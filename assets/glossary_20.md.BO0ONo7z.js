John McPhee portrays a remarkable man \\"at the near end of a skein of magnanimous despots who...created enduring schools through their own individual energies, maintained them under their own absolute rule, and left them forever imprinted with their own personalities.\\" More than simply a portrait of the Headmaster of Deerfield Academy, it is a revealing look at the nature of private school education in America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5cZgHAAACAAJ&dq=The+Headmaster:+Frank+L.+Boyden+of+Deerfield&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Revival addresses,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RbIPAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Study Guide Student Solutions Manual to Accompany Principles of Physics (Volume 2)","description":"This two-volume manual features detailed solutions to approximately 20% of the end-of-chapter problems from the textbook.

Grant","description":"In his eighth and final annual message to Congress, Ulysses S. Grant reminded the nation that it was his \\"fortune or misfortune, to be called to the office of Chief Executive without any previous political training.\\" The electoral crisis that dominated Grant's last months in office left little room for political error. On November 7, 1876, Democrat Samuel J. Tilden won the popular vote, but Republican Rutherford B. Hayes could claim the presidency by a single electoral vote if he captured all disputed electors from Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Oregon. Uncertainty gave way to deadlock as the crisis deepened. Grant's mail included a steady trickle of anonymous threats. In late January 1877, Grant signed a bill creating an electoral commission to end the dispute. Hayes won all disputed electors and succeeded Grant without incident. Out of the White House, without a settled home, the Grants spent two months visiting family and friends before embarking on their long-planned European tour. On May 17, Grant left Philadelphia aboard the steamer Indiana. When he arrived at Liverpool, crowds thronged the docks and streets to give him a hero's welcome, and Londoners welcomed Grant with similar enthusiasm. In July, the Grants crossed to Belgium, traveled through Germany, and summered in the Swiss Alps and the lakes of northern Italy. Back in Great Britain, they toured Scotland and northern England, then visited daughter Ellen Grant Sartoris at Warsash, the Sartoris country home near Southampton. Grant spent November in Paris, later writing \\"no American would stay in Paris if he found himself the only one of his countrymen there.\\" The Grants wintered in the Mediterranean, sailing down the Italian coast to Sicily, where they spent Christmas, then to Alexandria, and a long trip up the Nile. The party toured the Holy Land, visited Constantinople and Athens, and spent a month in Italy. After another month in Paris, the Grants were off to Holland, Germany, Scandinavia, Russia, Austria, and Switzerland, exploring the Alps again before returning to Paris in September, 1878, to ponder their next move. Abroad and out of office, Grant freely talked about the war and his presidency. Several interviews stirred controversy in America and stoked talk of a third term in 1880, despite Grant's own protestation: \\"I never wanted to get out of a place as much as I did to get out of the Presidency.\\" The Grants had seen Europe. Now they faced a choice between home and a journey to distant Asia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w1ijHal5rKMC&dq=The+Papers+of+Ulysses+S.+Grant&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Tibetan Lamas (Wisdom of the Masters)","description":"For many Tibetans, the phrase \\"the Kadam masters\\" evokes a spiritual golden age in Tibet an image of a community of simple monks devoted to humble rectitude in the service of others. The teachings of the Kadam masters have spiritually nourished the Tibetan people for nearly a millennium. The Kadampa tradition began in the eleventh century with the arrival in Tibet of the Indian Bengali teacher Atisa, who heralded a large-scale revival of Buddhism there with a return to the basics. Although these Tibetan teachings emerged nearly a thousand years ago, within a specific historical cultural context, the teachings of the Kadam masters embody wisdom that resonates beyond the boundaries of time, culture, and language. To modern-day Tibetan Buddhists, this volume will offer in an accessible format some of the most loved teachings of the Tibetan tradition. For practitioners of other religious traditions, the texts collected in this special anthology will provide a glimpse into the rich world of Tibetan Buddhist teachings and practice, possibly offering insights and approaches that could easily be incorporated into the practices of one's own cherished faith. To those readers who have no particular religious inclination, these teachings could be approached as part of humanity's accumulated wisdom, which represent the long history of human being's quest to better understand their own existence and its meaning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=97AzqpgEqPcC&dq=Wisdom+of+the+Tibetan+Lamas+(Wisdom+of+the+Masters)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The voyage of the Discovery","description":"Account of British National Antarctic Expedition 1901-04, leader R.F.

Peyton McCrary offers a comprehensive account of the social and political upheavals in Louisiana, set against the background of a new interpretation of the revolutionary dimensions of the Civil War party system. He compares the moderate Republican regime set up by Lincoln with the antebellum social and political system, and contrasts it with the reactionary government established in 1865 under the aegis of Andrew Johnson and the Democratic Party. The author also explores the social history of the contract labor system, the evolution of the Freedmen's Bureau, and the growing participation of blacks in the Louisiana Republican movement. Drawing on extensive research in unpublished manuscripts, party records, and newspapers, and using sophisticated quantitative analysis of electoral and legislative behavior, Professor McCrary suggests a significant revision of earlier interpretations of Lincoln's reconstruction policies. He finds that the real architect of the gradualist approach with which the President was publicly identified was his commanding general in Louisiana, Nathaniel P. Banks, who was less open to the idea of Negro suffrage than was Lincoln himself. Originally published in 1979.

Whether used to float innovations, showcase new developments, or promote the latest models, they are, first and foremost, examples of graphic art. Future Retro looks at cars from a landmark period in American automobile design, the 1940s through the 1960s, providing a rare glimpse into the thinking of premier Detroit car builders. The text discusses such matters as the role of the designer in auto styling, the influence of emerging technologies on postwar car design, and the ways in which these drawings depict a particularly resonant segment of the American dream. Over 50 color illustrations, many never before published, introduce us to cars that are both futuristic and retro, sometimes decidedly wacky (several were too outlandish to build), and always very, very, cool. Future retro offers a lesson in car creation and history to practitioners and students of graphic and industrial design - as well as to anyone who has ever felt the allure of the great American automobile.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eXJTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Future+Retro&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mongol Costumes (The Carlsberg Foundation's Nomad Research Project)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yb5DzwEACAAJ&dq=Mongol+Costumes+(The+Carlsberg+Foundation%27s+Nomad+Research+Project)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ballades (Music Scores)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Substituting Ingredients: An A to Z Kitchen Reference","description":"With more than 1,000 healthy, easy-to-find, and cheap substitutions, no cook will ever abandon an appetizing dish for the lack of a particular ingredient.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0XVcWB-FHCYC&dq=Substituting+Ingredients:+An+A+to+Z+Kitchen+Reference&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Weighed & Found Wanting:","description":"An honest and inspirational story of dreaming big, winning big, and losing big, by one of today s most-beautiful voices and brightest Hollywood stars.

It demonstrates that Irish ambivalence about British imperialism in India complicates the assumption that colonialism precluded identifying with an exotic other. Examining a wide range of media, including manuscript illuminations, paintings, prints, architecture, stained glass, and photography, its authors demonstrate the complex nature of empire in India, compare these empires to British imperialism in Ireland, and explore the contemporary relationship between what are now two independent countries through a consideration of works of art in Irish collections, supplemented by a consideration of Irish architecture and of contemporary Irish visual culture. The collection features essays on Rajput and Mughal miniatures, on a portrait of an Indian woman by the Irish painter Thomas Hickey, on the gate lodge to the Dromana estate in County Waterford, and a consideration of the intellectual context of Harry Clarke's Eve of St. Agnes window. This book should appeal not only to those seeking to learn more about some of Ireland's most cherished works of art, but to all those curious about the complex interplay between empire, anti-colonialism, and the visual arts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IC0xDwAAQBAJ&dq=A+History+of+Canadian+Catholics:+Gallacanism,+Romanism,+and+Canadianism+(Mcgill-Queen%27s+Studies+in+the+History+of+Religion)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Commander's Kitchen : Take Home the True Taste of New Orleans With More Than 150 Recipes from Commander's Palace Restaurant","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dating, Intimacy & the Teenage Years","description":"Shows women how to break the cycle of sex-only relationships and find a partner who will commit to a loving union.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fJuMoAEACAAJ&dq=Dating,+Intimacy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Big Gifts For Small Groups: A 1-hour Board Member's Guide To Securing Gifts Of $500 To $5,000","description":"If yours is among the tens of thousands of organizations for whom six- and seven-figure gifts are unattainable, then Andy Robinson's' new book, Big Gifts for Small Groups, is just the ticket for you and your board.The subtitle, A Board Member's 1-Hour Guide to Securing Gifts of $500 to $5,000 says it all. Robinson is the straightest of shooters ? a sort of John McCain of fundraising. There literally isn't one piece of advice in this book that's glib or inauthentic. It has all been earned. But, then again, what would you expect from a fellow who first won his stripes as door to door canvasser, making 10,000 pitches on 10,000 doorsteps.As a result of Robinson's 'no bull' style, board members will take immediately to Big Gifts for Small Groups, confident the author isn't slinging unrealistic bromides.They'll learn everything they need to know from this one-hour read: how to get ready for the campaign, who to approach, where to find them; where to conduct the meeting, what to bring with you, how to ask, how to make it easy for the donor to give, what to do once you have the commitment ? even how to convey your thanks in a memorable way.Believing that other books already focus on higher sum gifts, the author smartly targets a range that has been neglected: $500 to $5,000. Why? Here's what Robinson says:o They're large enough to justify the time it takes to develop a prospect list, prepare a letter, follow up with a phone call and visit the prospective donor.o They're small enough to include a wide range of prospects. o They're both modest enough to seem feasible to the novice, but also ambitious enough to make it worth their while.o Taken in the context of a major gifts campaign, with a team of solicitors working together, gifts of $500 to $5,000 can add up to a lot of money.Robinson has a penchant for good writing and for using exactly the right example or anecdote to illustrate his point. But more importantly he lets his no-nonsense personality shine through. The result being that by the end of the book, your board members just may turn to one another and say, \\"Hey, we can do this\\" ? and mean it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3WUSiEE7newC&dq=Big+Gifts+For+Small+Groups:+A+1-hour+Board+Member%27s+Guide+To+Securing+Gifts+Of+%24500+To+%245,000&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aphrodite : Book Two (Bk.2)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8GpiAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Troubleshooting your handgun","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HUv7AAAACAAJ&dq=Troubleshooting+your+handgun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Using the Whole Brain: Integrating the Right and Left Brain with Hemi-Sync Sound Patterns","description":"Discover uses of The Monroe Institute's consciousness-expanding technology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xn8IAAAACAAJ&dq=Using+the+Whole+Brain:+Integrating+the+Right+and+Left+Brain+with+Hemi-Sync+Sound+Patterns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real Life, Real Spirituality: For Busy People Who Want to Pray","description":"Judy Esway offers delightful stories and challenging example from her own life to illustrate that busy people can indeed develop a trasforming prayer life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IyM0AAAACAAJ&dq=Real+Life,+Real+Spirituality:+For+Busy+People+Who+Want+to+Pray&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Man Who Cried","description":"An epic movie from the creator of Orlando and The Tango Lesson, The Man Who Cried is a young woman's coming-of-age story set in the dangerous maelstrom of the Nazi Occupation of Paris.

Focusing on the need to negotiate, adjust, and reconcile family life, parenthood and parenting practices in the face of national, material, ideological, cultural, religious, and moral borders, it considers the manner in which these processes are complicated by recent changes in the legitimation of Nordic welfare states. The case studies centre on migrant, refugee, and asylum seeker parents, as well as parents of the indigenous S mi communities. The book considers the ways in which the welfare state and its services construct borders of respectable parenthood, and examines the efforts on the part of racialized parents to negotiate such borders and organize their transnational everyday lives. Uncovering possibilities and obstacles that exist for families seeking to enact citizenship in the Nordic welfare states, Family Life in Transition will appeal to social scientists with interests in the sociology of the family, children, parenting, and the welfare state.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fjDNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Financiers aim for portals.(Internet marketing strategies of financial services companies): An article from: Bank Marketing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h_5aAAAAYAAJ&dq=Financiers+aim+for+portals.(Internet+marketing+strategies+of+financial+services+companies):+An+article+from:+Bank+Marketing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memoir of Italo Svevo (American)","description":"This is a memoir of Italo Svevo, who died in 1928 and who is the author of The Confessions of Svevo.

Deftly blending history with autobiography, action with analysis, and separating fact from fable, General Krulak touches the very essence of the Corps: what it means to be a Marine and the reason behind its consistently outstanding performance and reputation. Krulak also addresses the most basic but challenging question of all about the Corps: how does it manage to survive--even to flourish--despite overwhelming political odds and, as the general writes, \\"an extraordinary propensity for shooting itself in the foot?\\" To answer this question Krulak examines the foundation on which the Corps is built, a system of intense loyalty to God, to country, and to other Marines. He also takes a close look at Marines in war, offering challenging accounts of their experiences in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. In addition, he describes the Corps's relationship to other services, especially during the unification battles following World War II, and offers new insights into the decision-making process in times of crisis.

Unkept campaign promises, false advertising, exaggerated tax exemptions, employee theft--compromise has become a way of life. Such moral concession has even invaded the church. Faced with an opportunity to proclaim Christ to unbelievers, we feel intimidated and keep silent. Or we water down God's Word on ethical issues at work or in our community to avoid rejection. Too often we prefer hypocrisy to integrity. But God longs for His people to be different--to maintain a commitment to His standards, no matter what the cost. Is consistent obedience to God--integrity--attainable in this world of sin and self? By the grace and power of God, yes! One of the nation's most respected pastors points the way to persevering character in Christ. Drawing from scriptural examples of godly men who modeled integrity during severe testing, MacArthur makes a compelling case for the impact a man or woman of integrity can have in our world. A helpful study guide for individuals or groups is included.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=reJgAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Southern Living Garden Book","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"At Home on Earth: Foundations for a Catholic Ethic of the Environment","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yRIRAQAAIAAJ&dq=At+Home+on+Earth:+Foundations+for+a+Catholic+Ethic+of+the+Environment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catholics Experiencing Divorce: Grieving, Healing and Learning to Live Again","description":"This book offers practical advice on starting over after the end of a marriage, including updated resources for education, career guidance, housing, counseling, and helpful online information.

This book takes an original approach to still life in modern literature and the visual arts by examining the potential for movement and transformation in the idea of stillness and the ordinary. It ranges widely in its material, taking Czanne and literary responses to his still life painting as its point of departure. It investigates constellations of writers, visual artists and dancers including D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, David Jones, Winifred Nicholson, Wallace Stevens, and lesser-known figures including Charles Mauron and Margaret Morris. Claudia Tobin reveals that at the heart of modern art were forms of stillness that were intimately bound up with movement: the still life emerges charged with animation, vibration and rhythm; an unstable medium, unexpectedly vital and well suited to the expression of modern concerns.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eHgxEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Left Behind or Sincerely Taken","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=liw0AAAACAAJ&dq=Left+Behind+or+Sincerely+Taken&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Macromedia Coldfusion 5 Language Reference","description":"ColdFusion 5 Language Reference simplifies the complex task of keeping track of the 100 tags, almost 300 functions, and hundreds of special variables of the ColdFusion Markup Language.

The reality of risk and how it impacts companies is that it is much more definite, often catastrophic and looks more like a shock. This is striking, as a difference between firms on risk different than a marginal difference in operating efficiencies, for example. Competing on Risk Management requires a discipline, a commitment to using information and recognizing shocks and then acting upon those to redistribute assets. This book will examine how leading firms that compete on risk have done this and showcase best practices and impacts to the capital structure of firms and their organizational formation.

I highly recommend this book to executives, board members and anyone else who truly wants to understand the key concepts of risk management.  Harry M Kraemer, Jr. Executive Partner of Madison Dearborn Partners and former Chairman and CEO of Baxter International Inc.  This book addresses risk management as a corporate competency that is important to the success of the organization and is an excellent read for executives and board members seeking to develop winning risk management strategies.  Dennis Chookaszian Former Chairman and CEO of CNA Insurance Company  The events of 2008 showed that risk was mispriced and misunderstood by many businesses. There were winners and losers. This book will help you be a winner with risk!  Donald P Jacobs Dean Emeritus of the Kellogg School of Management  In this engaging analysis of risk management, Dr. Russell Walker takes a holistic look at the competitive advantages of risk and how to approach volatility and uncertainty. Dr. Walker provides strong historical context for risk and then explores how it impacts modern business organizations in diverse ways   from operational risk in the supply chain to technological risks inherent in digital processes. Drawing from theory and practice, Dr. Walker highlights various real-world cases of risk management, including examples from the 2008 recession. Of special benefit is his focus on how top firms successfully compete on risk. Anyone seeking an accessible and rich consideration of risk will gain valuable insight from Dr. Walker's treatment of this ever-present market force.  Dipak C Jain Dean of INSEAD  Of special interest are the many relevant case studies that help the reader to identify decisions that led to catastrophe or to success.

Founded in the mid-19th century, the Society for Itinerant Art Exhibitions (known as Peredvizhniki in Russian) consisted of a group of realist painters who decided that the best way for their work to be seen was to hold exhibitions in the Salon style of the French painters of the time, but in the form of travelling shows which moved around Russia. This helped to popularise the work of these painters, and of Russian art in general, and it helped them to sell their paintings and thus finance their work. The painters traveled with the exhibitions, recording the lives and customs of their fellow countrymen, and providing an insight into the life in Tsarist Russia, right up until the 1918 Revolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GEc3AQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Itinerants:+The+Masters+of+Russian+Realism+:+Second+Half+of+the+19th+and+Early+20th+Centuries+(Schools&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Passion for Watercolor: Painting the Inner Experience","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Exploring the Internet","description":"Exploring the Internet is a technical travelogue, chronicling 3 trips around the world during the early days of the Internet.

The nature of attachment dynamics allied with threat, discrediting, the manipulation of the victim's dissociative defences, long-term conditioning and the endless invoking of shame mean that sexual, physical and emotional abuse may, in some instances, be essentially unending. Even when separation from the long-term abuser is attempted, it may initially be extremely difficult to achieve, and there are some individuals who never achieve this parting. Even when the abuser is dead, the intrapsychic nature of the enduring attachment experienced by their victim remains complicated and difficult to resolve. This volume includes multiple perspectives from highly experienced clinicians, researchers and writers on the nature of the relationship between the abused and their abuser(s). No less than five of this international grouping of authors have been president of the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation, the world's oldest international trauma society. This book, which opens with a highly original clinical paper on 'weaponized sex' by Richard Kluft, one of the foremost pioneers of the modern dissociative disorders field, concludes with a gripping historical perspective written by Jeffrey Masson as he reengages with issues that first brought him to worldwide prominence in the 1980s. Between these two pieces, the contributors, all highly acclaimed for their clinical, theoretical or research work, present original, cutting edge work on this complex subject.

If it were possible to sum up this book in a sentence, then it would be that the time to live is now, the place to live is here, and the way to be happy is to ensure others are happy.

Thirty years later, Freed's philosophy is world-renowned andPossum Living remains as fascinating, inspirational, and pertinent as it was upon its original publication. This updated edition includes new reflections, insights, and life lessons from an older and wiser Dolly Freed, whose knowledge of how to live like a possum has given her financial security and the confidence to try new ventures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=STqDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"His Majesty, Queen Hatsheput","description":"A fictionalized account of the life of Hatshepsut, a queen in ancient Egypt who declared herself king and ruled as such for more than twenty years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iao0HAAACAAJ&dq=His+Majesty,+Queen+Hatsheput&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Age Hypnosis","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wars of the Roses","description":"This collection of nine essays (including the introduction) by leading British scholars addresses recent debates concerning the Wars of the Roses, especially their origins and the balance between self-interest and principle in the motivation of the participants.

For more than 30 years, on numerous film sets, Bridges, with his specialized panoramic camera, a Widelux F8, has captured behind-the-scenes views of the creative world of moviemaking. Now after 16 years since his first collection of photography comes Volume 2. Taking pictures of co-workers on the job results in compelling photographs especially when those people include the likes of Meryl Streep, Robert Duvall, Julianne Moore, Robert Downey Jr. and Matt Damon among others. Unique photos from his earlier work were first shared in Pictures- Jeff Bridges (powerHouse Books, 2003). Now, drawing on his most recent film work, Pictures Volume 2 expands on Bridges' intimate vision of Hollywood behind-the-scenes. Included within are rare looks at the famed actors, top directors, talented costumers and makeup artists, skilled and creative set and art decoration and the entire passionate crew involved in such memorable movies as True Grit, Crazy Heart, The Giver, TRON- Legacy, and Hell or High Water. Together, these pictures provide glimpses of the art, craft, and sleight of hand behind the magic of motion pictures. Pictures Volume 2 also celebrates Bridges' mastery of the special effects made possible with the distinctive Widelux panoramic camera. With Jeff Bridges' hand-written commentary and captions throughout, Pictures Volume 2 is an exciting addition to what artist Richard Misrach called the \\"formally intelligent and emotionally incisive\\" photographs of his first book. Jeff Bridges' proceeds from Pictures Volume 2 will be donated to the Motion Picture & Television Fund, a nonprofit organization that offers charitable care and support to film-industry workers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1zsWwQEACAAJ&dq=Pictures+by+Jeff+Bridges&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clinical Textbook for Veterinary Technicians Sixth Edition","description":"A fundamental text in the field of veterinary technology, McCurnin's Clinical Textbook for Veterinary Technicians, 8th Edition has the trusted content, simplified layout, and novel study tools every Vet Tech needs.

The result is that geography is often seen as a diverse and dynamic subject, but also as a disorganised and fragmenting one, without a focus. Unifying Geography focuses on the plural and competing versions of unity that characterise the discipline, which give it cohesion and differentiate it from related fields of knowledge. Each of the chapters is co-authored by both a leading physical and a human geographer. Themes identified include those of the traditional core as well as new and developing topics that are based on subject matter, concepts, methodology, theory, techniques and applications. Through its identification of unifying themes, the book will provide students with a meaningful framework through which to understand the nature of the geographical discipline. Unifying Geography will give the discipline renewed strength and direction, thus improving its status both within and outside geography.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fTjahfKj3g0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pinball Compendium: 1970-1981","description":"Chronicles the history of pinball games from 1970 through 1981, one of pinball's most prolific eras.

In this text Marx subjects Hegel's doctrine on the internal constitution of the state to a lengthy analysis. It was Marx's first attempt to expose and criticize Hegel's philosophy in general and his political philosophy in particular. It also represents his early efforts to criticize existing political institutions and to clarify the relations between the political and economic aspects of society. The Critique provides textual evidence in support of the argument that Marx's early writings do not exhibit radically different doctrinal principles and theoretical and practical concerns from his later work. This edition also includes a translation of the introduction Marx wrote for his proposed revised version of the Critique which he never completed. In a substantial introduction, Professor O'Malley provides valuable information on Marx's intellectual development.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uxg4AAAAIAAJ&dq=Hegel%27%27s+Philosophy+of+Right&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old-time stories","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KksgAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Filmmaking For Dummies","description":"Everything you ever wanted to know about making a movie but were afraid to ask  Lights, camera, action!

Dr. Gary Corrado. Captain Diemar's Troop of Hussars was raised in 1779. This unit was composed mainly of escaped German prisoners of war from the various Brunswick regiments that had accompanied Burgoyne at Saratoga. Having made their way back to New York without their officers, these men had become somewhat unruly but were well suited for service in a unique independent hussar troop. Hussars were cavalry troops who dressed lightly, traveled quickly on fast horses and could inflict a devastating blow on the enemy at just the right moment during battle. Diemar's Hussars found themselves attached to Provincial regiments, including Tarleton's Legion and the Queen's Rangers, and they served in the environs of the British garrison in New York City. They were involved in numerous skirmishes in the area known as the \\"no-man's land\\" in Westchester County, participated in raids into New Jersey, and patrolled the north shore of Long Island against Connecticut whaleboat raiders. The Rangers also had a hussar company, and given the fact that the Black Hussars, as they were to become known, spent much of their time with, and eventually were joined to the Rangers, their dress was similar.

Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Big Magic and Eat Pray Love No matter what you eat, how much you exercise, how skinny or young or wise you are, none of it matters if you re not breathing properly. There is nothing more essential to our health and well-being than breathing: take air in, let it out, repeat twenty-five thousand times a day. Yet, as a species, humans have lost the ability to breathe correctly, with grave consequences. Journalist James Nestor travels the world to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. The answers aren t found in pulmonology labs, as we might expect, but in the muddy digs of ancient burial sites, secret Soviet facilities, New Jersey choir schools, and the smoggy streets of S?o Paulo. Nestor tracks down men and women exploring the hidden science behind ancient breathing practices like Pranayama, Sudarshan Kriya, and Tummo and teams up with pulmonary tinkerers to scientifically test long-held beliefs about how we breathe. Modern research is showing us that making even slight adjustments to the way we inhale and exhale can jump-start athletic performance; rejuvenate internal organs; halt snoring, asthma, and autoimmune disease; and even straighten scoliotic spines. None of this should be possible, and yet it is. Drawing on thousands of years of medical texts and recent cutting-edge studies in pulmonology, psychology, biochemistry, and human physiology, Breath turns the conventional wisdom of what we thought we knew about our most basic biological function on its head. You will never breathe the same again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6lS9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Outlaw of Torn","description":"\\"The Outlaw of Torn\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs.

Although computer simulations of extremely complicated biological processes are released from rigid mathematical constraints, he places each of the simulations in the context of a mathematical formulation examined either analytically or numerically.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GnXctxBmXoEC&dq=Simulating+Ecological+and+Evolutionary+Systems+in+C&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pocket Dictionary of Statistics","description":"A single, thorough source of definitions for thousands of statistical terms, illustrated with graphs, charts, tables, and equations.

By investing in their personal and spiritual development, readers will build a strong character that allows them to create a larger vision for their lives -- a vision of service and contribution to themselves and the world. Part mentor/part best friend, Cheryl Richardson picks up where her two earlier books leave off, by offering new \\"inner life skills\\" to readers who are ready to stop hiding their power and start living according to their Divine assignment. Using real life stories and examples (including her own), she offers a practical, step-by-step plan to: Build self-trust and inner confidence by strengthening your relationship with yourself and your inner life. Identify and eliminate the thoughts, words, and actions that rob you of power and self-esteem. Face \\"conflict phobia\\" head-on by telling the truth with grace and love. Use fear as an ally to build your courage muscles. Pass up good for great by centering your life around your values. As readers work through each phase of the program, they will find that they have not only the power and vision to fulfill their greatest potential but the ability to help others do the same. Stand Up for Your Life is a practical, hands-on guide that will inspire readers to own (and use) their talents and gifts so they can lead passionate, more fulfilling lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KZaSPyCwUf0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"daniel's dinosaurs","description":"Everywhere he goes, Daniel sees different kinds of dinosaurs--until he visits an aquarium.

In a close examination of Teresa's major writings, Weber correlates the stylistic techniques of humility, irony, obfuscation, and humor with social variables such as the marginalized status of pietistic groups and demonstrates how Teresa strategically adopted linguistic features associated with women--affectivity, spontaneity, colloquialism--in order to gain access to the realm of power associated with men.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x-j5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Big Dipper (Let's-read-and-find-out books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The way that I went;: An Irishman in Ireland","description":"Written by Ireland's greatest field botanist and first published in 1937, Robert Praeger's personal tour of Ireland's natural wonders has had a greater influence on Irish naturalists than any other book.

Well, not every conceivable one, but at least the top ones that thwart us time and again.This is an ingenious book, and it's a wonder it wasn't written years ago.Sure, if you've attended a fundraising seminar, or read a Jerry Panas book, or perused one of the field's journals, you're familiar with a dozen or so mistakes to avoid. But the appeal of this book ? and it will become a classic ? is that in one place it gathers and discusses ALL of the biggest errors.Some, like the following, will be second nature if you've been in the field for long:o \\"Tax deductibility is a powerful incentive.\\" It isn't, as you know.o \\"People will give just because yours is a good cause.\\" They won't.o \\"Wealth is mostly what determines a person's willingness to give.\\" Not so. Other factors are equally important.Other mistakes aren't as apparent. For example: \\"You need a powerful board to have a successful campaign.\\" Truth be told, many are convinced that without a powerful board they can't succeed. Grace shows otherwise.Then, too, there are more nuanced mistakes:o \\"We can't raise big money - we don't know any rich people.\\" Don't believe it. You can raise substantial dollars.o \\"Most people don't like to give.\\" To the contrary, many find joy in it.o \\"Without a track record in annual giving, you can't have a successful capital campaign.\\" In fact you can, but your tactics will be different.And that touches on only seven of the 40 mistakes Grace explores (and explodes).Just as anyone involved in journalism should own a copy of Strunk and White's, The Elements of Style, anyone involved in fundraising ? board member, staff, volunteer ? should have Fundraising Mistakes that Bedevil All Boards by their side.When Grace makes it so easy to avoid costly errors, it is imprudent to risk repeating them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dNxwbhhTc0cC&dq=Fundraising+Mistakes+That+Bedevil+All+Boards+(And+Staff+Too):+A+1-hour+Guide+To+Identifying+And+Overcoming+Obstacles+To+Your+Success&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The United Nations and the Maintenance of International Security: A Challenge to be Met Second Edition","description":"International security must be understood in much broader terms in the aftermath of the Cold War. This extensively revised edition retains the valuable descriptions and analyses of the United Nations' achievements and failures, while placing them in the context of the ever-broadening definition of international security and of changing attitudes toward national sovereignty and humanitarian intervention. In order to deal with the internal struggles that are now the prevalent form of conflict, it is necessary to allay the root causes of tensions within societies. Means of enforcement must be applied to prevent gross violations of human rights, including genocide. Sutterlin describes the background of innovations that recent crises have imposed on the UN. He analyzes how recent reforms have affected the UN's capacity to deal with the security problems of the new century. Peacekeeping, peace-enforcement, peace-building, and the application of sanctions all bring new challenges. In one chapter, Sutterlin focuses on the UN's experience in enforcing disarmament in Iraq. A new chapter details the impact of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction on UN policies and actions. This systematic presentation, using scholarly analysis and a practitioner's inside knowledge, provides a readable and challenging text for courses on the United Nations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ENxN8ktYPjUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ladysmith","description":"A harrowing novel of the Boer War visits the South African town of Ladysmith in 1899, which has been surrounded by Boer forces and threatened with destruction.

When his wife has an affair with an American GI, Miwa is forced to come to terms with the disintegration of their relationship and the fact that his attempts to repair it only exacerbate the situation.

She offers these theories as a set of tools for understanding the complex relationships between films and their audiences, TV shows and their viewers. She explains such questions as the behavior of fans; the implications of gender, sexuality, and race/ethnicity with regard to the media; the effect of violence, horror, and sexually explicit images on viewers; and the place of memory in spectatorship.

However, scholars and academics are by no means united in the question how these important but difficult authors should be read and interpreted. Many of them are divided by implicit (but often unquestioned) assumptions about the best way to approach the texts or by underlying hermeneutical questions about the norms, limits and opportunities of reading Ancient Christian writers. This book will raise profound hermeneutical questions surrounding the reading of the Fathers with greater clarity than it has been done before. The contributors to this volume are theologians and historians who have used contemporary post-modern approaches to illuminate the Ancien corpus of texts. The chapters discuss issues such as What makes a 'good' reading of a church Father? What constitutes a 'responsible' reading? Is the reading of the Fathers limited to a specialist audience? What can modern thinkers contribute to our reading of the Fathers?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7-bfoeIFEiMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frozen Music: A Novel","description":"Esther and Linus, although they have never met, have known of each other through their mothers for years, and suddenly find themselves meeting under the most unusual of circumstances.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CFwOXlypRD0C&dq=Frozen+Music:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\"Love Your Enemies\\": Jesus' Love Command in the Synoptic Gospels and in the Early Christian Paraenesis : A History of the Tradition and Interpretatio","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XZdOAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22Love+Your+Enemies%22:+Jesus%27+Love+Command+in+the+Synoptic+Gospels+and+in+the+Early+Christian+Paraenesis+:+A+History+of+the+Tradition+and+Interpretatio&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE COMPLETE POEMS OF PAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR","description":"The Complete Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar is a comprehensive selection of the iconic writer s beloved poetry that features his unique rhythm and famous dialect.

Prior to his passing, at age 33, he published multiple collections of poetry including Majors and Minors in 1895 and Lyrics of Lowly Life in 1896. Dunbar uses his poetry to address multiple themes such as love, loss, family, marriage and work. His signature prose and melodic turn of phrase permeates the heart and mind, leaving an indelible mark. The Complete Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar is required reading for poetry scholars. It helps exemplify Dunbar s influence in America and abroad. He was a prolific artist who set a precedent for many twentieth century poets, including Dr. Maya Angelou.

Spanning 2,000 miles and traversing six states from Missouri to the Pacific Ocean, the Oregon Trail is the route that made America. In the fifteen years before the Civil War, when 400,000 pioneers used it to emigrate West historians still regard this as the largest land migration of all time the trail united the coasts, doubled the size of the country, and laid the groundwork for the railroads. The trail years also solidified the American character: our plucky determination in the face of adversity, our impetuous cycle of financial bubbles and busts, the fractious clash of ethnic populations competing for the same jobs and space. Today, amazingly, the trail is all but forgotten. Rinker Buck is no stranger to grand adventures. The New Yorker described his first travel narrative,Flight of Passage, as  a funny, cocky gem of a book,  and with The Oregon Trailhe seeks to bring the most important road in American history back to life. At once a majestic American journey, a significant work of history, and a personal saga reminiscent of bestsellers by Bill Bryson and Cheryl Strayed, the book tells the story of Buck's 2,000-mile expedition across the plains with tremendous humor and heart. He was accompanied by three cantankerous mules, his boisterous brother, Nick, and an  incurably filthy  Jack Russell terrier named Olive Oyl. Along the way, Buck dodges thunderstorms in Nebraska, chases his runaway mules across miles of Wyoming plains, scouts more than five hundred miles of nearly vanished trail on foot, crosses the Rockies, makes desperate fifty-mile forced marches for water, and repairs so many broken wheels and axels that he nearly reinvents the art of wagon travel itself. Apart from charting his own geographical and emotional adventure, Buck introduces readers to the evangelists, shysters, natives, trailblazers, and everyday dreamers who were among the first of the pioneers to make the journey west. With a rare narrative power, a refreshing candor about his own weakness and mistakes, and an extremely attractive obsession for history and travel,The Oregon Trail draws readers into the journey of a lifetime.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vQH5CQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Oregon+Trail&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Advanced Internet Searcher's Handbook","description":"The handbook offers help with topics such as free-text search engines, index-based search engines, searching the 'hidden web', finding images, sounds and multimedia information, finding people, and weblogs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nbnuAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Advanced+Internet+Searcher%27s+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murphy's Commandments","description":"Of all the laws known to humankind, few are more famous than Murphy's classic observation: If anything can go wrong--it will.

This new two-volume work, Let's Get Biblical! Why Doesn't Judaism Accept the Christian Messiah?, takes the reader on an eye-opening journey through timeless passages in Tanach, and answers a pressing question: Why doesn't Judaism accept the Christian messiah? Are the teachings conveyed in the New Testament compatible with ageless prophecies in the Jewish Scriptures? Rabbi Singer's fascinating new work clearly illustrates why the core doctrines of the Church are utterly incompatible with the cornerstone principles expressed by the Prophets of Israel, and are opposed by the most cherished tenets conveyed in the Jewish Scriptures. Moreover, this book demonstrates how the Church systematically and deliberately altered the Jewish Scriptures in order to persuade potential converts that Jesus is the promised Jewish messiah. To accomplish this feat, Christian \\"translators\\" manipulated, misquoted, mistranslated, and even fabricated verses in the Hebrew Scriptures so that these texts appear to be speaking about Jesus. This exhaustive book probes and illuminates this thought-provoking subject. Tragically, over the past two millennia, the church's faithful have been completely oblivious to this Bible-tampering because virtually no Christian can read or understand the Hebrew Scriptures in its original language. Since time immemorial, earnest parishioners blindly and utterly depended upon manmade Christian \\"translations\\" of the \\"Old Testament\\" in order to understand the \\"Word of God.\\" Understandably, churchgoers are deeply puzzled by the Jewish rejection of their religion's claims. They wonder aloud why Jewish people, who are reared since childhood in the Holy Tongue, and are the bearers and protectors of the sacred Oracles of God, do not accept Jesus as their messiah. How can such an extraordinary people dismiss such an extraordinary claim? Are they just plain stubborn? Let's Get Biblical thoroughly answers these nagging, age-old questions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_r6XoAEACAAJ&dq=Let%27s+get+biblical&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Broken Symmetry (Made in Michigan Writers Series)","description":"Michigan poet Jack Ridl leads readers into reflective connection with the everyday world in this unique and enjoyable volume.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ydIDJgh1F-IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Double Vision","description":"**NAMED ONE OF THE BEST ART BOOKS OF THE DECADE BY ARTNEWS** The first and definitive biography of the celebrated collectors Dominique and John de Menil, who became one of the greatest cultural forces of the twentieth century through groundbreaking exhibits of art, artistic scholarship, the creation of innovative galleries and museums, and work with civil rights. Dominique and John de Menil created an oasis of culture in their Philip Johnson-designed house with everyone from Marlene Dietrich and Ren  Magritte to Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns.

In the last 50 years, yoga has become incredibly popular as a way to exercise both the mind and body. Yoga means \\"unity\\" or \\"oneness,\\" and the word is derived from the Sanskrit word yuj, which means \\"to join.\\" In spiritual terms, this joining refers to the unity of the individual consciousnesses with the universal consciousness. In practical terms, it refers to balancing and harmonizing the mind, body, and spirit. Yoga can be both a physical exercise and a way of life that bestows several health benefits upon those who practice it. Whether you have hours to spend on a yoga session that includes traditional postures, chanting, and meditation, or if you have only a limited time to do yoga poses for exercise, the versatility of yoga makes it an ideal way to improve fitness and flexibility. The Illustrated Step-By-Step Guide to Yoga will help any yoga newcomer or veteran learn and practice traditional yoga, replete with photographs and in-depth explanations by instructors trained at Yoga Vidya Gurukul in Trimbakeshwar, India.

Who listened to this \\"good news,\\" and who ignored it? Where did Christianity spread, and how? Based on quantitative data and the latest scholarship, preeminent scholar and journalist Rodney Stark presents new and startling information about the rise of the early church, overturning many prevailing views of how Christianity grew through time to become the largest religion in the world. Drawing on both archaeological and historical evidence, Stark is able to provide hard statistical evidence on the religious life of the Roman Empire to discover the following facts that set conventional history on its head: Contrary to fictions such as The Da Vinci Code and the claims of some prominent scholars, Gnosticism was not a more sophisticated, more authentic form of Christianity, but really an unsuccessful effort to paganize Christianity. Paul was called the apostle to the Gentiles, but mostly he converted Jews. Paganism was not rapidly stamped out by state repression following the vision and conversion of the Roman Emperor Constantine in 312 AD, but gradually disappeared as people abandoned the temples in response to the superior appeal of Christianity. The \\"oriental\\" faiths such as those devoted to Isis, the Egyptian goddess of love and magic, and to Cybele, the fertility goddess of Asia Minor actually prepared the way for the rapid spread of Christianity across the Roman Empire. Contrary to generations of historians, the Roman mystery cult of Mithraism posed no challenge to Christianity to become the new faith of the empire  it allowed no female members and attracted only soldiers. By analyzing concrete data, Stark is able to challenge the conventional wisdom about early Christianity offering the clearest picture ever of how this religion grew from its humble beginnings into the faith of more than one-third of the earth's population.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QnDNU1Bf35cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Design of room cooling facilities: Structural & energy requirements (AG)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Stanley Park: A Novel","description":"A young chef who revels in local bounty, a long-ago murder that remains unsolved, the homeless of Stanley Park, a smooth-talking businessman named Dante   these are the ingredients of Timothy Taylor's stunning debut novel   Kitchen Confidential meets The Edible Woman.

Author Lindsay Brooke also relates the adventures and misadventures that were part of owning and driving a Model T. He chronicles the changes the car s unprecedented popularity wrought in the auto industry (including Ford s introduction of the  $5 day ), and he tracks the Model T through popular culture, from its role in early motorsports to its resurgent popularity in the 1950s and 60s as a platform for T-bucket hot rods.

While the Nuremberg and, to a lesser degree, Tokyo tribunals have received considerable attention, this is the first full-length assessment of the entire Far East operation, which involved some 5,700 accused and 2,200 trials. After discussing the Tokyo trial, Piccigallo systematically examines the operations of each Allied nation, documenting procedure and machinery as well as the details of actual trials (including hitherto unpublished photographs) and ending with a statistical summary of cases. This study allows a completely new assessment of the Far East proceedings: with a few exceptions, the trials were carefully and fairly conducted, the efforts of defense counsel and the elaborate review procedures being especially noteworthy.

Kenneth E. Hagin asked himself this question. He studied the subject and concluded the following: \\"We as a Church have authority on the earth that we've never yet realized... A few of us have barely gotten to the edge of that authority, but before Jesus comes again, there's going to be a whole company of believers who will rise up with the authority that is theirs. They will know what is theirs, and they will do the work that God intended they should do.\\" During the past 30 years, over a million readers have been blessed by this classic faith-building message by Rev. Hagin. In his clear and illustrative style, he uses the Word of God to explain the authority that belongs to every believer.

Bruce believes Java is abandoning its base, and conditions are ripe for an alternative to emerge. In Beyond Java, Bruce chronicles the rise of the most successful language of all time, and then lays out, in painstaking detail, the compromises the founders had to make to establish success. Then, he describes the characteristics of likely successors to Java. He builds to a rapid and heady climax, presenting alternative languages and frameworks with productivity and innovation unmatched in Java. He closes with an evaluation of the most popular and important programming languages, and their future role in a world beyond Java. If you are agree with the book's premise--that Java's reign is coming to an end--then this book will help you start to build your skills accordingly. You can download some of the frameworks discussed and learn a few new languages. This book will teach you what a new language needs to succeed, so when things do change, you'll be more prepared.

Their mission was to maintain neutrality on an isolated sector of the Trans-Siberian railway which was targeted by Bolshevik and Czarist troops, by roving bands of Cossacks and by the forces of a dozen other nations which sought to control Siberia. In 1920 when they received orders to withdraw Lt. Leverett deserted the company to find Maryenka Austin, widow of an American sergeant who died in action. Captain Carlisle and his men, riding two rail wagons behind an erratic wood burning switching engine, beat their way East toward Vladivostok trying to outrun an armored train commanded by a rogue White officer, Colonel Sipialef, who has stolen the Cazrist gold reserves.

Dr Weinberg answers this question in WHY MEN WON'T COMMIT and shows women how to help their men change their minds. Dr Weinberg considers that men have four basic needs (the need to be special, to travel light, for loyalty and for emotional closeness) and if they feel that these aren't being met they will develop bad gut reactions against their girlfriends, which will most likely mystify these women. The problem for women and men is that men themselves couldn't tell you about these needs because they've grown up establishing a 'masculine pretence' that forbids them from showing emotion or discussing problems. Dr Weinberg's WHY MEN WON'T COMMIT provides a bridge between the two sexes that will lead to greater understanding, greater commitment and greater happiness. This is a unique approach to an age-old problem because it shows women why they needn't play games, or lose their own dignity, to help men commit. An informed, practical, straight-talking guide to men, or as Dr Weinberg calls them 'the fragile sex', WHY MEN WON'T COMMIT is invaluable to every woman who feels her single life must end - and soon!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H0L1s6LHUJcC&dq=Why+Men+Won%27t+Commit:+Getting+What+You+Both+Want+Without+Playing+Games&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Success Without A College Degree - The Secrets of How To Get Ahead and Show Them All","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1rnpAQAACAAJ&dq=Success+Without+A+College+Degree+-+The+Secrets+of+How+To+Get+Ahead+and+Show+Them+All&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Land of the Penguins (Collins Big Cat)","description":"The survival of the white continent's most famous inhabitants is the subject of this beautiful book.

Hagner begins by exploring introductory issues (e.g., historical backgrounds, author, audience, date, purpose, structure, genre) and overarching themes (e.g., heavenly archetypes and earthly copies, the use of the Old Testament, the attitude toward Judaism). The heart of the book then offers a chapter-by-chapter exposition of Hebrews. Unlike commentaries, it does not try to be exhaustive--examining all details and answering all questions--but instead guides students to the issues that are most important for their study of this difficult book. Hagner concludes with a final look at the contribution of Hebrews to the New Testament, New Testament theology, the church, and the individual Christian.

Adams led the oldest revolutionary movement in Ireland on an extraordinary journey from armed insurrection to active participation in government. Now he tells the story of the tumultuous series of events that led to the historic Good Friday Agreement as only he can: with a tireless crusader s conviction and an insider s penetrating insight. In vivid detail, Adams describes the harrowing attack on his life, and he offers new details about the peace process. We learn of previously undisclosed talks between republicans and the British government, and of conflicts and surprising alliances between key players. Adams reveals details of his discussions with the IRA leadership and tells how republicans differed,  dissidents  emerged, and the first IRA cessation of violence broke down. He recounts meetings in the Clinton White House, tells what roles Irish-Americans and South Africans played in the process, and describes the secret involvement of those within the Catholic Church. Then triumphantly this inspiring story climaxes with the Good Friday Agreement: what was agreed and what was promised. Gerry Adams brings a sense of immediacy to this story of hope in what was long considered an intractable conflict. He conveys the acute tensions of the peace process and the ever-present sense of teetering on the brink of both joyous accomplishment and continued despair. With a sharp eye and sensitive ear for the more humorous foibles of political allies and enemies alike, Adams offers illuminating portraits of the leading characters through cease-fires and standoffs, discussions and confrontations. Among the featured players are John Major, Tony Blair, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Jean Kennedy Smith, and Nelson Mandela. As the preeminent republican strategist of his generation, Gerry Adams provides the first comprehensive account of the principles and tactics underpinning modern Irish republicanism. And in a world where peace processes are needed more urgently than ever, A Farther Shore provides a template for conflict resolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cpPeCYEzMEIC&dq=A+Farther+Shore:+Ireland%27s+Long+Road+to+Peace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your People Shall Be My People: How Israel, the Jews and the Christian Church Will Come together in the Last Days","description":"\\"Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God\\" (Ruth 1:16).

We need to confess personally and corporately on behalf of the Church for centuries of persecution of the Jewish people, looking in these days for every opportunity to bless and not curse them. Once again, Israel and her people are center stage at a crucial moment in world history, and this book shows why the Church must effect reconciliation and why our prayers are vital in this hour.

Or conciseness ? and clarity ? and cogency.Yet all four aptly describe Gayle Gifford?s book, How Are We Doing: A 1-Hour Guide to Evaluating Your Performance as a Nonprofit Board. Until now, almost all books dealing with board evaluation have had an air of unreality about them. The perplexing graphs, the matrix boxes, the overlong questionnaires. It took only a thumbing through to render a judgment: \\"My board?s going to use this? Get real!\\"Enter Gayle Gifford. Inhale the fresh air. See the ground break. Watch the clutter clear.Gifford has pioneered an elegantly simple and enjoyable ? yes, enjoyable ? way for nonprofit boards to evaluate and improve its overall performance.It all comes down to answering a host of straightforward questions ? questions that, as Graham Greene would say, get to \\"the heart of the matter.\\" Here is a sampling:-Have we set a goal for the good we want to do?-How well do we know our community?s needs?-Do we know if our programs are having an impact?-Do we ask the right financial questions?-Do we govern and resist the temptation to manage?-Do we recruit the board members we need?-Have we decided the board?s role in fundraising?It doesn?t matter whether the setting is formal, as in a special board meeting, or casual ? the chairperson?s living room. It doesn?t matter whether you have 75 board members or seven.It doesn't matter whether yours is an established institution or a grassroots start-tup. All that matters is that the questions are answered candidly and the responses discussed. It doesn?t get any easier than that.It?s all so refreshing ? the thought of an invigorating discussion taking place, without pretense or pedantry, during which board members reflect on their job, gain a fuller understanding of their organization, explore their strengths and shortcomings, grow more cohesive, sense new potential ? and come away genuinely energized by the process ? and far better equipped to govern.Gifford has done nothing less than transform the way boards will evaluate themselves from this day forward.Oh, the simplicity of it all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jwx1xNl81pEC&dq=How+Are+We+Doing%3F:+A+1-hour+Guide+To+Evaluating+Your+Performance+As+A+Nonprofit+Board&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lattimer legend","description":"A modern West Virginian discovers in an ancestor's Civil War diaries new direction in his own way of life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_6NAAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Lattimer+legend&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Joys of Beekeeping","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Till Death Us Do Part, A True Murder Mystery","description":"In the Palliko-Stockton trial, prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi offered a brilliant summation that synthesized for the jury the many inferences and shades of meaning in the testimony, fitting all the pieces together in a mosaic of guilt.

Henry James was born in New York City in 1843. One of thirteen children, James had an unorthodox early education, switching between schools, private tutors and private reading.. James published his first story,  A Tragedy of Error , in the Continental Monthly in 1864, when he was twenty years old. In 1876, he emigrated to London, where he remained for the vast majority of the rest of his life, becoming a British citizen in 1915. From this point on, he was a hugely prolific author, eventually producing twenty novels and more than a hundred short stories and novellas, as well as literary criticism, plays and travelogues. Amongst James's most famous works are The Europeans (1878), Daisy Miller (1878), Washington Square (1880), The Bostonians (1886), and one of the most famous ghost stories of all time, The Turn of the Screw (1898).

The woman is Rebecca Davitch, a fifty-three-year-old grandmother. Is she an impostor in her own life? she asks herself. Is it indeed her own life? Or is it someone else s? On the surface, Beck, as she is known to the Davitch clan, is outgoing, joyous, a natural celebrator. Giving parties is, after all, her vocation something she slipped into even before finishing college, when Joe Davitch spotted her at an engagement party in his family s crumbling nineteenth-century Baltimore row house, where giving parties was the family business. What caught his fancy was that she seemed to be having such a wonderful time. Soon this large-spirited older man, a divorc  with three little girls, swept her into his orbit, and before she knew it she was embracing his extended family plus a child of their own, and hosting endless parties in the ornate, high-ceilinged rooms of The Open Arms. Now, some thirty years later, after presiding over a disastrous family picnic, Rebecca is caught un-awares by the question of who she really is. How she answers it how she tries to recover her girlhood self, that dignified grownup she had once been is the story told in this beguiling, funny, and deeply moving novel. As always with Anne Tyler s novels, once we enter her world it is hard to leave. But in Back When We Were Grownups she so sharpens our perceptions and awakens so many untapped feelings that we come away not only refreshed and delighted, but also infinitely wiser.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ye8QBwAAQBAJ&dq=Back+When+We+Were+Grownups:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American Accent Guide: A complete and comprehensive course on the pronunciation and speaking style of American English for individuals of all language backgrounds/ book and 8 cassettes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a5mxugEACAAJ&dq=The+American+Accent+Guide:+A+complete+and+comprehensive+course+on+the+pronunciation+and+speaking+style+of+American+English+for+individuals+of+all+language+backgrounds/+book+and+8+cassettes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Critical Theory Today : A User-Friendly Guide (Garland Reference Library of the Humanities)","description":"Providing in-depth coverage of the most common approaches to literary analysis, this guide can be used as the only text in a course or as a precursor to the study of primary theoretical works.

Indeed as Stanford professor and award-winning author Estelle B. Freedman argues in her compelling new book, feminism has reached a critical momentum from which there is no turning back. A truly global movement, as vital and dynamic in the developing world as it is in the West, feminism has helped women achieve authority in politics, sports, and business, and has mobilized public concern for once-taboo issues like rape, domestic violence, and breast cancer. And yet much work remains before women attain real equality. In this fascinating book, Freedman examines the historical forces that have fueled the feminist movement over the past two hundred yearsand explores how women today are looking to feminism for new approaches to issues of work, family, sexuality, and creativity. Freedman begins with an incisive analysis of what feminism means and why it took root in western Europe and the United States at the end of the eighteenth century. The rationalist, humanistic philosophy of the Enlightenment, which ignited the American Revolution, also sparked feminist politics, inspiring such pioneers as Mary Wollstonecraft and Susan B. Anthony. Race has always been as important as gender in defining feminism, and Freedman traces the intricate ties between women s rights and abolitionism in the United States in the years before the Civil War and the long tradition of radical women of color, stretching back to the impassioned rhetoric of Sojourner Truth. As industrialism and democratic politics spread after World War II, feminist politics gained momentum and sophistication throughout the world. Their impact began to be felt in every aspect of societyfrom the workplace to the chambers of government to relations between the sexes. Because of feminism, Freedman points out, the line between the personal and the political has blurred, or disappeared, and issues once considered  merely  privateabortion, sexual violence, homosexuality, reproductive health, beauty and body imagehave entered the public arena as subjects of fierce, ongoing debate. Freedman combines a scholar s meticulous research with a social critic s keen eye. Sweeping in scope, searching in its analysis, global in its perspective, No Turning Back will stand as a defining text in one of the most important social movements of all time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lDJGSUPCMXcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern Actuarial Theory and Practice","description":"In the years since the publication of the best-selling first edition, the incorporation of ideas and theories from the rapidly growing field of financial economics has precipitated considerable development of thinking in the actuarial profession.

Parts of Kansas City seemed risqu to Mary Jane Caruthers. But nothing could prepare her for the bacchanal atmosphere of Hollywood, where the film industry was being called on to clean up its violence and sex, and the daily papers reported corruption and cruelty in the L.A. police department. But Mary Jane refuses to look back at that time in Kansas City; that time when ragtime, jazz, and speakeasies were the status quo . . . when the Pendergast political machine was in control. Yet Mary Jane knew what she wanted from life. . . to be a fashion designer and to raise a healthy family. Her parents forced her to marry a young man with whom she had had an affair; and there were soon two children. Then suddenly her world became unbearable as her husband met with a violent and scandalous death. Her story quickly moves to Los Angeles, where she hopes to make a new life. Gary Edendale divorces his wife and follows Mary Jane and the children to California. Soon her dream seems to be falling into place. She meets a favorite silent film star, Clara Kimball Young, who allows Gary and Mary Jane Edendale to manage her property. Gary finds a restaurant to operate, then Mary Jane has another child. But the Depression hits, turning the familys life upside down. Gary looses his restaurant and Mary Jane must take in dressmaking for the family to survive. Being an industrious soul, Mary Jane finds a way to promote herself as a couturir, by reintroducing her talents to her girlhood chum, Joan Crawford. Ultimately her style and her creativity are recognized, and she becomes established as Maryjane Edendale, Couturir. In the 1930s, studio bosses like Luis B. Mayer control the lives and contracts of famous stars, yet they find it impossible to control the sexual bombshell known as Mae West. Then the Los Angeles Chief of Police is accused of working hand-in-hand with mob bosses like Lucky Luciano. Maryjane develops a clientele of celebrities through acquaintances with Walt Disney, Helen Hayes, Claudette Colbert, and Mae West. Tragically a client, comedienne Thelma Todd, is killed by a syndicate hit man. Then Maryjane is exposed to an incident where a neighbor participates in a crime . . . a crime that ultimately exposes the rampant corruption of the citys administration and its police force. The Edendales nearly lose their home due to a major flood. Then finally there is an amazing twist of fate when a friends child is killed and Maryjane witnesses a suicide. This story about Reluctant Angels is a remarkable novel, told in Maryjanes own compassionate, often humorous voice. Here is an extraordinary woman who survives many tragedies, ultimately to discover the importance of shaping her own, and her familys destiny.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=38lHDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dictator's Dictation: The Politics of Novels and Novelists","description":"In these elegant essays, many of them originally written for The New Republic and Harper's, Robert Boyers examines the role of the political imagination in shaping the works of such important contemporary writers as W. G. Sebald and Philip Roth, Nadine Gordimer and Mario Vargas Llosa, Natalia Ginzburg and Pat Barker, J. M. Coetzee and John Updike, V. S. Naipaul and Anita Desai. Occasionally he finds that politics actually figures very little in works that only pretend to be interested in politics. Elsewhere he discovers that certain writers are not equal to the political issues they take on or that their work is fatally compromised by complacency or wishful thinking. In the main, though, Boyers writes as a lover of great literature who wishes to understand how the best writers do justice to their own political obsessions without suggesting that everything is reducible to politics. Resisting the notion that novels can be effectively translated into ideas or positions, he resists as well the notion that art and politics must be held apart, lest works of fiction somehow be contaminated by their association with \\"real life\\" or public issues. The essays offer a combination of close reading, argument, and assessment. What, Boyers asks, is the relationship between form and substance in a work whose formal properties are particularly striking? Is it reasonable to think of a particular writer as \\"reactionary\\" merely because he presents an unflattering portrait of revolutionary activists or because he is less than optimistic about the future of newly independent societies? What is the status of private life in works set in politically tumultuous times? Can the novelist be \\"responsible\\" if he consistently refuses to engage the conditions that affect even the intimate lives of his characters? Such questions inform these essays, which strive to be true to the essential spirit of the works they discuss and to interrogate, as sympathetically as possible, the imagination of writers who negotiate the unstable relationships between society and the individual, art and ideas.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c9oYzu3FjrgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gaveston","description":"This title provides a reappraisal of the role of Piers Gaveston in English history and of his personal relationship with Edward II.

Only a dinner of first-class excellence can tempt the Prince of Wales to endure the ordeal of being the president of the Society of Literary Lionisers.

Broadstairs is famed not only as a seaside resort but also as the holiday haunt of Charles Dickens - the author the Society has chosen to lionise for the year of the Prince's presidency. The banquet, attended by six Peggottys, two Betsy Trotwoods, a couple of Little Dorrits, a Scrooge and a Mr Pickwick, not to mention a highly emotional Miss Havisham, passes off well - but the readings that follow do not. In the middle of the murder scene from Oliver Twist, the reader Sir Thomas Throgmorton collapses and dies. It is soon realised that he has been poisoned, and Inspector Naseby of the local constabulary believes Didier's banquet is to blame - after all, what can you expect when a foreigner cooks the food?

Tu Fu merged the public and the private, often in the same poem, as his subjects ranged from the horrors of war to the delights of friendship, from closely observed landscapes to remembered dreams, from the evocation of historical moments to a wry lament over his own thinning hair. Although Tu Fu has been translated often, and often brilliantly, David Hawkes s classic study, first published in 1967, is the only book that demonstrates in depth how his poems were written. Hawkes presents thirty-five poems in the original Chinese, with a pinyin transliteration, a character-by-character translation, and a commentary on the subject, the form, the historical background, and the individual lines. There is no other book quite like it for any language: a nuts-and-bolts account of how Chinese poems in general, and specifically the poems of one of the world s greatest poets, are constructed.

Burgoyne is best known for his role in the American War of Independence. During the Saratoga campaign he surrendered his army of 5,000 men to the American troops on October 17, 1777. Appointed to command a force designated to capture Albany and end the rebellion, Burgoyne advanced from Canada but soon found himself surrounded and outnumbered. He fought two battles at Saratoga, but was forced to open negotiations with Horatio Gates. Although he agreed to a convention, on 17 October 1777, which would allow his troops to return home, this was subsequently revoked and his men were made prisoners.

Out fell a little packet of high-grade cocaine. When he confronted the undersecretary to the chief Soviet diplomat really a KGB colonel and the top Russian spy the agent laughed good-naturedly and congratulated him on passing the test. That was the beginning of Sanjuan s long, peculiar odyssey into the looking-glass world of the United Nations Secretariat. Pedro Sanjuan had been appointed by thenVice President George H. W. Bush to a high-ranking UN post. His real mission: to keep an eye on Soviet espionage activities. Over the years, the Russians had managed to install nearly four hundred KGB and GRU agents in strategic positions throughout the Secretariat, and had turned it into a massive spy facility, operating openly and with absolute impunity on American soil. But this, it turned out, was the least of the problem. Sanjuan soon discovered that incompetence, corruption, anti-Semitism, and outright criminality were rife throughout the UN Secretariat. Among the shady activities that he personally observed or documented were rigged bidding for major service contracts; drug transactions conducted in the UN s parking garage; sale of shotguns and beryllium directly out of the UN building; ties to global organized crime figures; use of UN Information Centers and other agencies to disseminate anti-US and pro-PLO propaganda; systematic theft and abuse of UN facilities and budgets in East Africa; graft and corruption in Vienna; widespread sexual harrassment; use of the UN employee s lounge to plan anti-Israel and anti-US activities by Muslim delegates; open celebration of 9/11 by said delegates in the halls of the UN; and inexplicable tolerance of all of the above on the part of the secretary general and the US government. Sanjuan s cast of characters includes every secretary general from Kurt Waldheim to Kofi Annan, and a large number of bureaucratic rogues and scoundrels. Much of what he documents in The UN Gang is absurdly comical. But its seriousness should not be overlooked. Ultimately, Sanjuan argues, the weakness and corruption of the UN is our own responsibility. During the Cold War, the superpowers conspired to render it a useless forum for international pronouncements and posturing. Now, however, it has become the focal point of global resistance to American interests and policies. Will we continue to host an unholy convention of anti-Semitic, America-hating hypocrites? Or will we take steps to reform this once-proud institution and make it serve the ends of peace, justice, and international order? Only time will tell.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nYht0EeAly0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Midst of Deceit: A Novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JUCNAAAACAAJ&dq=In+the+Midst+of+Deceit:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Incident at Badamya","description":"\\"Gilman keeps you turning the pages.\\" UPI After Gen Ferris's missionary father commits suicide in 1950, it is up to her to get out of Burma alone.

A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the  Austrian School,  which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong   and strongly reasoned   anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jared's Love-Child (Harlequin II)","description":"On her way to her mother s fifth wedding, Devon runs into the groom s son, Jared.

Put concisely, God is a psychological creation signifying ultimate ideality. Mills argues that the idea or conception of God is the manifestation of humanity s denial and response to natural deprivation; a self-relation to an internalized idealized object, the idealization of imagined value. After demonstrating the lack of any empirical evidence and the logical impossibility of God, Mills explains the psychological motivations underlying humanity s need to invent a supreme being. In a highly nuanced analysis of unconscious processes informing the psychology of belief and institutionalized social ideology, he concludes that belief in God is the failure to accept our impending death and mourn natural absence for the delusion of divine presence. As an alternative to theistic faith, he offers a secular spirituality that emphasizes the quality of lived experience, the primacy of feeling and value inquiry, ethical self-consciousness, aesthetic and ecological sensibility, and authentic relationality toward self, other, and world as the pursuit of a beautiful soul in search of the numinous. Inventing God will be of interest to academics, scholars, lay audiences and students of religious studies, the humanities, philosophy, and psychoanalysis, among other disciplines. It will also appeal to psychotherapists, psychoanalysts and mental health professionals focusing on the integration of humanities and psychoanalysis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0nS3DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Help!

Schools are not the equitable institutions that one would hope them to be--a feature of schooling and one that deserves a great deal more attention.

The early 1960s saw American auto manufacturers desperately trying to sell cars to the emerging baby-boom market. Pontiac attained success with its original muscle car, the GTO, but as successful as the GTO was, it was handily outsold by Ford s grand-slam home-run pony car, the Mustang. In response, Pontiac entered the pony car market in 1967 with its new Firebird, a model that became one of the most iconic cars of the classic muscle-car era. Introduced for 1969, the Trans Am version Firebird of the Firebird became the standard bearer for automotive performance in the U.S. market and kept the muscle car flame alive throughout the dark years of the 1970s and led the charge when performance reemerged in the 1980s. When muscle cars became dormant for a generation it was once again the classic pony cars that jump started American performance. The battle that raged between Firebird, Camaro, and Mustang in the 1980s rejuvenated the U.S. auto industry's interest in high-performance muscle cars and the Trans Am remained the most potent car of the lot until the bitter end. Pontiac Trams Am: 50 Years chronicles this ultimate version of the Firebird s rich history, from the early attempts to reach the youth market in the early 1960s, through the potent and turbulent years of the classic muscle car era, the resurgence of muscle in the 1980s, to the car s continued popularity in both the automotive world and in popular culture today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b8tjDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Welding Fabrication and Repair: Questions & Answers","description":"Providing insights, ideas, and tips for solving real-world fabrication problems, this guide presents a broad range of methods from different welding specialties and a brief understanding of the nonwelding knowledge nearly all welders must have to advance in their trade.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UT5HM71MHe8C&dq=Welding+Fabrication+and+Repair:+Questions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One day at Teton Marsh","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fdGfxwEACAAJ&dq=One+day+at+Teton+Marsh&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Doctor's Dilemma (Library Edition Audio CDs)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V-DaAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Doctor%27s+Dilemma+(Library+Edition+Audio+CDs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scarlett Angelina Wolverton-Manning","description":"Having kidnapped feisty Scarlett, the only daughter of very wealthy parents, a criminal realizes that he has made a serious mistake when the full moon starts to rise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FvRVPgAACAAJ&dq=Scarlett+Angelina+Wolverton-Manning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Signs and Symptoms: Thomas Pynchon and the Contemporary World","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"U.S. Nuclear Weapons in Canada","description":"In a follow-up to Canadian Nuclear Weapons, the author brings together recently declassified information of nuclear weapons stored, stationed, or lost in Canada.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I3_oaypyhB8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Historical Mary: Revealing the Pagan Identity of the Virgin Mother","description":"Based on recent interpretations of historical texts, this book unravels the mystery of who Mary really was and the role she played in Jesus' life and ancient society.

However Caroline's brother William, an organist employed in Bath, persuaded their mother to allow Caroline to join him there. She left for England in 1772 to live with William, to whom she remained devoted all of her life. In Bath, William turned towards telescope-making and astronomy, to such effect that in 1781 he discovered the planet Uranus. He was appointed 'the King's astronomer' in 1782, and Caroline, trained by William, continued to work at his side as a scientist in her own right.

The theoretical underpinning of the work lies in the author?s rereading, in terms of contemporary rhetorical theory, of the medieval tradition known as ?figural representation,? which defines the Jewish-Christian relation as that between the dead, prefigural letter and the living, fulfilled spirit. After arguing that the German Enlightenment ultimately plays out the historical phantasm of a necessary ?Judaization? of Protestant rationality, the author shows that German Early Romanticism consists fundamentally in the attempt to solve the aporias raised by this impossible confrontation between Protestant spirit and Jewish letter. In readings of Dorothea Schlegel?Mendelssohn?s daughter?and her husband Friedrich Schlegel, the author provides a new interpretation of the Neo-Catholic turn of later German Romanticism. Further, he situates the proleptic end and reversal of the project of Jewish emancipation in the two extreme versions of late-nineteenth-century anti-Judaism, those of Marx and Wagner, here viewed as binary concretizations of a specifically post-Romantic paganized Protestantism. Finally, the author argues that twentieth-century Modernism as represented by Nietzsche and Freud renews, if in a multiply ironic displacement, the secret ?Judaizing? tendencies of the Enlightenment. Fascism and Communism both denigrate this Modernism, which affirms the letter of language as quasi-synonymous with the force of temporality?or anticipatory repetition?that disrupts all claims to the full presence of spirit. The book ends with a note on recent debates about Holocaust memory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JcUhLctBFkwC&dq=Richard+Wagner+Und+Die+Indische+Geisteswelt+(German+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stats 1999 Diamond Chronicles (STATS Diamond Chronicles)","description":"Provides essays, comments, and statistics that examine trades, compare players, resolve old baseball arguments, and start new ones","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H2dQyEWQwmAC&dq=Stats+1999+Diamond+Chronicles+(STATS+Diamond+Chronicles)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Katie Brown Entertains : 16 Menus 16 Occasions 16 Tables","description":"One of America's favorite doyennes of domesticity reveals her quick, easy, and affordable secrets to casual entertaining.

In Jinxed, smart, saucy sleuth Regan Reilly faces a new challenge -- the case of the missing wedding guest. Regan, an L.A.-based private detective, returns to her office after a vacation with her beau, Jack \\"no relation\\" Reilly. Their tour of the wineries in Napa Valley and Santa Barbara County is cut short when Jack has to fly back to New York City, where he is the head of the Major Case Squad of the NYPD. Their last stop had been at Altered States, a run-down winery owned by three siblings who are all former hippies -- Lilac, Earl, and Leon Weldon. Not knowing how soon it would be put to use, Regan leaves her business card behind. Within minutes of being back to work, Regan gets an excited call from Lilac. The Weldon family has been invited to the wedding of ninety-three-year-old Lucretia Standish, a former silent-screen star, who made a killing in a dot-com before it went bankrupt. Lucretia had been married to the Weldons' Uncle Haskell and had invested the money she inherited from Haskell in the dot-com. Lucretia's maid, Phyllis, clues Lilac in on the fact that Lucretia plans to give the Weldons $2 million each -- if they all show up at the wedding. The wedding is two days away, and there is only one problem -- Lilac's daughter, Whitney, aka Freshness, a young actress, has taken off on one of her go-with-the-flow weekends. Whitney is out of touch and goes where the wind blows. If it doesn't blow her back into town by Sunday morning, the Weldon family will be out $8 million. Regan's job is to find Whitney. But unbeknownst to Regan, there's someone else on the hunt. Lucretia's fianc , the much younger Edward Fields, has hired an accomplice in crime to locate Whitney and keep her away from the wedding. Edward knows Whitney will recognize him as the con man she'd met in acting class in New York. He wants to say \\"I do\\" to Lucretia and her millions before Whitney can protest. When Edward finds out that Regan Reilly has been hired to find the missing Whitney, he gives the order to get rid of her as well. Meanwhile, Lucretia is befriended by a gang of bikers, the story of her upcoming nuptials is featured on national television news, and wildfires are threatening to consume the barn where Whitney is being held captive. As in her previous novels, Carol Higgins Clark has created a novel that is both exciting and vastly entertaining. As no less a master of suspense than Nelson DeMille has said, \\"Clark's writing is elegantly clear and concise, her characters are witty and engaging, and her plots and pacing are perfect.\\" And in Jinxed, she is at her very considerable best.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MfumrY36q4UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War and Society in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds","description":"This social history of war from the third millennium BCE to the 10th-century CE in the Mediterranean, the Near East and Europe (Egypt, Achamenid Persia, Greece, the Hellenistic World, the Roman Republic and Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the early Islamic World and early Medieval Europe) with parallel studies of Mesoamerica (the Maya and Aztecs) and East Asia (ancient China, medieval Japan).

During the languid days of the Christmas break, a group of thirtysomething friends from Oxford meet to welcome in the New Year together, a tradition they began as students ten years ago. For this vacation, they ve chosen an idyllic and isolated estate in the Scottish Highlands the perfect place to get away and unwind by themselves. The trip begins innocently enough: admiring the stunning if foreboding scenery, champagne in front of a crackling fire, and reminiscences about the past. But after a decade, the weight of secret resentments has grown too heavy for the group s tenuous nostalgia to bear. Amid the boisterous revelry of New Year s Eve, the cord holding them together snaps, just as a historic blizzard seals the lodge off from the outside world. Two days later, on New Year s Day, one of them is dead. . . and another of them did it. Keep your friends close, the old adage says. But how close is too close? DON'T BE LEFT OUT.

The focus of the book is on the Portuguese, Spanish, and French-speaking regions of continental America and the Caribbean. It analyzes the latest research on urban and rural slavery and on the African and Afro-American experience under these regimes. It approaches these themes both historically and structurally. The historical section provides a detailed analysis of the evolution of slavery and forced labor systems in Europe, Africa, and America. The second half of the book looks at the type of life and culture which the salves experienced in these American regimes. The first part of the book describes the growth of the plantation and mining economies that absorbed African slave labor, how that labor was used, and how the changing international economic conditions affected the local use and distribution of the slave labor force. Particular emphasis is given to the evolution of the sugar plantation economy, which was the single largest user of African slave labor and which was established in almost all of the Latin American colonies. Once establishing the economic context in which slave labor was applied, the book shifts focus to the Africans and Afro-Americans themselves as they passed through this slave regime. The first part deals with the demographic history of the slaves, including their experience in the Atlantic slave trade and their expectations of life in the New World. The next part deals with the attempts of the African and American born slaves to create a viable and autonomous culture. This includes their adaptation of European languages, religions, and even kinship systems to their own needs. It also examines systems of cooptation and accommodation to the slave regime, as well as the type and intensity of slave resistances and rebellions. A separate chapter is devoted to the important and different role of the free colored under slavery in the various colonies. The unique importance of the Brazilian free labor class is stressed, just as is the very unusual mobility experienced by the free colored in the French West Indies. The final chapter deals with the differing history of total emancipation and how ex-slaves adjusted to free conditions in the post-abolition periods of their respective societies. The patterns of post-emancipation integration are studied along with the questions of the relative success of the ex-slaves in obtaining control over land and escape from the old plantation regimes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fllWnwEACAAJ&dq=African+Slavery+in+Latin+America+and+the+Caribbean&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grandma Was Quite a Girl","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The First World Series and the Baseball Fanatics of 1903","description":"A chronicle of the first World Series captures all the exitement and drama of this first match-up between the Boston Americans and the Pittsburgh Pirates.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ML-9NIMsDeYC&dq=The+First+World+Series+and+the+Baseball+Fanatics+of+1903&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Piano Teacher: The True Story of a Psychotic Killer","description":"Everybody has a dream.

David French picked up the newspaper in the comfort of his penthouse in Philadelphia, and read about a soldier - father of two - who was wounded in Iraq. Immediately, he was stricken with a question: Why him and not me? David was a 37-year-old father of two, a Harvard Law graduate and president of a free speech organization. In other words, he was used to pushing pencils, not toting M16s. His wife Nancy was raising two children and writing from home. She was worrying about field trips and playdates, not about her husband going to war.

Ishi is believed to have been the last Native American in Northern California to have lived most of his life completely outside the European American culture. At about 49 years old, in 1911 he emerged from the wild near Oroville, California, leaving his ancestral homeland, present-day Tehama County, near the foothills of Lassen Peak. The anthropologist Alfred Kroeber gave the name to the man when he discovered Ishi had never been named. When asked his name, he said: \\"I have none, because there were no people to name me,\\" meaning that no tribal naming ceremony had been performed. Ishi was taken in by anthropologists at the University of California at Berkeley, who both studied him and hired him as a research assistant. He lived most of his remaining five years in a university building in San Francisco. A question often asked is: Why was Ishi Press named after the Last Wild American Indian? The answer is: It wasn't ! It is almost a pure coincidence that Ishi Press shares a name with the last wild American Indian. The word \\"Ishi\\" means \\"Go Stone\\" in Japanese. Go Stones are used to play the Chinese and Japanese game of Go. Ishi Press was formed to publish books about the game of go. We at Ishi Press have never been able to overcome the belief that we are connected with the last wild American Indian named Ishi, so we have decided to become connected with him after all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G5pjAAAACAAJ&dq=Ishi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leaving Home: What You Gotta Do, When You Gotta Do It, and How Much It's All Gonna Cost You","description":"A book about the transformation from home life to life out on one's own, \\"Leaving Home\\" teaches readers about such real-life details as car insurance, checking accounts, and finding a place to live.

For this second edition, Williams reads Romero's Bruiser (2000) against his more recent Land of the Dead (2005) and takes a fresh look at Diary of the Dead (2007) and Survival of the Dead (2009), two overlooked films that feature Romero's greatest achievements yet.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W34yBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oz: The Hundredth Anniversary Celebration (Books of Wonder)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WeLYkQEACAAJ&dq=Oz:+The+Hundredth+Anniversary+Celebration+(Books+of+Wonder)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The man from Greek and Roman,: A novel","description":"The Metropolitan Museum acquires a chalice through a European art dealer.

He shows us how, over the last half century, America s core values meritocracy, innovation, due process, free speech, and even democracy itself have somehow managed to power its decline into dysfunction. They have isolated our best and brightest, whose positions at the top have never been more secure or more remote. The result has been an erosion of responsibility and accountability, an epidemic of shortsightedness, an increasingly hollow economic and political center, and millions of Americans gripped by apathy and hopelessness. By examining the people and forces behind the rise of big-money lobbying, legal and financial engineering, the demise of private-sector unions, and a hamstrung bureaucracy, Brill answers the question on everyone s mind: How did we end up this way? Finally, he introduces us to those working quietly and effectively to repair the damages. At once a diagnosis of our national ills, a history of their development, and a prescription for a brighter future, Tailspin is a work of riveting journalism and a welcome antidote to political despair.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4Dk-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Survived","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Remove Pain-Physical and Emotional: With Energy Psychology by Tapping on Acupuncture Points","description":"This latest revolutionary development in psychology and pain management allows people to free themselves from physical pain and such negative emotions as hurt, anger, or fear.

She s come to assist celebrated artist Miles Radburn with his new book on the history of Turkish art.

Known also as Haungooah, his Kiowa name, Silver Horn was a man of remarkable skill and talent. Working in graphite, colored pencil, crayon, pen and ink, and watercolor on hide, muslin, and paper, he produced more than one thousand illustrations between 1870 and 1920. Silver Horn created an unparalleled visual record of Kiowa culture, from traditional images of warfare and coup counting to sensitive depictions of the sun dance, early Peyote religion, and domestic daily life. At the turn of the century, he helped translate nearly the entire corpus of Kiowa shield designs into miniaturized forms on buckskin models for Smithsonian ethnologist James Mooney. Born in 1860 when huge bison herds still roamed the southern plains, Silver Horn grew up in southwestern Oklahoma. Son of a chief and member of an artistically gifted family, he witnessed traumatic changes as his people went from a free-roaming, buffalo-hunting culture to reservation life and, ultimately, to forced assimilation into white society. Although perceived as a troublemaker in midlife because of his staunch resistance to the forces of civilization, Silver Horn became to many a romantic example of the \\"real old-time Indian.\\" In this presentation of Silver Horn s work, showcasing 43 color and 116 black-and-white illustrations, Candace S. Greene provides a thorough biographical portrait of the artist and, through his work, assesses the concepts and roles of artists in Kiowa culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_zy1bq4eG-oC&dq=Silver+Horn:+Master+Illustrator+of+the+Kiowas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Larry Powell's Big book of cake decorating","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s0zRAAAACAAJ&dq=Larry+Powell%27s+Big+book+of+cake+decorating&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Biology, The Penguin: 2 (Dictionary, Penguin)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P3j6zQEACAAJ&dq=Dictionary+of+Biology,+The+Penguin:+2+(Dictionary,+Penguin)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mr. Peters' Connections (Plays, Penguin)","description":"Produced in May 1998 in New York and starring Peter Falk, Mr. Peters' Connections takes place, in Miller's own words, in \\"that suspended state of consciousness when the mind is freed to roam from real memories to conjectures, from trivialities to tragic insights, from terror of death to glorying in one's being alive.\\" Within the confines of his mind, Mr. Peters interacts with the living members of his family and his long-deceased brother and lover, as well as the imaginary Adele, a black bag lady, who is a figment of Peters' imagination and one of Miller's most original characters. \\"A work of rare honesty and dignity\\" (Fintan O'Toole, New York Daily News), Mr. Peters' Connections uncoils with ferocious, life-affirming intensity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RIlPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Mr.+Peters%27+Connections+(Plays,+Penguin)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Finding Peace","description":"'This transformational book will help you calm your mind, remove negativity and find inner peace.'

At its center are two men convicted in U.S. courts on terrorism-related charges: Hemant Lakhani, a seventy-year-old tried for attempting to sell a fake missile to an FBI informant, and Shahawar Matin Siraj, baited by the New York Police Department into a conspiracy to bomb a subway. Lakhani and Siraj were caught through questionable sting operations involving paid informants; both men received lengthy jail sentences. Their convictions were celebrated as major victories in the war on terror. In Amitava Kumar s riveting account of their cases, Lakhani and Siraj emerge as epic bunglers, and the U.S. government as the creator of terror suspects to prosecute. Kumar analyzed the trial transcripts and media coverage, and he interviewed Lakhani, Siraj, their families, and their lawyers. Juxtaposing such stories of entrapment in the United States with narratives from India, another site of multiple terror attacks and state crackdowns, Kumar explores the harrowing experiences of ordinary people entangled in the war on terror. He also considers the fierce critiques of post-9/11 surveillance and security regimes by soldiers and torture victims, as well as artists and writers, including Coco Fusco, Paul Shambroom, and Arundhati Roy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2EAZMFOeICIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Self Esteem and Peak Performance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CydBnQEACAAJ&dq=Self+Esteem+and+Peak+Performance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mars Arena (death lands)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Triad Worlds","description":"Captain Sam Gowdy and his crew are caught in the middle of a triplanetary war in which they learn of a conspiracy to steal the Habegger Gates, a revolutionary transport technology that can be used to manipulate time and space.

Biology is no different and we are just beginning to comprehend the challenges inherent in the next stage of biology as a human technology. It is this critical moment, with its wide-ranging implications, that Robert Carlson considers in Biology Is Technology. He offers a uniquely informed perspective on the endeavors that contribute to current progress in this area the science of biological systems and the technology used to manipulate them. In a number of case studies, Carlson demonstrates that the development of new mathematical, computational, and laboratory tools will facilitate the engineering of biological artifacts up to and including organisms and ecosystems. Exploring how this will happen, with reference to past technological advances, he explains how objects are constructed virtually, tested using sophisticated mathematical models, and finally constructed in the real world. Such rapid increases in the power, availability, and application of biotechnology raise obvious questions about who gets to use it, and to what end. Carlson s thoughtful analysis offers rare insight into our choices about how to develop biological technologies and how these choices will determine the pace and effectiveness of innovation as a public good.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NGTbnaXOKD8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Present (Malory Family)","description":"Now together for the first time, Johanna Lindsey's two classic Christmas tales, long beloved by her fans, available with a beautiful keepsake Christmas ornament!

Shuger published her field-changing study, The Renaissance Bible: Scholarship, Sacrifice and Subjectivity. Shuger s book offers a wide-reaching and intellectually ambitious exploration of the centrality of the inter-connected discourses of literature and theology in the period. Throughout, Shuger troubles prevailing assumptions about religion and its purview by expanding the archive of \\"religious writing\\" far beyond the devotional poetry and prose that had so long been the province of literary history. Shuger deftly traces the connections between biblical scholarship and the histories of politics, nations and peoples, languages, and law, as well as to the most important literary forms of the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance: tragedy (ancient and modern), \\"mythology,\\" and the genres of affective devotion that depict Christ s inestimable suffering. The Renaissance Bible discovers how early modern readers rendered the worlds of Scripture intelligible, even palpable, and how they located themselves and their endeavors in a history they shared with classical and biblical antecedents alike. The essays collected here lay bare the extraordinary powers and resources of The Renaissance Bible, with contributions by leading scholars of early modernity: Anthony Grafton, Brian Cummings, Russ Leo, Beth Quitslund, and Achsah Guibbory.

Whatever the success of this attempt, there can be no doubt that it was enormously influential. Cartesian celestial mechanics held sway for well over a century, and some of the best minds of that period, including Leibniz, Malebranche, Euler, and the Bernoullis, attempted to modify and quantify the Cartesian theory of vortices into an acceptable alternative to Newton's theory of universal gravitation. Thus, the Principles is not only of inherent and historical interest philosophically but is also a seminal document in the history of science and of 17th Century thought. Principles of Philosophy was first published in Latin, in 1644. In 1647, a French translation, done by the Abbe Claude Picot and containing a great deal of additional material and a number of alterations in the original text, was published with Descartes's enthusiastic approval. Unlike some English translations of portions of the Principles, this translation uses the Latin text as its primary source; however, a good deal of additional material from Picot's translation has been included. There are several reasons for this. First, there is good evidence that Descartes himself was responsible for some of the additional material, including, of course, the Preface to the French translation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8vt0uWWVzEYC&dq=Ren+Descartes:+Principles+of+Philosophy:+Translation+with+Explanatory+Notes+(Synthese+Historical+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dance of the Planets: The Universe of Nicolaus Copernicus","description":"Nicolaus Copernicus' inquiring mind probes the secrets of the universe during a time when such behavior is considered heretical.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bd58swEACAAJ&dq=Dance+of+the+Planets:+The+Universe+of+Nicolaus+Copernicus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Science Fair Workshop","description":"How to set up a science fair project - from start to finish.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r0kNAAAACAAJ&dq=Science+Fair+Workshop&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Christian year (Keble's Christian Year)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Miser and Other Plays","description":"Moli re combined all the traditional elements of comedy - wit, slapstick, spectacle and satire - to create richly sophisticated and enduringly popular dramas.

The perplexing event has not been adequately accounted for by historians in their large-scale assessments of how and why the Holocaust occurred. In this gripping new analysis, Alon Confino draws on an array of archives across three continents to propose a penetrating new assessment of one of the central moral problems of the twentieth century. To a surprising extent, Confino demonstrates, the mass murder of Jews during the war years was powerfully anticipated in the culture of the prewar years. The author shifts his focus away from the debates over what the Germans did or did not know about the Holocaust and explores instead how Germans came to conceive of the idea of a Germany without Jews. He traces the stories the Nazis told themselves where they came from and where they were heading and how those stories led to the conclusion that Jews must be eradicated in order for the new Nazi civilization to arise. The creation of this new empire required that Jews and Judaism be erased from Christian history, and this was the inspiration and justification for Kristallnacht. As Germans imagined a future world without Jews, persecution and extermination became imaginable, and even justifiable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YoI6AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Strategy of Dominance: The History of an American Concentration Camp","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yVC7DAEACAAJ&dq=A+Strategy+of+Dominance:+The+History+of+an+American+Concentration+Camp&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Primate Diversity","description":"Primate Diversity successfully synthesizes a thorough look at current primatology research while providing a careful examination of a variety of species.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v_ZfQgAACAAJ&dq=Primate+Diversity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pillar of fire: The rebirth of Israel--a visual history","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=66RXzQEACAAJ&dq=Pillar+of+fire:+The+rebirth+of+Israel--a+visual+history&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Old Farmer's Almanac 2004 Gardening Calendar","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gfy5TqEp5nIC&dq=The+Old+Farmer%27s+Almanac+2004+Gardening+Calendar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The CRYSTAL DROP","description":"In the summer of 2011, the death of their mother sends Megan and her younger brother Ian on a dangerous journey across a Canada ravaged by drought and the collapse of civilization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XEMYuEOK-tMC&dq=The+CRYSTAL+DROP&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pose File 4: Dance Action (Pose File, Vol 4)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Color Design Workbook: A Real-World Guide to Using Color in Graphic Design","description":"Presents information on the fundamentals of graphic design and color theory, providing tips on ways to talk to clients about color and how to use color in presentations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CjuLl_bNO9UC&dq=Color+Design+Workbook:+A+Real-World+Guide+to+Using+Color+in+Graphic+Design&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Man''s Possible Evolution","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZIvlT9IxYTwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dragon World","description":"Immerse yourself in the rich, fascinating history of dragons in this illustrated gift ebook.

Lucidity is consciousness itself. It exists in a realm of experience beyond words; achieving it is not an intellectual exercise. To become lucid is a transformation of emotions, memories, and thought patterns to reach an altered state. It s not your image of the walls that you want to dissolve when becoming lucid, it s your image of reality. This is the first book to approach lucid dreaming through hypnosis. Each chapter has an introduction that you read, and a trance induction you can listen to online by accessing free MP3 audio files. These hypnotic inductions offer you experiential tours of altered states. Listen to them while falling asleep and they will become your lucid dream environment. Other books view lucid dreaming as awakening in a dream. This book views all states as dream states from which lucidity is possible. And what one becomes lucid of, when one becomes lucid, is another dream state as all states are our own constructions. Lucidity is an awakening to a level of consciousness that s higher, broader, deeper, and more connected. Lucidity is not a goal, it s a process; it s not something you get, it s something you become. Doing silly stuff in your dreams is as enlightening as doing silly stuff while awake. It s fun for a while, but you grow out of it. On the other hand, breaking open your mind to move into what s now not even comprehensible is something you don t grow out of. This is not sleep work or dream work, it s life work. Exploring the impossible is just the start. Let s explore the inconceivable. Drawn from the author s experience as a theoretical physicist, neurophysiologist, and hypnotherapist who focuses on sleep and trance states, Becoming Lucid would like to take your hand and lead you into states of mind you can t even imagine. \\"Lincoln Stoller takes the de facto approach to lucid dreaming and turns it on its head. Rather than yet another guide book, this work represents a paradigm shift to an entirely new mode of thinking.\\"   Chris Hammond, Chief Lucidity Officer at www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lGbXDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hypnosis of Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1I1snFCHuPEC&dq=Hypnosis+of+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Borders and Bridges: A History of U.S.-Latin American Relations (Praeger Security International)","description":"Illuminates the motivations behind U.S. actions and Latin American reactions in the hemisphere.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0HmdAAAAMAAJ&dq=Borders+and+Bridges:+A+History+of+U.S.-Latin+American+Relations+(Praeger+Security+International)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"3-d Negotiation: Powerful Tools to Change the Game in Your Most Important Deals","description":"Most discussions on negotiation use an exclusively at-the-table perspective, focused on tactics, persuasion, psychology and other 1-D elements of the negotiation process.

Seldom does one find serious scholarship so easy to read.   The Times, Book of the Year A New York Times bestseller, this major new history of the knights Templar is  a fresh, muscular and compelling history of the ultimate military-religious crusading order, combining sensible scholarship with narrative swagger\\"  Simon Sebag Montefiore, author of Jerusalem A faltering war in the middle east. A band of elite warriors determined to fight to the death to protect Christianity s holiest sites. A global financial network unaccountable to any government. A sinister plot founded on a web of lies. Jerusalem 1119. A small group of knights seeking a purpose in the violent aftermath of the First Crusade decides to set up a new order. These are the first Knights Templar, a band of elite warriors prepared to give their lives to protect Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land. Over the next two hundred years, the Templars would become the most powerful religious order of the medieval world. Their legend has inspired fervent speculation ever since. In this groundbreaking narrative history, Dan Jones tells the true story of the Templars for the first time in a generation, drawing on extensive original sources to build a gripping account of these Christian holy warriors whose heroism and alleged depravity have been shrouded in myth. The Templars were protected by the pope and sworn to strict vows of celibacy. They fought the forces of Islam in hand-to-hand combat on the sun-baked hills where Jesus lived and died, finding their nemesis in Saladin, who vowed to drive all Christians from the lands of Islam. Experts at channeling money across borders, they established the medieval world s largest and most innovative banking network and waged private wars against anyone who threatened their interests. Then, as they faced setbacks at the hands of the ruthless Mamluk sultan Baybars and were forced to retreat to their stronghold in Cyprus, a vindictive and cash-strapped King of France set his sights on their fortune. His administrators quietly mounted a damning case against the Templars, built on deliberate lies and false testimony. On Friday October 13, 1307, hundreds of brothers were arrested, imprisoned and tortured, and the order was disbanded amid lurid accusations of sexual misconduct and heresy. They were tried by the Pope in secret proceedings and their last master was brutally tortured and burned at the stake. But were they heretics or victims of a ruthlessly repressive state? Dan Jones goes back to the sources tobring their dramatic tale, so relevant to our own times, to life in a book that is at once authoritative and compulsively readable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6RccDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intention (Library of Philosophy and Logic)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ewmpAQAACAAJ&dq=Intention+(Library+of+Philosophy+and+Logic)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When the Elephants Dance : A Novel","description":" Papa explains the war like this:  When the elephants dance, the chickens must be careful.

Once in a great while comes a storyteller who can illuminate worlds large and small, in ways both magical and true to life.

While the Karangalan family and their neighbors huddle together for survival in the cellar of a house, they tell magical stories to one another based on Filipino myth that transport the listeners from the chaos of the war around them and give them new resolve to continue fighting. Outside the safety of their refuge the war rages on fiery bombs torch the countryside, Japanese soldiers round up and interrogate innocent people, and from the hills guerilla fighters wage a desperate campaign against the enemy.

Pre-modern jurists produced an extensive and sophisticated discourse on the legality of rebellion and the treatment due to rebels under Islamic law. The book examines the emergence and development of these discourses from the eighth to the fifteenth centuries, and considers juristic responses to the various terror-inducing strategies employed by rebels--including assassination, stealth attacks and rape. The study demonstrates how Muslim jurists went about restructuring several competing doctrinal sources in order to construct a highly technical discourse on rebellion. Indeed many of these rulings may have a profound influence on contempoary practices. This is an important and challenging book which sheds light on the complexities of Islamic law, and pre-modern attitudes to dissidence and rebellion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W_hepwAACAAJ&dq=Rebellion+and+Violence+in+Islamic+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The ancient martial art of hwarang do (Literary links to the Orient)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gbnVpwAACAAJ&dq=The+ancient+martial+art+of+hwarang+do+(Literary+links+to+the+Orient)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Keene (NH) (Images of America)","description":"Keene has a history as fascinating and diverse as it is long.

But neither her husband nor her marriage had been saved. What had become of His promise? Tony Kavanagh had been Allison s dream-come-true. They were in love within days, engaged within weeks, married and pregnant within a year. Her cup bubbled over with joy . . . but years later, that joy had been extinguished by unexpected trials. The day Allison issued her husband an ultimatum, she thought it might save him. She never expected he would actually leave. She was certain God had promised to heal; it was clear that she'd misunderstood. Now, living in the quiet mountain cabin she inherited from her single, self-reliant Great Aunt Emma, Allison must come to terms with her grief and figure out how to adapt to small town life. But when she finds a wedding dress and a collection of journals in Emma s attic, a portrait of her aunt emerges that takes Allison completely by surprise: a portrait of a heartbroken woman surprisingly like herself. As Allison reads the incredible story of Emma s life in the 1920s and 1930s, she is forced to ask a difficult question: Does she really surrender every piece of her life to the Lord?

The division enjoyed a high reputation for its combat capability, and was always at the focal points of the fighting on the Eastern Front in the last year of the war. During this period it saw combat in the Baltic, in Pomerania, on the Oder, and finally in defense of Berlin, where it was destroyed.Erik Wallin served with his unit in all of these locations, and provides the reader with a fascinating glimpse into these final battles.

Such antisocial behavior has its roots in the despair that children feel when they are abused, neglected, or abandoned by their parents or other caregivers. The book emphasizes and focuses upon the early recognition and treatment of this depression, highlighting those interventions most likely to be effective in helping abused, neglected and abandoned youth. The methods discussed are specifically chosen because they are not only empirically based but also practical.

In Tell Me Who You Are, Guo and Vulchi reveal the lines that separate us based on race or other perceived differences and how telling our stories--and listening deeply to the stories of others--are the first and most crucial steps we can take towards negating racial inequity in our culture. Featuring interviews with over 150 Americans accompanied by their photographs, this intimate toolkit also offers a deep examination of the seeds of racism and strategies for effecting change.

While retaining a general picture of the modest, quintessentially English composer, Stephen Banfield's stylish, witty and acute biography reveals Finzi as a more complex and engaged figure than he is often given credit for. Finzi's ambiguous relationship with his craft, his affluent and intellectually stimulating family background and his Jewishness lend a mysterious and troubled quality to his life and work, and ultimately invite us to question the notions of Englishness he represents. 'In this outstanding study, Stephen Banfield remarks that although Finzi's output and influence were those of a minor composer, \\"something about his profile, the way he went about his job, the breadth of his thought, the depths of his personality and its impact on others, in short his individuality, always suggested something greater.\\" Thus it is that Finzi, with a relatively small output, now receives a 571-page biography in which the author brings to bear the full weight and authority of analytical scholarship. Is he worth it? Banfield compels one to answer yes.' Michael Kennedy, BBC Music Magazine 'Stephen Banfield's long-needed and doubly welcome book does all that a good life-and-works study should do ... he earns the most heartfelt gratitude.

The novel takes as its starting point the ultimately pointless struggles of left- and right-wing militants in Spain in 1938. Never having forgotten their defeat, a terrorist faction returns to the vilalge of Nieves and massacres its inhabitants as the story opens forty years later. Enraged by the minor coverage given the slaughter, the journalist Jefferson Pritchard regroups his brigade and resolves to wipe out their old foes from the Black Order. As one crusty old group pursues the other across Europe, the distinctions between principles, between left and right, all but vanish into a senseless haze, without victors or vanquished, leaving only victims.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hWFQAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Black+Order+Brigade&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Knight, White Knight","description":"Zander Davis, a loving, romantic Dominant, has squelched his true nature for many years, but a chance encounter with a dark-haired, green-eyed, Brazilian beauty named Gabriela Costa sets to flame the sleeping embers of his fiery, sensuous soul. Though their connection is immediate and deep, they both know Zander must walk away. He bids her a bittersweet farewell, thinking he will never see her again, but the future holds shocking surprises for them both. While engrossed in their conversation, neither noticed the man scowling at them from the bar. His name, Connor Matthews, and he was filled with an egomaniacal, jealous rage; Gabriela was supposed to wait for him. He is a conniving, narcissistic sadist, who uses social media as his hunting ground, seeking vulnerable, naive, young women. Claiming to be a Dominant, with the screen name Black Knight 007, he carefully selects and nurtures his victim, and once under his roof, cruelly forces her into domestic servitude, and uses her for his perverted sexual needs, replacing her when he becomes bored. But Zander and Gabriela will not be the only ones to experience a twist of fate. When Karma comes calling, Connor Matthews discovers the old adage, be careful what you wish for, to be horrifyingly true. WHITE KNIGHT, BLACK KNIGHT, is a compelling tale of Dominance and submission, good versus evil, a woman's courage, a man's faith, and their souls enduring love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gS7UnQEACAAJ&dq=Black+Knight,+White+Knight&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Over the Line : North Korea's Negotiating Strategy","description":"Using previously unpublished accounts, Over the Line brings together for the first time the full record of North Korea's negotiations, describes motives and objectives, and assesses negotiating tactics.

Now America s Sweetheart, preacher s daughter, pop phenomenon, reality tv pioneer, and the billion-dollar fashion mogul invites readers on a remarkable journey, examining a life that blessed her with the compassion to help others, but also burdened her with an almost crippling need to please. Open Book is Jessica Simpson using her voice, heart, soul, and humor to share things she s never shared before. First celebrated for her voice, she became one of the most talked-about women in the world, whether for music and fashion, her relationship struggles, or as a walking blonde joke.

Her book shares the wisdom and inspirations she s learned and shows the real woman behind all the pop-culture clich  s    chicken or fish,   Daisy Duke,  \\"football jinx,\\"  mom jeans,   sexual napalm   and more.

Originally published in 1980, this updated edition of The Psychology of Romantic Love explores the nature of romantic love on many levels-the philosophical, the historical, the sociological, and the physiological. Nathaniel Branden explains why so many people say that romantic love is just not possible in today's world and-drawing on his experience with thousands of couples-finds that such love is still a possibility for anyone who understands its essence and is willing to accept its challenges. Branden sees it as a pathway not only to extraordinary joy but also to profound self-discovery.

They're a rare breed that inspires awe, envy, admiration -- sometimes even hatred. They're idolized, criticized, and demonized. In short, they stand out from the rest of humanity. After all, not everyone can build personal fortunes worth billions or create dominant business empires. It takes a remarkable person, blessed with the \\"traits of wealth\\", to accomplish these things. The Prime Movers takes a penetrating look at some of these remarkable people -- and reveals seven attributes common to all great wealth creators: independent vision, an active mind, competence and confidence, the drive to action, egoistic passion, love of ability in others, and virtue. In the right mix, these traits are what makes someone a Bill Gates, Sam Walton, Mary Kay, or Ross Perot. Sometimes irreverent, sometimes surprising, but always fascinating, The Prime Movers sheds welcome light on the powerful personalities and driving forces behind the world's famous (and infamous) ultra-wealthy elite.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k9RpQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Prime+Movers:+Traits+of+the+Great+Wealth+Creators&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murder at Bertram's Bower: A Beacon Hill Mystery","description":"IN A HAVEN FOR FALLEN WOMEN, HAS HISTORY S MOST DEPRAVED KILLER RISEN AGAIN?

He worries that unless there is a spiritual revival of mythic dimensions, Mormonism is doomed to resolve itself into yet another sect full of ethical pretension and xenophobic aspiration.Considering himself a Latter-day Saint in exile, Toscano remains confident that Christian love may yet overflow the banks of righteousness, sweep away respectability, turn dignity into mud, lay waste the levees of our vaunted invulnerability, and contaminate us with holiness. The church will yet become an open, compassionate, and forgiving community, according to Toscano's wish -- one dedicated to the spiritual empowerment of each individual, the celebration of diversity, and the sanctity of dissent.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Eg6LAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Sanctity+of+Dissent&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bluff Your Way in the Quantum Universe (Bluffer's Guides)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"SignLanguage","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Toulon 1793: Napoleon's first great victory (Campaign)","description":"In August 1793 of the French Revolutionary Wars (1792-1802), Republican France teetered on the brink of collapse.

Now a scholar who gained an insider's perspective into the Black Seminole community in Texas and Mexico offers a rare and vivid picture of these women and their contributions. In Dreaming with the Ancestors, Shirley Boteler Mock explores the role that Black Seminole women have played in shaping and perpetuating a culture born of African roots and shaped by southeastern Native American and Mexican influences. Mock reveals a unique maroon culture, forged from an eclectic mixture of religious beliefs and social practices. At its core is an amalgam of African-derived traditions kept alive by women. The author interweaves documentary research with extensive interviews she conducted with leading Black Seminole women to uncover their remarkable history. She tells how these women nourished their families and held fast to their Afro-Seminole language   even as they fled slavery, endured relocation, and eventually sought new lives in new lands. Of key importance were the \\"warrior women\\"   keepers of dreams and visions that bring to life age-old African customs. Featuring more than thirty illustrations and maps, including historic photographs never before published, Dreaming with the Ancestors combines scholarly analysis with human interest to open a new window on both African American and American Indian history and culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6DidR2jTUjEC&dq=A+journey+through+Texas%3B:+Or,+A+saddle-trip+on+the+southwestern+frontier,+with+a+statistical+appendix+(Burt+Franklin+research&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Colonist","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S3YPAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roger Sessions on Music: Collected Essays","description":"Over the past fifty years Roger Sessions has developed, in articles, lectures, and addresses, various themes that reflect the stages of his own musical and intellectual growth. These themes form the basis of the present collection of essays.

The collection also includes a set of critical essays on such seminal figures as Bloch, Schoenberg, and Stravinsky. Roger Sessions is the composer of a recently recorded cantata on Whitman's \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\\" as well as numerous other works.

His proper name is thus an open-ended, all-encompassing list, a mystery the Church embraces in its rhetoric, but which many Christians have found difficult to accept. To explore this conflict, Valentina Izmirlieva examines two lists of God s names: one from The Divine Names, the classic treatise by Pseudo-Dionysius, and the other from The 72 Names of the Lord, an amulet whose history binds together Kabbalah and Christianity, Jews and Slavs, Palestine, Provence, and the Balkans. This unexpected juxtaposition of a theological treatise and a magical amulet allows Izmirlieva to reveal lists  rhetorical potential to create order and to function as both tools of knowledge and of power. Despite the two different visions of order represented by each list, Izmirlieva finds that their uses in Christian practice point to a complementary relationship between the existential need for God s protection and the metaphysical desire to submit to his infinite majesty a compelling claim sure to provoke discussion among scholars in many fields.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BmUmMs_p-QQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Object Orientation in Visual FoxPro","description":"You can make the transition to object - oriented programming and reap its benefits - faster development, easier maintenance, higher quality, and increased adaptability - quickly and easily with this concise and lively introduction to OOP geared specifically for FoxPro programmers.

He begins by asking why women have figure so little in the development of science, and then proceeds in a fascinating and radical analysis to trace their absence to a deep-rooted legacy of the male-dominated Western religious community. He shows how over the last thousand years science and the practice and institutions of higher learning were dominated by Christian clerics, whose ascetic culture from the late medieval period militated against the inclusion of women in scientific enterprise. He further demonstrates how the attitudes that took hold then remained more or less intact through the Reformation, and still subtly permeate out thinking despite the secularization of learning. Noble also describes how during the first millennium and after, women at times gained amazingly broad intellectual freedom and participated both in clerical activities and in scholarly pursuits. But, as Noble shows, these episodic forays occurred only in the wake of anticlerical movements within the church and without. He suggest finally an impulse toward  defeminization  at the core of the modern scientific and technological enterprise as it work to wrest from one-half of humanity its part in production (the Industrial Revolution s male appropriation of labor) and reproduction (the millennium-old quest for the artificial womb). An important book that profoundly examine how the culture of Western Science came to be a world without women.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kRHH6HdVgtYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ex-Boyfriend Cookbook: They Came, They Cooked, They Left (But We Ended Up with Some Great Recipes)","description":"Every time we tell someone about this book we get puzzled grins, raised eyebrows, and hilarious guesses as to what on earth The Ex-Boyfriend Cookbook might possibly be. Every time we tell a guy about it, he becomes instantly intent on doing pretty much anything if it'll get him into the book. One boy (who swears he only went out with Thisbe in order to get a recipe named after him) found out he'd missed the print deadline by a hair but that the cover wasn't done yet and quickly e-mailed with a list of potential subtitles for the front jacket: Men Are from Marzipan, Women Are from Bean Dip; Dear John, I'm Leaving You and Taking the Cuisinart; He Would Eat His Grandmother's Pie All Night While Mine Just Sat There and Got Cold, Love in the Time of Colander . . . We don't have anyone exactly clamoring to be our boyfriends, yet they're practically lining up to get to be our exes! We swear we didn't conceive of this book as a way to pick up guys. At least it didn't start out that way. Really: One day we were planning a barbecue at the Iowa farmhouse where we lived and Erin said, \\"Oh, I'll make Davis's spicy BBQ rub!\\" And we kind of looked at each other and said, \\"We should write a cookbook of all the recipes we've gotten from ex-boyfriends over the years!\\" And an idea was born. It was the perfect project for us, too. We're both pack rats, collectors who hold on to every scrap of paper anyone's ever handed us. While all our friends grilled burgers that night and played volleyball on the lawn, the two of us took our beers upstairs and hauled out all of our aging boxes and envelopes full of tear-stained letters, ticket stubs, withered flowers, valentines....We told each other the stories behind every one of those scribbled scraps. \\"And, god,\\" we'd find ourselves saying, \\"he made the most incredible vinaigrette . . . . \\" We never made it outside to our own barbecue. We've pretty much been in our rooms since then, pecking away at this book like crazy people, the floors littered with old letters, our hands covered in rubber cement. We were driven, obsessed, compulsively determined to bring you The Ex-Boyfriend Cookbook. And voila! Here it is! Now that the book is out, we're starting to let our imaginations take hold of us again. We've got all sorts of ideas. Like maybe we could spend a year letting a different man cook us dinner every night. We'd bring along cameras, collect artifacts from the evening like budding archaeologists, and select the best dishes for a sequel!

In contrast to the current military posture calling for the United States to be capable of waging two Desert Storm-like wars at a time, he argues for a \\"Desert Storm plus Desert Shield plus Bosnia peacekeeping\\" capability as well as selected economies in weapons modernization programs to save a total of $15 billion a year.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gbChEf0ZIH0C&dq=How+to+Be+a+Cheap+Hawk:+The+1999+and+2000+Defense+Budgets+(Studies+in+Foreign+Policy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sugar Blues","description":"It's a prime ingredient in countless substances from cereal to soup, from cola to coffee.

This book stands at the crossroads of different disciplines and combines their approaches  particularly the history of science, the history of philosophy, contemporary philosophy of science, and intellectual and cultural history. It brings together over 100 philosophers, historians of science, historians of mathematics, and medicine offering a comprehensive view of early modern philosophy and the sciences.

At the heart of their work are richly annotated lists of read-alouds for a variety of purposes. The authors' intimate knowledge and experience with these books make the annotations sing. - Lucy Calkins Open this book and invite the richness, the excitement of story and poetry into your classroom every single day. Take note, chapter by chapter, of the endless possibilities and ways to steer your students toward the powerful enchantment of books. Laminack and Wadsworth ask you to never forget \\"the power of literacy in the lives of learners,\\" and this book will serve as a perfect reminder, time and time again. - Rebecca Kai Dotlich, author of Lemonade Sun and Other Poems of Summer The read-aloud of yesteryear was often limited in its ambition and application - a well-intended routine for getting students' attention or settling them down. But today's read-aloud is a vibrant, deliberate part of good teaching, an essential, effective strategy for introducing sophisticated ideas to young learners throughout the school day by immersing them in rich language and literate behaviors. The influence of reading aloud can be profound, and Learning Under the Influence of Language and Literature shows you how to plan for and implement the read-aloud for maximum instructional effect. Learning Under the Influence of Language and Literature revolutionizes the read-aloud. Lester Laminack and Reba Wadsworth lay out six types of read-alouds each of which targets key instructional goals, including: addressing standards in the curriculum building community demonstrating the craft of writing enriching vocabulary enticing children to read independently modeling fluent reading. Whether you read aloud once a day, or six times a day, Laminack and Wadsworth give you all the strategies you need to make the read-aloud a successful and effective way to lead your students to new understandings. You'll discover how, why, and when to read aloud, and find both specific suggestions for planning instruction around it and numerous ideas for entry points into it. Best of all, they provide an extensively annotated list of four hundred titles to use with each of the six types of read-aloud, including ample suggestions for how each fits within the reading and writing curriculum.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cz0QAQAAMAAJ&dq=Learning+Under+the+Influence+of+Language+and+Learning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God Left Us Alone Here: A Book of War","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tgzePAAACAAJ&dq=God+Left+Us+Alone+Here:+A+Book+of+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Patent Piracy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XGtBAQAAIAAJ&dq=Patent+Piracy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Torque-Tension Testing and Evaluation of Fastener Finishes (Sae/Uscar-11 December 1998)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tGjWPgAACAAJ&dq=Torque-Tension+Testing+and+Evaluation+of+Fastener+Finishes+(Sae/Uscar-11+December+1998)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Preludes (Urtext)","description":"19 Little Preludes from \\"Little Clavier Book\\" for Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, \\"Six Little Preludes for Beginners\\" and other sources.

Beautiful Helen Forsythe marries into a family beset by a strange history. Her love for her handsome and charismatic husband, Sir Gavin French, is bedeviled by her suspicions of his liaison with an attractive Goanese woman and a growing presentiment that something evil is shadowing her family's life. The splendours and barbarity of the Indian scene; the social whirl of the British, living in the splendid isolation of the Raj; the opulence and intrigue of the Nawab's Court, to which her husband is appointed British Resident; and the machinations of a sinister Cult of Kali; are the rich tapestry against which the characters in this novel live their lives. Their often turbulent emotions are reflected in the simmering unrest of the Indian people, themselves; a discontent, which in 1857, erupts in the horrors of the Indian Mutiny. Torn by misunderstanding and despite their strong emotional chemistry, Helen and Gavin face many problems before, perhaps too late, they acknowledge their deep love for each other.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=InpHPQAACAAJ&dq=THE+CURSE+OF+KALI:+Historical+Drama+set+in+India&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outlines of a philosophy of religion: Based on psychology and history","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Battling Through Life: The Story of Filomena Danisi","description":"Battling Through Life is a moving, touching, funny, and sometimes painful revelation of the trials and tribulations Filomena and her family have faced in trying to deal and cope with an insidious disease, Friedreich's ataxia (a slowly progressive neuromuscular disease which also has the medical community struggling to come to terms with what it doesn't know).

It is a story of men in action--some four thousand of them--and how they lived and fought as a magnificent combat team. Ken Jones not only records their heroic deeds but helps explain what prompted those deeds, including the leadership qualities that fired the men into action. In doing so he brings to life the outfit's fighting spirit--that mysterious combination of qualities inspired by great leaders that wins battles--and the man who led them. Commodore Arleigh Burke was the right man at the right place at the right time; his leadership fused the squadron into a superb combat organization. This book offers a vivid account of the fighting in the South Pacific during one of the most crucial periods of the war. In authentic, minute-by-minute detail drawn from once-secret documents, Jones describes the battles of Tassafaronga, Savo Island, Empress Augusta Bay, and Cape St. George. But the focus throughout is on the men as they meet the test of battle with a common bravery as staunch as any in the Navy's annals. No squadron in any navy is said to have won more battle honors in less time than the Fighting Twenty-third.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r149BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Autobiographical Study (The International Psycho-Analytical Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J21-AAAAMAAJ&dq=An+Autobiographical+Study+(The+International+Psycho-Analytical+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Stillness at Appomattox (THE GREAT MASTERWORKS OF HISTORY - THE FRENCH EMPIRE BINDING)","description":"John Wilmerding was curator of American art and senior curtor 1977-1983 and deputy director 1983-1988, at the National Gallery of Art.

Campbell writes about his life growing up poor in Amite County, Mississippi, during the 1930s alongside his older brother, Joe. Though they grew up in a close-knit family and cared for each other, the two went on to lead very different lives. After serving together in World War II, Will became a highly educated Baptist minister who later became a major figure in the early years of the civil rights movement, and Joe became a pharmacist who developed a substance abuse problem that ultimately took his life. Brother to a Dragonfly also serves as a historical record. Though Will's love and dedication to his brother are the primary story, interwoven throughout the narrative is the story of the Jim Crow South and the civil rights movement. Will is present through many of the most pivotal moments in history--he was one of four people who escorted black students integrating the Little Rock public schools; he was the only white person present at the founding of the SCLC; he helped CORE and SNCC Freedom Riders integrate interstate bus travel; he joined Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign of boycotts, sit-ins, and marches in Birmingham; and he was at the Lorraine Motel the night Dr. King was assassinated. Will's accomplishments, however, never take the spotlight from his brother, and as his relationship with Joe evolves, so does Will's faith. Featuring a new foreword by Congressman John Lewis, this book brings back to print the combined lives of Will Campbell--Will the brother and Will the preacher.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BHlQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Scofield Study Bible, New King James Version","description":"Packed with new supplementary materials, each ScofieldRG Study Bible is durable and made to withstand daily use.

Capturing the jazz rhythms and desperate gaiety that defined the era, Meade gives us Parker, Fitzgerald, Millay, and Ferber, traces the intersections of their lives, and describes the men (F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edmund Wilson, Harold Ross, and Robert Benchley) who influenced them, loved them, and sometimes betrayed them. Here are the social and literary triumphs (Parker's Round Table witticisms appeared almost daily in the newspapers and Ferber and Millay won Pulitzer Prizes) and inevitably the penances each paid: crumbled love affairs, abortions, depression, lost beauty, nervous breakdowns, and finally, overdoses and even madness. These literary heroines did what they wanted, said what they thought, living wholly in the moment. They kicked open the door for twentieth-century women writers and set a new model for every woman trying to juggle the serious issues of economic independence, political power, and sexual freedom. Meade recreates the excitement, romance, and promise of the 1920s, a decade celebrated for cultural innovation--the birth of jazz, the beginning of modernism--and social and sexual liberation, bringing to light, as well, the anxiety and despair that lurked beneath the nonstop partying and outrageous behavior. A vibrant mixture of literary scholarship, social history, and scandal, BOBBED HAIR AND BATHTUB GIN is a rich evocation of a period that will forever intrigue and captivate us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hQFrdKhzHrUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Internet Economy: Technology and Practice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OIOBQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Internet+Economy:+Technology+and+Practice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Milagros de Nuestra Senora","description":"PR LOGO MILAGROS DE NUESTRA SE?ORA por Gonzalo de Berceo Introducci n I.

After finishing her course in Romania, she ended up in Washington, D.C. where she worked and lived for many years. During those years, travel continued to be an important part of her life personally and professionally.

Because of God s gracious covenant with Israel, manifested in election and the provision of atoning sacrifices, one could be righteous under the law despite occasional failures to obey the law perfectly. This view concludes that Paul, as a first-century Jew, could not have been troubled by the law s stringent demands, because it was generally understood that the gracious framework of the covenant provided a way of dealing with occasional lapses. Consequently, it is claimed, Paul s problem with the law must have to do with its misuse as a means of enforcing ethnic boundaries and excluding Gentile believers. However, as Das demonstrates in this book, whenever the gracious framework of covenantal nomism is called into question, the law s demands take on central importance. Das traces this development in a number of second-temple Jewish works and especially in the writings of Paul. Covenantal nomism is probably an apt characterization of Paul s opponents, and indeed of Paul s past life; thus he can assert that formerly he was blameless under the law. But now Paul sees God s grace as active only in Christ. He emphatically denies that God will show special grace in his judgment of Jews; to do so would be favoritism. Similarly, Paul sees no atoning benefit to the sacrificial system. In effect, Paul is no longer a covenantal nomist. Since the gracious framework of the covenant has collapsed, all that remains for Paul is the law, with its oppressive requirement of perfect obedience and ethnic exclusivism. Contra the \\"newperspective,\\" the \\"works of the law\\" should not be construed so narrowly as only the law's ethnic exclusivity. Christ is \\"the end\\" of the law in general, both in the sense that he is the goal to which the law always pointed, and in that he is the sole agent of God's grace apart from which the law's demands would be impossible.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hnwRAQAAIAAJ&dq=Paul,+the+Law,+and+the+Covenant&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Are Your Employees Stealing You Blind?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JX7SPAAACAAJ&dq=Are+Your+Employees+Stealing+You+Blind%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jewish Marriage Contract: a Study in Status of the Woman in Jewish Law","description":"Epstein, Louis M.

Mom,  I said to her,  isn t that kind of pathetic?   Well, it s realistic.  It s her thirty-sixth birthday, and she really thought things would be different this year that she d have figured out men and how to get along with her narcissistic parents enough to survive a birthday celebration. But nothing s changed. Her disappointing day is capped off by the delivery of a huge bouquet of flowers from Carl, with whom she has recently, and bitterly, split. A gesture of reconciliation? Of passive aggression? She s too unhinged to tell. It s My F---ing Birthday unfolds in seven state-of-my-life addresses this hapless high school art teacher writes to herself on consecutive birthdays, as she is determined to break the patterns of behavior that are keeping her down. Her objective: to avoid making the same mistakes over and over and start making some new ones. Through seven outrageously funny years of needling parents, self-absorbed boyfriends, riots, O.J., and Monica and bigger and bigger bouquets from Carl she navigates a circuitous (and ultimately successful) route to happiness in a world where everything seems to conspire to the contrary. What I Learned This Year That I Need to Remember 1. No more taking the bait from Mom. Even if the fight becomes about not taking the bait. 2. No more dwelling in the past. 3. Try much harder to continue being a vegetarian. This will limit the restaurants the folks can take me to. 4. No more trying to decode the flowers from Carl. If he sends them again, just think of them as a fun, free thing, like a little sample box of cereal or detergent that suddenly appears in the mailbox. 5. Don t make a big deal out of the fact that there were no guys this year. Perhaps that s a better thing than continuing to get involved with guys who exhibit behavior from the beginning that indicates the whole thing is completely hopeless. So try to remember the above as a coping strategy when I am so crazed with horniness that I want to throw myself off a building. 6. No more mumbo jumbo. This means no more calling 900 astrology numbers listed at the end of horoscopes in women s magazines to find out my love forecast.

For that reason, Weaver's study of oilfield labor during the industry's first half century in Texas is indeed welcome....as a substantial contribution to both labor history and the history of the American petroleum industry.\\" ---Diana Hinton, J. Conrad Dunagan Chair in Regional and Business History, University of Texas of the Permian Basin \\"Oilfield Trash is written in a charming, flowing style that any reader will enjoy....In Weaver's capable hands, the gypsy lives of a generation of young men unfold on the rigorous stage of drilling fields....\\"---Paul Spellman, author of Spindletop Boom Days When the first gusher blew in at Spindletop, near Beaumont, Texas, in 1901, petroleum began to supplant cotton and cattle as the economic engine of the state and region. Very soon, much of the workforce migrated from the cotton field to the oilfield, following the lure of the wealth being created by black gold. The early decades of the twentieth century witnessed the development of an oilfield culture, as these workers defined and solidified their position within the region's social fabric. Over time, the work force grew more professionalized, and technological change attracted a different type of laborer. Bobby D. Weaver grew up and worked in the oil patch. Now, drawing on oral histories supplemented and confirmed by other research, he tells the colorful stories of the workers who actually brought oil wealth to Texas. Drillers, shooters, toolies, pipeliners, teamsters, roustabouts, tank builders, roughnecks... each of them played a role in the frenzied, hard-driving lifestyle of the boomtowns that sprouted overnight in association with each major oil discovery. Weaver tracks the differences between company workers and contract workers. He details the work itself and the ethos that surrounds it. He highlights the similarities and differences from one field to another and traces changing aspects of the work over time. Above all, Oilfield Trash captures the unique voices of the laboring people who worked long, hard hours, often risking life and limb to keep the drilling rigs \\"turning to the right.\\" Scholars and historians of labor and industry will glean new insights from this important book. General readers, especially those interested in oil history, will delight in Weaver's lively recounting of the hardships, dangers, and rewards that shaped and defined those who worked for a living in the oil patch.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZcVrTPmYY4YC&dq=Oilfield+Trash:+A+Walk+in+the+Patch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thomas Jefferson: An Anthology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yyzHzgEACAAJ&dq=Thomas+Jefferson:+An+Anthology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smooth Selling","description":"This entertaining and valuable how to will introduce readers to a field-tested sales program that can shave years off the learning process.

Dichter has worked in the field of international development, managing and evaluating projects for nongovernmental organizations, directing a Peace Corps country programme, and serving as a consultant for such agencies as USAID, UNDP, and the World Bank. On the basis of this experience, he has become an outspoken critic of what he terms the \\"international poverty alleviation society\\". He believes that efforts to reduce world poverty have been well-intentioned but largely ineffective. On the whole the development industry has failed to serve the needs of the people it has sought to help.; To make his case Dichter reviews the major trends in development assistance from the 1960s through to the 1990s, illustrating his analysis with 18 short stories based on his own experiences in the field. The analytic chapters are therefore grounded in the daily life of development workers as described in the stories. Dichter shows how the development organizations have often become caught up in their own self-perpetuation and in public relations efforts designed to create an illusion of effectiveness. Tracing the evolution of the role of money (as opposed to ideas) in development assistance, he suggests how financial imperatives have reinforced the tendency to sponsor time-bound projects, creating a dependency among aid recipients. He also examines the rise of careerism and increased bureaucratization in the industry, arguing that assistance efforts have become disconnected from important lessons learned on the ground.; Ultimately, Dichter calls for a more light-handed and artful approach to development assistance, with fewer agencies and experts involved. His stance is pragmatic, rather than ideological or political. What matters, he says, is what works, and he maintains that the current practices of the development industry are simply not effective.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O___vQEACAAJ&dq=Despite+Good+Intentions:+Why+Development+Assistance+to+the+Third+World+Has+Failed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Symbols of Tibetan Buddhism","description":"Based on the author's previous publication The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs, this handbook contains an array of symbols and motifs, accompanied by succinct explanations.

The catalyst of war provided the swiftest impetus to this evolution. The new mechanized armies existing from the later period of World War I onward seized on the fresh technology and sought to squeeze every possible drop of advantage from it that the limits of science and the era's materials would allow. Many military thinkers and even aeronautical enthusiasts believed that blimps would remain the chief military aerial asset more or less forever. These men thought airplanes would play a secondary role at best, and might even prove a uselessly expensive gimmick soon to fade back into obscurity, leaving the majestic bulk of the dirigible as sole master of the skies. Thus, when World War I began, airplane improvements occurred in an ad hoc, almost accidental manner during the war. However, when pilots' mounting of armaments on airplanes proved a successful means of defeating other aircraft and even attacking men on the ground, a much more active and systematic development of warplanes began across the continent. Each advance prompted a countermeasure, as the two sides strove for primacy in a deadly, unforgiving environment which rewarded real advances in equipment and tactics with survival and punished poor ideas with death. Before long, relatively powerful, heavily armed aircraft buzzed through the skies over battle-stained Europe, tearing each other apart with furious gusts of machine gun fire and sending many of the vaunted dirigibles plunging, burning, to the ground. The new era of fighting aircraft arrived in dramatic fashion, raising successful pilots to celebrity or heroic status, and laying the groundwork for the tremendous potential of airpower to achieve its next logical expansion in World War II and beyond. By the time World War II arrived, the fighter airplane appeared as a much different beast than the purpose-built aircraft-hunting machines of 1917 and 1918. Though propellers still provided motive force, greatly increased engine power allowed these aircraft to slice through the sky at speeds of 200 mph, 300 mph, or even in excess of 400 mph when flying flat-out. Service ceilings jumped to 25,000 feet, 30,000 feet, or higher, altitudes unthinkable to World War I's aviators. Engineering and research and development began working scientifically to shave time off the climb rate and address a host of other problems and possibilities. At the start of the war, as the German Luftwaffe first flew against Poland and then the Royal Air Force, aircraft were already swift, metal-skinned hunter-killers in the sky, with enclosed cockpits, armor, and powerful loadouts of machine guns, 20mm cannons, and, soon, rockets. But an even bigger transformation awaited - the birth of the jet age, a future glimpsed briefly in the spectacular but doomed appearance of the Messerschmitt Me 262 near the war's end.

Anthony Boucher was a literary renaissance man: an Edgar Awardwinning mystery reviewer, an esteemed editor of the Hugo Awardwinning Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, a prolific scriptwriter of radio mystery programs, and an accomplished writer of mystery, science fiction, fantasy, and horror. With a particular fondness for the locked room mystery, Boucher created such iconic sleuths as Los Angeles PI Fergus O Breen, amateur sleuth Sister Ursula, and alcoholic ex-cop Nick Noble. When Metropolis Pictures announces plans to make a movie out of an Arthur Conan Doyle classic, it triggers outrage from a group of Sherlock Holmes fans called the Baker Street Irregulars. In hopes of calming their protest, the studio invites the five members to advise on the film, and even throws them a celebration in a house numbered 221B. Also on the guest list is Los Angeles police detective A. Jackson. He was hoping to spend his night off hanging out at a Hollywood party with his brother, Paul, the famous actor. Instead he finds himself in one of the most bizarre murder cases he s ever encountered, complete with cryptograms and a disappearing corpse, all of which results in a  delightfully farcical narrative, which offers a surprise on nearly every page  (The New York Times Book Review).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hw2EDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FIRE & BRONZE:A NOVEL OF CARTH","description":"In the bestselling tradition of Brene Brown s Daring Greatly and Nick Vujicic s Life Without Limits comes a rousing 7-step plan for living a life on fire, filled with hope and possibility from an inspirational speaker who survived a near-fatal fire at the age of nine and now runs a successful business inspiring people all around the world. When John O Leary was nine years old, he was almost killed in a devastating house fire. With burns on one hundred percent of his body, O Leary mustered an almost unimaginable amount of inner strength just to survive the ordeal. The insights he gained through this experience and the heroes who stepped into his life to help him through the journey his family, the medical staff, and total strangers changed his life. Now he is committed to living life to the fullest and inspiring others to do the same. An incredible and emotionally honest account of triumph over tragedy, On Fire contains O Leary s reflections on being that little boy, the life-giving choices made then, and the resulting lessons he learned. O Leary very clearly shares that without the right people providing the right guidance, at the right time, he never would have made it through those five months in the hospital, let alone the years that followed as he struggled to regain mobility, embrace his story, and ignite clarity of his life s purpose. On Fire encourages us to seize the power to choose our path and transform our lives from mundane to extraordinary. Once we stop thinking solely on the big moments in our lives, we can begin to focus on those smaller opportunities that tend to pass us by. These are the events the inflection points in our lives that can determine how we feel about life now, where we are headed in the future, and how many lives we can impact along the way. We can t always choose the path we walk, but we can choose how we walk it. Empowering, inspiring, remarkably honest, and heartfelt, O Leary s strength and incredible spirit shine through on every page.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FlwJCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Aromatherapy Kit","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Cq7CXwAACAAJ&dq=The+Aromatherapy+Kit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"First Experiences (Usborne First Experiences)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Business Structures","description":"Invaluable Insight into LLCs Featuring updated forms and financial templates now available via download, this comprehensive toolkit provides step-by-step instructions for planning, organizing, forming, operating and maintaining a limited liability company (LLC) in any state.

Now Stephen R. Bokenkamp introduces the reader to ancient scriptures never before published in the West, providing a systematic and easily accessible introduction to early Daoism (c. 2nd-6th C.E.). Representative works from each of the principal Daoist traditions comprise the basic structure of the book, with each chapter accompanied by an introduction that places the material within a historical and cultural context. Included are translations of the earliest Daoist commentary to Laozi's Daode jing (Tao Te Ching); historical documents relating the history of the early Daoist church; a petitioning ritual used to free believers from complaints brought against them by the dead; and two complete scriptures, one on individual meditation practice and another designed to rescue humanity from the terrors of hell through recitation of its powerful charms. In addition, Bokenkamp elucidates the connections Daoism holds with other schools of thought, particularly Confucianism and Buddhism. This book provides a much-needed introduction to Daoism for students of religion and is a welcome addition for scholars wishing to explore Daoist sacred literature. It serves as an overview to every aspect of early Daoist tradition and all the seminal practices which have helped shape the religion as it exists today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qngJspoY3TMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Top TV recipes: Tried and tested in the WFMY-TV studio kitchen","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tLX1GwAACAAJ&dq=Top+TV+recipes:+Tried+and+tested+in+the+WFMY-TV+studio+kitchen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Junkman and Oter Stories","description":"Junkman and Other Stories brings into razorsharp focus life lived on the edge.

One, headquartered in London, subscribes to and promotes an idolatrous and pantheistic view of the world. It is monarchist, capitalistic, wealthy, right-wing. The other, in Paris, is atheistic and humanistic in origin and outlook. It is republican, socialist, poor, left-wing. One is Scarlet. The other, the Beast. The breakthrough theory which I have developed with Scripture as my guide makes sense of the massive literature I have collected on Freemasonry as well as its apparent contradictions. My library includes books written by members of and defectors from both English and French Freemasonry. At the beginning of my research, like many other revisionist authors, I thought revisionist authors were reporting one single plot. I gradually realized that many authors were exposing what in reality were often the machinations of one group of conspirators against the other. The devices of both wings of Masonry were so similar that without Scripture as a guide, one could easily perceive only a single intrigue. This interesting twist in the historical drama, confirmed again and again by my research, points to the existence of a struggle between the two powers in Freemasonry. Although revisionist authors are supposedly concerned about one plot, I noticed that all exposes pointed to Paris as the center of an intrigue before World War I. After the War, however, evidence points to the shift of intrigue to London. I will explain this shift in the course of this book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z2mxvAEACAAJ&dq=Scarlet+and+the+Beast:+A+History+of+the+War+Between+English+and+French+Freemasonary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cottage Cheese and Cancer: And Other Things Your Doctor Does Not Tell You","description":"The statements about essential fats or the life threatening effects of certain fats and their significance for the cancer problem lead to a collision with prevailing opinion.

Reik establishes the theme of this work in the following way: \\"The sex urge hunts for lustful pleasure; love is in search of joy and happiness.\\" Over a third of this volume had never been published in book form before it originally appeared half a century ago. Its appearance in paperback, for the first time, is a welcome addition to current debates, liberated from ideological and political constraints. The first part of the book is so far ahead of its time that it is still current. It reveals Reik's departure from Freud's theories and from those of most of his contemporaries in psychology and psychoanalysis. Part Two is a greatly abbreviated version of Masochism in Modern Man, retaining those parts with a direct bearing on the subject of this volume. Part Three offers two essays on why people remain single. In the author's usual direct style, they deal with the marriage shyness of the male and the psychological fears and resistance of both men and women to acceptance of the marriage bond. Part Four is Reik at his wisest. \\"The first lady whom I asked to read the manuscript said smilingly: 'Many of your impressions about us (women) are correct. No man should read the book!' A few seconds later, she said: 'Or rather, every man should read the book!'\\" As Paul Roazen noted, \\"in contrast to some of Freud's other followers, Reik was prescient early on in distinguishing self-love from narcissism. Reik believed that genuine self-regard was the ultimate basis for developing the capacity to love.\\" At times Reik seems to defend women, at times to critique them. Yet he writes with sympathy and understanding. He challenges other authorities who have written on the subject, but he also agrees with many of them. Love and Lustis civilized writing at its most provocative. Reik is authoritative, and his book reflects the glow of a rich personality. It is mellow, but uncompromising.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bKFptAEACAAJ&dq=Of+love+and+lust+%3B:+On+the+psychoanalysis+of+romantic+and+sexual+emotions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fantasy Line","description":"This line art coloring book includes 24 original traditionally hand drawn illustrations by the artist Christine Karron.

It begins with the introduction of the empresario system in Mexico in 1823, a system of land distribution to American farmers and ranchers in an attempt to strengthen the postwar economy following Mexico's independence from Spain. Once welcomed as fellow countrymen, the new settlers, homesteading on land destined to be called Texas, were viewed as enemies when in 1835 they revolted against the government's harsh Centralist rulings. Winning independence from Mexico and recognition from the United States as the independent Republic of Texas only intensified the Mexican refusal to accept their loss of Texas as legitimate. The final straw for both sides came when Texas was granted U.S. statehood and 11 American soldiers were ambushed and murdered. As a result, Congress declared war on Mexico, a bloody conflict that resulted in the U.S. gain of 525,000 square miles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OkRXAwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Mexican+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ten Poems to Change Your Life","description":"In this powerful book, Roger Housden harnesses the unique ability of poetry to touch the reader's inner-most feelings.

It highlights, in particular, the interrelated challenges of cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue and the way in which strong homogenizing forces are matched by persistent diversifying trends. The report proposes a series of ten policy-oriented recommendations, to the attention of States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, international and regional bodies, national institutions and the private sector on how to invest in cultural diversity. Emphasizing the importance of cultural diversity in different areas (languages, education, communication and new media development, and creativity and the marketplace) based on data and examples collected from around the world, the report is also intended for the general public. It proposes a coherent vision of cultural diversity and clarifies how, far from being a threat, it can become beneficial to the action of the international community.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KUU8HV3ruX8C&dq=Art+Culinaire+((The+International+Magazine+in+Good+Taste,+Volume+75))+%5BILLUSTRATED%5D+(Hardcover)+(Winter+issue+2004-2005)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let the Reader Understand: A Guide to Interpreting and Applying the Bible","description":"For many people, interpreting the Bible is the art of making it say what they want.

On Battle Hill, just outside London, a group of townspeople are performing a new play by Peter Stanhope. This hill, however, appears to be positioned at a pivotal place in space and time, as people from the past begin to appear and the townsfolk are transported either to heaven, or to hell. Charles Walter Stansby Williams (1886  1945) was a British theologian, novelist, poet, playwright, and literary critic. He was also a member of the  The Inklings , a literary discussion group connected to the University of Oxford, England. They were exclusively literary enthusiasts who championed the merit of narrative in fiction and concentrated on writing fantasy. He was given an scholarship to University College London, but was forced to leave in 1904 because he couldn't afford the tuition fees. Other notable works by this author include:  The Greater Trumps  (1932),  War in Heaven  (1930), and  The Place of the Lion  (1931). This volume is highly recommended for lovers of fantasy fiction, and it would make for a fantastic addition to any collection. Many vintage books such as this are increasingly scarce and expensive. It is with this in mind that we are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with the original text and artwork.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jAeWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beginning Slovak: A Course for the Individual or Classroom Learner","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6QVhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Beginning+Slovak:+A+Course+for+the+Individual+or+Classroom+Learner&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Down Among the Dead Men","description":"Michelle Williams is young and attractive, she has close family ties as well as a busy social life - but she is far from usual. She is a mortuary technician and her job involves dealing with those things in life that many people do not wish to experience directly. Yet life in the mortuary is neither gruesome nor sad. Told with good humour and common sense, we are introduced to a host of characters - the pathologists, many of them eccentric, some downright mad; the undertakers, the hospital porters and the man from the coroner's office who sings to Michelle every morning. The incidents too ensure that no two days are ever the same. From the tragic to the hilarious they include: The fitness fanatic who was run over as he did pressups in the road on a dark night The decapitated motorcyclist The guide dog who led his owner on to the railway tracks - and left him there The forty stone man for whom an entire refrigerated lorry had to be hired because he wouldn't fit in the mortuary cooler Over the course of her first year Michelle has to deal with situations and emotions that few of us will ever experience, and does so while retaining a sense of humour and a sense of perspective.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-xbBBAAAQBAJ&dq=Down+Among+the+Dead+Men&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Eye of Night","description":"From Pauline J.

In the North the Troubles rage. Cities and kings are being annihilated; the very earth is in upheaval, waking even the dead from their graves. All notions of time and space, of day and night, of seasonal change seem fractured beyond repair. But as the chaos moves slowly south, engulfing land after land, three unlikely heroes--an ex-priest, a battered serving girl, and an exquisitely beautiful, refined lady--journey bravely to the dying regions, their only weapon an enchanted stone of enigmatic power and ancient origin. Jereth, disillusioned with his faith in the Rising God and robbed of his family after a deadly shipwreck, struggles to find meaning in his blighted life, searching the devastated land without direction--until he meets two extraordinary women. Each has her own secrets to keep; both are on a quest to save the world. But they must first save themselves, conquering their demons and rousing their well-disguised strengths. Only then will it be revealed how three penniless, unarmed wanderers can light a darkening world.

In these essays, Williams, a renowned cultural critic, demonstrates how these key words take on new meanings and how these changes reflect the political bent and values of our past and current society. He chose words both essential and intangible--words like nature, underprivileged, industry, liberal, violence, to name a few--and, by tracing their etymology and evolution, grounds them in a wider political and cultural framework. The result is an illuminating account of the central vocabulary of ideological debate in English in the modern period. This edition features a new original foreword by Colin MacCabe, Distinguished Professor of English and Literature, University of Pittsburgh, that reflects on the significance of Williams' life and work. Keywords remains as relevant today as it was over thirty years ago, offering a provocative study of our language and an insightful look at the society in which we live.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E4PnCwAAQBAJ&dq=Keywords:+A+vocabulary+of+culture+and+society&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How To Hydroponics","description":"Explains how to operate a hydroponic garden, with detailed instructions, photographs, and step-by-step plans.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e5xLkJLTMygC&dq=How+To+Hydroponics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FrontPage 2000: The Complete Reference","description":"Published in preparation for the release of Microsoft's Office 2000 products, this text provides a comprehensive guide to all the features of FrontPage 2000.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QXasQgAACAAJ&dq=FrontPage+2000:+The+Complete+Reference&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"National Geographic June 1984","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PTDAjgEACAAJ&dq=National+Geographic+June+1984&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sharks over China: The 23rd Fighter Group in World War II","description":"Based on interviews with the group's survivors and containing numerous photographs, this is the first complete history of the unit that included Gen.

Once positioned at the center of the crown of King Solomon, it is a stone of astonishing and terrifying power, capable of good and evil alike. Anyone who touches it can move through time and space, perform miracles, and heal or kill. The stone can replicate itself, and does so during the course of Sir Giles s inhuman experiments, subsequently falling into numerous unworthy hands throughout England. There are those who will attempt to use the stone for personal gain, only to discover that it is they themselves being used by a power beyond their comprehension; some will find themselves trapped in eternally repeating nightmares from which there is no escape; still others will be freed from their earthly burdens. And so begins the battle between the forces of darkness and light for control of the most dangerous object in existence. A gripping metaphysical thriller by Charles Williams, who along with C. S. Lewis, Owen Barfield, and J. R. R. Tolkien was one of Oxford s famed Inklings, Many Dimensions is at once a gripping supernatural adventure and a thought-provoking exploration of the good and evil that dwell in the heart of every human being.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KegVBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Symphonic Theology: The Validity of Multiple Perspectives in Theology","description":"The truth of God is rich and multifaceted. Though a coherent body of revelation, the Bible comes to us through a variety of inspired authors, metaphors, and themes highlighting the many facets of God's truth. Likewise, our theological formulations capture manifold emphases--distinct perspectives on the whole--which collectively enable us to gain a fuller understanding of the truth. Poythress explains, We use what we have gained from one perspective to reinforce, correct, or improve what we understood through another. I call this procedure 'symphonic theology' because it is analogous to a blending of various musical instruments to express the variation of a symphonic theme. The implications of this approach are far-reaching for theology and praxis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mDQGAAAACAAJ&dq=Symphonic+Theology:+The+Validity+of+Multiple+Perspectives+in+Theology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stewardess","description":"The empowering true story of a group of spirited stewardesses who  stood up to huge corporations and won, creating momentous change for all working women.  (Gloria Steinem, co-founder of Ms. magazine) It was the Golden Age of Travel, and everyone wanted in. As flying boomed in the 1960s, women from across the United States applied for jobs as stewardesses. They were drawn to the promise of glamorous jet-setting, the chance to see the world, and an alternative to traditional occupations like homemaking, nursing, and teaching. But as the number of  stews  grew, so did their suspicion that the job was not as picture-perfect as the ads would have them believe.  Sky girls  had to adhere to strict weight limits at all times; gain a few extra pounds and they d be suspended from work. They couldn t marry or have children; their makeup, hair, and teeth had to be just so. Girdles were mandatory while stewardesses were on the clock. And, most important, stewardesses had to resign at 32. Eventually the stewardesses began to push back and it s thanks to their trailblazing efforts in part that working women have gotten closer to workplace equality today. Nell McShane Wulfhart crafts a rousing narrative of female empowerment, the paradigm-shifting  60s and  70s, the labor movement, and the cadre of gutsy women who fought for their rights and won.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GSs5EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"View from the Medicine Lodge: Stories from the American Indian's Soul","description":"Eastman was a Native American physician, writer, national lecturer, and reformer.

Here, in a letter of her own, Lee Smith explains how she was inspired to write this celebrated epistolary novel: Dear Friends, Like me, you probably get Christmas letters every year. I read every word and save every letter. Because every Christmas letter is the story of a life, and what story can be more interesting than the story of our lives? Often, it is the story of an entire family. But you also have to read between the lines with Christmas letters. Sometimes, what is not said is even more important than what is on the page. In The Christmas Letters, I have used this familiar format to illumine the lives, hopes, dreams, and disappointments of three generations of American women. Much of the story of The Christmas Letters is also told through shared recipes. As Mary, my favorite character, says, \\"I feel as if I have written out my life story in recipes! The Cool Whip and mushroom soup years, the hibachi and fondue period, then the quiche and crepes phase, and now it's these salsa years.\\" I wrote this little book for the same reason I write to my friends and relatives every holiday--Christmas letters give us a chance to remember and celebrate who we are.

As Walter Kaufmann, one of the world s leading authorities on Nietzsche, notes in his introduction,  Few writers in any age were so full of ideas,  and few writers have been so consistently misinterpreted. The Portable Nietzsche includes Kaufmann s definitive translations of the complete and unabridged texts of Nietzsche s four major works: Twilight of the Idols, The Antichrist, Nietzsche Contra Wagner and Thus Spoke Zarathustra. In addition, Kaufmann brings together selections from his other books, notes, and letters, to give a full picture of Nietzsche s development, versatility, and inexhaustibility.  In this volume, one may very conveniently have a rich review of one of the most sensitive, passionate, and misunderstood writers in Western, or any, literature.

Wine-making has become ever-more unnatural, from the use of blanket crop-spraying in vineyards, to the over-use of sulfites and additives in the cellar, but luckily there is another way, as Master of Wine Isabelle Legeron explains. Isabelle, who campaigns for natural wine around the world and runs the hugely successful RAW wine fairs in London, Berlin and New York, reveals why the finest, most authentic wines are those made naturally. While currently not regulated by an official definition, natural wines are made from sustainably farmed, organic (or biodynamic) grapes, with nothing removed or added during winemaking, bar at most a dash of sulfites. It is good old-fashioned grape juice fermented into wine  just as nature intended. If you care about what s in your glass, want to explore unique flavours, or are keen to support small-scale producers, then you need to know more about natural wine, and where to find it. The second edition of this consumer guide to natural wine has been fully updated, and explains the processes involved, introduces you to some of the growers, and suggests over 140 of the best wines for you to try.  A joyous celebration of all that Legeron believes is good and pure in the world of wine and wine production.

Extinct Animals portrays over 60 remarkable animals that have been lost forever during the relatively recent geological past. Each entry provides a concise discussion of the history of the animal how and where it lived, and how it became extinct as well as the scientific discovery and analysis of the creature. In addition, this work examines what led to extinction from the role of cyclical swings in the Earth's climate to the spread of humans and their activities. Many scientists believe that we are in the middle of a mass extinction right now, caused by the human undermining of the earth's complex systems that support life. Understanding what caused the extinction of animals in the past may help us understand and prevent the extinction of species in the future. Extinct Animals examines the biology and history of some of the most interesting creatures that have ever lived, including: The American Terror Bird, which probably became extinct over 1 million years ago, who were massive predators, some of which were almost 10 feet tall; the Rocky Mountain Locust, last seen in 1902, formed the most immense animal aggregations ever known, with swarms estimated to include over 10 trillion insects; the Giant Ground Sloth, which was as large as an elephant; and the Neandertals, the first Europeans, which co-existed with prehistoric Homo sapiens. Extinct Animals includes illustrations many created for the work that help the reader visualize the extinct creature, and each entry concludes with a list of resources for those who wish to do further research.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JZJxDwAAQBAJ&dq=Extinct+animals,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Twelve Dancing Princesses","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xfTkjwEACAAJ&dq=The+Twelve+Dancing+Princesses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Next of Kin: SF Classic No 13","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IbIPAQAAMAAJ&dq=Next+of+Kin:+SF+Classic+No+13&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Family Communication (Routledge Communication Series)","description":"This third edition of Family Communication carefully examines state-of-the art research and theories of family communication and family relationships.

It was not until she hit her mid-seventies that she realized she had packed sneakers to climb Mount Everest, not anticipating the crevices and chasms that constitute the rocky terrain of old age. The professional gerontological and social work literature offered little help, so she turned to the late-life works of beloved women authors who had bravely climbed the mountain and sent back news from the summit. Maya Angelou, Colette, Simone de Beauvoir, Joan Didion, Marguerite Duras, M. F. K. Fisher, Doris Lessing, Mary Oliver, Adrienne Rich, May Sarton, and Florida Scott-Maxwell were among the many guides she turned to for inspiration. In The Lioness in Winter, Burack-Weiss blends an analysis of key writings from these and other famed women authors with her own wisdom to create an essential companion for older women and those who care for them. She fearlessly examines issues such as living with loss, finding comfort and joy in unexpected places, and facing disability and death. This book is filled with powerful passages from women who turned their experiences of aging into art, and Burack-Weiss ties their words to her own struggles and epiphanies, framing their collective observations with key insights from social work practice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FpmACgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries: A True Story of Friends, Neighbors, and Murder in a Small Town","description":"Explores the 1984 Florida rape-murder of artist Karen Gregory and the ensuing events, including the effects on her family and boyfriend, and the investigation by Larry Tosi police detective, who began to realize that he was hunting one of his own neighbors for the crime.

Confronted with a world in which too much is changing too fast, the attitude of most British critics is simply to ignore the fact that today's culture is in a state of constant ebullience and continue turning out, or churning out, week after week, month after month, the kind of article, a complacent conflation of artistic impressions, that could have been written thirty, fifty or a hundred years ago. Gilbert Adair is a critic with a difference. Witty, perspicacious and in love with language, he is prepared to engage with the multifarious realities of our culture - culture in the least restricted sense of the word. He is prepared to embrace them, if not unconditionally, then at least without encumbering hinself with any twinges of nostalgia for the past's redundant credos and repertories. The essays which make up this collection - on subjects as various as postmodernism and pop music, AIDS and art movies, Tintin and the Titanic - thus constitute a uniquely stimulating record of the nineties and, like the cool, glinting surfaces of a Calder mobile, reflect the most significant fragments of our cultural agenda.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SYoQBQAAQBAJ&dq=Surfing+the+Zeitgeist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Among the farmyard people,","description":"This book is one of the classic book of all time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8VxGswEACAAJ&dq=Among+the+farmyard+people,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Berlin N-54: A story about life in Berlin, Germany from the 1920s through the end of World War II","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pK3lswEACAAJ&dq=Berlin+N-54:+A+story+about+life+in+Berlin,+Germany+from+the+1920s+through+the+end+of+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A World Waiting to be Born: Civility Rediscovered","description":"Just as The Road Less Traveled provided hope and guidance for individuals seeking growth, this major new work by M.

This copiously illustrated investigation begins by examining the intellectual world of the Stoics, who originated the phrases \\"seeds of virtue\\" and \\"seeds of knowledge.\\" Tracing the interrelated history of the Stoic cluster of epistemological images for natural law within humanity--reason, common notions, sparks, and seeds--Horowitz presents the distinctive versions within the competing movements of Hellenistic Judaism and early Christianity, Augustinian and Thomist theologies, Christian mysticism and Kabbalah, and Erasmian Catholicism and the Lutheran Reformation. She demonstrates how the Ciceronian and Senecan analogies between horticulture and culture--basic to Italian Renaissance humanists, artists, and neo- Platonists--influence the emergence of emblems and essays among participants in the Northern Renaissance neo-Stoic movement. The Stoic metaphor is still visible today in ecumenical movements that use vegetative language to encourage the growth of shared values and to promote civic virtues: organizations disseminate information on nipping bad habits in the bud and on turning a new leaf. The author's evidence of illustrated pages from medieval, Renaissance, and Enlightenment texts will stimulate contemporary readers to evaluate her discovery of \\"the premodern scientific paradigm that the mind develops like a plant.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XQoN_eo0p5AC&dq=New+Dictionary+of+the+History+of+Ideas+(6+Volume+Set)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How History Made the Mind: The Cultural Origins of Objective Thinking","description":"This book argues that ?reason,  or ?objective thinking,  is not a natural product of an enlarged brain or of innate biological tendencies, but a way of learning that contradicts the natural characteristics of being an animal, a mammal, and a primate.

Under the President's 1996 budget plan, it will decline by just as great a percentage as defense between 1990 and 2002 and by substantially more than defense over the 1980-2002 period. No other major category of federal spending will undergo a real cut over either time period. The shrinking budget, totaling about $19 billion in 1997, will still have to fund the State Department, international broadcasting and educational exchanges, trade subsidies and investment guarantees for U.S. business overseas; United Nations operations including peacekeeping, and all types of foreign assistance. In this book, O'Hanlon and Graham focus primarily on this last component of international spending. Specifically, they analyze U.S. official development assistance (ODA) to poor countries. The authors place U.S. ODA in a broad historical, international, and economic perspective. They then recommend an alternative approach to ODA for the United States as well as other donors. They favor continuing to provide humanitarian and grass-roots aid to most poor countries, but providing ODA to promote macroeconomic growth only to those countries that maintain coherent, market-oriented economic policy frameworks. The authors argue that to provide effective aid, as well as to maintain U.S. leadership in world affairs, net resources for ODA and the international account need to increase only modestly.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=klJyIIf73JkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Day Care Deception: What the Child Care Establishment Isn't Telling Us","description":"The central issue of daycare is often framed in a way that pits working moms against stay-at-home moms, and feminists against traditional families.
