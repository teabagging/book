As Pulitzer Prize- and National Book Award-winning author James MacGregor Burns and acclaimed historian Susan Dunn follow the evolution of the Roosevelt political philosophy, they illuminate how Theodore's example of dynamic leadership would later inspire the careers of his distant cousin Franklin and his niece Eleanor, who together forged a progressive political legacy that reverberated throughout the world. Theodore, Franklin, and Eleanor Roosevelt led America through some of the most turbulent times in its history. The Three Roosevelts takes readers on an exhilarating voyage through these tumultuous decades of our nation's past, and these momentous events are seen through the Roosevelts' eyes, their actions, and their passions. Insightful and authoritative, this is a fascinating portrait of three of America's greatest leaders, whose legacy is as controversial today as their vigorous brand of forward-looking politics was in their own lifetimes. \\"A remarkable example of narrative and biographical history at its best.\\"   Bruce Clayton, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \\"No one has written more trenchantly about Franklin Roosevelt and American politics ... than James MacGregor Burns....\\"   H.

But when a tragic twist of fate leads her to the small mountain town of Dawson Mills, Tennessee, she soon learns that the dead don't always stay silent. Shadows begin to shift in the rambling, old Victorian farmhouse she's purchased. Voices come from nowhere. She can feel the eyes on her. Paul Bradford, a contractor who is bidding the renovation work on the house, believes it's more than just Allison's imagination conjuring up the paranormal activity. Toni Harper, a reporter for the local paper, concurs. She's heard snippets of hand-over-the-mouth gossip from some of the town's deputies who responded to calls in the middle of the night. Ghosts. Or so the former owner claimed in the few months before his death. The secrets they unearth rock Allison right down to the core.

Certainly, it is an account of punishment without crime - the first-person chronicle of life under Stalin in the 1930s and the Nazi invading army in the 1940s. Declared \\"enemies of the people\\" during the Stalinist purges, the eleven-year-old Helen Dmitriew and her family were forced from their home in the Smolensk district, stripped of their belongings, and transported in closed railroad cars to Siberia, where the family was separated. Dmitriew and her sick mother eventually found their way back from the Siberian wilderness, hiding in friendly homes or railroad cars, sleeping in dangerous forests, and concealing their \\"social origins\\" when interrogated by Soviet authorities. Although life in the general vicinity of Minsk returned to \\"normal\\" and Dmitriew earned her teacher's credentials and married, it was still characterized by deprivation, malnutrition, and sickness. She was reunited with her father in Leningrad only briefly, then never to see him (or ultimately any of her family members) again. During the Nazi invasion, when the Soviet armies fled in its path, her first husband was fatally shot by drunken German soldiers during \\"target practice\\". The next month she gave birth to her only daughter, whose survival today is hardly short of a miracle. Yet Dmitriew never gave up, never stopped helping other innocent victims of Soviet barbarity and Nazi cruelty, and eventually found herself assigned to a labor farm in Bavaria, which was eventually liberated by the American army. Here she also met her second husband, the survivor of two death sentences at the hands of the Soviet government. Together thisfugitive family successfully escaped the certain death of Soviet \\"repatriation\\", a program initially supported by the western allies, and managed to immigrate to Canada, where they began life again. Today Helen Dmitriew is a professor of Russian in Fresno, California, and her daughter is an insurance agent in Los Angeles. At a time when the former Soviet Union faces economic and social uncertainty, Dmitriew's life story of nerve, compassion, and survival is a living testament to Russian character and endurance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GltpAAAAMAAJ&dq=Surviving+the+Storms:+Memory+of+Stalin%27s+Tyranny&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Media at War: Communication and Conflict in the Twentieth Century","description":"Drawing on examples from 20th century conflicts, this study argues that the media's performance in wartime results as much from peacetime journalistic practices as from the special circumstances of war.

Saint John of the Cross is the great unknown of the Christian community. The last forty years have seen a growth in prayer methods and transcendental meditation. The search for a guide that teaches such prayer and meditation practices have led many seekers to the teachings of Saint John of the Cross. Like a song that sings the beauty of the creation in its sublime poems, the Saint teaches us that all of the beauty of creation is nothing in comparison with the beauty of the divine. In this book, Isa as A. Rodriguez does not pretend to be able to substitute Saint John in what he can teach us, but he helps us to understand what Saint John says to us, to discover the roads that he shows us, and to stay on course for our life pilgrimage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kkct2nA1Oa8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Listen & Learn Spanish (Manual Only)","description":" A memorable experience.

My Name is Esther Clara is an authentic account of 20th Century rural America audio- and videotaped by Esther Clara before her death in 1989 and adeptly reconstituted by her granddaughter, Laurel Johnson, author of the novel, The Alley of Wishes (Dandelion Books) and several other works of fiction and poetry. Writes Nancy Mehl, book reviewer for The Wichita Eagle and Midwest Book Review: \\"Laurel Johnson brings this story of her grandmother out of the shadowed past and into our hearts in this stunning and beautiful portrayal.

A battalion of Serbs has been senselessly murdered in Kosovo and the Green Berets stand accused. Now, Major Sean Drummond, a top Army lawyer, is assigned to investigate this unspeakable atrocity. But of course, no one saw anything. Drummond gets consistently suspicious depositions from all of the Green Berets: Supposedly pursued by Serb soldiers, they left the engagement with wounded Serbs firing at them, and no one can explain the number of deaths. Teamed with a straight-laced prosecutor and a sexy defense attorney, Drummond probes further but forces continue to hide the truth. Soon a reporter is found dead, Drummond suspects there's a traitor on his team, and everyone from the CIA to the president may be involved in a cover-up that could threaten the stability of the most powerful nation in theworld.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tZTUMZECPrsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Men in War","description":"In the grand tradition of John Keegan s enduring classic The Face of Battle comes a searing, unforgettable chronicle of war through the eyes of the American soldiers who fought in three of our most iconic battles: Bunker Hill, Gettysburg, and Iwo Jima. This is not a book about how great generals won their battles, nor is it a study in grand strategy. Men of War is instead a riveting, visceral, and astonishingly original look at ordinary soldiers under fire. Drawing on an immense range of firsthand sources from the battlefield, Alexander Rose begins by re-creating the lost and alien world of eighteenth-century warfare at Bunker Hill, the bloodiest clash of the War of Independence and reveals why the American militiamen were so lethally effective against the oncoming waves of British troops. Then, focusing on Gettysburg, Rose describes a typical Civil War infantry action, vividly explaining what Union and Confederate soldiers experienced before, during, and after combat. Finally, he shows how in 1945 the Marine Corps hurled itself with the greatest possible violence at the island of Iwo Jima, where nearly a third of all Marines killed in World War II would die. As Rose demonstrates, the most important factor in any battle is the human one: At Bunker Hill, Gettysburg, and Iwo Jima, the American soldier, as much as any general, proved decisive. To an unprecedented degree, Men of War brings home the reality of combat and, just as important, its aftermath in the form of the psychological and medical effects on veterans. As such, the book makes a critical contribution to military history by narrowing the colossal gulf between the popular understanding of wars and the experiences of the soldiers who fight them. Praise for Men of War  A tour de force . . . strikingly vivid, well-observed, and compulsively readable.  The Daily Beast  Military history at its best . . . This is indeed war up-close, as those who fought it lived it and survived it if they could. Men of War is deeply researched, beautifully written.  The Wall Street Journal  A brilliant, riveting, unique book . . . Men of War will be a classic.  General David H. Petraeus, U.S. Army (Retired)  The fact is that Men of War moves and educates, with the reader finding something interesting and intriguing on virtually every page.  National Review  This is a book that has broad value to a wide audience. Whether the reader aims to learn what actually happens in battle, draw on the military lessons within, or wrestle with what actually defines combat, Men of War is a valuable addition to our understanding of this all-too-human experience.  The New Criterion  A highly recommended addition to the literature of military history . . . [Rose] writes vividly and memorably, with a good eye for the telling detail or anecdote.  Kirkus Reviews (starred review)  Using the firsthand accounts of brave soldiers who fought for freedom, Rose sheds new light on viewpoints we haven t heard as widely before. It s a welcome perspective in an era where most people have no military experience to speak of.  The Washington Times  Rose poignantly captures the terror and confusion of hand-to-hand combat during the battle.  The Dallas Morning News  If you want to know the meaning of war at the sharp end, this is the book to read.

Will the AIDS epidemic have similar dramatic effects on the social and political landscape of the twenty-first century? This readable volume looks at the impact of AIDS since its emergence and suggests its effects in the next decade, when a million or more Americans will likely die of the disease. The Social Impact of AIDS in the United States addresses some of the most sensitive and controversial issues in the public debate over AIDS. This landmark book explores how AIDS has affected fundamental policies and practices in our major institutions, examining How America's major religious organizations have dealt with sometimes conflicting values: the imperative of care for the sick versus traditional views of homosexuality and drug use. Hotly debated public health measures, such as HIV antibody testing and screening, tracing of sexual contacts, and quarantine. The potential risk of HIV infection to and from health care workers. How AIDS activists have brought about major change in the way new drugs are brought to the marketplace. The impact of AIDS on community-based organizations, from volunteers caring for individuals to the highly political ACT-UP organization. Coping with HIV infection in prisons. Two case studies shed light on HIV and the family relationship. One reports on some efforts to gain legal recognition for nonmarital relationships, and the other examines foster care programs for newborns with the HIV virus. A case study of New York City details how selected institutions interact to give what may be a picture of AIDS in the future. This clear and comprehensive presentation will be of interest to anyone concerned about AIDS and its impact on the country: health professionals, sociologists, psychologists, advocates for at-risk populations, and interested individuals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h_udx9hESKgC&dq=Preaching+to+a+church+in+crisis:+a+homiletic+for+the+last+days+of+the+mainline+church.:+An+article+from:+Presbyterian+Record&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NORSE GODS AND HEROES ( Myths of the World )","description":"The actual myths are presented in this volume, along with the story of how these oral traditions were committed to paper.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rseb07kqdv0C&dq=NORSE+GODS+AND+HEROES+(+Myths+of+the+World+)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Value in the Valley: A Black Woman's Guide Through Life's Dilemmas","description":" The most powerful spiritual healer, fixer, teacher on the planet.   Oprah Winfrey Is it the job you hate but need in order to pay the rent? Is it that relationship that you gave your all to only to end up with a broken heart...again? Perhaps it's your children, a family member or a lifelong friend doing you in, dragging you down, pushing you to the brink. If you are an honorary member of the Black Woman's Suffering Society, you have probably been told that it's all your fault. Or that struggling and suffering is your lot in life. Iyanla Vanzant says NO! Life is an Act of Faith and suffering is optional! Those everyday challenges, obstacles, and dilemmas are what Iyanla calls valleys. As bad as they may seem, there is a purpose or, as Iyanla says, \\"There is so much value in the valley.\\" Valley experiences open your eyes to the things you know but have difficulty facing and accepting. Valleys challenge your fears, strengthen your will, correct your misperceptions, and give you valuable insights into yourself, the world, and the people around you. Those dark, bleak, ugly experiences that make you most uncomfortable can help you to grow. Valley experiences let you know it is time to do a new thing in a new way. You may grit your teeth and dig in your heels, but, as you will see, that new thing can be daring, exciting, and even fun. If you learn your valley lessons well, you are bound to shake other people up too. Good! You need to display your brilliance and move into your own grace. You've got the power, and your thoughts, deeds, and actions are your ticket. When you muster up the strength to change how you do what you've been doing, you find the way out of the valley. As Iyanla says, \\"Valleys are not one-size-fits-all.\\" In fact, they are custom-designed to teach you how to reach your highest potential -- to be divine, prosperous, and in alignment with your highest and greatest good. If you've ever been disappointed, betrayed, rejected, abandoned, or just plain old scared to let go, then you've been or may still be in a valley. Iyanla knows -- she's been there, and on a bad day she's still there, but now she shares with you the way out.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yDJFacLWTHgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Earthly Paradise: Baha'i Houses of Worship Around the World","description":"Exploring the significance of places that built our cultural past, this guide is a lens into historical sites spanning the entire history of the United States, from Acoma Pueblo to Ground Zero. ?

As the field of Asian American literary studies gains increasing recognition, however, questions of misreading and appropriation inevitably arise. How is the growing body of Asian American works to be read? What holds them together to constitute a tradition? What distinguishes this tradition from the \\"mainstream\\" canon and other \\"minority\\" literatures? In the first comprehensive book on Asian American literature since Elaine Kim's ground-breaking 1982 volume, Sau-ling Wong addresses these issues and explores their implications for the multiculturalist agenda. Wong does so by establishing the \\"intertextuality\\" of Asian American literature through the study of four motifs--food and eating, the Doppelg,nger figure, mobility, and play--in their multiple sociohistorical contexts. Occurring across ethnic subgroup, gender, class, generational, and historical boundaries, these motifs resonate with each other in distinctly Asian American patterns that universalistic theories cannot uncover. Two rhetorical figures from Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman Warrior, \\"Necessity\\" and \\"Extravagance,\\" further unify this original, wide-ranging investigation. Authors studied include Carlos Bulosan, Frank Chin, Ashley Sheun Dunn, David Henry Hwang, Lonny Kaneko, Maxine Hong Kingston, Joy Kogawa, David Wong Louie, Darrell Lum, Wing Tek Lum, Toshio Mori, Bharati Mukherjee, Fae Myenne Ng, Bienvenido Santos, Monica Sone, Amy Tan, Yoshiko Uchida, Shawn Wong, Hisaye Yamamoto, and Wakako Yamauchi.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YBqOac2M9ScC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Family Fortunes: Men and Women of the English Middle Class, 1780-1850 (Women in Culture and Society Series)","description":"Family Fortunes has become a seminal text in class and gender history.

Starting with a handful of software contractors who produced specialized programs for the few existing machines, the industry grew to include producers of corporate software packages and then makers of mass-market products and recreational software. This book tells the story of each of these types of firm, focusing on the products they developed, the business models they followed, and the markets they served. By describing the breadth of this industry, Martin Campbell-Kelly corrects the popular misconception that one firm is at the center of the software universe. He also tells the story of lucrative software products such as IBM's CICS and SAP's R/3, which, though little known to the general public, lie at the heart of today's information infrastructure.With its wealth of industry data and its thoughtful judgments, this book will become a starting point for all future investigations of this fundamental component of computer history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BeruCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Conversion of the Jews (Short Stories Series)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qz-2DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Play Rock Keyboards","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6BBjKQAACAAJ&dq=Play+Rock+Keyboards&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sunset Warrior","description":"First in the Sunset Warrior cycle:  Vivid sword and sorcery adventure  from the #1 New York Timesbestselling author of The Ninja (Publishers Weekly).

At age thirty-one, Delilah needs a plan. Still living with her parents on their Key West estate, with no career to speak of and a dull relationship with a self-involved artist, she is beginning to feel as if life is sailing swiftly past her. Her sister is living the perfect life with the perfect husband, her father con-tinues to make money off the stock market, and her mother continues to spend it on the latest social cause.

Little does she know that it will soon come in the shape of Carla, -- a former tiger tamer and Delilah's long-lost biological grandmother. Long-lost, that is, until now. When Delilah's mother unwittingly discovers the identity of the woman who put her up for adoption years ago, Delilah is enlisted to visit Carla at her dilapidated farmhouse in rural New York. The first meeting does not go well. Aside from her constant gruff commands and occasional meddling in Delilah's love life, Carla barely says a word to her newly discovered granddaughter, who is more like her than either of them would care to admit. Slowly, however, the two are drawn together by the beauty of the land, by the good friends around them, and by a love as unpredictable as life itself. Soon Delilah discovers that saving the world requires the courage to be saved and that truly embracing life means accepting its uncertainty. \\"Because love was always unpredictable.

Flourishing principally in the Languedoc and Italy, the Cathars taught that the world is evil and must be transcended through a simple life of prayer, work, fasting, and non-violence. They believed themselves to be the heirs of the true heritage of Christianity going back to apostolic times, and completely rejected the Catholic Church and all its trappings, regarding it as the Church of Satan. Cathar services and ceremonies, by contrast, were held in fields, barns, and in people's homes. Finding support from the nobility in the fractious political situation in southern France, the Cathars also found widespread popularity among peasants and artisans. And, unlike the Church, the Cathars respected women; they played a major role in the movement. Alarmed at the success of Catharism, the Church founded the Inquisition and launched the Albigensian Crusade to exterminate the heresy. While previous Crusades had been directed against Muslims in the Middle East, the Albigensian Crusade was the first Crusade to be directed against fellow Christians, and was also the first European genocide. With the fall of the Cathar fortress of Monts gur in 1244, Catharism was largely obliterated, although the faith survived into the early fourteenth century. Today, the mystique surrounding the Cathars is as strong as ever, and Sean Martin recounts their story and the myths associated with them in this lively and gripping book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y9eQCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The crystal tree,","description":"This fascinating and original method of divination brings together two treasure-troves of occult wisdom for the first time.

The love languages in human relationships are a reflection of divine love. If man is indeed made in the image of God, then we would expect to find all five love languages (and more ) expressed in the character and nature of God.

Val Darrant was just four years old the snowy night his mother abandoned him. But instead of meeting a lonely death, he met Will Reilly--a gentleman, a gambler, and a worldly, self-taught scholar. For ten years they each were all the family the other had, traveling from dusty American boomtowns to the glittering cities of Belle  poque Europe--until the day Reilly's luck ran out in a roar of gunfire. But it wasn't a gambling brawl or a pack of thieves that sealed Will's fate. It was a far more complex story that Val would soon uncover--one that would bring him face-to-face with the one person he least wants to see: his mother. With the help of a beautiful, street-smart rancher and the woman who was Will Reilly's lost love, Val must close this last cruel chapter of his past before he can turn the page on an uncertain future.

Fury-sexual, Oedipal, political, magical, brutal- drives us to our finest heights and coarsest depths. This is what we are, what we civilize ourselves to disguise-the terrifying human animal in us, the exalted, transcendent, self-destructive, untrammeled lord of creation. We raise each other to the heights of joy. We tear each other limb from bloody limb.\\" Malik Solanka, historian of ideas and dollmaker extraordinaire, steps out of his life one day, abandons his family without a word of explanation, and flees London for New York. There's a fury within him, and he fears he has become dangerous to those he loves. He arrives in New York at a time of unprecedented plenty, in the highest hour of America's wealth and power, seeking to \\"erase\\" himself. Eat me, America, he prays, and give me peace. But fury is all around him. Cabdrivers spout invective. A serial killer is murdering women with a lump of concrete. The petty spats and bone-deep resentments of the metropolis engulf him. His own thoughts, emotions, and desires, meanwhile, are also running wild. A tall, green-eyed young blonde in a D'Angelo Voodoo baseball cap is in store for him. As is another woman, with whom he will fall in love and be drawn toward a different fury, whose roots lie on the far side of the world. Fury is a work of explosive energy, at once a pitiless and pitch-black comedy, a profoundly disturbing inquiry into the darkest side of human nature, and a love story of mesmerizing force. It is also an astonishing portrait of New York. Not since the Bombay of Midnight's Children have a time and place been so intensely and accurately captured in a novel. In his eighth novel, Salman Rushdie brilliantly entwines moments of anger and frenzy with those of humor, honesty, and intimacy. Fury is, above all, a masterly chronicle of the human condition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QHuqz73g5ZsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sex, Lies, and Rabbis: Breaking a Sacred Trust","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Just One Night","description":"After spending one life-changing day in Paris with laid-back Dutch actor Willem De Ruiter, sheltered American good girl Allyson  Lulu  Healey discovered her new lover had disappeared without a trace.

In such plays, courtiers, gentlemen, or knights use social superiority to seduce citizens  wives. The Windsor wives, though, do not follow that pattern.

Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments? The shocking answer is: None of the above! In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: \\"Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!\\" Eker does this by identifying your \\"money and success blueprint.\\" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success. Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and \\"revise\\" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it. In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen \\"Wealth Files,\\" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth. If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4AUbNnnOzSAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NRSV Giant Print (Burgundy 4-Volume Set)","description":"If the Bible isn't a science book or an instruction manual, what is it? What do people mean when they say the Bible is inspired? When New York Times bestselling author Rachel Held Evans found herself asking these questions, she embarked on a journey to better understand what the Bible is and how it's meant to be read. What she discovered changed her--and it can change you, too. Evans knows firsthand how a relationship with the Bible can be as real and as complicated as a relationship with a family member or close friend. In Inspired, Evans explores contradictions and questions from her own experiences with the Bible, including: If the Bible was supposed to explain the mysteries of life, why does it leave the reader with so many questions? What does it mean to be chosen by God? To what degree did the Holy Spirit guide the preservation of these narratives, and is there something sacred to be uncovered beneath all these human fingerprints? If the Bible has given voice to the oppressed, why is it also used as justification by their oppressors? Drawing on the best in biblical scholarship and using her well-honed literary expertise, Evans examines some of our favorite Bible stories and possible interpretations, retelling them through memoir, original poetry, short stories, and even a short screenplay. Undaunted by the Bible's most difficult passages and unafraid to ask the hard questions, Evans wrestles through the process of doubting, imagining, and debating the mysteries surrounding Scripture. Discover alongside Evans that the Bible is not a static text, but a living, breathing, captivating, and confounding book that can equip us and inspire us to join God's loving and redemptive work in the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HjY-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crystal Palace, 1851-1936: A portrait of Victorian enterprise","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wkhUAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Crystal+Palace,+1851-1936:+A+portrait+of+Victorian+enterprise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The noise of their wings (Armed Services edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uL9tswEACAAJ&dq=The+noise+of+their+wings+(Armed+Services+edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"California Light: The Watercolors of Rollin Pickford","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bE1IAQAAIAAJ&dq=California+Light:+The+Watercolors+of+Rollin+Pickford&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Special Treatment: Ten Ways to Get the Same Special Health Care Your Doctor Gets","description":"Doctors have a built-in advantage when it comes to getting extra-special medical care.

Topics of special interest addressed in the book include Brouwer's fixed point theorem, Morse Theory, and the geodesic flow. Smooth manifolds, Riemannian metrics, affine connections, the curvature tensor, differential forms, and integration on manifolds provide the foundation for many applications in dynamical systems and mechanics. The authors also discuss the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and its implications in non-Euclidean geometry models. The differential topology aspect of the book centers on classical, transversality theory, Sard's theorem, intersection theory, and fixed-point theorems. The construction of the de Rham cohomology builds further arguments for the strong connection between the differential structure and the topological structure. It also furnishes some of the tools necessary for a complete understanding of the Morse theory. These discussions are followed by an introduction to the theory of hyperbolic systems, with emphasis on the quintessential role of the geodesic flow. The integration of geometric theory, topological theory, and concrete applications to dynamical systems set this book apart. With clean, clear prose and effective examples, the authors' intuitive approach creates a treatment that is comprehensible to relative beginners, yet rigorous enough for those with more background and experience in the field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tV9sTDnaf40C&dq=Differential+Geometry+and+Topology:+With+a+View+to+Dynamical+Systems+(Studies+in+Advanced+Mathematics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Messianic idea in Judaism and other essays on Jewish spirituality","description":"Gershom Scholem was the master builder of historical studies of the Kabbalah. When he began to work on this neglected field, the few who studied these texts were either amateurs who were looking for occult wisdom, or old-style Kabbalists who were seeking guidance on their spiritual journeys. His work broke with the outlook of the scholars of the previous century in Judaica die Wissenschaft des Judentums, the Science of Judaism whose orientation he rejected, calling their  disregard for the most vital aspects of the Jewish people as a collective entity: a form of  censorship of the Jewish past.  The major founders of modern Jewish historical studies in the nineteenth century, Leopold Zunz and Abraham Geiger, had ignored the Kabbalah; it did not fit into their account of the Jewish religion as rational and worthy of respect by  enlightened  minds. The only exception was the historian Heinrich Graetz. He had paid substantial attention to its texts and to their most explosive exponent, the false Messiah Sabbatai Zevi, but Graetz had depicted the Kabbalah and all that flowed from it as an unworthy revolt from the underground of Jewish life against its reasonable, law-abiding, and learned mainstream. Scholem conducted a continuing polemic with Zunz, Geiger, and Graetz by bringing into view a Jewish past more varied, more vital, and more interesting than any idealized portrait could reveal.  from the Foreword by Arthur Hertzberg, 1995","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gfPP9SjPK4MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sonnets from the Portuguese","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EMFNAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hippocrene Compact Dictionary Spanish-English English-Spanish (Latin American)","description":"This bilingual dictionary is designed specifically for the distinct vocabulary and dialects found throughout Central and South America and the Caribbean, and a valuable guide to the most prevalent dialect spoken in the U.S.--Latin American.

But did you know that the reason most commonly cited by transnational executives for this phenomenal failure rate isn't geopolitics, global competition, or economic volatility, but culture clash? As one frustrated transnational manager quipped, \\"How are you supposed to get all your ducks in a row when half of them think they're turtles?\\" Why, despite the vast sums spent each year on cross-cultural executive training, do so many well-laid business plans continue to fall apart under the strain of cultural differences? Author Sheida Hodge finds the answer in the training itself, which typically focuses on \\"the ten percent of the iceberg above the surface-how to bow or shake hands, whether to cross your legs, what gestures to use.\\" Much more dangerous is \\"the ninety percent of the iceberg that is under water\\"-the deep-seated cultural values on which unsuspecting executives routinely founder. In this book, as in her world-renowned training courses and seminars, Hodge departs from the common practice of drilling readers in the do's and don'ts of doing business in various cultures. She concentrates instead on helping you build cross-cultural competence by acquainting you with the basic values, beliefs, and biases that inform the business styles in most Asian, Latin American, and European cultures. Rather than simply offering tips on how to eat and what colors to wear-which do appear, in abundance, throughout the book-she coaches you in a proven set of strategies and skills that will enable you to successfully navigate the people dimension of doing business virtually anywhere in the world. For Hodge, learning to see past one's own cultural hobbyhorses-while avoiding getting trampled by everyone else's-is the first big step toward succeeding in global business. Thus, most of her discussions of specific cultural differences start by exploring values and business practices that seem \\"natural\\" to North Americans, and go on to show how they differ from values and practices in other cultures. To better illustrate her points, she has included anecdotes throughout told by managers from North America and around the world that provide vivid, sometimes hilarious, object lessons in how minor cultural frictions and misunderstandings can mushroom into major business disasters. A complete guide to building solid cross-border business relationships, Global Smarts is must reading for all managers and entrepreneurs in today's global business world. Proven strategies for breaking down cultural barriers and building prosperous business relationships anywhere in the world American executives need to know how to communicate effectively with their associates around the world to remain competitive. In Global Smarts, Sheida Hodge, a successful international entrepreneur and one of the most sought-after cross-cultural business trainers, shares her proven strategies for successfully dealing with such issues as language barriers, culture shock, international negotiation tactics, and how to establish trust on a cross-cultural basis. Unlike other authors who merely list the various do's and don'ts of doing business in specific regions, Hodge helps you to develop a high degree of cross-cultural competency that translates into an unbeatable competitive edge, virtually anywhere in the world. Packed with practical insider tips and eye-opening anecdotes from cross-cultural managers from the United States and other countries, this thoroughly engaging guide is an indispensable resource for anyone doing business in today's global business world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UURpCssfRvcC&dq=Global+Smarts:+The+Art+of+Communicating+and+Deal+Making+Anywhere+in+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Birdy","description":"The critically acclaimed Birdy is an inventive, hypnotic novel about friendship and family, love and war, madness and beauty, and, above all, \\"birdness\\".

Although the ideals embodied in religion and philosophy are considered to be humanity's prime \\"civilising\\" force, religions that preach love have been used to justify bloody massacres, and utopian ideals have fomented intolerance and persecution of those who were perceived as obstacles to the realisation of an ideal society. John Mohawk, a distinguished Native American historian, examines this paradox and traces the role of utopian thinking as the rationale for religious wars, subjugation of indigenous peoples, genocide, enslavement, plunder, economic domination, and campaigns of world conquest from the time of the ancient Greeks. Mohawk examines the hidden dynamic within utopian thinking and the danger it poses when it is adopted by powerful groups who use it to serve their own interests. He points out that the danger lies not in the utopian ideal itself but in the parallel assumption that its followers are in possession of the only \\"truth\\" and are therefore justified in forcing their \\"better way of life\\" on other cultures or nations for the ultimate good of humanity. In a gripping historical narrative, Mohawk traces the impact of utopian thinking on the rise of Western culture in ancient Greece and Rome, the emergence of the Christian empire, and the holy wars of the Middle Ages. Showing how this mindset has shaped Western development, he makes it clear that the utopian legacy still influences contemporary social and political movements at home and abroad. Our greatest challenge is to find ways to defuse its harmful effects on cultures different from our own, while preserving our aspirations and personal ideals. Mohawk argues that only a pluralistic outlook can truly support peace and understanding among the peoples of the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RZWFAAAAMAAJ&dq=Utopian+Legacies:+A+History+of+Conquest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"General Chemistry: Principles and Modern Applications (7th Edition)","description":"Appropriate for 2-semester or 3-quarter general chemistry courses.

We live in the city of men. Our public spaces are not designed for female bodies. There is little consideration for women as mothers, workers or carers. The urban streets often are a place of threats rather than community. Gentrification has made the everyday lives of women even more difficult. What would a metropolis for working women look like? A city of friendships beyond Sex and the City. A transit system that accommodates mothers with strollers on the school run. A public space with enough toilets. A place where women can walk without harassment. In Feminist City, through history, personal experience and popular culture Leslie Kern exposes what is hidden in plain sight: the social inequalities built into our cities, homes, and neighborhoods. Kern offers an alternative vision of the feminist city. Taking on fear, motherhood, friendship, activism, and the joys and perils of being alone, Kern maps the city from new vantage points, laying out an intersectional feminist approach to urban histories and proposes that the city is perhaps also our best hope for shaping a new urban future. It is time to dismantle what we take for granted about cities and to ask how we can build more just, sustainable, and women-friendly cities together.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ipHqDwAAQBAJ&dq=Ways+of+Women+Pb&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Persistence of vision","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Movie Sets 101: The Definitive Survivor's Guide","description":"Asked what advice he could give young actors, Spencer Tracy replied, Know your lines and dont bump into the furniture.

Spanning much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the novel follows the fortunes of the extraordinary Whittaker family as led by the enterprising Henry Whittaker a poor-born Englishman who makes a great fortune in the South American quinine trade, eventually becoming the richest man in Philadelphia. Born in 1800, Henry s brilliant daughter, Alma (who inherits both her father s money and his mind), ultimately becomes a botanist of considerable gifts herself. As Alma s research takes her deeper into the mysteries of evolution, she falls in love with a man named Ambrose Pike who makes incomparable paintings of orchids and who draws her in the exact opposite direction into the realm of the spiritual, the divine, and the magical. Alma is a clear-minded scientist; Ambrose a utopian artist but what unites this unlikely couple is a desperate need to understand the workings of this world and the mechanisms behind all life. Exquisitely researched and told at a galloping pace, The Signature of All Things soars across the globe from London to Peru to Philadelphia to Tahiti to Amsterdam, and beyond. Along the way, the story is peopled with unforgettable characters: missionaries, abolitionists, adventurers, astronomers, sea captains, geniuses, and the quite mad. But most memorable of all, it is the story of Alma Whittaker, who born in the Age of Enlightenment, but living well into the Industrial Revolution bears witness to that extraordinary moment in human history when all the old assumptions about science, religion, commerce, and class were exploding into dangerous new ideas. Written in the bold, questing spirit of that singular time, Gilbert s wise, deep, and spellbinding tale is certain to capture the hearts and minds of readers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lJdPEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Signature+of+All+Things&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mister Stormalong,","description":"Tales of Mister Stormalong,the legendary hero of the men and officers of the merchant marines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ze4kAAAAMAAJ&dq=Mister+Stormalong,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Credit Mobilier (The Railroads)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aas_XCCQjfUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heverly","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lrpRAAAAMAAJ&dq=Heverly&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Persian Cats and Other Longhairs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JIp2kJ400v4C&dq=Persian+Cats+and+Other+Longhairs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christmas at Cupid's Hideaway (Harlequin American Romance Ser, No. 996)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PWdYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Christmas+at+Cupid%27s+Hideaway+(Harlequin+American+Romance+Ser,+No.+996)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Noel","description":"A Christmas ornament named No?l has a special quality which he eventually shares with all of mankind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9kTO_cUenx8C&dq=Noel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Third Choice: A Woman's Guide to Placing a Child for Adoption","description":"The Cruelest Con \\"is a unique book in many ways: it is deeply personal, emotionally powerful, and contains important lessons for everyone in the adoption community.

On the flight from London, I told a British soldier, \\"I'm going to Baghdad to teach English.\\" He threw his head back and laughed, \\"My God, you don't even SPEAK it!\\" he said.

The Minneapolis Teamsters challenged the muscle of big business, as well as the authority of local, state, and federal government, and in the process they changed the very nature of labor relations in the United States. In The Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934, Philip Korth's description of events surrounding this landmark labor action are filtered through the recollections of the people who were there. Korth blends historical record with the words of actual participants to draw a thorough and compelling portrait of a labor strike and its consequences. Philip Korth's study illustrates the organizational strategies that made the Minneapolis strike a success, as well as how opposition and public perception defined emerging labor relations practices and public policy. At the same time, the author provides an in-depth examination of the conflict through interviews with witnesses and participants in this pivotal event in labor history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vnEdAQAAMAAJ&dq=1934&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Few Good Women: Breaking The Barriers To Top Management","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Camp Saddlebrook (Thoroughbred Series #28)","description":"Will Cassidy tell the truth, even if it means losing her horse?

Chinese writing is character based, the one major world script that is neither alphabetic nor syllabic. Through the years, the Chinese written language encountered presumed alphabetic universalism in the form of Morse Code, Braille, stenography, Linotype, punch cards, word processing, and other systems developed with the Latin alphabet in mind. This book is about those encounters in particular thousands of Chinese characters versus the typewriter and its QWERTY keyboard. Thomas Mullaney describes a fascinating series of experiments, prototypes, failures, and successes in the century-long quest for a workable Chinese typewriter. The earliest Chinese typewriters, Mullaney tells us, were figments of popular imagination, sensational accounts of twelve-foot keyboards with 5,000 keys. One of the first Chinese typewriters actually constructed was invented by a Christian missionary, who organized characters by common usage (but promoted the less-common characters for  Jesus\\" to the common usage level). Later came typewriters manufactured for use in Chinese offices, and typewriting schools that turned out trained  typewriter girls  and  typewriter boys.  Still later was the  Double Pigeon  typewriter produced by the Shanghai Calculator and Typewriter Factory, the typewriter of choice under Mao. Clerks and secretaries in this era experimented with alternative ways of organizing characters on their tray beds, inventing an input method that was the first instance of  predictive text.  Today, after more than a century of resistance against the alphabetic, not only have Chinese characters prevailed, they form the linguistic substrate of the vibrant world of Chinese information technology. The Chinese Typewriter, not just an  object history  but grappling with broad questions of technological change and global communication, shows how this happened.

Cha and David C. Kang s Nuclear North Korea was first published in 2003 amid the outbreak of a lasting crisis over the North Korean nuclear program. It promptly became a landmark of an ongoing debate in academic and policy circles about whether to engage or contain North Korea. Fifteen years later, as North Korea tests intercontinental ballistic missiles and the U.S. president angrily refers to Kim Jong-un as  Rocket Man,  Nuclear North Korea remains an essential guide to the difficult choices we face. Coming from different perspectives Kang believes the threat posed by Pyongyang has been inflated and endorses a more open approach, while Cha is more skeptical and advocates harsher measures, though both believe that some form of engagement is necessary the authors together present authoritative analysis of one of the world s thorniest challenges. They refute a number of misconceptions and challenge the faulty thinking that surrounds the discussion of North Korea, particularly the idea that North Korea is an irrational actor. Cha and Kang look at the implications of a nuclear North Korea, assess recent and current approaches to sanctions and engagement, and provide a functional framework for constructive policy. With a new chapter on the way forward for the international community in light of continued nuclear tensions, this book is of lasting relevance to understanding the state of affairs on the Korean peninsula.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g2NbDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alexander's Care of the Patient in Surgery","description":"Prepare for success on certification exams and in perioperative nursing!

We make-over wardrobes and restore houses and commit ourselves to better habits. But we're still left feeling empty and not-quite-enough. That's because what we need is not an upgrade but a complete upending of our lives. We need to be reborn. And it's not something we can do by ourselves. With deep compassion, Clayton King shares the compelling stories of 12 broken people who came face-to-face with Jesus in the New Testament and got a second chance at life. A respected religious leader, an ostracized woman, a despised embezzler, a condemned thief--all of them flawed, sinful, full of regret--encountered Jesus and were never the same. Along with their stories, King shares contemporary stories of people struggling with addiction, lust, greed, and depression, showing that Jesus still meets people right where they are and changes them from the inside out. If you're tired of going through the religious motions by your own power and long to experience the radical life and heart change that Jesus promised, it's time for an encounter with Jesus. It's time to be reborn.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ydXIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teens Can Bounce Back","description":" Well researched and up to date, including the acknowledgement of teens  struggles with the Covid-19 pandemic....

As the Confederates had pushed west at a relentless pace for nearly a week, thousands of wounded and exhausted men fell out of the ranks. When word spread that Lee planned to surrender, most remaining troops stacked their arms and accepted paroles allowing them to return home, even as they lamented the loss of their country and cause. But others broke south and west, hoping to continue the fight. Fearing a guerrilla war, Grant extended the generous Appomattox terms to every rebel who would surrender himself. Provost marshals fanned out across Virginia and beyond, seeking nearly 18,000 of Lee's men who had yet to surrender. But the shock of Lincoln's assassination led Northern authorities to see threats of new rebellion in every rail depot and harbor where Confederates gathered for transport, even among those already paroled. While Federal troops struggled to keep order and sustain a fragile peace, their newly surrendered adversaries seethed with anger and confusion at the sight of Union troops occupying their towns and former slaves celebrating freedom. In this dramatic new history of the weeks and months after Appomattox, Caroline E. Janney reveals that Lee's surrender was less an ending than the start of an interregnum marked by military and political uncertainty, legal and logistical confusion, and continued outbursts of violence. Janney takes readers from the deliberations of government and military authorities to the ground-level experiences of common soldiers. Ultimately, what unfolds is the messy birth narrative of the Lost Cause, laying the groundwork for the defiant resilience of rebellion in the years that followed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2ZIkEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dancing on Snowflakes","description":"A young mother s troubled past catches up to her and sets her heart aflame in this spellbinding western romance set it California s untamed past.

Zimbabwe is a country with a rich history, dating from the early San hunter-gatherer societies. The arrival of British imperial rule in 1890 impacted the country tremendously, as the European rulers exploited Zimbabwe's resources, giving rise to a movement of African nationalism and demands for independence. This culminated in the armed conflict of the 1960s and 1970s and independence in 1980. The 1990s were marked by economic decline and the rise of opposition politics. In 1999, Mugabe embarked on a violent land reform program that plunged the nation's economy into a downward spiral, with political violence and human rights violations making Zimbabwe an international pariah state.

In addition to analyzing how the process of racism is articulated in specific films, it examines how specific meanings can resist their function of ideological containment, and instead, offer a perspective of a more collective, egalitarian social system - one that transcends the discourse of race.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MUhaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Li'L Miss Fuss Budget","description":"L'il Miss Fuss Budget's big brother describes all the ways in which his sister's behavior causes problems every day of the week.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4Hz6PQAACAAJ&dq=Li%27L+Miss+Fuss+Budget&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Rural Society after the Black Death : Essex 1350-1525 (Cambridge Studies in Population, Economy and Society in Past Time)","description":"A Rural Society after the Black Death is a study of rural social structure in the English county of Essex between 1350 and 1500. It seeks to understand how, in the population collapse after the Black Death (1348-1349), a particular economic environment affected ordinary people's lives in the areas of migration, marriage and employment, and also contributed to patterns of religious nonconformity, agrarian riots and unrest, and even rural housing. The period under scrutiny is often seen as a transitional era between 'medieval' and 'early-modern' England, but in the light of recent advances in English historical demography, this study suggests that there was more continuity than change in some critically important aspects of social structure in the region in question. Among the most important contributions of the book are its use of an unprecedentedly wide range of original manuscript records (estate and manorial records, taxation and criminal-court records, royal tenurial records, and the records of church courts, wills etc.) and its application of current quantitative and comparative demographic methods.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nznIAsILdA0C&dq=A+Rural+Society+after+the+Black+Death+:+Essex+1350-1525+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Population,+Economy+and+Society+in+Past+Time)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alternatives to Economic Globalization","description":"Written by a premier group of thinkers from around the world, this book is the defining document of the anti globalization movement and the culmination of a three-year project by the International Forum on Globalization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QNDjfyavFx0C&dq=Alternatives+to+Economic+Globalization&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wizard of Sun City: The Strange True Story of Charles Hatfield, the Rainmaker Who Drowned a City's Dreams","description":"Filled with firsthand research and the flair of a thriller, \\"The Wizard of Sun City\\" is a biography of visionary scientist Charles Hatfield, a chronicle of a virtually unknown subculture, and, ultimately, the story of the tumultuous events of January 1916 that gave Hatfield a reputation as the West's most controversial rain wizard.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bcAGlqLo1NAC&dq=The+Wizard+of+Sun+City:+The+Strange+True+Story+of+Charles+Hatfield,+the+Rainmaker+Who+Drowned+a+City%27s+Dreams&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Krause's Food, Nutrition, & Diet Therapy - Study Guide","description":"A trusted classic for over 50 years, Krause's Food and the Nutrition Care Process, 14th Edition presents the most cutting-edge and up-to-date dietetics content available in this ever-changing field.

It was in a summer class in 1915 that Carobeth Laird first met him, handsome and sun-tanned from the field. Her story of their seven-year marriage, written when she was in her seventies and published when she was eighty years old, is a compelling tale that has sold over 250,000 copies. In one sense a chronicle of what it meant to an anthropologist in the early twentieth century, it is also a love story, portraying the curious triangle that developed when a Chemehuevi informant entered the lives of Harrington and the young wife he drove as ruthlessly as he did himself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sye0AAAAIAAJ&dq=Encounter+With+an+Angry+God:+Recollections+of+My+Life+With+John+Peabody+Harrington&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baseball's All-Time Goats As Chosen by America's Top Sportswriters","description":"Recounts the many bad plays performed by baseball players over the years which resulted in lost games and lost World Series","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KGoFNdR29n4C&dq=Baseball%27s+All-Time+Goats+As+Chosen+by+America%27s+Top+Sportswriters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life's Journey for One Man","description":"Why are we here?

Right or wrong, safe or dangerous, Plant illustrates that narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens have actually been integral to the cultural life of modern times. They have shaped some of the era's most fundamental philosophies and provided much of its economic wealth. They have even exposed the neurochemistry of the human brain, which, like society itself, has never been drug-free.

As the leading textbook of modern orthopaedics for over 50 years, this book is a testament to the late Alan Apley's skills as a teacher, and the care and forethought he brought to the presentation of the content. The current authors have developed and extended this foundation to produce a thoroughly modern textbook of orthopaedic surgery, bringing contemporary expertise while retaining the book's characteristic philosophy and approach. They are joined by a selection of expert contributors from around the world who provide added material on a wide variety of subjects  including radiology, open fractures, neuromuscular disorders, and inflammatory arthropathies. This ninth edition echoes its predecessors in following Apley's approach to the orthopaedic patient. As before, the work is divided into three sections: General Orthopaedics, Regional Orthopaedics, and Fractures and Joint Injuries. The material has been fully updated and revised and includes more than 1,000 illustrations. Apley's System's wide readership of practicing orthopaedic surgeons, postgraduate trainees and residents in orthopaedics and general surgery, A&E specialists, and physiotherapists is evidence of the authors' ability to instruct and inspire. The book is a truly fitting introduction to modern-day orthopaedics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ReMaDpIxyLYC&dq=Apley%27s+System+of+Orthopaedics+and+Fractures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Place I've Never Been (Contemporary American Fiction)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9S_uAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Place+I%27ve+Never+Been+(Contemporary+American+Fiction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BATTLE FOR PLANET EARTH: The Chronicles of Dar-Rek Mar-Cus Ra","description":"Introduction to Sociology 2e adheres to the scope and sequence of a typical, one-semester introductory sociology course.

The two radio plays were commissioned by the BBC; All That Fall  plumbs the same pessimistic depths [as Waiting for Godot] in what seems a no less despairing search for human dignity  (London Times), and Embers is equally unforgettable theater, born of the ramblings of an old man and his wife. Finally, in the two pantomimes, Beckett takes drama to the point of pure abstraction with his portrayals of, in Act Without Words I, frustrated desired, and in Act Without Words I, corresponding motions of living juxtaposed in the slow despair of one man and the senselessly busy motion of another.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PLR6GhORntYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Spell of Winter: A Novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"\\"With Bleeding Footsteps\\": Mary Baker Eddy's Path to Religious Leadership","description":"An intimate portrait of the founder of the Christian Science Church explores the life of Mary Baker Eddy within the context of her late-Victorian world and the experiences of illness and loss that led to her attempts to alleviate suffering.

The Kod ly Today handbook series is the first comprehensive system to update and apply the Kod ly concepts to teaching music in elementary school classrooms. Kod ly in the Fourth Grade Classroom provides teachers with a step-by-step road map for developing children's performance, creative movement, and literacy skills in an organic and thoughtful manner. Through six years of field-testing with music teachers in the United States, Great Britain, and Hungary (the home country of Zolt n Kod ly), authors Miche l Houlahan and Philip Tacka have developed a methodology specifically for 21st century classrooms. Houlahan and Tacka use the latest research findings in cognition and perception to create a system not only appropriate for the developmental stages of fourth graders but also one which integrates vertically between elementary music classes. The methods outlined in this volume encourage greater musical ability and creativity in children by teaching them to sing, move, play instruments, and develop music literacy skills. In addition, Kod ly in the Fourth Grade Classroom promotes critical thinking, problem solving, and collaboration skills. Although the book uses the Kod ly philosophy, its methodology has also been tested by teachers certified in Orff and Dalcroze, and has proven an essential guide for teachers no matter what their personal philosophy and specific training might be. Over 100 children's books are incorporated into Kod ly in the Fourth Grade Classroom, as well as 35 detailed lesson plans that demonstrate how music and literacy curriculum goals are transformed into tangible musical objectives. Scholarly yet practical and accessible, this volume is sure to be an essential guide for elementary music teachers everywhere.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cBoOCgAAQBAJ&dq=Circle+Round+the+Zero:+Play+Chants&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bamboo Cage","description":"After the Vietnam War ground to a bloody halt, long after the boys were officially sent home, evidence remained that over 2,000 American soldiers were still missing in Southeast Asia.

Steal This Vote tells the fraught but very colorful history of electoral malfeasance in the United States. It is a tale of votes bought, stolen, suppressed, lost, cast more than once, assigned to dead people and pets, miscounted, thrown into rivers, and litigated all the way to the Supreme Court. (No wonder America has the lowest voter participation rate of any Western democracy!) Andrew Gumbel whose work on the new electronic voting fraud has been praised by Gore Vidal and Paul Krugman, and has won a Project Censored Award shows that, for all the idealism about American democracy, free and fair elections have been the exception, not the rule. In fact, Gumbel suggests that Tammany Hall, shrouded as it is in moral odium, might have been a fairer system than we have today, because ostensibly positive developments like the secret ballot have been used to squash voting rights ever since.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aFJutAEACAAJ&dq=Steal+This+Vote:+Dirty+Elections+and+the+Rotten+History+of+Democracy+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Export: A Patch of Tapestry Out of Coal Country America","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Witch's Brew: Good Spells for Creativity","description":"Whether you're conjuring the muse, using rituals to aid your creative process, or trying to get your art out into the world, let good witchcraft help you succeed in all your creative endeavors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lZU_w2sxnaEC&dq=Witch%27s+Brew:+Good+Spells+for+Creativity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE REIGN OF JESUS THROUGH MARY; REVISED EDITION","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m6_UGAAACAAJ&dq=THE+REIGN+OF+JESUS+THROUGH+MARY%3B+REVISED+EDITION&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Larry Kane's Philadelphia","description":"Larry Kane, dean of Philadelphia news anchors, arrived in town to take a job as a radio broadcaster on September 12, 1966. Driving across the Walt Whitman Bridge he spotted several fires raging to the south. After paying his toll, he drove to a pay phone and called the fire emergency line. The dispatcher responded, \\"Whateryoutawkin about? Them there's oil refineries.\\"Thirty-four years later, Larry knows all about the oil refineries. In fact, there's very little that goes on in Philadelphia that he hasn't reported on at one time or another. And it's all here in this easy-reading look at Philadelphia government and politics, and the trials of a journalist trying to cover them.For Larry Kane watchers, this book answers some nagging questions: Why did he leave for New York and why did he come back? What's the story behind the Bill Green lawsuit? Does he apply his own makeup? Larry is candid about his own mistakes, and about his successes. He talks about his insecurities and the strain of living life in the spotlight.But this is first and foremost a book about Philadelphia by a man who knows the city intimately. He has been close to more Philadelphia power figures than perhaps any other person. Here he talks personally about Ed Rendell, Arlen Specter, Vince Fumo, Lynne Abraham, John Cardinal Krol, Leon Sullivan, and, of course, the legendary Frank Rizzo. He has visited Jimmy Tayoun in jail, co-hosted a weekend radio marathon with John Lennon, and interviewed shirtless Lenny Dykstra, who insisted that the news team could just clip the microphone to his chest hair.Larry also has tales to tell about watching Martin Luther King Jr.'s killer being apprehended in Heathrow Airport, about barely escaping the riot at the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention, about traveling to earthquake-stricken Italy and to dissent-torn Israel. He has even been to Alaska to see the Pope. (Yes, he's also met him more conventionally at the Vatican.)These are the reminiscences of a master-storyteller, a man whose job has been to see the city accurately and report on it informatively. Whether you're more familiar with Richardson Dilworth or Boyz II Men, you will laugh, groan, and be moved by Larry Kane's view of Philadelphia. Author note: Larry Kane is news anchor for Eyewitness News at 11 on KYW TV in Philadelphia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9v9kPgAACAAJ&dq=Larry+Kane%27s+Philadelphia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gurkha Rifles (Men-at-Arms)","description":"The Gurkhas have a long and distinguished service record.

In his Autobiography he also attains literary distinction. He is a writer who recounts the history of his period from a personal point of view and yet scarcely mentions himself. He is an observer who writes about the history of his country and of his country s art, yet makes his own character implicit in the narrative. The character that emerges is charming. It is that of a man strong but retiring, sharply critical of what he disapproves yet generous in praise of what he admires, decided in his views but modest in his assumptions and given to understatement in describing his own activities, averse to war and political struggle yet eager for conflict of ideas, always dedicated to the welfare of humanity. Through the details of day-by-day living, he presents the panorama of the Mexican Revolution and of events in other parts of the world to which he traveled. His is a personal story of the Revolution, giving his reactions (as those of any common man) to the barbarities of war:  Insolent leaders, inflamed with alcohol, taking whatever they wanted at pistol point. . . . By night in dark streets the sound of gunplay, followed by screams, blasphemies, and vile insults. Breaking windows, sharp blows, cries of pain, and shots again.  Orozco s ability, as a painter, to see the details and to sense the mood of a place is apparent in his word pictures of the places he visited:  After six in the evening Paris is an immense brothel.   London was like the seat of a noble family which had been exceedingly rich but had lost its fortune.   Old, old Montmartre [is] a moldering cadaver . . .  Orozco also makes some penetrating observations on art itself. Although he emphasizes individuality and freedom from tradition in art, he abhors unschooled art, especially such extremes as primitive Impressionism and other groups that lack instruction in the general principles of art, in technique, in theory of color, in perspective. He says ironically of the artistically uneducated:  Blessed are the ignorant and the imbecile, for theirs is the supreme glory of art! Blessed are the idiots and the cretins, for masterpieces of painting shall issue from their hands!  Orozco believes in education, not only for the artists but for their public. Taste in art can come only through understanding of the purpose and the techniques of art through knowledge. Without training, public taste  mostly likes sugar, honey, and candy. Diabetic art. The greater the amount of sugar, the greater the commercial success.

Professor Lidenbrock and his nephew Axel travel across Iceland, and then down through an extinct crater towards a sunless sea where they enter a living past and are confronted with the origins of man. A classic of nineteenth-century French literature, the novel's distinctive combination of realism and Romanticism has marked figures as diverse as Sartre and Tournier, Mark Twain and Conan Doyle. This new translation of the complete text is faithful to the lyricism, verve, and humour of the original. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.

Mia Levy is content with the simple existence she leads on a farm. But her days weren't always spent so quietly.

Mia's struggle to survive would take her from the poverty-stricken streets of Poland to New York City, where she encountered a love that would span decades, to Paris where she would place herself in the gravest of dangers to uncover the mysterious fate that befell her family. . .

This was the world of Shams al-Din Mohammad Hafez Shirazi, a classical poet who remains broadly popular today in his native Shiraz and in modern Iran as a whole, and among all lovers of great verse traditions. As John Limbert notes, Hafez's poetry is inseparable from the Iranian spirit--a reflection of Iranians? intellectual and emotional responses to events. But if Hafez?s endurance derives from the considerable charm of his work, it also arises from his sure grounding in the life of his day, from a setting so deftly explored by his verse that his depictions of it retain a timeless relevance. To fully comprehend and enjoy Hafez, and thus to understand a root force in modern Iranian consciousness, we must know something of the city in which he lived and wrote. In this book, Limbert provides not only a rich context for Hafez?s poetry but also a comprehensive perspective on a fascinating place in a dynamic time. His portrait of this elegant, witty poet and his marvelous city will be as valuable to medievalists, students of the Middle East, and specialists in urban studies as it will be to connoisseurs of world literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mPcnCnCNNF8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Teddy Bear ABC","description":"The letters of the alphabet are introduced in rhymed text and illustrations that also reveal some of the activities and characteristics of teddy bears.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=26TxmFeVmKIC&dq=The+Teddy+Bear+ABC&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The gold bug,","description":"Set on Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, the plot follows William Legrand, who was recently bitten by a gold-colored bug.

They reveal a variety of settings, voices, styles, and thematic concerns, and the best of them, masterpieces written mainly in the mid-1930s, display an impressive artistic maturity. Included among these authors are Hwang Sun-won, modern Korea's greatest short story writer; Kim Tong-in, regarded by many as the author who best captures the essence of the Korean identity; Ch'ae Man-shik, a master of irony; Yi Sang, a prominent modernist; Kim Yu-jong, whose stories are marked by a unique blend of earthy humor and compassion; Yi Kwang-su and Kim Tong-ni, modernizers of the language of twentieth-century Korean fiction; and Yi Ki-y?ong, Yi T'ae-jun, and Pak T'ae-won, three writers who migrated to North Korea shortly after Liberation in 1945 and whose works were subsequently banned in South Korea until democratization in the late 1980s. One way of reading the stories, all of which were written during the Japanese occupation, is that beneath their often oppressive and gloomy surface lies an anticolonial subtext. They can also be read as a collective record of a people whose life choices were severely restricted, not just by colonization, but by education (either too little or too much, as the title story shows) and by a highly structured society that had little tolerance for those who overstepped its boundaries. Life was unremittingly onerous for many Koreans during this period, whatever their social background. In the stories, educated city folk fare little better than farmers and laborers. A Ready-Made Life will provide scholars and students with crucial access to the literature of Korea's colonial period. A generous opening essay discusses the collection in the context of modern Korean literary history, and short introductions precede each story. Here is a richly diverse testament to a modern literature that is poised to assume a long overdue place in world literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P6ABEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Beatles Book Of Lists","description":"Gathers lists of little known facts about the Beatles and their songs, recordings, performances, and films","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5cGaNwAACAAJ&dq=The+Beatles+Book+Of+Lists&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cruisers of the U.S. Navy, 1922-1962","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sYTfAAAAMAAJ&dq=Cruisers+of+the+U.S.+Navy,+1922-1962&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unbridled Fury (Thoroughbred Series #62)","description":"Kaitlin's dream to event internationally with her beloved dapple-gray Thoroughbred, Sterling Dream, is threatened when her new romance with handsome Connor Hamilton causes her to neglect her training.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IctPkLYvCDEC&dq=Unbridled+Fury+(Thoroughbred+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Parenting Children with ADHD: 10 Lessons That Medicine Cannot Teach (APA Lifetools)","description":"In this second edition, Dr. Vince Monastra provides practical, step-by-step guidance to parents looking for ways to bring out the best in kids with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Mauss s long-awaited magnum opus on the evolution of traditional Mormon beliefs and practices concerning minorities. He examines how members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have defined themselves and others in terms of racial lineages. Mauss describes a complex process of the broadening of these self-defined lineages during the last part of the twentieth century as the modern Mormon church continued its world-wide expansion through massive missionary work. Mauss contends that Mormon constructions of racial identity have not necessarily affected actual behavior negatively and that in some cases Mormons have shown greater tolerance than other groups in the American mainstream. Employing a broad intellectual historical analysis to identify shifts in LDS behavior over time, All Abraham s Children is an important commentary on current models of Mormon historiography.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WZI-RuPF9AcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Love Knot (SIGNED)","description":"Love Knot By: Mary F.

A searing, post-apocalyptic novel about a father and son's fight to survive, this \\"tale of survival and the miracle of goodness only adds to McCarthy's stature as a living master. It's gripping, frightening and, ultimately, beautiful\\" (San Francisco Chronicle). A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food and each other. The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, \\"each the other's world entire,\\" are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PfmjWho_zOAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classic American Railroads","description":"This book picks up where the previous two Classic American titles left off, focusing on the golden age of American railroading from 1945 to the early 1970s.

A proposal to perform his work ignites controversy in Israel. Wagner's The Ride of the Valkyries blares from helicopters slicing the air of Apocalypse Now. His name leads a list of Germany's spiritual heroes against a flaming backdrop in Anselm Kiefer's largest work. Idolized by Nietzsche, appropriated by Hitler, defended by writers from Mann to Adorno, emulated by countless composers, interpreted by artists and filmmakers, Wagner has left us a legacy as complicated as it is profound. To this day the sheer magnitude of his accomplishment retains its power to overwhelm. This book is a measure of that magnitude, an unprecedented attempt to bring together in one volume what is known about the composer's life, his work, and his influence. Unparalleled in its scope and depth, this remarkable compendium offers readers a unique opportunity to understand what this prodigious man has meant to the Western world. Described by Brahms as a man of \\"colossal industry and horrendous energy,\\" Wagner composed dozens of works, many of them towering masterpieces; he influenced a whole generation of conductors, took part in a revolution, counseled kings and diplomats, and organized the building of the Bayreuth festival theater. His writings on a wide variety of subjects fill sixteen substantial volumes, and his thousands of personal letters document a wildly eventful private life. The Wagner Handbook addresses all of these aspects of the composer's life and achievement. Central chapters include an account of Wagner's place in music history by Carl Dahlhaus; Werner Breig's treatment of individual musical works; Peter Wapnewski's discussion of Wagner's operatic works as literature; Isolde Vetter's chapter on Wagner in the history of psychology; surveys of performance questions over the years by Jens Malte Fischer and Oswald Bauer. These and other topics--the individuals who most powerfully influenced the composer and those he influenced, his impact on music history, and the political exploitation of his ideas--are masterfully drawn. From a chronological overview of Wagner's operas to concise, insightful chapters on each important facet of his career, this splendid book offers a full picture of one of the most challenging figures in Western culture. It will prove invaluable to all those who wish to understand Wagner--the man, the music, and finally, the phenomenon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ui1vQgAACAAJ&dq=Wagner+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Family dog: Revolutionary rapid training method ... dog health & care","description":"An illustrated guide to the training, health and care of the family dog.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sZDgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Family+dog:+Revolutionary+rapid+training+method+...+dog+health&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Of molecules and men, (The John Danz lectures)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Romantic Weddings","description":"Wedding planning guidance, unique ideas, inspiring photos, and helpful tips from the creator of RusticWeddingChic.com.

The author of Goodbye to Berlin (1939), the British Isherwood found fame through the adaptation of that work into the stage play and film I Am a Camera and then into the stage musical and film Cabaret. Throughout his career he was a keen observer, always seemingly in the right place at the right time. Whether in Berlin in the 1930s or in Los Angeles in the 1960s and 1970s, Isherwood (1904--86) reflected on his life and his world and wrote perceptive commentary on contemporary European and American history and culture. His ties to California made him more American than British. \\"I have spent half my life in the United States,\\" he said. \\"Los Angeles is a great place for feeling at home because everybody's from someplace else.\\" Isherwood can be credited for helping make L.A. an acceptable setting for serious fiction, paving the way for John Rechy, Joan Didion, Paul Monette, and Bernard Cooper, among others. The interviews in this volume--two of which have never before been published--stretch over a period of forty years. They address a wide range of topics, including the importance of diary-keeping to his life and work; the interplay between fiction and autobiography; his turning from Christianity to Hinduism; his circle of friends, including W. H. Auden, Aldous Huxley, and E. M. Forster; several important places in his life--Berlin, England, and California; and his homosexual identity. These interviews are substantive, smart, and insightful, allowing the author to discuss his approach to writing of both fiction and nonfiction. \\"More and more,\\" he explains, \\"writing is appearing to me as a kind of self-analysis, a finding-out of something about myself and about the past and about what life is like, as far as I'm concerned: who I am, who these people are, what it's all about.\\" This emphasis on self-discovery comes as no surprise from a writer who mined his own diaries and experiences for inspiration. As an interviewee, Isherwood is introspective, thoughtful, and humorous. James J. Berg is the program director for the Center for Teaching and Learning, Minnesota State Colleges and Universities. Chris Freeman is an assistant professor of English at St. John's University. Berg and Freeman are editors of The Isherwood Century: Essays on the Life and Work of Christopher Isherwood, which was a finalist for the 2001 Lambda Literary Award for Gay Studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HkXKvnDC4uUC&dq=Conversations+with+Christopher+Isherwood+(Literary+Conversations+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Pilot's Log: The Career of E. L. \\"Slonnie\\" Sloniger","description":"The career of one of the USA's most colourful aviationists is told by his son, drawing on the extensive family photography collection and four months of taping his father's reminiscences during an exhilarating period in American aviation history. From the days of landing in open corn fields with the wind at his face to blind instrument landings in a snowstorm, E.L. Slonnie Sloniger was behind the controls of an airplane, open cockpit or closed. Slonnie looped the loop over Nebraska, averted bandits to deliver payrolls in Mexico, and served as an aviation ambassador, inaugurating commercial flight in China. As a pursuit pilot, barnstormer, racer, test pilot, acrobatic pilot, and, ultimately a commercial pilot, Slonnie grew with aviation. Slonnie learned to fly when he entered the heavier-than-air division of the army, because he just didn't want to walk and served in the Air Service in WWI. Upon his return to the US, Slonnie bought his own plane, a Curtiss JN-4 Canuck, and became a barnstormer, selling rides in small towns across the Middle western plains. He flew for early airlines when the biggest customer was the US mail and saw the beginnings of the major lines.

It was a tough and fast-moving campaign, fought against a formidable enemy in harsh terrain and sometimes stupefying heat. Its highpoints - T.E. Lawrence's capture of Aqaba with a charge of Arab horsemen, and Allenby's victory march through the walled city of Jerusalem with fighters overhead and volleys of machine-gun fire in the streets - are classic moments in the history of warfare, but there is more that is equally gripping; the battles of Gaza were among the most hard-fought, and the battle of Megiddo among the most brilliant and decisive victories of the entire war.;Hostilities began with the defence of the Suez Canal, Britain's jugular, against the Ottoman Turks and their German allies. The Allies' thrust into Palestine when Allenby took over from the less aggressive Murray, and Lawrence harnessing the irregular forces of Arab nationalism, were much needed victories. In contrast to the failures at Gallipoli and in Mesopotamia, or the inconclusive battles on the Western Front, Palestine's view of movement and dramatic success made an essential contribution to the Allied will to win. Anthony Bruce has produced a comprehensive military history of the campaign, drawing on the full range of sources including the experiences of those who took part. \\"Bruce is not only a fine miltary historian but an engaging writer who makes the narrative seems as exciting as T E Lawrence's \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom.\\" Norman Stinchcombe.

Their combined efforts restored the veneration of icons, saving Byzantium from a purely symbolic and decorative art and ensuring its influence for centuries to come. In this exhilarating and highly entertaining account, one of the foremost historians of the medieval period tells the story of how these fascinating women exercised imperial sovereignty with consummate skill and sometimes ruthless tactics. Though they gained access to the all-pervasive authority of the Byzantine ruling dynasty through marriage, all three continued to wear the imperial purple and wield tremendous power as widows. From Constantinople, their own Queen City, the empresses undermined competitors and governed like men. They conducted diplomacy across the known world, negotiating with the likes of Charlemagne, Roman popes, and the great Arab caliph Harun al Rashid. Vehemently rejecting the ban on holy images instituted by their male relatives, Irene and Theodora used craft and power to reverse the official iconoclasm and restore icons to their place of adoration in the Eastern Church. In so doing, they profoundly altered the course of history. The art and not only the art of Byzantium, of Islam, and of the West would have been very different without them. As Judith Herrin traces the surviving evidence, she evokes the complex and deeply religious world of Constantinople in the aftermath of Arab conquest. She brings to life its monuments and palaces, its court ceremonies and rituals, the role of eunuchs (the \\"third sex\\"), bride shows, and the influence of warring monks and patriarchs. Based on new research and written for a general audience, Women in Purple reshapes our understanding of an empire that lasted a thousand years and splashes fresh light on the relationship of women to power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ku0zEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tisa","description":"We Have a Religion: The 1920s Pueblo Indian Dance Controversy and American Religious Freedom","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Zw2bzQEACAAJ&dq=Tisa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hotel Pastis","description":"A beguiling novel of romance, adventure, and tongue-in-cheek suspense set in the South of France, from the beloved, best-selling author of A Year in Provence.

Excerpted from Invitation to Love. 108 Reminders for the Enlightened Ones \\"The greatest blessing in my life was the gift of being in the physical presence of Babaji in Herrekhan in 1980. One day he said that he would be leaving his body, I asked him if he would still come to me if I asked. He simply looked at me and smiled knowingly and said: \\"Of course!\\" Recently, my work healing moved to a new level. Some of the recent miracles have been so powerful as to leave me shaky. I could only turn to God to keep myself stable and humble; and so I asked for his advice. Well, he has answered my request. And I imagine he will answer the prayers of many others, through the writings of Ivonne Delaflor. In them I recognize his voice, his humor, his teaching. Thank you Babaji!

It tells of his long, desperate ascent and of the magnificent enlightening that awaited him at the summit, the fruit of which is in this book. The book articulates the entire spiritual process, from Spirit-Baptism through Nirvana, and then critiques both Protestant Christianity and Roman Catholicism as spiritual vehicles, through the ancient eye of a mystic. It speaks of religious fear, sexual ethics, spiritual awakenings and the confusing variety of religious and spiritual offerings. By illuminating universal spiritual principles it crosses all denominational lines. It examines what Protestant and Catholic theologians and exegetes have learned about the real Christ from the latest available historical data. And it concludes that modern Christianity has strayed far from the theology of Christ and incorrectly characterized both Christ and his mission. It is nothing short of a spiritual masterpiece!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2o0gPQAACAAJ&dq=In+Defense+of+the+Christ:+Why+Jesus+Would+Disown+Christianity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Science and the Secrets of Nature","description":"In closely examining this rich but little-known source of literature, Eamon reveals that printing technology and popular culture had as great, if not stronger, an impact on early modern science as did the traditional academic disciplines. Medieval interest in the secrets of nature was spurred in part by ancient works such as Pliny's Natural History. As medieval experimenters adapted ancient knowledge to their changing needs, they created their own books of secrets, which expressed the uncritical, empiricist approach of popular culture rather than the subtle argumentation of scholastic science. The crude experimental methodology advanced by the \\"professors of secrets\\" became for the \\"new philosophers\\" of the seventeenth century a potent ideological weapon in the challenge of natural philosophy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rB3cIVVq-YUC&dq=Science+and+the+Secrets+of+Nature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Notary law, procedures & ethics: A complete reference on notarial laws and procedures in America","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=shQdGQAACAAJ&dq=Notary+law,+procedures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Songs & Prayers from Taize","description":"Sing along to favorite songs from Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood!

The authors explore every aspect of life in Rus, using evidence and the fruits of post-Soviet historiography. They describe the rise of a polity centred on Kiev, the coming of Christianity, and the increasing prosperity of the region even as, with the proliferation of new dynastic centres, the balance of power shifted northwards and westwards. Fractured, violent and transitory though it often is, this is a story of growth and achievement - and a masterly piece of historical synthesis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=17DYjwEACAAJ&dq=The+Emergence+of+Rus:+750-1200+(Longman+History+of+Russia)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Differential Equations, 3rd edition (Schaum's Outline Series)","description":"Tough Test Questions?

As the citrus-growing regions of the San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys in eastern Los Angeles County expanded during the early twentieth century, the agricultural industry there developed along segregated lines, primarily between white landowners and Mexican and Asian laborers. Initially, these communities were sharply divided. But Los Angeles, unlike other agricultural regions, saw important opportunities for intercultural exchange develop around the arts and within multiethnic community groups. Whether fostered in such informal settings as dance halls and theaters or in such formal organizations as the Intercultural Council of Claremont or the Southern California Unity Leagues, these interethnic encounters formed the basis for political cooperation to address labor discrimination and solve problems of residential and educational segregation. Though intercultural collaborations were not always successful, Garcia argues that they constitute an important chapter not only in Southern California's social and cultural development but also in the larger history of American race relations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NELcVmnIiEQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best Little Stories from World War II","description":"BEHIND THE GREAT POWERS, global military conflict, and infamous battles are more than 100 incredible stories that bring to life the Second World War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mfxl4rwn_-4C&dq=Best+Little+Stories+from+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sorrows of Priapus (Sorrows of Priapus Ppr)","description":"\\"The Elegies of Tibullus\\" from Tibullus.

The third edition expands and deepens this perspective, further developing the basic premise that, by being situated within the people:environment interface, the social work profession is distinct from other service professions. The book presents the \\"what\\" (theories and concepts) and the \\"how\\" (practice methods) to help people with their life stressors and, simultaneously, to influence communities, organizations, and policymakers to be more responsive to them. In this edition, Gitterman and Germain examine major changes to our socioeconomic and political landscape. They restore a chapter on the history of social work practice, offering a view of the limited services for African Americans provided by settlements and charity organization societies. Building on the African American self-help and mutual aid traditions, this chapter traces the replication of a parallel social service system by African American leaders for their own communities. The chapter also addresses the impact of contemporary societal trends, including the global economy, immigration, cultural changes, and the technology revolution. In addition, it discusses current professional contexts of managed mental health care, evidence-based practice, and the professional uses of technology. A new chapter explores issues and processes embedded in assessment, practice monitoring, and practice evaluation. The volume continues to feature innovative schema for assessment and intervention with respect to stressful life transitions and traumatic events, environmental pressures, and dysfunctional interpersonal processes. Practice illustrations offer reflections of today's major social issues, such as AIDS, homelessness, and modern forms of violence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GoCfifznTKIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faith Hill -- Breathe: Piano/Vocal/Chords","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"BETTY'S POND: A NOVEL STARTING IN NORTH FLORIDA.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y_q1GwAACAAJ&dq=BETTY%27S+POND:+A+NOVEL+STARTING+IN+NORTH+FLORIDA.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SECRET SEVEN WIN THROUGH","description":"Solve the mystery with the Secret Seven - everyone's favourite detective club!

Noted practitioners, specialists, and researchers take an interdisciplinary approach to analyze the multiple barriers for access and care to indigenous women that had been complicated by longstanding gender inequities, poverty, stigmatization, lack of education, war, obstetrical violence, and differences in language and customs, all of which contribute to unnecessary maternal morbidity and mortality. Emphasis is placed on indigenous cultures and folkways from traditional midwives and birth attendants to indigenous botanical medication and traditional healing and spiritual practices and how they may effectively coexist with modern biomedical care. Throughout these chapters, the main theme is clear: the rights of indigenous women to culturally respective reproductive health care and a successful pregnancy leading to the birth of healthy children.

The first complete English-language translation of the original Coptic Gospel of Mary, with line-by-line commentary ? Reveals the eminence of the divine feminine in Christian thought ? Offers a new perspective on the life of one of the most controversial figures in the Western spiritual tradition Perhaps no figure in biblical scholarship has been the subject of more controversy and debate than Mary Magdalene. Also known as Miriam of Magdala, Mary Magdalene was considered by the apostle John to be the founder of Christianity because she was the first witness to the Resurrection. In most theological studies she has been depicted as a reformed prostitute, the redeemed sinner who exemplifies Christ's mercy. Today's reader can ponder her role in the gospels of Philip, Thomas, Peter, and Bartholomew--the collection of what have come to be known as the Gnostic gospels rejected by the early Christian church. Mary's own gospel is among these, but until now it has remained unknown to the public at large. Orthodox theologian Jean-Yves Leloup's translation of the Gospel of Mary from the Coptic and his thorough and profound commentary on this text are presented here for the first time in English. The gospel text and the spiritual exegesis of Leloup together reveal unique teachings that emphasize the eminence of the divine feminine and an abiding love of nature over the dualistic and ascetic interpretations of Christianity presented elsewhere. What emerges from this important source text and commentary is a renewal of the sacred feminine in the Western spiritual tradition and a new vision for Christian thought and faith throughout the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yFsoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Night of the Living Dummy (Goosebumps, No 7)","description":"Amy s ventriloquist dummy, Dennis, has lost his head   for real.

Crocker offers in this book and its accompanying compact disc an introduction to the history and meaning of the Gregorian chant. He explains how Gregorian chant began, what functions and meanings it had over time, who heard it and where, and how it was composed, learned, written down and handed on. Crocker explains Gregorian chant and its functions within modern catholic liturgy as well as its position outside this liturgy, where the modern listener may hear it just as music. He describes the origins of the chant in the early Middle Ages, details its medieval development and use, and considers how it survived without, and later with, musical notation. The author probes the paradoxical position of the chant in monastic life -- serving as an expression of liturgical fellowship on the one hand and as the medium of solitary mystic ascent on the other. The book also includes a detailed commentary on each of twenty-six complete chants performed by the Orlando Consort and by the author on the accompanying compact disc. --From publisher's description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GziiuuRgoV0C&dq=An+Introduction+to+Gregorian+Chant&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Supernatural","description":"Revelation From a Near-Death Experience compares elements of Scripture, science, and personal revelation received during a near-death experience, which leads you to understand why things are the way they are, why you are you, and what your earthly and eternal purpose is.

In spiritual traditions East and West, light is not only ubiquitous but something that assumes strikingly similar forms in altogether different historical and cultural settings. This study examines light as an aspect of religiously valued experiences and its entailments for mystical theology, philosophy, politics, and religious art. The essays in this volume make an important contribution to religious studies by proposing that it is misleading to conceive of religious experience in terms of an irreconcilable dichotomy between universality and cultural construction. An esteemed group of contributors, representing the study of Asian and Western religious traditions from a range of disciplinary perspectives, suggests that attention to various forms of divine radiance shows that there is indeed a range of principles that, if not universal, are nevertheless very widely occurring and amenable to fruitful comparative inquiry. What results is a work of enormous scope, demonstrating compelling cross-connections that will be of value to scholars of comparative religions, mysticism, and the relationship between art and the sacred.

You've seen him on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart offering up his trademark angry observational humor on everything from politics to pop culture. You've seen his energetic stand-up performances on HBO, Comedy Central, and in venues across the globe. Now, for the first time, Lewis Black translates his volcanic eruptions into book form in Nothing's Sacred, a collection of rants against stupidity and authority, which oftentimes go hand in hand. With subversive wit and intellectual honesty, Lewis examines the events of his life that shaped his antiauthoritarian point of view and developed his comedic perspective. Growing up in 1950s suburbia when father knew best and there was a sitcom to prove it, he began to regard authority with a jaundiced eye at an early age. And as that sentiment grew stronger with each passing year, so did his ability to hone in on the absurd. True to form, he puts common sense above ideology and distills hilarious, biting commentary on all things politically and culturally relevant. \\"No one is safe from Lewis Black's comic missiles.\\" (New York Times) You have been warned....","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F_3x_azTqfAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Banditti of the Plains or The Cattlemen's Invasion of Wyoming in 1892","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Brave Free Men","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The rise of American civilization","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oEb7zQEACAAJ&dq=The+rise+of+American+civilization&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Credit Repair Kit","description":"Now, you can finally end the cycle of bad credit and get back on your feet by following the step-by-step advice and tools in Credit Repair Kit For Dummies, 2nd Edition.

In Fiji open ethnic competition led to the seizure of power by one ethnic group over the other.

A decade before, the German jurist Carl Schmitt had coined the term 'political theology' in order to designate the Christian theological foundations of modern sovereignty and legal order. In a specular and opposite gesture, Buber argued that the covenant at Sinai established YHWH as the King of the Israelites and simultaneously promulgated the principle that no human being could become sovereign over this people. In so doing, Buber offered an interpretation of Jewish theocracy that is both republican and anarchic. Republican because, by pivoting on the idea that democracy is a function of a people's fidelity to a prophetic higher law, theocracy displaces the central role of the human sovereign.

The Dalai Lama here discusses the need for religious practice and the importance of kindness and compassion. Originally written for Tibetan lay people, this was the Dalai Lama's first book on Buddhist philosophy to appear in English, and Prof. Lopez's new introduction places these teachings in their proper historical context. This is an invaluable handbook for both personal use and academic study of the Buddhist path. \\"Written for both Tibetan and Western readers, Opening the Eye of New Awareness is the Dalai Lama's first religious work. It is not an edited transcript of public lectures, but is His Holliness' own summation of Buddhist doctrine and practice. Completed in 1963, just four years after his escape from Tibet and four years after completing his religious education, it is a work of consummate scholarship by a twenty-seven year-old geshe, wise beyond his years. Nowhere in his many subsequent works does one find a more clear and concise exposition of the essentials of Buddhist thought.

Recent perspectives on learning, however, suggest that the learner can play an active, indeed, intentional role in the process of knowledge restructuring. This volume explores this new, innovative view of conceptual change learning using original contributions drawn from renowned scholars in a variety of disciplines.

The usefulness of this methodology is demonstrated through the design of an operational amplifier. This methodology consists of the following iterative steps: description of the circuit functionality at a high level of abstraction using signal flow graphs; equivalent transformations and modifications of the graph to the form where all important parameters are controlled by dedicated feedback loops; and implementation of the structure using a library of elementary cells. Operational Amplifier Speed and Accuracy Improvement shows how to choose structures and design circuits which improve an operational amplifier's important parameters such as speed to power ratio, open loop gain, common-mode voltage rejection ratio, and power supply rejection ratio. The same approach is used to design clamps and limiting circuits which improve the performance of the amplifier outside of its linear operating region, such as slew rate enhancement, output short circuit current limitation, and input overload recovery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iPzqBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twin Cities Metro Street Atlas 2000: King of Maps (USA StreetFinder Atlas)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Fresno Armenians : History of a Diaspora Community","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mRV2AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Fresno+Armenians+:+History+of+a+Diaspora+Community&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What's the Difference?: A Compendium of Commonly Confused and Misused Words","description":"A comprehensive reference explains the difference between commonly confused words with more than eight hundred entries such as Copyright versus Trademark, Billiards versus Pool, and Sherbet versus Sorbet.

Ruth Tiffany Barnhouse, M.D., Th.M., Harvard University Robert A. Johnson's classic work exploring the differences between man and woman, female and male newly reissued. What does it really mean to be a man? What are some of the landmarks along the road to mature masculinity? And what of the feminine components of a man's personality? Women have developed, over the centuries, considerable expertise in the technique of adapting to men, and for good reason, but that is not the same as truly understanding them. The transition from male childhood to real manhood is a complicated struggle, and explored in this book. As timely today as when it was first published, He provides a fascinating look into male identity and how female dynamics influence men.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OM4QxT2ZozgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Iyanla Live Volume 7 Transformation","description":"These divas represent the voices of past and future generations, such as Tyra Banks, Terry McMillan, Harriette Cole, Maya Angelou, Iyanla Vanzant, Nikki Giovanni, Dawn Davis, Adrienne Ingrum, Carol Mackey, Oprah Winfrey, Rosa Parks, Shirley Chisholm, Coretta Scott King, Zora Neal Hurston, and Octavia Butler.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jdCAQJwYeXMC&dq=Iyanla+Live+Volume+7+Transformation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Resurrection of Jesus","description":"The question of the historicity of Jesus' resurrection has been repeatedly probed, investigated and debated. And the results have varied widely. Perhaps some now regard this issue as the burned-over district of New Testament scholarship. Could there be any new and promising approach to this problem? Yes, answers Michael Licona. And he convincingly points us to a significant deficiency in approaching this question: our historiographical orientation and practice. So he opens this study with an extensive consideration of historiography and the particular problem of investigating claims of miracles. This alone is a valuable contribution. But then Licona carefully applies his principles and methods to the question of Jesus' resurrection. In addition to determining and working from the most reliable sources and bedrock historical evidence, Licona critically weighs other prominent hypotheses. His own argument is a challenging and closely argued case for the historicity of the resurrection of Jesus, the Christ. Any future approaches to dealing with this 'prize puzzle' of New Testament study will need to be routed through The Resurrection of Jesus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1mfnDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Resurrection+of+Jesus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rice Bible: The Definitive Sourcebook with over 500 Illustrations","description":"Presents a selection of recipes for soups and stews from all over the world, with cultural commentary on each recipe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hI82SfAfz9MC&dq=The+Rice+Bible:+The+Definitive+Sourcebook+with+over+500+Illustrations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sands of Mars","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aQCfPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Sands+of+Mars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Black parent's handbook to educating your children: Outside of the classroom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w1p_GwAACAAJ&dq=A+Black+parent%27s+handbook+to+educating+your+children:+Outside+of+the+classroom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seven men,","description":"In Seven Men, New York Times bestselling author Eric Metaxas presents seven exquisitely crafted short portraits of widely known but not well understood Christian men, each of whom uniquely showcases a commitment to live by certain virtues in the truth of the gospel. Written in a beautiful and engaging style, Seven Men addresses what it means (or should mean) to be a man today, at a time when media and popular culture present images of masculinity that are not the picture presented in Scripture and historic civil life. This book answers questions like: What does it take to be a true exemplar as a father, brother, husband, leader, coach, counselor, change agent, and wise man? What does it mean to stand for honesty, courage, and charity? And how can you stand especially at times when the culture and the world run counter to those values? Each of the seven biographies represents the life of a man who experienced the struggles and challenges to be strong in the face of forces and circumstances that would have destroyed the resolve of lesser men. Each of the seven men profiled George Washington, William Wilberforce, Eric Liddell, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Jackie Robinson, John Paul II, and Charles Colson call the reader to a more elevated walk and lifestyle, one that embodies the gospel in the world around us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=deQ3CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"VIRTUAL REALITY","description":"A comprehensive overview of developments in augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality and how they could affect every part of our lives. After years of hype, extended reality augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR) has entered the mainstream. Commercially available, relatively inexpensive VR headsets transport wearers to other realities fantasy worlds, faraway countries, sporting events in ways that even the most ultra-high-definition screen cannot. AR glasses receive data in visual and auditory forms that are more useful than any laptop or smartphone can deliver. Immersive MR environments blend physical and virtual reality to create a new reality. In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, technology writer Samuel Greengard offers an accessible overview of developments in extended reality, explaining the technology, considering the social and psychological ramifications, and discussing possible future directions. Greengard describes the history and technological development of augmented and virtual realities, including the latest research in the field, and surveys the various shapes and forms of VR, AR, and MR, including head-mounted displays, mobile systems, and goggles. He examines the way these technologies are shaping and reshaping some professions and industries, and explores how extended reality affects psychology, morality, law, and social constructs. It's not a question of whether extended reality will become a standard part of our world, he argues, but how, when, and where these technologies will take hold. Will extended reality help create a better world? Will it benefit society as a whole? Or will it merely provide financial windfalls for a select few? Greengard's account equips us to ask the right questions about a transformative technology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a06qDwAAQBAJ&dq=VIRTUAL+REALITY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The myth of meaning in the work of C.G.

The neglected five acres were not only the burial site for generations of her family but also the designated resting ground for many in the nearby, down-on-its-luck logging town. Living Among Headstones chronicles the author's experiences as she takes charge of this sacred land and finds herself plotting graves, consoling families, and confronting the funeral industry. Filled with humor, singular events, pathos, and unexpected smiles, the pages offer historical asides and moving personal stories. For example, Shannon explores the language and customs of funerals as she agonizes over how to approach families who have covered graves with plastic flowers and inappropriate ornaments. In doing so, she contemplates the myriad ways cultures past and present approach the dead. Living Among Headstones is, in part, about rural cemeteries in contemporary America, but the sum is a meditation on how we long for those we love to have a continuing place in our world, and it focuses as much on life as death.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l_N-tAEACAAJ&dq=Living+Among+Headstones:+Life+in+a+Country+Cemetery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reading Rhetorically: A Reader for Writers","description":"This aims-based rhetoric and reader teaches students analytical reading, academic writing, and inquiry as the keys to success in college.

Life with Rat as a neighbor isn't run-of-the-mill, but things turn even stranger when Rat announces that he (and Christopher) are going on a search for the Holy Grail. The saga begins in Rennes-le-Chateau in France, where in 1891 a local priest discovered a treasure whose mystery remains unsolved. Once Christopher and Rat have written a list of things to do (\\"Buy metal detectors!\\"), they need only unravel a tale involving the Cathars, the Knights Templar, the Man in the Iron Mask, and Louis XIV and along the way, visit Paris, Rome, Glastonbury, and Tintagel and perhaps join the Masons (Rat thinks they know something). The legend of the Holy Grail is far from unknown, but this is the first time the quest has been given the punk rock treatment.

Columnist for The New Yorker for over half a century and co-author of Strunk and White's The Elements of Style, White hit his stride as an American literary icon when he began publishing his 'One Man's Meat' columns from his saltwater farm on the coast of Maine. In E. B. White on Dogs, his granddaughter and manager of his literary estate, Martha White, has compiled the best and funniest of his essays, poems, letters, and sketches depicting over a dozen of White's various canine companions. Featured here are favorite essays such as 'Two Letters, Both Open,' where White takes on the Internal Revenue Service, and also 'Bedfellows,' with its 'fraudulent reports'; from White's ignoble old dachshund, Fred. ('I just saw an eagle go by. It was carrying a baby.') From The New Yorker's 'The Talk of the Town' are some little-known Notes and Comment pieces covering dog shows, sled dog races, and the trials and tribulations of city canines, chief among them a Scotty called Daisy who was kicked out of Schrafft's, arrested, and later run down by a Yellow Cab, prompting The New Yorker to run her 'Obituary.' Some previously unpublished photographs from the E. B. White Estate show the family dogs, from the first collie, to various labs, Scotties, dachshunds, half-breeds, and mutts, all well-loved. This is a book for readers and writers who recognize a good sentence and a masterful turn of a phrase; for E. B.

In 1913, explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson hired William McKinlay to join the crew of the Karluk, the leading ship of his new Arctic expedition. Stefansson's mission was to chart the waters north of Alaska; yet the Karluk's crew was untrained, the ship was ill-suited to the icy conditions, and almost at once the Karluk was crushed-at which point Stefansson abandoned his crew to continue his journey on another ship. This is the only firsthand account of what followed: a nightmare struggle in which half the crew perished, one was mysteriously shot, and the rest were near death by the time of their rescue twelve months later. Written some sixty years after the fact, and drawing extensively on his own daily log, McKinlay's narrative of this doomed expedition is rendered with remarkable clarity of recollection, and with a combination of horror and a level of self-possession that, to modern eyes, may seem incredible. Like most of his companions, McKinlay was inexperienced, without a day's training in the skills essential to survival in the Arctic. Yet he and many of his fellow crewmen, with the help of an Eskimo family accustomed to such conditions, survived a year under the harshest of conditions, enduring 80-mile-per-hour gales and temperatures well below zero with only the barest of provisions and almost no hope of contact with civilization. Nearly a century later, this remains one of the most compelling survival stories ever written-an extraordinary testament to man's overpowering will to live.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MrEaCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bravo 20: The Bombing of the American West (Creating the North American Landscape)","description":"Shows public lands illegally used to test bombs","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W_D1swEACAAJ&dq=Bravo+20:+The+Bombing+of+the+American+West+(Creating+the+North+American+Landscape)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The special functions and their approximations (Mathematics in science and engineering)","description":"Special Functions and Their Approximations: v. 2.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z_ZQAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+special+functions+and+their+approximations+(Mathematics+in+science+and+engineering)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under a Wing: A Memoir","description":"The poignant and superbly written memoir (Chicago Tribune) of growing up as the daughter of Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh. ?

Corvette is Chevrolet's iconic performance car. Its importance to the brand cannot be overstated. Thus each new generation is sweated by Chevy's designers, engineers, marketing staff, and executives to ensure that it sets the bar higher than the preceding version. With the eighth generation, Chevrolet has done more than raise the bar or move the goalpost--they've torn down the stadium and started from scratch. For the first time ever in a production version, the new Corvette features a mid-engine configuration. Though Corvette engineers have experimented with this engine placement over the past several decades, 2020 marks the first time GM has committed it to production cars. Corvette already had prodigious power on tap, but its front-engine configuration put some limitations on its handling and traction. The new mid-engine Corvette eliminates any final performance barriers and takes the battle to supercar rivals like Ferrari, Lamborghini, and McLaren. It's the story every Corvette fan needs to read.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jBwSEAAAQBAJ&dq=Corvette&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences)","description":"This volume brings together investigators working on the clinical problem of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as neuroscientists from other disciplines.

He then proceeded to a youth camp on the island of Ut?ya, where he killed sixty-nine more, most of them teenage members of Norway's governing Labour Party. In One of Us, the journalist ?sne Seierstad tells the story of this terrible day and what led up to it. What made Breivik, a gifted child from an affluent neighborhood in Oslo, become a terrorist? As in her bestseller The Bookseller of Kabul, Seierstad excels at the vivid portraiture of lives under stress. She delves deep into Breivik's troubled childhood, showing how a hip-hop and graffiti aficionado became a right-wing activist and Internet game addict, and then an entrepreneur, Freemason, and self-styled master warrior who sought to \\"save Norway\\" from the threat of Islam and multiculturalism. She writes with equal intimacy about Breivik's victims, tracing their political awakenings, aspirations to improve their country, and ill-fated journeys to the island. By the time Seierstad reaches Ut?ya, we know both the killer and those he will kill. We have also gotten to know an entire country famously peaceful and prosperous, and utterly incapable of protecting its youth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=szqwBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The naked city (Dell first edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NYTWGwAACAAJ&dq=The+naked+city+(Dell+first+edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Brass Check: A Study of American Journalism","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wS9EAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Brass+Check:+A+Study+of+American+Journalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christianity in a Revolutionary Age.

Yet the vision of America as \\"home\\" was more than a metaphor for women's stake in the process of conquest--it took deliberate work to create and uphold. Treating white and indigenous women's struggles as part of the same history, Jane E. Simonsen argues that as both cultural workers and domestic laborers insisted upon the value of their work to \\"civilization,\\" they exposed the inequalities integral to both the nation and the household. Simonsen illuminates discussions about the value of women's work through analysis of texts and images created by writers, women's rights activists, reformers, anthropologists, photographers, field matrons, and Native American women. She argues that women such as Caroline Soule, Alice Fletcher, E. Jane Gay, Anna Dawson Wilde, and Angel DeCora called upon the rhetoric of sentimental domesticity, ethnographic science, public display, and indigenous knowledge as they sought to make the gendered and racial order of the nation visible through homes and the work performed in them. Focusing on the range of materials through which domesticity was produced in the West, Simonsen integrates new voices into the study of domesticity's imperial manifestations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x7VQ_UY2IOYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Once off guard (Popular library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jeCMtAEACAAJ&dq=Once+off+guard+(Popular+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chord Progressions for Guitar: 101 Patterns for All Styles from Folk to Funk!","description":"This second edition of Song Sheets to Software includes completely revised and updated listings of music software, instructional media, and music-related Internet Web sites of use to all musicians, whether hobbyist or professional.

This uniquely contemporary guide to understanding the timeless message of Buddhism, and in particular its relevance in actual human relations, was inspired by Shantideva s Guide to the Bodhisattva s Way Of Life, which the author translated into English, the oral instructions of living Buddhist masters, Heidegger s classic Being and Time, and the writings of the Christian theologians Paul Tillich and John MacQuarrie.

Santayana was versed in the history of his subject, from Plato and Aristotle to Schopenhauer and Taine in the nineteenth century. Santayana took as his task a complete rethinking of the idea that beauty is embedded in objects. Rather, beauty is an emotion, a value, and a sense of the good. In this aesthetics was unlike ethics: not a correction of evil or pursuit of the virtuous. Rather it is a pleasure that residues in the sense of self. The work is divided into chapters on the materials of beauty, form, and expression. A good many of Santayana's later works are presaged by this early effort.

Her vivid and detailed account demonstrates that contrary to official rhetoric, the current people of Greek Macedonia ultimately derive from profoundly diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Throughout the last century, a succession of regional and world conflicts, economic migrations, and shifting state formations has engendered an intricate pattern of population movements and refugee resettlements across the region. Unraveling the complex social, political, and economic processes through which these disparate peoples have become culturally amalgamated within an overarchingly Greek national identity, this book provides an important corrective to the Macedonian picture and an insightful analysis of the often volatile conjunction of ethnicities and nationalisms in the twentieth century. \\"Combining the thoughtful use of theory with a vivid historical ethnography, this is an important, courageous, and pioneering work which opens up the whole issue of nation-building in northern Greece.\\" Mark Mazower, University of Sussex","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vGQ2enTZWO4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Brannocks","description":"The Brannocks Matt Braun Earl Brannock was a gambling man who fled the fires of the Civil War and found a boomtown called Denver in a land being built on dreams, luck, and gold.

They believed that these, and the interaction of the five elements - wood, fire, earth, metal and water - governed human affairs and that together they demonstrated a unity in multiplicity, a harmony in divergence. Taking the same frame of reference, Liam d'Arcy Brown set out to travel to the four corners of the People's Republic in an attempt to reconcile modern China's seemingly irreconcilable extremes. His 10,000-mile journey took him to an isolated fishing community in the East China Sea, a tropical holiday resort on the tip of Hainan Island, a Muslim city on the Silk Road and a riverside village in remote Manchuria. In each, he discovered aspects of China that the wider world seldom glimpses. Yet despite the astonishing contrasts of her physical and social geography, the variety of her peoples and the tangled web of her many histories and possible destinies, some constants remain. Pork buns steaming in a bamboo basket, gold Chinese characters pasted to a doorway on a red paper diamond, empty crates of beer bottles, a battered thermos flask stencilled with the Double Happiness symbol - all these endure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sK92QgAACAAJ&dq=Green+Dragon,+Sombre+Warrior:+Travels+to+China%27s+Extremes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands","description":"??

Employers who unknowingly use invalid tests or recruitment procedures that have an adverse impact are reducing minority and/or female representation in their workforce, unfairly screening out qualified workers and (worst of all) just plain discriminating. Dan Biddle's Adverse Impact and Test Validation provides you with analyses that allow you to identify which of your selection procedures have adverse impact. The validation steps will help you decide whether to keep the selection procedure (because it's valid), change it, or stop using it altogether. This second edition contains new material on using multiple regression to evaluate pay practices and provides step-by-step instructions for using SPSS or Excel for evaluating your company's pay practices for possible inequities. New content on how to define \\"Internet applicants\\" and set up defensible Basic Qualifications (BQs) for online recruiting will help employers ensure compliance with EEO regulations and screen in qualified applicants. Specific guidelines for developing and validating written job knowledge tests, such as those used for police and fire promotional testing, have also been included in this new edition. The CD included in the back cover of the book includes tools (which may be used on a trial evaluation basis) describing several of the functions described in the book, including Adverse Impact Toolkit?, Test Validation and Analysis Program? (TVAP?), Guidelines Oriented Job Analysis? (GOJA?) Manual, and Content Validity Checklists. This highly pragmatic guide goes beyond the concepts, theories and ideas behind adverse impact and test validation. It not only explains what to do but crucially, also shows you how to do it. The second edition has been expanded to include two brand new chapters with a new Appendix and comes with new editions of the accompanying software. As a means of protecting your organization from litigation, damage to employee relations and to your corporate reputation, Adverse Impact and Test Validation is a 'must-have' purchase for human resource professionals, testing and recruitment specialists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_AwkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Animate Form","description":"CD-ROM contains animations which provide further illustration of the projects in the book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wimyEAh6TowC&dq=Animate+Form&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emyl Jenkins' Reproduction Furniture: Antiques for the Next Generation","description":"Addressing a recent surge in reproduction furniture's popularity, a guide summarizes the events that shaped the American furniture industry","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YW9OAAAAYAAJ&dq=Emyl+Jenkins%27+Reproduction+Furniture:+Antiques+for+the+Next+Generation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ladon (Monsters of mythology)","description":"Retells the myth of Ladon, the enormous serpent used by Hera to try to destroy Hercules.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_tkMAQAACAAJ&dq=Ladon+(Monsters+of+mythology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Reading the Constitution","description":"Our Constitution speaks in general terms of liberty and property, of the privileges and immunities of citizens, and of the equal protection of the laws--open-ended phrases that seem to invite readers to reflect in them their own visions and agendas.

Somehow, I knew deep down in my own heart, ill versed as I was in such things, that I should never send her such a gift myself. I would climb to the top of Gander Knob for a wild rose or rhododendron; I would stir the leaves from the gap to the river in search of a simple spray of arbutus for her. But step before her with my arms clasping a tin can with a geranium plant? Heaven forbid! Perry was different. The suggestion pleased him. He was rubbing his hands and smiling in great contentment. \\"I might send a po-em with it,\\" he said. \\"I've allus found that poetry kind of catches ahold of a girl when you are away.

I mind when I was keepin' company with Ehoda Spiker--she afterward married Ulysses G.

By analyzing selected work of major pre- and post-revolutionary literary figures, Talattof shows how Persian literary history has not been an integrated continuum but a series of distinct episodic movements shaped by shifting ideologies. Drawing on western concepts, modern Persian literature has responded to changing social and political conditions through complex strategies of metaphorical and allegorical representations that both construct and denounce cultural continuities. The book provides a unique contribution in that it draws on texts that demonstrate close affinity to such diverse ideologies as modernism, Marxism, feminism, and Islam. Each ideological standard has influenced the form, characterization, and figurative language of literary texts as well as setting the criteria for literary criticism and determining which issues are to be the focus of literary journals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JPWwm_k8eLMC&dq=The+Politics+of+Writing+in+Iran:+A+History+of+Modern+Persian+Literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Proud Youth","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F0CFAAAACAAJ&dq=Proud+Youth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pokemon Emerald (Prima Official Game Guide)","description":"It's a Team Aqua and Team Magma rematch!

Even before she skyrocketed to movie stardom at age twenty-two, she had already experienced more than most women twice her age: international modeling at fifteen, marriage at seventeen, and motherhood at nineteen. Then came Summer of '42. If her career was already a dream come true, however, her private nightmare had just begun. The dark years that followed saw scandal and sorrow offset by beauty and style: eight marriages, nine miscarriages, a near-fatal gunshot wound, and three other near-death experiences. Even motherhood proved a painful trial when one of her husbands fell into the abyss of sexual abuse, with Aimee, the eldest of her three children, as his victim. But Jennifer O'Neill is a survivor -- by the grace of God. Now, with her faith intact, she looks back on the roller coaster of her past with an unsparing honesty tempered with compassion, humor, and a new understanding of herself. Her story is an unforgettable drama of a beautiful, intelligent, talented, whimsical, yet deeply troubled woman redeemed in the end by the gift of her spiritual awakening.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=docXHAAACAAJ&dq=Surviving+Myself&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All But the Waltz: A Memoir of Five Generations in the Life of a Montana Family","description":"In language reminiscent of the wild beauty of Big Sky Country, the author gives readers a glimpse into the lives of her family as she traces their connection to Montana's natural and human landscape.

But the easy concept of globalization poses as many questions as it answers and it is the purpose of this book to address these challenges. In Governments, Globalization, and International Business a prestigious group of international scholars explore in detail the consequences of globalization defined as the deepening structural interdependence of the world economy. In Part 1 John Dunning, Richard Lipsey, Susan Strange and Stephen Kobrin analyse these changes from different disciplinary perspectives and intellectual backgrounds. The basic question they address is what are the consequences of globalization on the nature, form, and level of domestic economic activity?. In doing so, they also consider the increasing mobility of knowledge and information, the role of international corporations, and the sovereignty of the nation state in the modern borderless world. In Part 2 the different experiences and policies of a number of economies are assessed in a series of country studies, These include the G7 countries as well as the developing East Asian economies, Latin America and smaller developed countries. In the final part John Stopford and Edward Graham stand back and look at the changing role of National and Supranational governance. In doing so they underscore a fundamental tenet of the volume, that globalization requires national governments to re-evaluate various factors of their systemic governance. Yet despite apparently convergent trends they argue there are no universal prescriptions for the way governments should respond to globalization, and the policy challenge is a more complex one than merely more or less government.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9QhREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Valkyries","description":"A classic masterwork of spiritual tension and realization from Paulo Coelho, this powerful story of one man s battle with self-doubt and fear is now available in a beautiful new package from HarperOne.

Because we believe that there is more than one way to look at the challenge of getting the most out of your sales career. Our book offers a new way of looking at sales that you're not likely to have encountered. In our experience, sales professionals don't always acknowledge that pressure. Or if they do, they internalize it. That's a big mistake. While most salespeople are well schooled in the nuts and bolts of the selling process, the feeling that there seems to be something missing can cause a loss of optimism and premature burnout. That's where SPROUT! comes in handy. We have found that using a metaphor we call the Sales Garden and its accompanying mind-set can help relieve some harmful stress and put more fun and passion into the selling process. By absorbing our simple Sales Garden concept and following the user-friendly steps outlined in this book, salespeople can beat the career blues and sustain themselves for the long term, regaining their passion for sales in the process. But that's not all. Our simple formula also enables organizations to better retain precious talent by applying a philosophy that supports their sales professionals throughout the inevitable ups and downs that mark a selling career - and that creates a healthy sales framework as well. All this from seeds sowed in our Sales Garden.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8xA4Y4FWfvoC&dq=Sprout!:+Everything+I+Need+to+Know+about+Sales+I+Learned+from+My+Garden&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Visual Neurosciences, 2 Volume Set, (Bradford Books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nowhere is Somewhere","description":"The action-packed finale to Jon Robinson's debut conspiracy thriller trilogy, Nowhere.

Some groups of Christians claimed that there was not one God but two or twelve or thirty. Some believed that the world had not been created by God but by a lesser, ignorant deity. Certain sects maintained that Jesus was human but not divine, while others said he was divine but not human. In Lost Christianities, Bart D. Ehrman offers a fascinating look at these early forms of Christianity and shows how they came to be suppressed, reformed, or forgotten. All of these groups insisted that they upheld the teachings of Jesus and his apostles, and they all possessed writings that bore out their claims, books reputedly produced by Jesus's own followers. Modern archaeological work has recovered a number of key texts, and as Ehrman shows, these spectacular discoveries reveal religious diversity that says much about the ways in which history gets written by the winners. Ehrman's discussion ranges from considerations of various \\"lost scriptures\\"--including forged gospels supposedly written by Simon Peter, Jesus's closest disciple, and Judas Thomas, Jesus's alleged twin brother--to the disparate beliefs of such groups as the Jewish-Christian Ebionites, the anti-Jewish Marcionites, and various \\"Gnostic\\" sects. Ehrman examines in depth the battles that raged between \\"proto-orthodox Christians\\"--those who eventually compiled the canonical books of the New Testament and standardized Christian belief--and the groups they denounced as heretics and ultimately overcame. Scrupulously researched and lucidly written, Lost Christianities is an eye-opening account of politics, power, and the clash of ideas among Christians in the decades before one group came to see its views prevail.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HHDNe8KmMAIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Carved in Rock: Short Stories by Musicians","description":"A collection of short stories by famous musicians includes contributions from such performers as Ray Manzarek, David Bym, Graham Parker, Steve Earle, Suzanne Vega, and Pete Townsend.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7PtNmB6M_WcC&dq=Carved+in+Rock:+Short+Stories+by+Musicians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Waiting Father : Sermons on the Parables of Jesus","description":"The Waiting Father is a collection of sermons by Helmut Thielicke, the great German preacher and theologian, which offer deep insights into the spiritual message of Jesus's fifteen major parables. They were originally preached in Michaelskirche, Hamburg, in the mid-1950s. Thielicke approaches the parables in novel ways. In treating the prodigal son, for instance, he concentrates more on the loving father than the rebellious son, emphasising the centrality of forgiveness. Similarly, when discussing the pharisee and the publican he shows that the publican is guilty of spiritual pride and arrogance, drawing attention to the dangers for the faithful. Both among expositions of the parables and among books for preachers, The Waiting Father stands in a class of its own. Great scholars are usually poor preachers, and great scholars are rarely good preachers, but Thielicke manages to combine distinguished scholarship with fine preaching.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=utPYDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jason X #2: The Experiment","description":"Jason Voorhees is resurrected in space and returns to what he does best; to slice and dice.

Nonmonotonic reasoning methods provide rigor similar to that of classical reasoning; they form a base for validation and verification and therefore increase confidence in intelligent systems that work with incomplete and changing information. Following a brief introduction to the concepts of predicate logic that are needed in the subsequent chapters, this book presents an in depth treatment of default logic. Other subjects covered include the major approaches of autoepistemic logic and circumscription, belief revision and its relationship to nonmonotonic inference, and briefly, the stable and well-founded semantics of logic programs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HffPtA8WbBAC&dq=Nonmonotonic+Reasoning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Andre Kertesz (Aperture Masters of Photography)","description":"Aperture Masters of Photography Six-Copy Collector's Set Includes Wynn Bullock, Harry Callahan, Eikoh Hosoe, Tina Modotti, Barbara Morgan, and W.

While not every title we publish becomes a New York Times bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qUiJCwAAQBAJ&dq=A+History+of+the+Amish,+Revised+and+Updated!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Key to 1000 quilt patterns","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZtBrGQAACAAJ&dq=Key+to+1000+quilt+patterns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Stories from My Father's Court","description":"An autobiographical collection of episodes remembered by the son of a rabbi","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0bj09VvXFTUC&dq=More+Stories+from+My+Father%27s+Court&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smart Shelving and Storage Solutions","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Fire Observation Towers of New York State","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tAdJAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Fire+Observation+Towers+of+New+York+State&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practitioner's Guide to Psychoactive Drugs","description":"In the eight years since the publication of the second edition of this Guide, psycho phannacotherapy has made many advances not only through the discovery of new medications but by the effective directing of their use to an ever-increasing variety of clinical disorders. These welcome developments are reflected in the concurrent growth and development of the Guide itself, which now enters adulthood with renewed vigor. Under the thoughtful and scholarly leadership of Dr. Alan Gelenberg, the third edition has undergone a significant transformation designed to meet the needs of the modem clinician. The panel of contributors is nearly double that of the former edition with the addition of nine new authors, who have helped in the major revision and rewriting of the text and in a broadening of the topics included. As a conse quence, the reader is assured of a thorough and thoroughly up-to-date coverage of current psychopharmacology that is both accurate and aimed at clinical utility. Having reached maturity, the third edition, while maintaining the lineaments of its earlier versions, is a considerably expanded and strengthened guide to treatment. Although now more encyclopedic in content, the new Practitioner' s Guide to Psy choactive Drugs retains the virtues of a clinical vade mecum that informed its predecessors and have eamed it a place by the patient's bedside for weIl over a decade. One may confidently anticipate its long and flourishing career in the years ahead. John C.

Scott Fitzgerald's career itself is a metaphor for the vagaries of book publishing. If Fitzgerald would have had his way, we would today refer to The Great Gatsby as either Gold-Hatted Gatsby, Trimalchio in West Egg, or The High-Bouncing Lover. A few years before Gatsby, Fitzgerald had become a literary sensation at the age of 23; Helen Hooven Santmyer, a contemporary of Fitzgerald's, would not have a successful novel published until she was 88 and living in a nursing home. In this book, the author explores that mysterious place in publishing where art and commerce can either clash, mesh, or both. Along the way, a wide range of authors--from the literary greats to today's commercial superstars--editors, agents and publishers share their thoughts, insights and experiences: What inspires writers? (John Steinbeck, for example, wrote every novel as if it were his last, as if death were imminent.) Why are some books successful and appreciated, while others fall into oblivion? The answers are often elusive, never absolute, but the stories and anecdotes are always fascinating.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=54qLAaxz19wC&dq=The+Making+of+a+Bestseller:+From+Author+to+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cross Stitch Teddies","description":"Celebrate the teddy bear in cross stitch by working the 40 plus designs on offer in this collection.

During play at the 2001 British Open Ian Woosnam playing his best golf in two years, entered the final round trailing by one shot when disaster struck. His caddie was forced to tell him that he had one too many clubs in his bag costing him a share of the lead and possibly the championship. And who could forget the infamous moment in the 1968 Masters Tournament when Roberto de Vincenzo, on his way to a play-off for the title, had to abdicate the lead when he discovered he had signed for a round higher than he had actually scored. How could both these unfortunate errors be illegal under the rules? Indeed they could, says golf legend Arnold Palmer, who throughout his distinguished career has taken part in a sizeable share of controversies. Despite the fact that golf has fewer rules than such sports as rugby or cricket, it is a contest of honour, and all players respect the rules. Palmer helps make sense of it all with easy-to-understand language and hundreds of pictures of some of the more controversial rulings, giving readers a visual recall of memorable moments involving Greg Norman, Tiger Woods, John Daly, even Palmer himself. If you're one of the millions who take to the course every year, need a clear explanation of the rules of the game you love, and don't want to be speechless when an argument over the 'coefficient of restitution' pops up, then PLAYING BY THE RULES will be an invaluable guide you'll refer to time and again.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4gLrPUi1QTQC&dq=Golf+Rules+Illustrated+2000+Rules:+The+United+States+Golf+Association:+An+Official+Publication+of+the+USGA+USGA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Short Path","description":"This book offers advanced parallel and distributed algorithms and experimental laboratory prototypes of unconventional shortest path solvers. In addition, it presents novel and unique algorithms of solving shortest problems in massively parallel cellular automaton machines. The shortest path problem is a fundamental and classical problem in graph theory and computer science and is frequently applied in the contexts of transport and logistics, telecommunication networks, virtual reality and gaming, geometry, and social networks analysis. Software implementations include distance-vector algorithms for distributed path computation in dynamics networks, parallel solutions of the constrained shortest path problem, and application of the shortest path solutions in gathering robotic swarms. Massively parallel algorithms utilise cellular automata, where a shortest path is computed either via matrix multiplication in automaton arrays, or via the representation of data graphs in automaton lattices and using the propagation of wave-like patterns. Unconventional shortest path solvers are presented in computer models of foraging behaviour and protoplasmic network optimisation by the slime mould Physarum polycephalum and fluidic devices, while experimental laboratory prototypes of path solvers using chemical media, flows and droplets, and electrical current are also highlighted. The book will be a pleasure to explore for readers from all walks of life, from undergraduate students to university professors, from mathematicians, computers scientists and engineers to chemists and biologists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7ppYDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The heart of Princess Osra (Collection of British authors.

Determined to flee, she feigns an audacious kidnapping and stows away on one of her brother's ships on the very eve of her own arranged wedding.

Subjugation is the price this mesmirizing creature demands fro the exquisite renegade's eternal pleasure, as Fenice follows her Dark Lord to his mountain domain, where she is to live...and die. But another is waiting there already, lurking in the shadows of the imposing castle keep: a lovely and crazed consort already corrupted by Dracula's terrible passion...a once-mortal girl named Kelene, late of a distant realm called Greece who could prove to be Fenice's staunchest ally and sister, or her most fearsome adversary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XDtvGwAACAAJ&dq=The+Soul+of+an+Angel+(Sisters+of+the+Night)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"He says she says: Lessons about love and relationships","description":"From the author of the beloved 30 Lessons for Living Karl Pillemer s 30 Lessons for Living first became a hit and then became a classic.

A deranged serial killer who apparently melted into the crowd was picking up hookers and sadistically torturing them, leaving some girls wondering if there was a real-life Dr. Frankenstein out there attempting to create his own personal plaything from pieces of his dismembered victims. Some working girls were butchered in seedy hotel rooms, their heads, hands or breasts sliced off, their remains then set ablaze in an effort to dispose of any incriminating evidence. Others narrowly escaped death, but only after enduring hours of terrifying torture that included brutal bite marks, surface knife slashes and stab wounds that all served as bloody foreplay for frenzied sexual assaults. Survivors were found bleeding and delirious, unable to remember much due to the cocktail of drugs they'd been given by their assailant. But their bodies told a horrific story that was almost worse than death, and the sadistic calling cards left by the serial killer would eventually tie together victims in this true crime murder spree that crossed two states. It wasn't until one victim's screams grew loud enough that Richard Cottingham, an American serial killer who was part narcissist, part sadist and all evil, was finally caught by police as he fled his hotel room carrying his bag of torture devices. His capture allowed them to close the books on some of the most horrific murder cases in U.S. history. This serial killer biography not only unearths Cottingham's sick, twisted crime spree, it also delves into the murderer's psyche, attempting to reveal why an insurance company IT guy's seemingly normal life would devolve into madness. Among true crime stories, Richard Cottingham's is particularly brutal, and will likely make you look twice at your own coworkers, and wonder what sick secrets they might be keeping.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vKNIvgAACAAJ&dq=The+Torso+Killer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications, Vol. 2","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AlggzQEACAAJ&dq=An+Introduction+to+Probability+Theory+and+Its+Applications,+Vol.+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Weaver and the Abbey: The Quest for a Secret Monastery in the Andes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tnvpAAAAMAAJ&dq=Weaver+and+the+Abbey:+The+Quest+for+a+Secret+Monastery+in+the+Andes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seventy-Seven Clocks A Bryant & may Mystery","description":"'The newspapers referred to it as the case of the seventy-seven clocks.

In fact, Arthur Bryant remembers very little about yesterday, but he does remember the oddest investigation of his career... It was late in 1973. As strikes and blackouts ravaged the country during Edward Heath's 'Winter of Discontent', sundry members of a wealthy, aristocratic family were being disposed of in a variety of grotesque ways - by reptile, by bomb, by haircut. As the hours of daylight diminish towards Christmas, Bryant & May, the irascible detectives of London's controversial Peculiar Crimes Unit, know that time is the key - and time is running out for both the family and the police. Their investigations lead them into a hidden world of class conflict, craftsmanship and the secret loyalties of big business. But what have seventy seven ticking clocks to do with it?

He began as a soldier in the Palmach, the elite underground unit of the Jewish community in Palestine, served in the 1948 War of Independence, and ultimately became chief of staff of the Israel Defense Force (IDF), defense minister in several governments, ambassador to the United States, and, twice, prime minister. As chief of staff, Rabin led the IDF to its triumph in the 1967 Six Day War. He was assassinated in 1995 as prime minister as he left a peace rally. Drawing on unpublished materials and interviews with important sources, including Rabin himself, Efraim Inbar's work offers a systematic study of Rabin's strategic thinking and his policies. Topics include the evolution of Rabin's thinking, his contributions to IDF military buildup, his stress on Israel's relationship to the United States, his attitudes toward the use of force, and his approach to Israel's nuclear status in the Middle East. Inbar's conclusion evaluates Rabin's contribution to Israel's national security and assesses Rabin's personal transition from warrior to peace maker. Because of Rabin's crucial role in Israel's defense establishment at important junctures in its history, this book provides an important view into the security challenges Israel has faced and how the country has responded over four decades.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xPqrJoepJvQC&dq=Rabin+and+Israel%27s+National+Security+(Woodrow+Wilson+Center+Press)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sylvie and Bruno","description":"Reproduction of the original: Sylvie and Bruno by Lewis Carroll","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0ttvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Sylvie+and+Bruno&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robert Shaw: THE PRICE OF SUCC","description":"Robert Shaw is most celebrated today as the Oscar-nominated star in movies like From Russia with Love, A Man For All Seasons, The Sting and - most memorably of all - as Quint in the record-breaking Jaws. His breakthrough came when Hollywood was experiencing something of a British Invasion. Sean Connery, Peter O'Toole, Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Burton were among the new stars. But Shaw was arguably more talented than any, a figure of extraordinary and wide-ranging promise. More than just a mesmerising actor on stage and screen, he was also a gifted writer. He wrote no less than six published novels (winning the Hawthornden Prize), while his plays include the acclaimed Man in The Glass Booth. The flipside to Shaw's diverse abilities was his well-earned reputation as a hellraiser. A fiercely competitive man in all areas of his life, whether playing table tennis or drinking whisky, he emptied mini-bars, crashed Aston Martins, fathered nine children by three different women, made (and spent) a fortune, and set fire to Orson Welles' house. He died at 51, having driven himself too hard, too fast, but unable to get past the tortured relationship to his father who had committed suicide when Shaw was just 11. Though his life ended tragically, it is fortunate that Shaw's biographer is someone who knew him well, professionally and personally. Robert Shaw: The Price of Success is a perceptive, sympathetic, but unsparing portrait of the blessings and curses endowing this mercurial, enigmatic but deeply engaging man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KC0TvgAACAAJ&dq=Robert+Shaw:+THE+PRICE+OF+SUCC&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plough, Sword and Book: The Structure of Human History","description":"Elucidates and argues for the author's concept of human history from the past to the present","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WwduQjFiB7kC&dq=Plough,+Sword+and+Book:+The+Structure+of+Human+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decreation: Poetry, Essays, Opera","description":"A remarkable compilation of literary writings by the critically acclaimed author of Autobiography of Red features an array of original poetry, essays, a screenplay, and a libretto that explores the nature and mechanics of the human act of decreation as revealed in the lives of Sappho, Marguerite Porete, Simone Weil, Virginia Woolf, and her own relationship with her mother.

Americans exist in time, in the era biblically called the Fall. America is a demonic principality, or conglomeration of principalities and powers in which death furnishes the meaning, in which death is the reigning idol. Enshrined in multifarious forms and guises, it enslaves human beings, exacts human sacrifices, captures and captivates Presidents as well as intimidating and dehumanizing ordinary citizens. Strong statements, yes, but timely in the biblical context which forms William Stringfellow's perspective of our contemporary situation. Identifying America as a fallen nation with the parable of Babylon in the Book of Revelation - not with Jerusalem the holy nation, as Americans are naively and vainly wont to do - Dr. Stringfellow issues as trenchant an indictment of our society as has been made since Philip Wylie's 'Generation of Vipers'. Shockingly prophetic, dismaying, and sobering, William Stringfellow's rigorous biblical theology will surely offend the self-righteous.

Nancy Abrams a philosopher of science, lawyer, and lifelong atheist is among them, but she has also found freedom in imagining a higher power. In A God That Could Be Real, Abrams explores a radically new way of thinking about God. She dismantles several common assumptions about God and shows why an omniscient, omnipotent God that created the universe and plans what happens is incompatible with science but that this doesn t preclude a God that can comfort and empower us. Moving away from traditional arguments for God, Abrams finds something worthy of the name  God  in the new science of emergence: just as a complex ant hill emerges from the collective behavior of individually clueless ants, and just as the global economy emerges from the interactions of billions of individuals  choices, God, she argues, is an  emergent phenomenon  that arises from the staggering complexity of humanity s collective aspirations and is in dialogue with every individual. This God did not create the universe it created the meaning of the universe. It s not universal it s planetary. It can t change the world, but it helps us change the world. A God that could be real, Abrams shows us, is what humanity needs to inspire us to collectively cooperate to protect our warming planet and create a long-term civilization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bNtmDwAAQBAJ&dq=God+and+the+Universe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Registration Methods for the Small Museum","description":"The definitive guide to registration methodology for smaller institutions and beginning or part-time registrars.

With this fascinating selection of correspondence written by one of England's greatest letter writers, Peter Quennell comes as close as anyone can to salvaging what was lost by the alleged actions of one overcautious publisher. Drawing on letters from Byron's pre-Harrow days to those written in the weeks before his death, Quennell has pieced together the extraordinary story of Byron's life as told by himself. As Byron records his thoughts as a schoolboy, man-of-the-world, rake and womanizer, literary sensation, and poet-in-exile, he reveals the rebellious, warm-hearted, disorderly, fun-loving, and neurotic sides to his private character. The volume conveys how his writing, veering from racy vulgarity to polished eloquence, vividly evokes the worlds in which he lived--London and Venetian high society, the Swiss and Italian countryside, and the Greek war tents at Missolonghi.

One of his most interesting chapters gives a practical-minded consideration to the probable future of Tibet.' New York Times Paul Brunton was one of a very small number of his generation to travel in India and Tibet so extensively at a time when very few were doing so with such insight and discernment. His journalistic skills produced magnificent descriptions of the snowy peaks and high-desert landscapes of the Himalayan region, but it was the lessons he learned from the holy men he met on his journey that transformed him into one of the great interpreters of the East. In this magnificent spirituality classic, he explains that we all need 'oases of calm in a world of storm', no matter what era we are living in, and that to retreat from our everyday lives for a while is not weakness but strength. By taking the trouble to discover the deep silence within us we will find the benefits of being linked to an 'infinite power, an infinite wisdom, an infinite goodness'. A Hermit In The Himalayas is a fascinating blend of travel writing and profound spiritual experience. As we accompany the author on his journey through the vast Himalayas ranges towards Mount Kailas in Tibet, he also shows us an even more remarkable - and timeless - inner path which will help us cope with the ups and downs of our contemporary world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1azWOAAACAAJ&dq=A+Hermit+in+the+Himalayas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Men, Women and Pianos: A Social History","description":"A renowned concert pianist traces the instrument's design, manufacture, and music in a delightful \\"piano's eye-view\\" of the social history of Western Europe and the United States from the 16th to the 20th centuries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BtDCAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Care for the Caretaker : How Jim Backus' Wife Did It: An Upbeat Guide for Those Who Care for Others","description":"Best-selling author Henny Backus cared for her husband, actor Jim Backus (\\"Mr. Magoo & \\"Gilligan's Island\\"), through his 10 year bout with Parkinson's disease.

The author focuses on the differences between 'discourse networks' in 1800 and in 1900, in the process developing a new analysis of the shift from romanticism to modernism. The work might be classified as a German equivalent to the New Historicism that is currently of great interest among American literary scholars, both in the intellectual influences to which Kittler responds and in his concern to ground literature in the most concrete details of historical reality. The artful structure of the book begins with Goethe's Faust and ends with Vale;ry's Faust. In the 1800 section, the author discusses how language was learned, the emergence of the modern university, the associated beginning of the interpretation of contemporary literature, and the canonization of literature. Among the writers and works Kittler analyzes in addition to Goethe's Faust are Schlegel, Hegel, E. T. A. Hoffman's 'The Golden Pot', and Goethe's Tasso. The 1900 section argues that the new discourse network in which literature is situated in the modern period is characterized by new technological media - film, the photograph, and the typewritten page - and the crisis that these caused for literary production. Along the way, the author discusses the work of Nietzsche, Gertrude Stein, Mallarme;, Bram Stroker, the Surrealists, Rilke, Kafka, and Freud, among others.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nRo0Pk8djjoC&dq=Discourse+Networks,+1800/1900&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fortress","description":"The Fortress Commentary on the New Testament presents a balanced synthesis of current scholarship.

Does the comprehensive message of Scripture concerning wealth support this movement, which is growing rapidly in Africa? This work looks at this important theme in both Old and New Testaments to determine their basic unity of thought. Both agree that there is a dark and a bright side to riches. There are dangers and serious temptations to wealth, but wealth can be a primary means to honor God as well. In this concise booklet Professor Donald Leggett examines this tension and concludes that the prosperity gospel fails to maintain the full biblical witness by ignoring the dangers of being wealthy. Donald Leggett is professor emeritus of Old Testament studies at Tyndale Theological Seminary in Toronto, where he has taught for more than 40 years. He holds a ThM from Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia and a doctorate from the Free University of Amsterdam. He has also taught at the Irish Baptist College, Belfast, at Scott Theological College in Kenya and in India, at the South Asia Institute for Advanced Christian Studies. From 1978 to 2003 he co-pastored Village Green Baptist Church in London, Ontario. He previously authored \\"The Kinsman Redeemer in the Book of Ruth, \\" and \\"Loving God and Disturbing Men.\\" He is married to Linda and they have five grown children now living in various parts of the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZqKIov90pEAC&dq=Theodore+Austin-Sparks+(1889-1971):+Reflections+on+His+Life+and+Work&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Investment Superstars: 13 Great Investors and Their Strategies for Superior Returns","description":"An examination of fifteen of today's most successful investors according to their areas of expertise, including stock-picking, global macro trading, sector investing, and more, describes how these investors approach the market at a time when volatility is high and certainty low.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yj0LIWZocugC&dq=The+New+Investment+Superstars:+13+Great+Investors+and+Their+Strategies+for+Superior+Returns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creative Rug Hooking","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Analysis of Behavior in Planning Instruction","description":"This book shows teachers and other human service professionals working in school settings how to employ non-aversive, behavior analysis principles in classrooms and other school settings.

Her meteoric rise to stardom in the mid-1970s was nothing short of phenomenal, and hits poured forth that pushed her to the top of the charts, including \\"Honey Bee,\\" \\"I Got You Under My Skin,\\" \\"Never Can Say Goodbye,\\" and the song that has immortalized her, \\"I Will Survive,\\" which became a #1 international gold seller. With that song, Gloria heralded the international rise of disco that became synonymous with a way of life in the fast lane - the sweaty bodies at Studio 54, the lines of cocaine, the indescribable feeling that you could always be at the top of your game and never come down. But down she came after her early stardom, and problems followed in the wake, including the death of her mother, whose love had anchored the young singer, as well as constant battles with weight, drugs, and alcohol. While her fans always imagined her to be rich, her personal finances collapsed due to poor management; and while many envied her, she felt completely empty inside. In the early 1980s, sustained by her marriage to music publisher Linwood Simon, Gloria took three years off and reflected upon her life. She visited churches and revisited her mother's old Bible. Discovering the world of gospel, she made a commitment to Christ that sustains her to this day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XjauAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Digital Design: Principles and Practices and Xilinx 4.2i Student Package (3rd Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Chocolate Run","description":"'I didn't mean to, honest to goodness I didn't.

The nineteenth century in Europe was a time of unprecedented artistic achievement. It was also the first age of cultural globalization an epoch when mass communications and high-speed rail travel brought Europe together, overcoming the barriers of nationalism and facilitating the development of a truly European canon of artistic, musical, and literary works. By 1900, the same books were being read across the continent, the same paintings reproduced, the same music played in homes and heard in concert halls, the same operas performed in all the major theatres. Drawing from a wealth of documents, letters, and other archival materials, acclaimed historian Orlando Figes examines the interplay of money and art that made this unification possible. At the center of the book is a poignant love triangle: the Russian writer Ivan Turgenev; the Spanish prima donna Pauline Viardot, with whom Turgenev had a long and intimate relationship; and her husband Louis Viardot, an art critic, theater manager, and republican activist. Together, Turgenev and the Viardots acted as a kind of European cultural exchange they either knew or crossed paths with Delacroix, Berlioz, Chopin, Brahms, Liszt, the Schumanns, Hugo, Flaubert, Dickens, and Dostoyevsky, among many other towering figures. As Figes observes, nearly all of civilization s great advances have come during periods of heightened cosmopolitanism when people, ideas, and artistic creations circulate freely between nations. Vivid and insightful, The Europeans shows how such cosmopolitan ferment shaped artistic traditions that came to dominate world culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J7KDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heartbreaker (Lone Star Country Club (Unnumbered))","description":"Successor to Twain's first collection of travel memoirs takes a second look at Europe.

As in the early modern Atlantic world, nineteenth-century interactions between the Americas, Africa, and Europe centered on exchange: exchange of people, commodities, and ideas. From 1789 to 1914, new means of transportation and communication allowed revolutionaries, migrants, merchants, settlers, and tourists to crisscross the ocean, share their experiences, and spread knowledge. Extending the conventional chronology of Atlantic world history up to the start of the First World War, Niels Eichhorn uncovers the complex dynamics of transition and transformation that marked the nineteenth-century Atlantic world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AJO7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Virtue and Other Tory Notions","description":"The noted conservative columnist and essayist summons the nation to be a responsible capitalism, calls for an elevated political leadership, and analyzes various trends, attitudes, phenomena, and personalities at large in the country today","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H7sg19Vq6U4C&dq=The+Pursuit+of+Virtue+and+Other+Tory+Notions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Grand Man","description":"A child's faith in her drunken Irish father leads her friends to find him a job.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iwBXAAAAYAAJ&dq=A+Grand+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roeser's Audiology Desk Reference","description":"Praise for the best-selling first edition: fills a much needed gap in audiological literature, providing a source of essential facts, figures and diagrams the information is precise and easy to read, while the contents and index pages are also very detailed, making it easy to locate information. -- Journal of Otolaryngology Audiologists are often pressed for time and need an up-to-date reference for quick consultation in their daily practice.

In a groundbreaking exploration of the roots of our political order, Levin shows that American partisanship originated in the debates over the French Revolution, fueled by the fiery rhetoric of these ideological titans.

In her latest book, Ms. Jenkins introduces cooks and readers to a cluster of core ingredients and foodways that are fundamental to all of the Mediterranean's diverse cuisines. She shows how the Mediterranean attitude toward food -- a combination of respect, integrity, enthusiasm, and sheer joy -- can be cultivated across the Atlantic. In twelve informative and captivating chapters, the author focuses on the core ingredients common to the diverse cuisines of the region: salt, wine and vinegar, pasta and couscous, bread, olive oil, Old World legumes, New World peppers and tomatoes, dairy products, the family pig, and the resources of the sea. In each chapter she travels to a different corner of the Inner Sea to describe how and why these essential ingredients are obtained, what determines their quality, and where they fit in local cuisines. Each chapter draws on history and ethnography as much as on the lives of Mediterranean people today. Readers will delight in Majid Mahjoub, the colorful Tunisian \\"Shakespeare of olive oil,\\" and commiserate with Provencal cheese maker Yves van Weddingen as he struggles to maintain his standards in the face of bureaucratic demands. Home cooks will garner a new appreciation of high-quality Spanish jamon de bellota as they follow the Trigo family through the annual winter ritual of transforming the family pig into hams and sausages. More than 170 contemporary, accessible recipes, simple to reproduce at home, bring the foods and the regions alive, while additional chapters include basic procedures and staples, as well as a helpful guide to ingredient sources.

This Meager Nature is the first full-length study to trace the cultural construction of Russia's landscape during the nineteenth century, showing how artistic and literary representations of nature reflected and shaped Russians' ideas about themselves and their nation. In the early 1800s, Russians commonly accepted the European judgment that their land lacked aesthetic value. That view changed with the outpouring of literary and artistic creativity that followed the century's political upheavals. Artists such as Aleksei Savrasov, Fedor Vasil'ev, Ivan Shishkin, and Nikolai Nekrasov turned to their native land and revealed the power of grey skies, vast open fields, and simple birch forests. Russians came to embrace their land's modest beauty, which represented strength and hidden depths. The historical creation of Russia's sense of place resulted not so much from its citizens' encounters with their environment, Ely argues, as from their long-term struggle to distinguish Russia from Europe. The humble beauty of the Russian land served to assert the genuineness of Russia against the inauthenticity of western Europe. For those who embraced it, the \\"meager\\" beauty of the landscape provided a powerful means for experiencing and expressing Russian national identity.

The science goes like this: fine filaments of cells called mycelium, the fruit of which are mushrooms, already cover large areas of land around the world. As the mycelium grows, it breaks down plant and animal debris, recycling carbon, nitrogen, and other elements in the creation of rich new soil. What Stamets shows is that the enzymes and acids thatmycelium produces to decompose this debris are superb at breaking apart hydrocarbons--the base of many pollutants. Stamets discusses the various branches of this exciting new technology, including mycorestoration (biotransforming stripped land), mycofiltration (creating habitat buffers), myco-remediation (healing chemically harmed environments), and mycoforestry (creating truly sustainable forests)--From publisher description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nnGKDwAAQBAJ&dq=Mycelium+Running:+How+Mushrooms+Can+Help+Save+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amelia Earhart's Shoes: Is the Mystery Solved?","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Lone Pilgrim","description":"A dazzling collection of stories that masterfully weaves together tales of love and desire in all its forms, exploring the universal complications of the heart--and the mysteries of being fully human in the world.

In The Rogue River Indian War and Its Aftermath, 18501980, historian E. A. Schwartz explores the tribal groups' resilience not only during this war but also in every period of federal Indian policy that followed. Schwartz's work examines Oregon Indian people's survival during American expansion as they coped with each federal initiative, from reservation policies in the nineteenth century through termination and restoration in the twentieth. While their resilience facilitated their success in adjusting to white society, it also made the people known today as the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians susceptible to federal termination programs in the 1970s efforts that would have dissolved their communities and given their resources to non-Indians. Drawing on a range of federal documents and anthropological sources, Schwartz explores both the history of Native peoples of western Oregon and U.S. Indian policy and its effects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OZwAnfQj62cC&dq=The+Rogue+River+Indian+War+and+Its+Aftermath,+1850-1980&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Name of the King","description":"1640, and the pall of war hangs over France...

The authors look at evidence from studies in developmental criminology, evolutionary psychology, psychopathology, and psychophysiology and examine the situational and social factors that influence the likelihood of rape. Theories about rape have an unfortunate history of being unconstrained by empirical knowledge, sometimes with the harmful consequence that solutions to the problem of rape are ineffectual. The authors address this situation with a fact-based exploration of this phenomenon, beginning with a review of coercive sex among animal species and an account of rape throughout history and across culture, moving through a discussion of current research on rape, and culminating with a synthesis of research findings that points toward a new explanation of why some men rape. The authors also discuss the practical implications of their research on the assessment and treatment of men who rape. This empirically exhaustive book will be the new standard text on the phenomenon of rape and will help psychologists, social workers, and legal professionals to develop a better understanding of sexual aggression\\"--Publicity materials.

Danto's essays not only critique bodies of work but reflect upon art's conceptual evolution as well, drawing for the reader a kind of \\"philosophical map\\" indicating how art and the criteria for judging it has changed over the twentieth century. In Unnatural Wonders the renowned critic finds himself at a point when contemporary art has become wholly pluralistic, even chaotic-with one medium as good as another-and when the moment for the \\"next thing\\" has already passed. So the theorist goes in search of contemporary art's most exhilarating achievements, work that bridges the gap between art and life, which, he argues, is now the definitive art of our time. Danto considers the work of such young artists as John Currin and Renee Cox and older living masters including Gerhard Richter and Sol LeWitt. He discusses artists of the New York School, like Philip Guston and Joan Mitchell, and international talents, such as the South African William Kentridge. Danto conducts a frank analysis of Matthew Barney's The Cremaster Cycle, Damien Hirst's skeletons and anatomical models, and Barbara Kruger's tchotchke-ready slogans; finds the ghost of Henry James in the work of Barnett Newman; and muses on recent Whitney Biennials and art influenced by 9/11. He argues that aesthetic considerations no longer play a central role in the experience and critique of art. Instead art addresses us in our humanity, as men and women who seek meaning in the \\"unnatural wonders\\" of art, a meaning that philosophy and religion are unable to provide.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=thgwDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Webster's New Explorer Encyclopedic Dictionary","description":"A comprehensive list of 330,000 words in the English language and their definitions also includes separate sections listing biographical, Biblical, mythological, and geographical names; a handbook fo style; synonyms and antonyms; and a pronunciation guide","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PbxWAAAAYAAJ&dq=Webster%27s+New+Explorer+Encyclopedic+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Successful Living With Chronic Illness","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jLhkPwAACAAJ&dq=Successful+Living+With+Chronic+Illness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conscience","description":"A priest confronts his inner demons when he is sent to a planet whose inhabitants rely on reason, rendering them incabable of faith or irrational belief of any kind.

It is my conviction, that unless I, and a large number of my fellow travelers begin to spend less time enjoying the natural beauty and recreational opportunities of our respective areas, and more time supervising and reassessing the role of our representatives to government, that very soon we will no longer be free to go where we want, and do what we please.

This book explores the reasons for this contradiction by examining several notable new library facilities around the world to see how modern expectations for libraries are being translated into concrete and steel. More and more libraries are looking at change not as a dreaded hazard but as an opportunity that can itself be seized to strengthen the library in the areas of mission, technologies, facilities, funding, and organizational structure. Thirteen libraries are discussed by a librarian or administrator who worked on the project. Each author writes about the design and building concerns that were particularly relevant to that library: philosophy, political issues, or any other concerns that affected planning, building, and services in the new facility. Introductory and concluding chapters identify underlying values and themes, tying everything together. The unique combinations of issues, constraints, and opportunities show how libraries are planning to fit into the approaching era of virtual information delivery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uLsHxE-Kax8C&dq=Building+Libraries+for+the+21st+Century:+The+Shape+of+Information&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Parents Are People, Too: An Emotional Fitness Program for Parents","description":"Offers techniques for dealing with the guilt, anger, frustration, and self-doubt of parenthood, including visualization, personal mission statements, and strategies for dealing with specific negative feelings","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I7gAAAAACAAJ&dq=Parents+Are+People,+Too:+An+Emotional+Fitness+Program+for+Parents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diamond Hunters","description":"An action-packed thriller of family, business and betrayal - perfect for fans of Succession - by global bestselling author, Wilbur Smith.

Since then he has both been an avid reader and follower of politics. ConvincedAmericans have been fed pabulum and lies by a liberal media for far too long, Richey?s decision to compile his thoughts in writing is his attempt to do something about the ?long march through the institutions? by the liberal ethos. Alternating between the serious and serio-comic, his epigrams are just what the doctor ordered for an America on a long slide into Liberalism. To wit: 1. Pascal laid it down as a fact that if all men knew what others say of them, there would not be four friends in the world. I believe he was much too generous in settling on the number four. 2. It is a sad but true statement about current American politics that there exist some male politicians who are ever so good with women's issues, doing things FOR women in groups in order that they may do things TO women as individuals. 3. The most pernicious fraud against the culture of the mind ever perpetrated in America is the dictum that the hallmark of intellectual maturity consists in the ability to tolerate ambiguity. 4. Every time you make a decision, you make a judgment about the proper course of action. But oh gosh: we mustn't be judgmental, must we? Yes, we must. Judge, and stand ready to be judged. 5. Those who profess a problem with your linear thinking don't really have a problem with thinking being linear, but with thinking being yours. Mr. Richey first became interested in politics in 1960 during the Kennedy-Nixon presidential contest, the first for which he was old enough to vote, when he detected something amiss in presidential politics. Especially frustrating was the Kennedy sandbagging of Humphrey in West Virginia on the Catholic issue. Kennedy invented the issue, thus putting the state into the Kennedy column on a sympathy vote, and thereby eliminating Humphrey?s chance to win the nomination.Four years later, Richey?s frustration with things political increased astronomically with the treatment of Goldwater by the Democrat Party and their allies in the media. Once elected, both Johnson?s prosecution of the Vietnam War and his Great Society with it?s ?War on Poverty? were unmitigated disasters. Richard Nixon violated the trust of the American people, saddling us with any number of failed liberal programs: EPA, OSHA, wage and price controls to name a few. Gerald Ford was a caretaker president, with no chance of election in his own right, while Jimmy Carter was a well-meaning national disaster, who brought about a four year national malaise.With the election of Ronald Reagan came ?Morning in America.? He made America proud of herself once again. Reagan assumed office with three large objectives: Getting regulations off our backs, reducing taxes, and strengthening the military. He accomplished them all, and, won the cold war along the way.George Bush the elder really has only one credit to his name: kicking Iraq out of Kuwait, but he failed to finish the job. After his ouster came Clinton?and eight years of disaster, disgust, and disarray in America. With the election of George W. Bush, our long national nightmare was at last at an end. Of course, listening to Al Gore and company would incline one to believe that Bush was ?selected,? not ?elected.? With the country behind him in the war on terrorism, Mr. Bush has the chance to make things right in America with programs such as his faith-based initiative. His problem is, and will remain, however, the successful ?long march through the institutions? by the liberal ethos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QRJ0PQAACAAJ&dq=Two+Steps+Forward,+No+Steps+Back:+Why+the+Left+Isn%27t+Right+for+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Earth","description":"\\"I take care of the earth because I know I can do little things every day to make a BIG difference...\\" With his signature blend of playfulness and sensitiviy, Todd Parr explores the important, timely subject of environmental protection and conservation in this eco-friendly picture book.

This was the question my sister and I asked each other, over and over. Every time we started talking about our mother, it was always this unanswered question we were left with. Why was she so unhappy? Why was she so abusive to Daddy, who loved her with his whole heart and soul? Why wouldn't she take care of herself? When I decided to try and find the answer, it was very hard to face those long buried memories from my childhood. But I did come to understand why. Author Jeanette Gardner uses her deeply personal memoir to share the touching story of her mother Pearl's journey, from growing up the daughter of a wealthy family in Illinois to living in a shack in Wyoming. A sweeping memoir chronicling the origins of the author's family and their subsequent struggle with poverty. After getting to know much-older Bowman Mercer through a pen-pal service, Pearl, the author's mother, eventually leaves her abusive brother and their inherited house to move to Wyoming as Bowman's wife. She weathers their paltry circumstances and survives Jeanette's grueling birth and a near-poisoning by a jealous woman. As a little girl, the author lived in homes with dirt floors and rarely bathed, which often made her and her family-her parents and sister, Virginia-an object of ridicule. Nonetheless, she lived a largely happy childhood, developing a resilient, stubborn nature, and benefiting from her indulgent but well-meaning parents and helpful townspeople. With poignant empathy, the author successfully traces Pearl's transformation from a pleasant, shy beauty to an unkempt grouch prone to hysterics. She also understands how to build suspense, but inexplicably sabotages her own groundwork by giving away key plot elements in the chapter titles. For instance, a new neighbor's spooky friendliness-skillfully brought to life on the page-is prematurely explained by the chapter's title, \\"Graduation, A Child Molester.\\" -Kirkus Discoveries","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NRGjA5aMkRsC&dq=Dirty+Feet+and+Hungry+Hearts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pet Library's German shepherd guide","description":"A complete guide to the breeding, care, training and health of the German Shepherd dog.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uWBAAx4PmGYC&dq=Pet+Library%27s+German+shepherd+guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best of Hillbilly: A prize collection of 100-proof writing from Jim Comstock's West Virginia hillbilly,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9jUEAAAAYAAJ&dq=Best+of+Hillbilly:+A+prize+collection+of+100-proof+writing+from+Jim+Comstock%27s+West+Virginia+hillbilly,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GREECE: THE PELOPONNESE","description":"This new edition of Bradt's Greece: The Peloponnese with Athens, Delphi and Kythira remains the only dedicated guidebook to the southern part of the Greek mainland and provides more detailed coverage of the peninsula than any other rival book, making it an indispensable read for travellers to this small but fascinating part of Greece. It also incorporates a focussed mini-guide to the Greek capital of Athens and nearby world famous site of Delphi and is particularly strong on off-the-beaten-track sites, background information, accommodation and other subjects of interest for both independent travellers and those travelling as part of a group. Originally written by Andrew Bostock, an expert on Greece and former resident of the Peloponnese, this fourth edition has been updated by Bradt's most prolific and experienced guidebook writer Philip Briggs. Selective listings have been refreshed to reflect a growing trend towards eco-conscious boutique hotels. As with previous editions, in-depth coverage of well-known sites is supplemented by descriptions of lesser-known attractions and independent tours and activities, reflecting the reality that the Peloponnese, more than any other part of Greece, exemplifies the ideals of 'slow travel'. With Bradt's Greece: The Peloponnese, discover hidden villages, sophisticated towns and other top attractions, including one of Europe's most spectacular train journeys and the tower houses of the famed Mani. Explore hidden sites, including places not covered anywhere else. The guide is packed with information on agritourism spots, camping under the stars, rustic tavernas and locally grown produce. For those coming out of high season, revel in the delights of the wildflowers of spring, the joys of the olive harvest in late autumn and skiing opportunities during the winter. Bird life and marine life are also a huge attraction for visitors to the Peloponnese. The guide also focuses on the colourful life of the traditional 'paneyiri' and those who still embrace the Greek spirit of 'philoxenia'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X_SJDwAAQBAJ&dq=GREECE:+THE+PELOPONNESE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Picasso: Bathers","description":"\\"No artist enjoys greater popularity than Pablo Picasso, and no other artist has been exhibited more often or studied so intensely.

Both structure-based \\"bottom-up\\" and function- based \\"top-down\\" models offer coherent concepts by which to evaluate the experimental data. The goal of this book is to point out the advantages of a multidisciplinary, multistrategied approach to the brain.Part I of Neural Organization provides a detailed introduction to each of the three areas of structure, function, and dynamics. Structure refers to the anatomical aspects of the brain and the relations between different brain regions. Function refers to skills and behaviors, which are explained by means of functional schemas and biologically based neural networks. Dynamics refers to the use of a mathematical framework to analyze the temporal change of neural activities and synaptic connectivities that underlie brain development and plasticity--in terms of both detailed single-cell models and large-scale network models.In part II, the authors show how their systematic approach can be used to analyze specific parts of the nervous system--the olfactory system, hippocampus, thalamus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia--as well as to integrate data from the study of brain regions, functional models, and the dynamics of neural networks. In conclusion, they offer a plan for the use of their methods in the development of cognitive neuroscience.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x9iKhpqm5kIC&dq=Neural+Organization:+Structure,+Function,+and+Dynamics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"She Lost Control","description":"SHE'S LOST CONTROL is an all-female horror and dark fiction & poetry anthology from Post Mortem Press.The pieces in this anthology deal with various themes: death, violence, love, rape, motherhood, childhood, family, failure, victory. The voices of women rise up, refusing to be quieted. A secretary is haunted by her boss's laughter. A young woman dreams of a lost little boy. A woman dances, and dances, and dances until little is left.One thing is certain, and it shows again and again throughout these works: She's lost control. And no one knows quite what will happen.INCLUDES WORKS FROM AWARD-WINNING AUTHORS CYNTHIA PELAYO, STEPHANIE M. WYTOVICH, AND LUCY A. SNYDERThis book, by its very nature, is doing important work: giving women writers a platform and prioritizing their voices over the cacophony of men that have dominated the field for so long. This is not meant to start an argument over whose voice is more important or stronger or holds more weight-this book is only meant to continue the conversation of why we need diverse mindsets and points of view in the literary community. And as the global conversation continues to both widen and deepen in regards to diversity and inclusion in all aspects of our lives, I hope we can maintain that dialogue. This is a good place to start. The pieces in this anthology deal with various themes: death, violence, love, rape, motherhood, childhood, family, failure, victory. They are all poignant, emotional, and important. They are all human. I am proud and grateful that these women have entrusted me with their words. I hope you read them and hear what they are saying-what they are screaming. The female voice is strong, and will not be controlled. - Elizabeth Jenike - editorFEATURING SHORT FICTION & POETRY FROMCHLOE MONET SUTCH, AMIRAH MOHIDDIN, L.L. MADRID, SYDNEY J.

Their binary opposition reflects the universal aspectual values [ Perfective], which are the same ones overtly expressed by the preterite and imperfect past tense forms in Spanish. It can therefore be shown that different types of states, just like different types of events, can be categorized based on their aspectual composition. Additionally, the inherent semantic differences between events and states can be accounted for by analyzing aspect as applying to events internally and to states externally. A useful resource for the beginning linguist as well as the most seasoned analyst, this work is written in language that is easy to understand while remaining faithful to all of the appropriate relevant technical terminology.

Embracing U.S., Texas, and Mexican history; early ethnography; geography; and political philosophy, de Zavala outlines the cultural and political institutions of Jacksonian America and post-independence Mexico. de Zavala's commentary rivals Alex de Tocqueville's classic travel narrative, Democracy in America, which was published in Paris one year after de Zavala's. The narrative presents the first account of U.S. political culture from a Mexican point of view and constructs the first comparative political and historical framework for the relationship between Mexico and the United States. In passionate prose, de Zavala argues for the incorporation of the true democratic ideals of the enlightenment in the fledgling Republic of Texas. He hoped Texas would meld the best of both Mexican and American cultures. de Zavala believed that if his colleagues who helped frame the Texas Constitution understood the complexities of democracy and the ideals that their state could achieve through a liberal, federal government that gave equal rights to all of its constituents: Native Americans, Mexicans, Euro-Americans, and free African Americans. The original text is accompanied by eight pages of maps and historical photos, John-Michael Rivera's critical introduction, and an English translation based upon Wallace Woolsey's deft translation, expanded and revised for the purposes of this volume.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pQYsAL4f4HwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Occidentalism: Modernity and Subjectivity (Published in association with Theory, Culture & Society)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The complete buffet guide, or, How to mix all Kinds of drinks","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hurtling wings (Classic fiction series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f_M7HAAACAAJ&dq=Hurtling+wings+(Classic+fiction+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Banned: Classical Erotica : Forty Sensual and Erotic Excepts from Aristophanes to Whitman-Uncensored","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wnGLAAAACAAJ&dq=Banned:+Classical+Erotica+:+Forty+Sensual+and+Erotic+Excepts+from+Aristophanes+to+Whitman-Uncensored&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Challenging Chomsky: The Generative Garden Game","description":"This study combines a description of the development of Chomsky's theory of linguistics with a satirical account of some of the debates to which it has given rise.

You need not live with a dark or dank cabin, insufficient space for stowage or chartwork, or sheet winches, halyards, and reefing arrangements so inconvenient that you often find yourself motoring when you'd rather be sailing. Somewhere beneath your boat's crazed gelcoat, untamed rig, patchwork electrical system, and stubborn steering lies the boat of your dreams. This book will enable you to envision that boat in detail--how its deck hardware is laid out, what the rig looks like, where its hull and decks are reinforced, and how its cabin arrangements are altered to fit your needs. And the book will help you translate that vision into reality by showing you what work should be done and in what order, which projects you can do yourself and which you should probably hire out, and how much time or money might be involved. Along the way, Dan Spurr gives step-by-step instructions, supported by Bruce Bingham's beautifully clear drawings, for many useful projects any do-it-yourselfer can tackle, including autopilot installation, deck hardware modifications, and electrical system upgrades. The gear, equipment, design, and construction standards cited in this book--often in very specific detail with brand-name recommendations--are as useful for evaluating a new boat as they are for buying a used boat or improving the boat you already own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jR5DPwAACAAJ&dq=Upgrading+the+Cruising+Sailboat:+Spurr%27s+Boatbook,+2nd+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Neurolink","description":"When he banishes two thousand \\"protes\\"--poverty-stricken workers--to a malfunctioning submarine, who in turn unleash a rebellion that could destroy the new governance of Earth, executive Dominic Jedes must rely on the digital ghost of his father to stop them.

Yet the feminine was accorded a central place in religious thought and ritual.This volume explores the often paradoxical centrality of the feminine in Greek culture, showing how out of sight was not out of mind. The contributors adopt perspectives from a wide range of disciplines, such as archaeology, art history, psychology and anthropology, in order to investigate various aspects of religion and cult. They include the part played by women in death ritual, the role of heroines, and the fact that goddesses had no childhood, at the same time posing questions about how we know what rituals meant to their participants. The Sacred and the Feminine in Ancient Greece is a lively and colourful exploration of the ways in which religion and ritual reveal women's importance in the Greek polis, showing how ideologies about female roles and behaviour were both endorsed and challenged in the realm of the sacred.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_oD-k2m1968C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maigret and the young girl","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Crash Dive","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Golden age of air racing, pre 1940","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rMdCswEACAAJ&dq=The+Golden+age+of+air+racing,+pre+1940&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thief","description":"Trying to make sense of the horrors of World War II, Death relates the story of Liesel--a young German girl whose book-stealing and story-telling talents help sustain her family and the Jewish man they are hiding, as well as their neighbors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rk2MDQAAQBAJ&dq=Thief&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Conspiracy Revealed (Hunter's League)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Party Politics in the Age of Caesar (Sather Classical Lectures)","description":"The advice given to Cicero by his astute, campaign-conscious brother to prepare him for the consular elections of 64 B.C., has a curiously modern ring: \\"Avoid taking a definite stand on great public issues either in the Senate or before the people.

The book dwells on Wharton's early and middle life leading up to and including her experiences during the First World War. The final chapter covers her life after the war, close on twenty years, emphasising a Mediterranean cruise and the unexpected death of her friend Geoffrey Scott. This is most certainly a writer's memoir rather than an autobiographical narrative. The writing itself is poised and mature; Wharton here reads like a confident artisan, at ease with her profession and happy to reel off her thought and remembrances. The reason it isn't an autobiography in the strictest sense is that Wharton leaves so much of her life out of the book, some of it for obvious reasons  such as the Morton Fullerton affair  and others maybe because she just can't be bothered. That aside, it's a joy to read.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w2pTCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Feminization of America: How Womens Values Are Changing Our Public and Private Lives","description":"Argues that the feminist movement is causing positive changes in the American workplace, family, health care system, politics, religious institutions, language, and culture","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pVAPgu6d7IkC&dq=Feminization+of+America:+How+Womens+Values+Are+Changing+Our+Public+and+Private+Lives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Universe Makers: Science Fiction Today","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8Q8_AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Universe+Makers:+Science+Fiction+Today&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mediation in the Campus Community: Designing and Managing Effective Programs","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Knowledge Assets Professional's Guide to Valuation and Financial Management","description":"This guide provides a rigorous financial framework for analysing the costs, benefits, and risks associated with investing in the knowledge asset of an organisation.

Exact facsimile of the original edition and not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Christians, from the lowliest to the most gifted minds all through the ages have yearned for a fuller understanding of the chief mysteries of their faith. The principal elements of these mysteries have been defined by the Church. But the implication and expansion of the dogmatic definitions embrace a wide field of discussion and speculation for theologians. All recognize, however, that some aspects of these mysteries lie beyond the reach of the human intellect, even aided by divine revelation. In THE MYSTERIES OF CHRISTIANITY, Scheeben attempts to clarify and present an explanation of these mysteries. Scheeben combines the strict logic of a theologian with the warmth of a man of prayer. The warmth pervades the logic throughout. The student or the professor of dogmatic theology will find here a method of proof that will supplement the more familiar scholastic treatment. The scope of this volume is best indicated by the following headings of the ten parts. I. The Most Holy Trinity II. God in the Original Creation III. Sin IV. The God-man and His Economy V. The Eucharist VI. The Church and the Sacraments VII. Christian Justification VIII. Glorification and the Last Things IX. Predestination X.

The Ecstatic is LaValle s debut novel, a startling tale of love, horror, sex, insanity, faith, morbid obesity, and the modern American family. Something is wrong with Anthony our 318-pound hero and it s getting worse. A monster has caught his uncle and his mother; now it wants Anthony. Mental illness has been transmitted through his family s blood. The three women in his life his mother, younger sister, and grandmother find him naked and disoriented in his off-campus college apartment and take him home to Queens, each determined to fix him in her own peculiar way. But his presence soon turns their house into a semisuburban asylum. Sweet but wickedly sarcastic, smart and heartbreakingly vulnerable, Anthony narrates his family s surreal adventures through a world of grinning exploitation and fake cures, from storefront evangelists and neighborhood loan sharks to bogus beauty pageants and bootleg medical clinics. He corresponds with a dreadlocked Japanese militant, is haunted by a vicious pack of dogs, and tries to make his own horror movie, all in search of an answer to a question he doesn t dare ask. Written in the tradition of misfit picaresques from Journey to the End of the Night and Invisible Man to A Confederacy of Dunces and The World According to Garp, The Ecstatic is the revelatory story of a family trying to save themselves from a ravenous world and their own unraveling minds.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=juqcaciULkMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time Warped: First-century Time Stewardship For 21st-century Living (Living Stewardship Series)","description":"This study book is on time--but not time management.

G. Wells, 5)","description":"Critics rightly view When the Sleeper Wakes as a prototype of the anti-utopian novel, a genre developed by Zamyatin, Huxley, and Orwell into nightmare futures associated with the totalitarian age and the moral horrors of fascism and communism. Suppose, however, that Wells rather favored unlawful statist controls, if justified in a good cause by his own ideological lights? This is one possibility explored in the apparatus to the present edition. Annotated by the worlds leading Wellsian scholar, in Sleeper is found a greater measure of artistry and characterization than is usually accorded it. As a complex work combining technological with social speculation, Sleeper is unmatched for canniness in the history of futuristic literature. Indeed, its aeronautical details influenced the Wright Brothers in the design of their flyer, and the novel predicts the promotion of airplanes as a weapon, a prophecy dramatically fulfilled in the twentieth century.

The scientific challenge is to develop data, methodologies, and techniques for identifying and assessing toxic substances before they cause harm to human beings and the environment. The philosophical problem is how much scientific information we should demand for this task consistent with other social goals we might have. In this book, Cranor utilizes material from ethics, philosophy of law, epidemiology, tort law, regulatory law, and risk assessment, to argue that the scientific evidential standards used in tort law and administrative law to control toxics ought to be evaluated with the purposes of the law in mind. Demanding too much for this purpose will slow the evaluation and lead to an excess of toxic substances left unidentified and unassessed, thus leaving the public at risk. Demanding too little may impose other costs. An appropriate balance between these social concerns must be found. Justice requires we use evidentiary standards more appropriate to the legal institutions in question and resist the temptation to demand the most intensive scientific evaluation of each substance subject to legal action.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nqKNvXgXf78C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Artorius Rex Discovered (Arthurian History)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w6_vOQAACAAJ&dq=Artorius+Rex+Discovered+(Arthurian+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conceptual Physics Package Edition","description":"0133857417 / 9780133857412 Conceptual Physics & Modified MasteringPhysics with Pearson eText - Access Card -- for Conceptual Physics Package Package consists of: 0321909100 / 9780321909107 Conceptual Physics 0321940652 / 9780321940650 Modified MasteringPhysics with Pearson eText -- ValuePack Access Card -- for Conceptual Physics","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x5_CjgEACAAJ&dq=Conceptual+Physics+Package+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Noonday Changes: A Story of Self-Conflict and Possibilities, Love and Growth","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Modern Linear and Nonlinear Econometrics","description":"The basic characteristic of Modern Linear and Nonlinear Econometrics is that it presents a unified approach of modern linear and nonlinear econometrics in a concise and intuitive way. It covers four major parts of modern econometrics: linear and nonlinear estimation and testing, time series analysis, models with categorical and limited dependent variables, and, finally, a thorough analysis of linear and nonlinear panel data modeling. Distinctive features of this handbook are: -A unified approach of both linear and nonlinear econometrics, with an integration of the theory and the practice in modern econometrics. Emphasis on sound theoretical and empirical relevance and intuition. Focus on econometric and statistical methods for the analysis of linear and nonlinear processes in economics and finance, including computational methods and numerical tools. -Completely worked out empirical illustrations are provided throughout, the macroeconomic and microeconomic (household and firm level) data sets of which are available from the internet; these empirical illustrations are taken from finance (e.g. CAPM and derivatives), international economics (e.g. exchange rates), innovation economics (e.g. patenting), business cycle analysis, monetary economics, housing economics, labor and educational economics (e.g. demand for teachers according to gender) and many others. -Exercises are added to the chapters, with a focus on the interpretation of results; several of these exercises involve the use of actual data that are typical for current empirical work and that are made available on the internet. What is also distinguishable in Modern Linear and Nonlinear Econometrics is that every major topic has a number of examples, exercises or case studies. By this \`learning by doing' method the intention is to prepare the reader to be able to design, develop and successfully finish his or her own research and/or solve real world problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=50tuO8hWGbAC&dq=Modern+Linear+and+Nonlinear+Econometrics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lost Frontier: The Marketing of Alaska","description":"Alaska looms as a mythical, savage place, part nature preserve, part theme park, too vast to understand fully.

Captain Joe Bernard spent decades in Alaska, amassing the largest single collection of Native artifacts ever gathered, giving his name to landmarks and even a now-extinct species of wolf. C. B. chased the legacy of this explorer and hunter up the family tree, tracking his correspondence, locating artifacts donated to museums, and finding his journals at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks. Using these journals as guides, he threw himself into the state once known as Seward s Folly, boating to remote islands, hiking distant forests, hunting and fishing the pristine environment, forming a landscape view of the place that had lured him and  Uncle Joe,  both men anchored beneath the Northern Lights in freezing, far-flung waters, separated only by time.

The images in this volume date largely between 1870 and 1950, a period that documents great change in Tohono O'odham traditions, culture, and identity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vfekQWOXtSUC&dq=Arizona+(Portrait+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century","description":"Examines the role of espionage in world history through a discussion of information gathering in the modern world, including spy technology, the Cold War, and crisis intelligence","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=108SDAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Century+of+Spies:+Intelligence+in+the+Twentieth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jew and modern Israel: [in the light of prophecy]","description":"Return to Me, My Love is an in-depth look at the end-times prophecies concerning the Jews and Israel as seen through the eyes of St. John, the Revelator. Most books on the Revelation attempt to interpret what John was trying to say but contend that he couldn t find the correct words to describe the visions he was given. Such interpretations are not very helpful in the understanding the Revelation or the entire panoply of end-times prophecy for that matter. The Revelation defines and explains each of the terms it uses if the reader will carefully consider John s words in light of all the prophecies of the Old and New Testaments taken together as a whole. This book does exactly that! It is a literal approach to the study of Prophecy. Over 500 pages of additional research materials are available on-line to prove what is contained in the book! In Return to Me, My Love, the author assumes the role of St. John as he explains each verse of the Revelation to his reading audience and shows them how it foretells the entire counsel of God concerning the Last Days. In this book, the reader will be shown how God took the people of Israel as his wife but, after bearing with their centuries of apostasy against him, he finally wrote them a Bill of Divorce and sent them away. Yet, the Lord was not done with Israel, and just as he wrote in Hosea, he was determined to allure her and eventually bring her back to him. We are seeing that story being played out as we watch the modern State of Israel struggle without her Messiah, Jesus. The Tribulation that is coming in last-days Israel will be God s way of testing his Jewish people, purging the nation of its apostasy, and taking back the remnant of his Chosen People to be his wife hence the title of the book. This is a must read and is unlike anything currently available on prophecy. Every Christian needs to understand prophecy in order to be ready to assist the Jews when their time of trial begins.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VRQ_7JxTsyEC&dq=The+Jew+and+modern+Israel:+%5Bin+the+light+of+prophecy%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","description":"\\"A superb book.\\" THE HOUSTON CHRONICLE When quiet, shy Amelia Jones reads a desperate message that has fallen out of a barrel organ in the antique shop she just bought, she can't forget the words, \\"They're going to kill me soon...\\" Armed only with the woman's first name and the note written years before, Amelia begins a journey into the past, a search that takes her from the protective cocoon she's wrapped herself in to a precarious world where nothing is the way it seems, where fear is second nature, and dark secrets just might uncover murder--her own....","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zniBAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Very Own Big Dictionary","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Complete Drug Reference, 2000 Edition (Consumer Drug Reference)","description":"A one-step resource for consumers and patients provides vital information--including side effects, interactions, and precautions--on thousands of prescription and nonprescription medications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OvGmzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Drug+Reference,+2000+Edition+(Consumer+Drug+Reference)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","description":"In a hierarchy, every employee rises to the level of their own incompetence.This simple maxim, defined by this classic book over 40 years ago, has become a beacon of truth in the world of work.

Mom,  I said to her,  isn t that kind of pathetic?   Well, it s realistic.  It s her thirty-sixth birthday, and she really thought things would be different this year that she d have figured out men and how to get along with her narcissistic parents enough to survive a birthday celebration. But nothing s changed. Her disappointing day is capped off by the delivery of a huge bouquet of flowers from Carl, with whom she has recently, and bitterly, split. A gesture of reconciliation? Of passive aggression? She s too unhinged to tell. It s My F---ing Birthday unfolds in seven state-of-my-life addresses this hapless high school art teacher writes to herself on consecutive birthdays, as she is determined to break the patterns of behavior that are keeping her down. Her objective: to avoid making the same mistakes over and over and start making some new ones. Through seven outrageously funny years of needling parents, self-absorbed boyfriends, riots, O.J., and Monica and bigger and bigger bouquets from Carl she navigates a circuitous (and ultimately successful) route to happiness in a world where everything seems to conspire to the contrary. What I Learned This Year That I Need to Remember 1. No more taking the bait from Mom. Even if the fight becomes about not taking the bait. 2. No more dwelling in the past. 3. Try much harder to continue being a vegetarian. This will limit the restaurants the folks can take me to. 4. No more trying to decode the flowers from Carl. If he sends them again, just think of them as a fun, free thing, like a little sample box of cereal or detergent that suddenly appears in the mailbox. 5. Don t make a big deal out of the fact that there were no guys this year. Perhaps that s a better thing than continuing to get involved with guys who exhibit behavior from the beginning that indicates the whole thing is completely hopeless. So try to remember the above as a coping strategy when I am so crazed with horniness that I want to throw myself off a building. 6. No more mumbo jumbo. This means no more calling 900 astrology numbers listed at the end of horoscopes in women s magazines to find out my love forecast.

As its author emphasizes, the music of the Orthodox Church cannot be understood in purely aesthetic categories, apart from the liturgical context which determines both its content and its function. Accordingly, this first volume examines not only the early history of Russian chant, but also the structure of Orthodox worship and the poetical forms of its hymnography. Dr. Johann von Gardner, the eminent Russian-born musicologist, holds the Chair of Russian Liturgical Music at the University of Munich. Over the past fifty years he has written over 300 articles on liturgical music as well as several major scholarly books. Russian Church Singing represents the culmination of his scholarly labors. St. Vladimir's Seminary Press publishes a wide selection of books on Orthodox theology, worship, history, spirituality and art. These include such works as Theology of the Icon by Leonid Ouspensky, an illustrated exploration of the Orthodox understanding of the icon; Introduction to Liturgical Theology by Alexander Schmemann, which studies the ordo or \\"shape\\" of Orthodox worship and its historical evolution from its beginnings down to the Byzantine synthesis of the ninthtwelfth centuries; Nicholas Cabasilas' Commentary on the Divine Liturgy, a classic expression of Byzantium's last great flowering of theology; and The Russians and Their Church by Nicholas Zernov, a popular survey of the entire scope of Russian Church history. All four books provide further insights into the life and thought of the Orthodox Church.

Hundreds of years in our future, humanity is expanding out into the galaxy in gigantic colony ships. Slower than light speed, the ships are filled with long-lived people who are, nevertheless, in suspended animation for all or much of the voyage. One ship has reached a promising world and begun a colony, but not everyone has yet been awakened. Matthew Fleury is shocked to learn that he has been revived from suspended animation to replace a colleague who has been murdered. Is the planet still inhabited by the alien race that left ancient ruins of great cities? And who killed the eminent scientist leading the investigation of the ruins? If the aliens survive, then the planet becomes off limits to humans, and the ship must find another planet to colonize. There are some colonists who would kill to leave. And some who would kill to stay.

Dustin Lance Black wrote the Oscar-winning screenplay for Milk and helped overturn California's anti-gay marriage Proposition 8, but as an LGBTQ activist he has unlikely origins--a conservative Mormon household outside San Antonio, Texas. His mother, Anne, was raised in rural Louisiana and contracted polio when she was two years old. She endured brutal surgeries, as well as braces and crutches for life, and was told that she would never have children or a family. Willfully defying expectations, she found salvation in an unlikely faith, raised three rough-and-rowdy boys, and escaped the abuse and violence of two questionably devised Mormon marriages before finding love and an improbable career in the U.S. civil service. By the time Lance came out to his mother at age twenty-one, he was a blue-state young man studying the arts instead of going on his Mormon mission. She derided his sexuality as a sinful choice and was terrified for his future. It may seem like theirs was a house destined to be divided, and at times it was. This story shines light on what it took to remain a family despite such division--a journey that stretched from the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court to the woodsheds of East Texas. In the end, the rifts that have split a nation couldn't end this relationship that defined and inspired their remarkable lives. Mama's Boy is their story. It's a story of the noble quest for a plane higher than politics--a story of family, foundations, turmoil, tragedy, elation, and love. It is a story needed now more than ever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EWbRDwAAQBAJ&dq=Mama%27s+Boy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heart of the Matter","description":"\\"Giffin excels at creating complex characters and stories that ask us to explore what we really want from our lives.\\"--Atlanta Journal-Constitution Tessa Russo is the mother of two young children and the wife of a renowned pediatric surgeon.

Valerie Anderson is an attorney and single mother to six-year-old Charlie--a boy who has never known his father. After too many disappointments, she has given up on romance--and even to some degree, friendships--believing that it is always safer not to expect too much. Although both women live in the same Boston suburb, the two have relatively little in common aside from a fierce love for their children. But one night, a tragic accident causes their lives to converge in ways no one could have imagined. In alternating, pitch-perfect points of view, Emily Giffin's Heart of the Matter creates a moving, luminous story of good people caught in untenable circumstances. Each being tested in ways they never thought possible. Each questioning everything they once believed. And each ultimately discovering what truly matters most.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q5QRRluMxecC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wonderful Nature, Wonderful You","description":"Nature can be a great teacher!

Although fought by light units with no dreadnoughts involved, Otranto was a battle in three dimensions -- engaging surface vessels, aircraft, and subsurface weapons (both submarines and mines). An attempt to halt the movement of submarines into the Adriatic using British drifters armed with nets and mines led to a raid by Austrian light cruisers. The Austrians inflicted heavy damage on the drifters, but Allied naval forces based at Brindisi cut off their withdrawal. The daylight hours saw a running battle, with the Austrians at considerable risk. Heavier Austrian units put out from Cattaro in support, and at the climactic moment the Allied light forces had to turn away, permitting the Austrians to escape. In the end, the Austrians had inflicted more damage than they suffered themselves. The Otranto action shows the difficulties of waging coalition warfare in which diplomatic and national jealousies override military efficiency.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4NrQnWliFxUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Official Patient's Sourcebook on Sarcoidosis","description":"This book has been created for patients who have decided to make education and research an integral part of the treatment process.

Cultural critic and popular radio host Michael Medved and his wife, psychologist Diane Medved, argue that in a mistaken effort to curb problems plaguing its youth, our culture has changed from protecting childhood as a precious time of growth to hammering even the smallest youngsters with a grim, harsh, and menacing view of the world. The Medveds systematically present unassailable scientific evidence, moving anecdotes, and personal experiences of raising their three young children to explain the attack from four primary directions--media, schools, peers, and even well-intentioned parents themselves. In a unique analysis the Medveds define innocence not as ignorance but as the result of three components--security, a sense of wonder and optimism. They empower parents and all who care about childhood with concrete, easily accomplished means to fend off the assault, as well as advice for handling hurdles such as the Internet, television, peer pressure, and the plague of pessimism. Saving Childhood enables us to restore and maintain for our children imagination, confidence, and hope for the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l5TZDDGfG8QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Early Man,","description":"The official novelization of the major stop-motion children's movie!

I watched my father, my father-in-law and my sister-in-law die of cancer caused by the radiation fallout they were exposed to. I have also lost many friends and acquaintances as a result of the Nevada tests. Helplessly watching a loved one die a slow and painful death affects a person. You can either let it tear you apart, or learn from it. I am simply a person that has experienced situations that I have chosen to learn from. I made a promise to myself that I would never let myself be helpless in a medical emergency, tragedy, or disaster again. If our country was attacked in the morning and they used germs, bacteria, viruses, radioactive fallout from a bomb or an attack on a nuclear power plant, are you even a little bit prepared? Do you have more than a few days of food and water in your home? Can you clean radiation from your food and water, and if so how? Do you have any potassium iodide? What about infections? If you get a heavy dose of radiation, it compromises your immune system and leaves you vulnerable to infections. Think of this book as real life insurance; insurance to keep you alive, not money to be used by others when you are gone. The government is simply unprepared for a potential national crisis of this magnitude. Remember, knowledge is power but only if you take action and prepare before an emergency situation develops. Please do not wait until it is TOO LATE.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6MJn1NUjNZMC&dq=Downwinders:+Your+Personal+Survival+Guide+to+an+Uncertain+Future&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Calculus and Analytic Geometry - Student's Solutions Manual, Part 2","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bYYpAQAAMAAJ&dq=Calculus+and+Analytic+Geometry+-+Student%27s+Solutions+Manual,+Part+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My search for the truth","description":"An anthology of wisdom and beauty.

He solidified his standing as the nation's foremost political forecaster with his near perfect prediction of the 2012 election. Silver is the founder and editor in chief of the website FiveThirtyEight. Drawing on his own groundbreaking work, Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the  prediction paradox : The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future. In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, Silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball to global pandemics, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. He explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share. What lies behind their success? Are they good or just lucky? What patterns have they unraveled? And are their forecasts really right? He explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions. And sometimes, it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition. In other cases, prediction is still a very rudimentary and dangerous science. Silver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability, and they tend to be both humble and hardworking. They distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable, and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth. Because of their appreciation of probability, they can distinguish the signal from the noise. With everything from the health of the global economy to our ability to fight terrorism dependent on the quality of our predictions, Nate Silver s insights are an essential read.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ekWLDQAAQBAJ&dq=Suburban+Metaphysics+and+Other+Stories+(MVP)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Final Analysis: An Eisenmenger-Flemming Forensic Mystery","description":"This is a forensic thriller starring John Eisenmenger, his partner, Helena Flemming, and police officer Beverley Wharton. It is about a series of gruesome murders that Beverley Wharton was convinced were done by Melkior Pendred, a mortuary technician with mental problems. But Melkior can't have done a sixth murder, which gives her rival, Chief Inspector Homer, just the opportunity he needs: he always thought the real killer was Martin, Melkior's twin brother... Then there is another murder. Beverley enlists the help of John Eisenmenger to prove that this is more than just another case of misjustice. But Martin is a strange man as Helena Flemming, his solicitor, soon discovers, and she has problems of her own, having just discovered that she has a breast lump. John and Beverley soon discover that the deaths are due to something far more complex than a disturbed man's madness; Helena, though, soon discovers that danger can come from more than one direction","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iqiNngEACAAJ&dq=The+Final+Analysis:+An+Eisenmenger-Flemming+Forensic+Mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hagee 3-in-1 Beginning Of The End, Final Dawn Over Jerusalem, Day Of Deception","description":"Beginning of the End.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HYbFHClxqJUC&dq=Hagee+3-in-1+Beginning+Of+The+End,+Final+Dawn+Over+Jerusalem,+Day+Of+Deception&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture","description":"The best known, most often cited history of anthropological theory is finally available in paperback! First published in 1968, Harris's book has been cited in over 1,000 works and is one of the key documents explaining cultural materialism, the theory associated with Harris's work. This updated edition included the complete 1968 text plus a new introduction by Maxine Margolis, which discusses the impact of the book and highlights some of the major trends in anthropological theory since its original publication. RAT, as it is affectionately known to three decades of graduate students, comprehensively traces the history of anthropology and anthropological theory, culminating in a strong argument for the use of a scientific, behaviorally-based, etic approach to the understanding of human culture known as cultural materialism. Despite its popularity and influence on anthropological thinking, RAT has never been available in paperback_until now. It is an essential volume for the library of all anthropologists, their graduate students, and other theorists in the social sciences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yUUYN3X18dwC&dq=The+Rise+of+Anthropological+Theory:+A+History+of+Theories+of+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","description":"I'd always been different.

It wasn't just that he was breathtakingly handsome with perfect features. Something about him drew me. Sucked my focus to him and then tugged at my body. As his eyes met mine, I was entrapped. No one had noticed him. He'd been right there, just beyond the light, but only I had perceived. I had to know if he was real. Or maybe I really was crazy. And even when my secret box was blasted wide open, dangers hurled at me like throwing knives, I couldn't stop until I unraveled his true identity.

As well, because the authors believe strongly that an effective composition textbook should address students directly, they've aimed for a conversational yet clear style that invites students into the book, lessens their apprehensions about writing, and provides a model for their own prose. This style complements the authors' strong student-based approach to writing, and together they help create a text that genuinely meets student needs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c5MXAQAAMAAJ&dq=Strategies+for+Successful+Writing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goldwater","description":"An elder statesman of the Republican party recounts his long, colorful career, offering insights into the famous figures he has known and the events he has witnessed, as well as proposals for positive change","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YFJ3AAAAMAAJ&dq=Goldwater&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christmas Stories (Standard Literature Series)","description":"The perfect gift this Christmas season: a generous selection of some of the greatest festive stories of all time This is a collection of the most magical, moving, chilling and surprising Christmas stories from around the world, taking us from frozen Nordic woods to glittering Paris, a New York speakeasy to an English country house, bustling Lagos to midnight mass in Rio, and even outer space.
