Bullinger shows thru numerical values, gematria, and other mathematical means that &quot;the Bible has but one Author...carrying out His own infinite plans&quot;. He makes the mathematician love the scriptures and the religious love math. One of my favorite parts is when he is explaining Dr. Milo Mahan's work on the principle of number 8 and number 13, and he gets passionate with the validity of the Bible, as over and over he demonstrates with gematria that every single name of the Lord's people are multiples of 8 and every one who were His enemies, are multiples of 13. It is one of the only books of its genre that wasn't exclusively written for Jews."},{"Title":"Number in Scripture: Its supernatural design and spiritual significance","review":"Don't miss reading the book along with the Bible.

The book shows how God (YHWH) uses numbers to symbolize various concepts. Each number is always used to show the same concept throughout the entire 66 books. The number 7 is a good place to begin study as it is emphasized. Certain names and words are repeated 7 times throuhout the 66 books even though various men set down the words to paper. Only the Holy Spirit could have designed such order. No man nor computer could have produced such results. Bullinger gives many examples. He provides the original Greek and Hebrew texts in his examples."},{"Title":"Number in Scripture: Its supernatural design and spiritual significance","review":"This is not a book on numerology which is a false religion, this is exactly what the title says - this is a book about numbers in the scriptures. Anything that God creates can be perverted for an evil purpose, this is not what this book is about. This book shows the intelligent design of the Scriptures by showing the supernatural intelligent use of numbers in the Scriptures as well as in nature. If you want to read this book it won't take you much time. If you want to truly study this book, it could take you a year. Great book!"},{"Title":"Number in Scripture: Its supernatural design and spiritual significance","review":"Here is yet another great book by the insightful E.W.

As the author admits this is not an all inclusive how to train your dog book. But, it does touch on training and specific to dachshunds. They can be a quirky breed (of course that only makes that more lovable!). Those quirks are covered well in this book. Potty issues are always something to contend with when you own a dachshund, but the book touches on how to deal with that. Other training books are generic and not specific. The care for a dachshund is a little different due to their structure.......this is also covered in the book. Other than all that......the pictures are just gorgeous!!!!!! You can't turn a page without each dachshund touching your heart. This also would make a wonderful present for any dachshund lover.

I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the first three mysteries. Characters are interesting and nicely developed. Daisy's Folly was a charming book that I finished in the less than a day. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"The third book in the delightful Victorian Mysteries series, Death at Daisy's Folly holds up well against the previous two books. While each book takes a real historical figure and involves them in the mystery in some way, this book was significantly more history-focused than the previous two. The historical figures play a more prominent role in this book, and the authors go more into depth explaining the political landscape as it related to foreign competition, adultery, the rising technology of the automobile, the poor, and the changes in class structure at the time.The mystery was good and the culprit not at all obvious (but believable), though somewhat overshadowed by the historical aspects of the story. Kate and Charles (the unofficial detectives of the series) were also more sidelined and two-dimensional than they usually are, which was a little disappointing. Overall, this is a solid addition to the series and I look forward to reading more about the adventures of Kate and Charles."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"When his young groom is found dead, the Prince of Wales asks Sir Charles Sheridan to look into the matter. Ably aided by Kate Ardleigh, an American who secretly pens penny-dreadfuls, Sheridan soon finds that behind it proper facades, the upper class is hiding some very sordid secrets.Death at Daisy's Folly is a treat for readers of historical British mysteries. It is obvious that a lot of research went into the creation of this book. Set at an 1890's weekend house party and featuring real historical figures, the story explores the private lives of the privileged and contrasts it with the daily lot of the servant class.Charles and Kate make a likable team. I was particularly glad to see the authors finally develop Charles into something more than just a science geek.Having enjoyed this book, I will definitely read the next entry in the series."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"I love how the authors always bring real historical figures into their plots - it such a fun way to learn a little more history!

If you are going to read Death at Daisy's Folly start with Death at Bishop's Keep the first book in the series as this book introduces the main characters that will be with you through out the series. Was very disappointed when Robin Paige discontinued the series. Purchased the series from Amazon twice. First in paperback and second for my Kindle Fire."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"I went on a trip and did not bring the fourth installment of this series because I assumed I would not finish Daisy's Folly. Wasn't I mistaken! I finished it before I even boarding my connecting flight. I was particularly pleased that Ms. Page did not see the need to use a lengthy back story to introduce her characters. She knows that we already know them=). While I thought the plot for the murder was a bit stretched, and that keeping the numerous characters straight was a trial, I still think it was a good story. The artifice involved in the characters is so enraging to the modern mind that it's a wonder you don't scream at Lord Warwick to do something. For God's sake, the man's wife is having an affair right in front of him! Ah, but those were different days. Good riddance!"},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"This is the third book in the Victorian Mystery series. Kate, an American who has inherited her aunt's estate and Sir Charles Sheridan have been invited to the Earl and Countess of Warwick's estate for a country retreat. The esteemed guest of the party is the Prince of Wales, who has the Countess (Daisy) as his mistress. The book opens with the death of a stable boy, initially thought of as an accident. There is another death as the book progresses. We get to see a fascinating take on how the upper-upper crust lived at the time and what they could get away with that would be scandalous elsewhere. While there is much bedroom intrigue and multiple suspects, we get to see that Daisy is more than just a silly woman and is passionate in her causes to help the poor which endears her to Kate. Intermixed with the murder mystery is the relationship between Kate and Charles, who both realize that they love each other, but each has reasons to believe that a marriage is impossible. This was a good mystery, and had nice development of the main characters. The historical characters and elements were well reseached and excellently portrayed."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"I read light, entertaining novels for relaxation and escape from sometimes boring real life. This series by Robin Paige fits the bill."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"Sir Charles Sheridan finally decides to ask Kate to marry him. Readers of this series have surely been waiting for this moment. But the proposal is overshadowed by a mystery. Charles and Kate are guests at a weekend house party, thrown by the Prince of Wales's long-time mistress. A servant and a party guest die, and Charles is charged with investigating.This books paints a colorful picture of the dynamics of the country house party. The series does an excellent job of showing the elaborate codes of behavior that governed the Victorian upper classes. The mystery itself was fairly unremarkable- actually fairly forgettable. Still, a decent, atmospheric book for those who like historical mysteries."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"I've enjoyed the Robin Paige Murder Mysteries (aka as co-authors Susan and Bill Albert), especially enjoying their fictional story of the Prince of Wales and his entourage of blue bloods as they look forward to a countryside sanctuary that soon turns tragic. The historical possibilities read as fact and when the Prince speaks, you can hear his voice in your head as if he were standing in front of you. I recommend reading the first, if not first and second books in this series to best relate to the two slueths (Miss Kate Ardleigh and Sir Charles Sheridan) who graciously lead us through a twist of events within high-society and the distinction of the downstairs inhabitants. P.S. don't forget to dress for tea!"},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"This is the third in a series of period mysteries written by a husband and wife team under a pseudonym. The books are well-written and well-researched, replete with period detail evocative of a bygone era.The linchpin of this series is Kathryn Ardleigh, an independent American woman with English roots who has settled in England due to an inheritance. The character of Sir Charles Sheridan, who is most definitely enamored of the feisty Katherine, is becoming more prominent in the series, as he becomes more entwined into Katherine's life.While both are houseguests at the Duchess of Warwick's country estate, a series of mysterious deaths bring Kathryn and Sir Charles closer together. As Sir Charles struggles with his feelings for Kathryn and the fact that he may soon become a Baron, the Prince of Wales privately commissions him to get to the bottom of what is going on in order to avoid a scandal that could involve the Prince and the Duchess should the matter become public.Together, Kathryn and Sir Charles discover that not even those to the manor born are exempt from from perpetrating the foulest of deeds. They also discover a great deal about their feelings for each other. As with all cozy mysteries, it is not so much the mystery that is of import but the characters that revolve around the mystery. While the mystery is intriguing, it is simply the framework around which the characters evolve. Those who enjoy the historical cozy mystery genre will definitely love this series.It is of interest that these books always seem to include a historical personage and/or event that is intertwined into the mystery at hand. The historical notes at the end of the book are most enjoyable, as they allow the reader to understand the reasoning and research that went into such inclusion. For those who enjoy history, this is an added bonus to these books."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"Sir Charles Sheridan is terribly attracted to the dashing young American lady, Kathryn Ardleigh. However, with the bad news about his brother, Sir Charles feels that he should back off thinking of marriage. Dashed awkward that the pair of them will be thrown together at the house party given by Lady Frances Brooke, the latest mistress of Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales (known to his friends as Bertie).But then the royal groom is bashed on the head in the stables, and Bertie asked Sir Sheridan to investigate. The next thing you know murder breaks out and guests at the fancy house party are dropping like flies. It must be a plot...but is it the anarchists?The amazing thing about this entertaining mystery is that the most colorful and eccentric characters are accurate depictions of historical figures. Bertie really was a wild blade and his lovely mistress, Lady Brooke was really called Daisy. The events at this house party really did cause Daisy to lose favor with the prince. The authors include a fascinating bibliography which looks like fun. Certainly the product of their research is a painless way to learn about things like motoring in the Victorian Era.This is a \\"British\\" historical mystery written by a husband and wife team who live in Texas. Susan Wittig Albert writes the China Bayles series on her own. Her husband, Bill Albert is described as the co-author of more than 60 books. That this is a real collaboration is shown by the fact that both the male and female sets of characters are equally strong and vivid. They've done a great job with the history, but the fictional detectives are somehow less vivid and believable."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"While I enjoyed the first novel in this series, I thought this second novel was not up to par. The characters were not particularly deep or engaging and I was not sure why Beatrix Potter was in the plot. I was not drawn into the characters' world as I had expected to be based on the first novel and probably will not pick up the next novel in the series. It seems to me that the author(s) were aiming at a much younger audience than grown women."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"The era of the 'Great House' and the lavish parties held in them are unfortunately, in the past. Thanks to Robin Paige, however, we can relive them vicariously, while being afforded the opportunity to solve a crime or two along the way.This is the third of a delightful series, set in an exciting time -- the last few years of the previous century. Cameras have already proven their merits, soon it will be motor cars and after that, who knows?Kate Ardleigh, an Irish-American orphan, has struggled to support herself writing 'penny-dreadful's' under the pseudonym of Beryl Bardwell. When she discovered to her great surprise that she had an aunt -- in England -- she set off for a visit. While she is there, her aunt dies, and suddenly, Kate is an heiress. As an independent woman, however, she refuses to give up her writing. It is while searching for background for her novels, that she first meets Sir Charles Sheridan in her first adventure, Death at Gallow's Green.Charles is a scientist and photographer who won his knighthood for a celebratory photograph of Queen Victoria, and at first, he indulges Kate's curiosity as a novelty. It doesn't take long for either of them to realize the feelings go much deeper than expected. Now, when he is invited to Easton Grange, home of the Earl and Countess of Warwick along with the Prince of Wales and his entourage, Charles discovers that his older brother -- the heir -- is dying, childless. His plan to propose to Kate is thrown into disarray by a murder. Bertie instructs Charles to investigate, eliminating the necessity to call in the local police, which will certainly dismay Bertie's Mama - the Queen.Historically accurate, this is an enjoyable deductive mystery, which will keep you guessing until the last moment. You won't want to miss the final author's notes about the 'Darling Daisy' of the title (in reality, the Countess) and you'll probably want to investigate the books in the bibliography. I did."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"I enjoyed all of the books in this series but this was the best one. The romance between Charles Sheridan and Kate Ardleigh moved along nicely and the mystery was interesting and well thought out. I especially enjoy the historical tidbits of life in Victorian England."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"As usual in the Victorian Mystery series by Robin Paige, the authors mix in historical people into their fictions. In Death at Daisy's Folly, we spend a country weekend with the Prince of Wales (Bertie) and his mistress the Countess of Warwick (Daisy) along with 20 other guests. The death of the prince's new groom under mysterious circumstances and the definite homicide of a nobleman prompts Bertie to enlist the detecting powers of Sir Charles Sheridan and Kate Ardleigh, both guests for the weekend. The life of Daisy plays a significant role in the story, and the authors have done thorough research into this real person, and they bring her to life so that we can see the charm she must have had to attract the prince. The morals and mores of the Marlborough Set, as the friends of the prince are called, drive the action of the story and provide unexpected motives. The relationship of Charles and Kate deepens, and Charles' responses are particularily delightful. All in all, another winner from Robin Paige."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"In the third book of this series we find Kate Ardleigh and Sir Charles Sheridan visiting Easton Grange the home of Lord and Lady Brooke, the Earl and Countess of Warwick. Among the other guests of this quite real historical couple is the also very real son of Queen Victoria, Prince Albert Edward the future Edward VII. The mixing of fiction with non-fiction adds a great deal of interest to these books and this story in fact revolves around these historical characters. In the previous two books the real people who found their way into the story were for the most part bit players. The story is also aided by the unflinching manner with which the characters are described. The people that have gathered at the Warwick home for a weekend of festivities are all obviously of the highest aristocratic order and this book describes their miserable existence in faithful detail. With this type of immoral, pompous, self-serving elite running things it is a wonder that the Empire lasted as long as it did.Straight away there is a death that at first appears to be an accident but Sir Charles is not so sure about that. The Prince orders the amateur sleuth to investigate but soon there is another death and this one is definitely no accident. Once again the Prince asks Charles to investigate and this time Charles asks the Kate be allowed to assist him. \\"Holmes and Watson\\" the future King announces and goes off to lunch. Charles and Kate turn all of their energies to the investigation but only come up with a few real clues along with a lot of conjecture and what ifs. Finally though, in a rather explosive ending the whole story comes out and justice is done.As in the previous books, the romantic feelings that Sir Charles and Kate have for each other provide an intriguing side plot. New complications and roadblocks keep getting in the way of their romance and the affectionate pair have to face and overcome each and every one. In this story they continue down the road to romance and even matrimony and this book gets just a little too mushy in places. So mushy in fact that it distracts from the mystery to some extent, but not too badly. For some people I am sure this mush will actually add to the story, it just didn't have that effect on me. Another slight drawback is that the old canard about the Prince's son being the reason for the Ripper murders makes an appearance. The authors of this series have obviously done a great deal of research and should know better.For some reason this book is a little slow for the first hundred pages or so. I can't figure out just why but it took about a hundred pages for me to really begin to get into the story. Once I did however, I read voraciously until the killer was revealed. This book may not have been quite as good as the previous two but I still found it to be very entertaining and enjoyable and I find that I am looking very forward to my next adventure with Sir Charles and Kate."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"This is the third book in an excellent series of Victorian mysteries. The romance in these books reminds me somewhat of the delightful Harriet Vane/Lord Peter mysteries by Dorothy Sayers. The historical research is impressive and the writing is great. In Death at Daisy's Folly the authors describe life the highest ranks of society in Victorian England. The Prince of Wales and his mistress, Daisy, are spending a weekend at Daisy's estate. Sir Charles Sheridan is asked by the Prince to investigate a suspicious death, and Sir Charles and the lovely Kate are thrown together again during the investigation. If you enjoy romance, history and mystery, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"Heroine Kate Ardleigh is an independent woman helping to solve crimes during Victorian times (late 1800s) in England. She doesn't quite fit in: she's American, she's of Irish descent, she's independent, she's interested in corpses, and she writes lurid crime stories under the pseudonym Beryl Bardwell. None of these characteristics is suitable for a proper British lady of society!Part of what makes this series interesting is the historical research the authors have done into the people, time, places and events that Kate experiences. The time period is the birth of many techniques and technologies, such as photography, crime scene investigation, air travel, and the automobile.Another element making this series enjoyable is the developing romance between Kate and Sir Charles. They are a perfect match for each other, but their secret backgrounds and responsibilities threaten to keep them apart.The story is filled with actual historical figures, all of whom Kate and Charles manage to meet. Beatrix Potter and her furry characters become Kate's friends in the first book of the series. In Death at Daisy's Folly, Kate and Charles mingle with the Prince of Wales and his mistress, Daisy, at a weekend house party at Daisy's husband's estate. Daisy's Folly is the\\"hideaway\\" on the estate outfitted with boudoirs for amorous assignations. In all the books, death comes unexpectedly, and Kate and Charles are eager to solve the crimes.For those of you who have devoured all of Elizabeth Peters' Amelia Peabody series, there are similarities in Robin Paige'sbooks, though in a decidedly more sedate tone and with fewer harrowing adventures. Just as Amelia knows better than Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter where to dig in the Valley of the Kings, Kate and Charles are on the cutting edge, setting forensic practices in motion, always at least one step ahead of the constables. The characters are charming and the details make the Victorian Era come to life. And if a little murder and some sleuthing can be done among Britain's elite, so be it."},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"I got started in the series with one of the later books,Death at Blenheim Palace, and was totally taken by the historical detail and the quality of the characters, so I purchased several more in the series.As with the other works, the husband-wife authors have worked magic with their thorough research of the period in which they have set their action. Susan Wittig Albert is a former professor of literature--I assume it is she who is primarily responsible for the writing--and this is abundantly apparent from the skillful use of the English language and the principles of composition; this is very readable literature, not just a \\"who-dunnit.\\"Also evident is the extent to which there is attention to the details of the period. The research has to have been pretty immersive, since little that creates an authentic ambiance has been neglected. I presume, although I could find out very little about him, that Bill Albert is responsible for the research, and I suspect a degree of at least some level in history. Whatever the case, it seems to be quite thorough, which makes the books the two write together very authentic.In this case the murder is set in an actual country estate and involves the historic individuals that owned it. The heavily structured lifestyle of the upper class English nobility, here that of the Earl and Countess of Warwick--Francis and Frances Brooke--and Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales at the Time (later Edward VII) is realistically portrayed; more so, as the authors have allowed the central historic figure to give voice to her own feelings about her circumstances, feelings that might not have been obvious to her contemporaries or even to those studying and writing about her and her contributions to society postmortem.Interesting too is the sense of political and cultural change going on at this time. Europe and Great Britain have yet to go through the turmoil that brought about the modern era. Especially in this particular book, socialism as it was viewed by the establishment is just beginning to threaten the status quo; being privileged to the knowledge of WWI and WWII and the changes that these wars introduced, the reader can almost sense how close to the edge the characters are. These are the last of the fabulously wealthy 19th century aristocrats, and the authors make it evident that they are an endangered species. Even the characters seem to be aware of it. By this period, roughly 1880-1900, they are barely hanging on to what their ancestors fully enjoyed and left to them. Marriages between American heiresses and the upper nobility were being arranged to salvage what could be of the historic prerogatives and wasteful lifestyles of these families as conditions and society were changing forever.The elements of the murder are not unlike another of the series, although the motives for murder are very real, but it is the opportunity to \\"see\\" the country house of an aristocratic family as vaunted as the Warwick's that is the true delight; one is almost \\"there.\\" All of the senses are treated in the venue, sight, sound, smell, touch, even taste (menus are provided), making the experience total.One of the touches I enjoy most with these books is the quotation from authors regarding the life of the time that head each chapter. Particularly poignant in this volume was the quotation from John Dryden:Be fair or foul, or rain or shine,The joys I have possessed, in spite of fate, are mine.Not heaven itself upon the past has power;But what has been, has been, and I have had my hour.Beautiful. A wonderful experience"},{"Title":"Death at Daisy's Folly (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 3)","review":"These authors can write a good Victorian mystery. It helps that they delve into the history books, and use actual incidences that lend credence to their story. This book talks about Queeen Victoria's son, Albert's propensity for married lovers - some of the worst kept secrets from that era. Daisy was a real person and was actually involved with the Prince. The story is realistic, and the characters are niceley portrayed. I really like Charles and Kathryn and think they make a good detective team.

I never guessed the culprit, though there were plenty of clues and lots of characters to think about.

Each one uniqely different."},{"Title":"Pigeon Feathers & Other Stories","review":"If there is, you have my attention. Maybe Isaac Babel's Collected Stories or Fitzgerald's Selected Stories. I've been writing for 27 years; I may have written three sentences that compare with the average in an Updike story. In \\"Flight\\" he captures more in several sentences about family than I've disentangled through an entire career. Sorry for being self-referential; it's a measure of my awe. Updike's magic is that he can tell a story in a single sentence. If you only know Updike through his novels, you're in for a treat. By my lights, this is one of the greatest living story writers and this is the book that made that clear.Update: I'd take this down a notch, though still five stars. I no longer think Updike is one of our greatest story writers. It's his use of language that charms me. Now that I've finally completed Swann's Way, begun in 1989, I think Updike uses language more skillfully than all but the very best of Proust. But his story imagination, while always interesting, doesn't alter the light of day."},{"Title":"Pigeon Feathers & Other Stories","review":"These stories are sublime.

If you are a writer of short stories, make this your Bible."},{"Title":"Pigeon Feathers & Other Stories","review":"The images in these stories are so lyrical, so sadly ethereal, I'd not be surprised to find the pages of Pigeon Feathers flap invisibly from my hands and into those of a Pennsylvania native, whose land, childhood and eventual disillusionment are so heart-wrenchingly documented in this collection. &quot;A&amp;P,&quot; a staple of contemporary American fiction anthologies, is a companion pieceto longer, stronger stories, like &quot;Flight&quot; and the final two episodic stories, showcasing the defining moments of adolescence and young adulthood; moments when the voice inside assuring us of our own greatness and immortality grows fainter and fainter.Philosophically, this collection is held together by the idea that beauty, love and fame are tenuous phenomena, no more substantial thanshapes of light skating across a room, or the images of a film projector (see &quot;Flight&quot;). This motif is always at the forefront of Updike's poetry and diction. (&quot;The Persistance of Desire,&quot; which plays upon the indispensible role of eyesight, literal and figurative, ingenuously spins a pun out of the optical effect of the persistance of vision for its title.)This philosophy rarely overshadows Updike's gift for an unorthodox, reflective style of narration. Conflicts figure prominently in every story, but almost always the battle is staged in the heart and mind of its protagonist. Updike is a Cicero and Keats blessed with a unique penchant for American storytelling."},{"Title":"Pigeon Feathers & Other Stories","review":"I'm a budding short story writer, myself; and no course, no workshop, no amount of instruction can subsitute for the lessons one learns leafing through and ingesting these exquisite paragraphs of John Updike. I find myself, in this volume, more than other Updike works, reading and re-reading the prose, even emailing sections to friends. Like a fine restaurant I want to tell people about, like a band that plays exceptionally well live which you get to catch on a great night, Updike, here, is \\"on\\"; he is at the absolute peak of his craft. I only wish there were more collections of short stories written as well as these."},{"Title":"Pigeon Feathers & Other Stories","review":"There is little, if anything, one is able to say that can possibly capture the beauty or majesty of a great Updike story. The gentle yet exact measure of his sentences, the bewilderingly complex yet infinitely fluid (and eventually near-epiphanic) weaving of narratives, his control of internal characterization--few are masters in the manner that John Updike is a master.And this volume contains his greatest story--possibly what I feel to be the greatest piece of literature in all of latter-half 20th century American literature (and we're including it all here, not just short stories). The last story of the volume: Packed Dirt, Churchgoing, A Dying Car, A Traded Car.Enough with the theoretics and generalities here. This story can change your life. Or, at the very least, it can alter the way in which you interact with literature--what you can expect out of literature.One piece of advice, though: read it in one sitting.Seriously.Don't get up, even just for a little while to fix something to eat. Don't read it bit by bit (it's long, so you may be tempted). And, whatever you do, don't look at the last page before it's time.It may seem disjointed. It may seem an odd accumulation of narratives. Don't stop reading.Two years, and a hundred readings later, I still haven't gotten over that first experience. What I wouldn't give to have it again..."},{"Title":"Pigeon Feathers & Other Stories","review":"This book is my introduction to John Updike, and I confess I haven't finished reading it. So I will try not to make comments that are likely to seem false to me later.He writes with such compassion that it makes you want to reach out to the characters. Since you can't do that, it makes you reach out to your friends, and people in general. It helps you see past the antagonizing surface of mankind, and into their lovable weaknesses. He also abandons many conventions of the typical narrative, and to me, it just helps to point out the stories aren't as important as life."},{"Title":"Pigeon Feathers & Other Stories","review":"This is an incredible book, which features many of Updike's earlier stories. The title story is amazing in its meaning and moral complexity. FIVE STARS!!!"},{"Title":"Pigeon Feathers & Other Stories","review":"Updike's abilities as a short story writer are best exemplified in _Pigeon Feathers_. His narratives often focus on the philosophies of the protestant middle class, in which the protagonist struggles to either accept or escape from the shackles of religion and society. Updike's narrative voice is so strong in these stories that the reader has the feeling that each one is in a sense autobiographical.There is a lot of variety in these short stories. Seven of these stories take place in the fictional Pennsylvanian suburb of Olinger, in which Updike pays homage to his adolescence. While each story in this collection is unique and special in its own right, there are some that I found to be particularly strong:\\"A&P;\\": This is one of the shortest and straightforward stories in the collection, but was my favorite. Sammy is a 19-year-old cashier working at the A&P; when he becomes infatuated with three girls who come into the store wearing bathing suits. When the manager scolds the girls for being indecent, Sammy is brought to a moral crossroad of conformance or to reject the values that A&P; represents.In \\"A&P;,\\" the manager is the voice of parental authority (friend of Sammy's family), pastoral authority (Sunday school teacher) and a business leader. Sammy represents the middle class conformist, who works behind the third register eating HiHo crackers. The girls represent the unattainable, with their sexual promiscuity and Kingfish Fancy Herring Snacks. Great symbolism and struggle is packed into this condensed narrative that is truly rewarding.\\"Flight\\": Allen Dow's mother predicts that her son will fly -- escape the destructive hold of ordinary life that has plagued their family. When Allen develops a relationship with the Olinger girl Molly Bingaman, this prediction is compromised and the relationship between Allen and his mother soon changes. \\"Flight\\" is about relationships and the conflict of deciding between young love and the yearning to escape.\\"Pigeon Feathers\\": The title story reflects on David Kern, who is approaching his fifteenth birthday and ponders on death and theology. He is in search of reassurance in God's existence and eternal life, but is continually misdirected, and is even discouraged by his minister when he inquires in Sunday School. Later in the story, David is asked shoot the pigeons in the barn so they will not harm the Olinger furniture that is stored in there. Through this experience, David comes to terms with God, creation and death.\\"Packed Dirt, Churchgoing, A Dying Cat, A Traded Car\\": This story seems to be a favorite by many readers. For me, the structure was a bit loose; however, the story and prose still show why Updike is one of the more talented writers in recent history. \\"Packed Dirt. . .\\" continues from \\"Pigeon Feathers\\" with David Kern as an adult. His struggles with faith are looked at from a different perspective as an adult in four episodes. He receives news that his father is ill and returns to his home. The traded car that David will soon exchange becomes representative for his writing and life itself, which is \\"dismissed without a blessing, a kiss, a testament, or any ceremony of farewell.\\" This story is fittingly placed at the end of the collection and strongly represents Updike's views.For any fan of John Updike or for someone interested in getting a taste of his writing, this collection is strongly recommended. I do not place these stories as highly as I place the Rabbit Angstrom tetralogy, but from what I have read of Updike, they stand the closest."},{"Title":"Pigeon Feathers & Other Stories","review":"Updike is a poet,and poetry rings with fresh clarity in his short stories.Some are about lost youth or realization of one's self.About the acceptance of misfortune,but all told beautifully.The best would have to be A&amp;P,the story of a teenager who works in a grocery store,and decides to risk his job for the girls that walk in,they get told to leave by the manager,but he tells the manger he's going to quit because of the way he treats the girls,so he leaves,while the girls don't even notice.Updike,the calculater of our innocence in the face of emotions.E - I = U and pigeon feathers.........."},{"Title":"Pigeon Feathers & Other Stories","review":"The reason the book was good, is that it allowed me to step outside myself to see myself.

I really liked this story and I would recommed it to anyone who is open to new ideas"},{"Title":"Carl Sandburg's Abraham Lincoln the War Years 1861-1864 (Carl Sandburg's Abraham Lincoln)","review":"\\"Abraham Lincoln: The War Years\\" is the second volume of Carl Sandberg's epic biography of Lincoln. It picks up with the trip to Washington and goes to the end of 1863. Author Carl Sandberg does an excellent job of weaving Lincoln's story into that of his times. As the reader progresses through this book, he is taken to the White House, the battlefield, the home front and foreign countries. At times the narrative diverts into a study of military and political figures and scenes which affect, but do not directly involve, Lincoln himself. The transition is often so smooth that the reader barely notices that he has moved from Lincoln, to others and back again.This volume tells the story of the land Lincoln left and the people he met along the way. The pressure exerted on Lincoln from all sides is fascinating. We read of abolitionists, pro-slavery Unionists, job seekers and many others who all demanded the time and attention of the president. The access to Lincoln is unbelievable. The idea that almost anyone could walk into his office and ask for an appointment, a commission or a discharge for a family member or just to chat boggles the mind.Many of the events of Lincoln's presidency are covered in this volume. We read about the battles of Fort Sumter, Bull Run, Fort Donelson, Shiloh, Vicksburg, Gettysburg and others, both from the perspectives of the battles themselves and the reception their news had in Washington and the effect they had on the political pressures brought to bear on Lincoln. We follow the succession of generals, including McClellan, Burnside, Meade, Sherman and Grant. The steps leading to the Emancipation Proclamation show it to have been a much more complicated process than many of its admirers or detractors appreciate.Sandburg's writing style emphasizes anecdotes and stories. In this volume he does a better job at weaving them into a compelling story line than he did in the first volume. This may be explained by the greater availability of information pertaining to the time period covered. I read this book in order to get a better understanding of Lincoln. I am satisfied and look forward to the next volume."},{"Title":"Carl Sandburg's Abraham Lincoln the War Years 1861-1864 (Carl Sandburg's Abraham Lincoln)","review":"Very good history of Lincoln's war years. Some of more recent books are more interesting reading."},{"Title":"Carl Sandburg's Abraham Lincoln the War Years 1861-1864 (Carl Sandburg's Abraham Lincoln)","review":"I'm focusing my comments on the complete Sandburg biography (\\"The Prarie Years\\" and \\"The War Years\\" Volumes)For a man who is widely reguarded as our greatest President, the single most influential Chief Executive -- arguably even more influential than George Washington -- in our history, there is a shocking lack of a detailed, painstakingly researched, well-written biography of the man. Sandburg's volumes stand alone in this reguard. There any number of one volume revisionist rants, or study's on narrow Lincolnalia, such as his humor, his mental health, his evolution as the commander-in-chief, or quick, pollyannish hagiographies. What's shocklingly lacking is a deeply, thoroughly researched, well-written, modern multi-volume biography of this truly incredible, complex man who ended up shaping the future couse of this country more profoundly than even Washington. Until (If) that voluminous biography comes along, Sandburg's work is the best we have, and it's very good indeed. It is amazingly thorough, and tries not to become mere hagiography -- no mean feat for a poet so clearly enamoured of his subject -- at which he largely succeeds. His writing style is slightly dated for our era, yet it remains highly readable. He offers much rich detail, tackling many of the political battles Lincoln had to fight with clarity and drama.His earlier Prarie Years volumes are approaching 100 years old. A lot of Lincolnian research has gone on since then, offering a gold mine of new information for a modern day, would-be Lincoln biographer to tap into. Until that happens, Sandburg's Volumes remains the sine qua non. It is well worth tackling the whole series if for no other reasons than to get a solid idea of who Lincoln was and how he got to be the near mythical figure he is, written by a skilled writer. I can't help but think that an updated voluminous biography in the hands of Stephan Ambrose, David McCullough, or (more realistically given that Ambrose is dead, McCullough too old to tackle such a project) Stephen Sears or James McPherson would be absoltely riveting."},{"Title":"Mastering Oracle SQL, 2nd Edition","review":"[A REVIEW OF THE SECOND EDITION]Those of you dealing with the latest Oracle 10g, and perhaps frustrated with the quality of the Oracle documentation, might want to consult this second edition. Its greatest difference compared to the first edition is simply that it deals with 10g, whereas the latter talks about 9g. Mishra and Beaulieu explain, with extensive detail and examples, the new features. Like support for unix-like regular expressions within SQL statements. Given that many Oracle users probably hail from a unix/C background, they will welcome this.Also, for mapping between XML and SQL data types, 10g now integrates XML. This will reduce the impedance mismatch between the object oriented and relational outlooks that bedevil many programmers who have to deal with both.The only problem I found with this book is its lack of mention of competing databases. Because the authors explicitly assume that you have already committed to using Oracle as your database. Fair enough. But perhaps occasional comments in the text, about how a given command or feature is not possible in another database would be useful and appreciated by Oracle users. Heck, to be fair, on this point, the book is at no relative disadvantage. For example, I have texts on dB2 and MySQL that likewise say zilch about their competitors."},{"Title":"Mastering Oracle SQL, 2nd Edition","review":"I will agree with other reviewers that cite this book as an excellent resource. It is well organized and easy to follow from topic to topic without getting lost. The examples are well introduced and written with few minor errors. These will be easy to spot for someone who has used any flavor of SQL.Some issues that I did have with the book revolve around what it isn't. Most of the book revolves around features that are new to 10g rather than a solid overview of the Oracle DML. This means that readers will not be properly introduced to string manipulation outside of the regular expression implementation which is new to 10g (Legacy DBs?). Also, you will have to look elsewhere for good information on CAST, CONVERT and case changing functions. These can be crucial as Oracle is much more strongly typed with regards to data than MS SQL Server.As DBAs or reporting analysts aren't always privy to the latest release, I see the concentration on 10g's new features as a flaw. Over all this book will introduce you to Oracle SQL in an easy to follow manner. Experienced SQL users will be able to become functional by using this book but, will scratch their heads when they encounter the DML language gaps."},{"Title":"Mastering Oracle SQL, 2nd Edition","review":"There are a lot of SQL books out there and this one is by no means the \\"fattest\\" but if your goal is querying or anything to do with business intelligence, this one is the best. It covers basic queries to advanced queries such as subqueries, CASE statement, and the newer analytic functions. The examples are great."},{"Title":"Mastering Oracle SQL, 2nd Edition","review":"Half of this 450 page book surveys basic SQL, and the other half is on features Oracle added to SQL in versions 9i and especially 10g. I bought the book because I believed the title, and the reviews here that said it was an excellent reference. But, to quote one of its authors, \\"This book is NOT a reference manual, and it is NOT an administrator's guide\\". It's an overview of SQL only. It is not an introduction; nor can it be used, reference book-fashion, all by itself.So for my purposes, I was quite disappointed. But the book has some utility, in its explanations of what can be done with Oracle SQL. Especially in the explanations of analytic functions, regular expressions, and XML. It's like a series of magazine articles, with discussion and examples.The book has some weaknesses:* The index is very skimpy and incomplete. This is what you'd expect actually, in a book that isn't ever meant to be referred back to.* The focus on SQL is diluted and inconsistent. For example, there is an explanation on how to set up partitioning. Another section compares Oracle's implementation of regular expressions to Perl's . Sometimes background and comparisons are present, sometimes they're not.* There isn't much explanation of *why* you'd want to do some of the *whats* that can be done. Yes, it's possible to build classes and objects into a database, but why do it in SQL instead of Java? (Of course the *hows* would be quite inadequate, if this were a how-to book).* There is too much explanation of how things used to be done in 8i. That version was five years old back when this edition was published. 8i shouldn't take up more than a paragraph or three in a book that purports to cover 9i and 10g.In summary, if you don't read trade magazines, and you don't care to spend your time on Oracle websites and forums, and you know you won't have access to 11g anytime soon, you may find this book a decent (altho somewhat pricey) way to broaden your horizons of what you can do with Oracle SQL."},{"Title":"Mastering Oracle SQL, 2nd Edition","review":"Jan, 2006: I'm no SDE, but I had a need to learn enough SQL to enable me to hit my company's Data Warehouse tables directly and employ some complex joins. This was the book recommended to me, and it did the trick. I sat down and began reading it and was quickly writing increasingly complex queries. I found the explanations easy to follow, and the format intuitive. The only fault I found is that there is a lack of more complex join examples, as when there are more than one field being joined on or more than two tables being joined.UPDATE, May 2012: It's been over 6 years now since I first started reading Mastering Oracle SQL, 2nd Edition to learn SQL. Since then, writing SQL to extract data sets out of our Oracle databases has become my primary role, and more recently I've begun managing some table spaces via DDL. A few years back I began training coworkers how to write Oracle SQL to perform extracts using this as the textbook. I've since written my own 100+ page training manual that ties in specifics of our system, uses examples in our data warehouse, and has homework assignments to practice what they learn - but I still recommend my students read at least chapters 1-6 and chapter 9 of this book. Based on my own experience using this book as the sole resource to learn SQL, those 7 chapters provide 80% of the knowledge needed to extract data out of an Oracle database to answer business questions. The rest of the book has proven somewhat useful for my load and transform needs, too (creating & managing tables).In case the authors are listening and thinking of doing a 3rd edition, I would make one main suggestion: Focus only on extracting data from Oracle databases, leaving the data manipulation functions (INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE/MERGE) for another book, or shift all manipulation topics to the later chapters. My students who are trying to learn to extract data get a little confused when, in chapter 1, these table manipulation functions are covered. Starting with SELECT, FROM & ORDER BY, moving to WHERE clauses and operators, then to dates, joins, etc. would make the early chapters more streamlined for someone new to SQL. I also found that there are some gems in much later chapters (like Advanced Grouping in Chapter 13) that seems more elementary than topics in earlier chapters (Partitioning, PL/SQL & Objects and Collections).Other reviewers have balked at the claim that this is a beginning SQL book, but I beg to differ. It starts with the absolute basics, and builds on that chapter by chapter. It doesn't assume you know anything, in my opinion, about databases or SQL. I believe the audience of the book stated on xi of the Preface is accurate, as I fell into the 'anyone who needs to access data stored in an Oracle database for reporting or ad-hoc analysis' bucket, and this book helped me succeed. I was a guy with a degree in Zoology and previous database experience limited to using MS Access, and this book (+ several years experience/practice) has turned me into an expert. Focusing only on the extract side of SQL, here are the key chapters (IMO) and what they teach:Chapter 1 gives a brief history of SQL and brief explanation of a database. Then it introduces the SELECT and FROM clauses, used to define the table(s) from which the data needs to be extracted, and the elements to extract. It also covers ordering of results using ORDER BY.Chapter 2 introduces the WHERE clause to enable filtering of results, and various operators (=, IN, BETWEEN) to create filtering conditions. It also briefly introduces multi-condition logic - aka how the query acts when you have multiple conditions in the WHERE clause.Chapter 3 covers how to join tables together in various ways (which I've found are the most difficult topic for new learners).Chapter 4 teaches methods of aggregating results via DISTINCT and GROUP BY, and also introduces the HAVING clause - used to filter results after aggregation.Chapter 5 shows how to nest one query within another, such that the innermost query executes first, then it's result set is treated like table in the outer query.Chapter 6 deals with dates and time, including various methods to transform text strings to dates and vice versa.Chapter 9 covers the DECODE, NULLIF, NVL, NVL2, and CASE functions - the If/Then functions of Oracle SQLI find the topics covered in these chapters meet nearly all my extract needs.For those who are looking for a companion to this book or are specifically looking for a reference to keep handy on Oracle SQL functions and syntax, I would recommendOracle SQL: the Essential Reference. I find it has a more robust Index and is better for quickly finding info on a function, whereas Mastering is more verbose because it's providing instruction."},{"Title":"Mastering Oracle SQL, 2nd Edition","review":"The goal of the authors is to explain how to write good readable SQL queries in Oracle 10g. The book starts with how to construct SELECT statements to group, filter and format result sets for dates, reports and data analysis. Then it proceeds to cover Oracle-specific queries and functions for hierarchies (data in tree structures), object-oriented types, XML documents, regular expressions and models (spreadsheet-like objects). Where relevant, there are notes about the differences between SQL for Oracle 10, Oracle 9 and the ANSI standard.As expected from the title, the chapters using declarative programming (i.e. SQL queries) for relational data, hierarchical data and reports are the most comprehensive. Chapters on interfacing Oracle SQL with other technologies such as scripting (Oracle's PL/SQL), object-oriented types, XML and regular expressions, or on optimization, are brief but sufficient to get you started, especially if you have a existing background in those technologies.This is the 2nd edition, so it's not surprising that the scope of the book is well-defined and that the writing is easy to read and polished. The example data and queries are just complex enough to demonstrate the issues without obscuring the main points. Minor annoyance about Chapter 15, \\"SQL Best Practices\\", which does not explain how to use the query analyzer and bind variables.I was already familiar with basic Oracle SQL but didn't really understand the language; this book blew away many of the fuzzy concepts in my mind and provided me the framework to tackle more complex problems.Kam-Hung Soh, 21 May 2007.[...]"},{"Title":"Mastering Oracle SQL, 2nd Edition","review":"I found this book especially helpful because it was written so a beginning DBA can turn to a page and immediately make sense of what's written.

This can make it hard for a beginner but if you've used Oracle for a while it's a great book.

I state this so you know that I am totally impartial.This is a great book for anyone interested in Archery, especially Traditional Archery. Even the armchair adventurer will find some wonderful gems in this very well written book. (I read a lot, and know good writing). It contains not only what you would expect from the title, but so much more. Over 500 pages of 20th (21st) century Archery history are featured in the 31 chapters featuring 30 prominent bowyers. A chapter may start with a bowhunting story or painting a portrait of the picturesque settings where a bowyer performs his magic, or any number of ways that pull a reader into a good yarn without the obvious formulaic monotony. Each chapter is as if you bumped into a friend and he said...\\" I met this guy named Fred Bear (et al) whose been making archery bows over in Grayling. Let me tell you a bit about him.Do you know what prompted Ken Beck to buy Black Widow from the renowned Wilson Bros.,after several other entreprenuerial endeavors foundered? It's a sad story but I'm glad I know it. I feel far more connected to him as a member of the macrocosmic community of hunting first, and the microcosmic (but growing) community of Tradition Bowhunters and target archers.Tim Meigs whose wife Fern was on the cover of Trad Bowhunter Magazine when she passed, has a wonderful hunting story called \\"The Skinny Dip Buck\\". Tim arrows a nice buck drinking at the pond, the deer falls into the pond and starts swimming, he runs down the hill to get a kill shot and slips on a cow pie. He gets his kill shot and the deer starts sinking. He has to strip down and wade out to recover his buck. His friends show up and wonder why he's standing naked next to his well earned prize. This was a story I have retold so many times, that it was worth the price of the book. Love Tim's bows too. I met him after reading this chapter when Business took me to Carson City. When I asked my customer where Kit Kat Rd. was, her jaw dropped as Tim's is the only business on this short street that is not a brothel. Another great story.Fifteen years (as of 2004) after the publication it could use some updating and include some of the new bowyers but it's still worth every penny. I reach for it when I see a used bow of interest or I want to just relax with a re reading of a chapter or two."},{"Title":"No Highway","review":"This is one book that is fun to read if you've seen the James Stewart movie about a scientist who believes a new type of airplane has a basic defect and will crash after so many hours in the air.Visualizing the well-cast actors as you read makes the book more interesting.

Maybe it helped that I too am an expat Pom living in Oz?I knew nothing about the man so did some research on his background. I'd assumed, (incorrectly) that he was Australian born & bred and was surprised to find his rather privileged English background (private school & Oxford) and that he only moved to Oz 10 years before his death.An aircraft engineer, I knew, as my father was too and had always spoken highly of him as a writer. I should have known better!I find Mr Shute's prose style that of an engineer writing a novel. His style is completely lacking. He is stilted, repetitive, long winded (where was the editor?) and lacking imagination. (If I have to read the title of Scott's lecture once more - in full - I shall throw that book across the room!)Quite simply, he is no writer.Even overlooking his dated attitudes to women ('girls' should be housewives - how dare they even think of having a career!), race (snide reference to the Jewish movie producer.....good heavens, this was a year or two after the death camps!), the 'lower orders' who are unreliable and dishonest - yes he was an insufferable snob! (see other of his novels re the post WW2 Labour govt).I am only 2/3rds of the way through this novel and I feel the need to comment. It's not often I do that!I'd like to read other of his novels (On the Beach being top of my list) but if this novel is anything to go by, I don't think I'll last the distance.I can only assume that he made his name as a novelist due to the unique subject matter.He might tell an interesting story but, personally, I think that he doesn't do it very well."},{"Title":"No Highway","review":"A Raindeer airplane crashes in Labrador after a little less than 1440 flying hours. In the official report the accident is ascribed to pilot error but Denis Scott at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough is not convinced that this explanation is true. Neither does Theodore Honey, a slightly eccentric member of Scott's staff, who has an as yet unproved theory that the tail plane of the Raindeer is bound to succumb to metal fatigue after 1440 hours in the air. What if Honey's experiments prove him to be right?"},{"Title":"No Highway","review":"All i need is to read someone elses review on No Highway."},{"Title":"No Highway","review":"...after all, this is an age of cynicism. It's the story of nerdy scientist Theodore Honey (the British term of that time was &quot;boffin&quot;--it specifically targeted scentists) who discovers a potentially deadly flaw in a new airliner. The problem is that nobody but his boss Dr. Scott (from whose viewpoint this story is told) has any faith in his theory. After all, oddballs don't have very high credibility factors. So Scott sends Honey over to Canada to investigate a recent crash of one of those planes, only to have it turn out that the plane he takes is also one of that model. Which makes for a particularly gripping scene--it's the centerpiece of the James Stewart movie based on this book. Other important characters here are Honey's motherless daughter, an actress he's a fan of who's also on the flight--he reminds her of an old friend she knew before she became famous, the plane's captain who is increasingly unsure that Honey is a crackpot, plus a stewardess who not only shares her captain's point of view--but finds Honey strangely compelling in an even more important way. Nowadays you don't often find this human a story in so short a book. Shute's best known book is &quot;On The Beach&quot;."},{"Title":"No Highway","review":"When Dr. Theodore Honey, a boffin of an aviation scientist, predicts that the wings on a new type of aircraft will begin falling off, he is sent across to Canada to investigate a previous crash. Bad choice--he is so unimpressive that when he learns that the aircraft he is on has already exceeded his estimated time to failure, he can only stop the flight by wrecking it when it stops to refuel at Gander. Almost everyone believes he's crazy except for a few--including the assistant director at his place of work, a stewardess, and a movie actress.Shute is at his best in his characterizations--such as Monica Teasdale the fading American movie actress, who falls in love with Honey as she once did with a man before she became famous. She soon realizes she can never have Honey and must step aside for the stewardess, who can give him children and maintain him in his work, as well as give him love. The details are amusing--the actress, from Indiana, uses the word \\"hoosier\\" to the mystification of the British charactersAs in most of Shute's books, there are no villians. The fact that many of the characters are working against each other does not make any of them evil, and when the truth is revealed, they quickly begin to work together.For the information of readers, the book made a fairly poor movie starring (I kid you not), Jimmy Stewart as Honey. But as so few of Shute's books were made into movies, it is worth watching for that reason."},{"Title":"No Highway","review":"This 1948 novel was one of the first adult books I read as a boy; remembering it fondly, I wanted to see how it stood up now. The brief answer: very well, although it shows its age. Such a book could never be published today, and in many ways that is a pity.Nevil Shute Norway was an aircraft engineer by profession, and most of his novels (of whichA TOWN LIKE ALICEis the best-known) touch to some degree on flying; in NO HIGHWAY, aircraft engineering is the entire background. The narrator, Dennis Scott, is head of a research department at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, England. One of his scientists, a rather unworldly widower named Theodore Honey, is convinced that Britain's latest transatlantic passenger aircraft, the Reindeer, is liable to catastrophic metal fatigue in the tail after so many hours' flying time, and convinces Scott that all Reindeers must be grounded before they approach that maximum. Unfortunately, two aircraft have already reached the danger point. One has recently crashed in a remote area of Labrador, and when Honey is sent out to investigate, he discovers he is traveling in the other one.Shute's strength is that he writes what he knows, straightforwardly and without frills. He assumes that the reader will be interested in the technology, and in the bureaucratic procedures that Scott must go through to convince the appropriate agencies of the danger. It is true that some of Honey's theories sound kooky, to put it mildly, and it is hard to believe that time-to-fracture is as predictable as he makes out. But in 1954, six years after the book was published, Britain's Comet fleet, the world's first commercial passenger jet aircraft, suffered a series of fatal accidents that were ultimately put down to metal fatigue; the episode essentially ended Britain's domination of the transatlantic market. That era was about to change anyhow; one of the pleasures of the book is to go back before the jumbo jet, when transatlantic aircraft has to refuel at places like Gander in Newfoundland, and carried only a few dozen passengers in easy luxury.NO HIGHWAY is also a heart-warming love story. This requires some suspension of contemporary cynicism, for Shute's character painting (especially his women, often referred to as \\"girls\\") now seems rather simplistic, in common with many of the popular writers of his generation. They don't write them like that any more -- with one notable exception: I suspect that the popularity of Alexander McCall Smith (author ofTHE SUNDAY PHILOSOPHY CLUB) is precisely because he too writes in the simple emotional terms of his boyhood reading. If you want Smith's warmth applied to more boyish subjects, you might do worse than look into Shute."},{"Title":"No Highway","review":"This is one of Neville Shute's best novels (I keep saying that) and a pretty good movie was made of it with Jimmy Stewart, Glynis Johns and Marlene Dietrich. The story is about a shy and rather homely aircraft engineer who was widowed in the war and lives with his eight year old daughter. He is reclusive and not very well liked by his bosses but he is brilliant. He has a theory about metal fatigue and is using a tail plane from the brand new British trans-Atlantic airliner as a test bed. It hasn't occurred to him that the test, if successful, will result in grounding the fleet of planes. Then, he learns that one of the airliners has crashed in Canada and he is asked to go to the crash site to see if the tail is intact. He is an \\"inside man\\" and doesn't want to go but he is \\"volunteered\\" by his boss. Flying across the Atlantic at night, he is horrified to learn that not only is this one of the \\"Reindeer\\" airliners but it has exceeded the safe number of flying hours according to his calculations. Upset, he confides his fears to a famous movie actress who is on the flight and who was a favorite of his late wife. The stewardess tries to discourage him from upsetting the passengers but both women begin to fear he knows what he is talking about. They make it to the fuel stop at Gander but, to prevent the plane taking off again, he pulls the lever on the undercarriage, causing the plane to settle down onto the taxiway. A furious row ensues and the story is an enjoyable scientific adventure story and a romance as both women become very attracted to this shy engineer. I read this book in the 1940s when it came out and, shortly after it was published, the British Comet jet airliners began to crash. The cause was metal fatigue. Shute was an experienced aeronautical engineer who had built up his own company before the war. He knew his subject. The book is excellent. This should be on every list of novels for engineers."},{"Title":"No Highway","review":"The humor and tension are grounded in both the characters and the situations in which they find themselves. It's a tidy novel with no great action scenes and no auctorial fireworks. Nevil Shute tells the tale simply and with a muted affection for everyone involved.Dennis Scott works in the post-war British government and is chief of testing programs designed to insure aircraft safety. I may get these organizations mixed up because I'm not familiar with any of them. New to the job, Scott surveys the ongoing programs and finds Theodore Honey, an queer, middle-aged engineer, experimenting with metal fatigue on the tailplane of an expensive new passenger airplane, the Reindeer. Curious about this froggy little troglodyte, Scott surveys the Reindeer tailplane now taking a pounding from hundreds of vibrators in Honey's isolated corner of the universe. The vibrators reproduce the stresses encountered in flight. Scott asks what Honey expects to find out. \\"I expect the tail to fall off after 1440 hours,\\" replies Honey. Scott gapes because Honey doesn't seem to care about a couple of things that less eccentric people might find important. One is that, if Honey's theory is right, all Reindeers now in service will have to be grounded and it will cause an uproar in a strapped England in which goods are still rationed because of the debt incurred by the war. The second is that, if Honey is right, hundreds of passengers and crew will die as, one by one, the tails fall off the airplanes and they fall out of the sky.What follows is a fascinating story of solving conundrums in aeronautical engineering, of family dynamics, of character traits, and of romance.The story is plot driven and moves logically through time and space, never hard to follow, never difficult to read, but it's also sprinkled with ludic tidbits that are sometimes hilarious in an understated way. Honey is clearly an intelligent mathematician and engineer. The guy has a vision. But he's also otherwordly, a fool who doesn't own an ordinary mop or know anything about electric water heaters. The little home he shares with his twelve-year-old daughter is cluttered and filthy. He spends what spare time he has investigating certain obscure features of pyramids and the apocryphal peregrinations of Jesus Christ, including a kind of vacation the savior took at the site of King Arthur's Camelot. Scott backs Honey and his theory up, against the dismissive attacks of establishment figures.Some reviewers have called the novel \\"dated,\\" and I suppose it is. The most advanced aircraft are propeller driven. Women yearn for stability and homes. But so what? \\"Ulysses\\" is dated too. Nobody rides around in horse-drawn coaches anymore. And, man, is \\"The Iliad\\" dated or what?Personally I found Shute's description of the typical nuclear family rather appealing. Take the stewardess, Marjorie Corder, that Theodore Honey finds himself thrown together with by circumstance. She's twenty-five, she's been a nurse and a stewardess. She's been all over the place and seen much of what she wants to see. And she falls for Honey and wants to spend her life taking care of him, his daughter, and their home. Granted that it all looks a bit retro today, but if women should feel free to pursue careers, why shouldn't they feel free to NOT pursue a career?Nietzsche argued that two people living together had a \\"nest\\", while a person alone \\"had, at best, a cave.\\" There's nothing I'd have enjoyed more than coming home after a hard day in the jungle and having a wife give me a massage, bring me my slippers, mix me a drink, light my pipe, and see to it that my wounds were properly treated and bandaged. Of course, there are advantages to living alone too. You can talk to yourself, you can curse rapturously at will, walk about in your underwear, prop your feet on the table, stagger around drinking out of the bottle, smoke poisonous cigars, watch ESPN day and night, burp without discretion, and so forth -- but I'd trade it all for an obedient, beautiful, wealthy, sinuous, undemanding, loving young wife.Where was I? Oh, yes. I've read the novel twice -- the first time about thirty years ago, then again just recently. It was enjoyable both times. It doesn't carry much of a moral message. It's not \\"profound.\\" It's an entertaining and involving tale. Try it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"No Highway","review":"Arrived as expected.

Unfortunately this same type of aircraft is flying across the Atlantic. Lives are at stake and the pure research of Mr. Honey becomes critical as does the character of Mr. Honey. He has a daughter and not one but two unlikely love love interests. The is a happy ending and all is well. but the charm of this kind of novel is you are drawn into the life of some likable people. I enjoyed the visit."},{"Title":"No Highway","review":"Nevil Shute writes a good, technically-sound tale of the perils of aircraft design in the immediate post-war era. His material is therefore dated -- yet because it is so obviously dated it has a charm that is difficult to fault.Memorable characters: you probably know people who are like the protagonists. Memorable plot. Written from the viewpoint of a semi-detached observer, though one with a keen stake in the outcome.The ending was a little disappointing, with a literal &quot;deus ex machina&quot; providing the solution to a really knotty problem -- perhaps it was feasible in the forties, but certainly wouldn't work today. But don't let this keep you from reading the book: it's a good tale that deserves dusting-off."},{"Title":"No Highway","review":"Oh, Nevil Shute. I do so adore your unabashed authorial self-insertion. I haven't read all Nevil Shute, or even the majority, but the ones I have read, I have strong opinions about.In this one, Shute is himself twice, both in the narrator (a young manager at an aeronautics company) and the main character, a weedy, pathetic, but brilliant \\"boffin\\".The novel opens with the young manager, Scott, talking about his job managing a bunch of brilliant but mildly eccentric scientists at a safety facility, a job much like the one Shute had before the WWII. One of his scientists, Theodore Honey, is drawn as extremely eccentric. He is widowed, with a pre-teen daughter, and is essentially uncivilized in a way that is acceptable only in older novels. He doesn't know how to cook or clean or buy clothes. He is interested in many crackpot theories, including pyramidology, and the return of Jesus to England. He is also quite brilliant at what he does, aeronautics-wise.Honey comes to Scott and tells him that the tail assembly of the brand new plane currently flying the Transatlantic flight is going to crystallize and shear off after a certain number of hours. He is running tests on a tail to be sure, but it will be months before they get confirmation. Scott is torn on whether to take this seriously on not. On the one hand, pyramidology. On the other hand, planes falling out of the sky for a reason that manifests quickly and without warning.Scott orders Honey to step up the testing and goes to see his own boss to quietly freak out about planes falling out of the sky. He finds out that one of these planes HAS fallen out of the sky -- the prototype, which had almost the correct number of hours for Honey's theory, crashed in a stupid way. It had been ruled pilot error, but the coincidence made Scott edgy.Scott and his boss decide that someone needs to go out to Newfoundland to investigate the wreckage. Scott would go, but he is going to present his big important professional paper, and so he decides to send Honey, who is not... personable, but is the expert on crystallized metal fatigue.As you can imagine, the plot is more complicated from there. I shan't give it all away, except to note that I find it completely and hilariously charming that Shute, who was 49 when it was published, depicted the nerdy, asocial little engineer as charming both an aging movie star and a bright and beautiful flight stewardess.Thematically, I can tell that this book was written in the era when Shute still had faith in the British system. It was not long after this that he emigrated to Australia because he found the country no longer to his taste.This book is by no means as strong as A Town Like Alice or On The Beach, but it is not unworthy to be on the shelf with them. Shute's charming older men: the narrators in Alice and Pied Piper, the Trustee from the Toolroom, are all extremely homey and sympathetic. I always like to think of them as Shute himself, spinning stories. I haven't read much from his early works, but I may go seek them out. Evidently some of them are about daring young pilots, which Shute also was.I enjoy reading period books that do not think of themselves as period books. It is not notable that Honey has trouble working his ration coupons and has three years of his jam sugar allotment saved. Of course air stewardesses are unmarried and of course young wives don't work. When I read stories that are ABOUT a period, these things always feel highlighted, but when I read books IN a period, they are just part of how life goes.Read if: You want to read about failure and risk analysis. Stories about nerdy little men who have women contending for them are amusing to you. The installation of domestic hot water heaters is something you had never thought about. You can tolerate some strange woo-woo in your mostly-science.Skip if: You want a lot of action, intrigue, or plausible romance. You have problems with outdated science. You are unwilling to read about the typical breakfasts served to transatlantic passengers of the era*.* I did enjoy reading about the time in Gander. I mostly know it as the place a lot of transatlantic flights ended up at after 9/11, but of course, it's been an airport for a very long time."},{"Title":"No Highway","review":"I enjoyed re-reading this story but I was very disappointed at the quality of the Kindle edition.

At times you were on the verge of giving up but you didn't because you had the sense of constantly getting closer to achieving your goal. You were not bored while learning. Come to think about it, you actually enjoyed learning, even though you had to work hard to get the results. Today, it is accepted as scientific fact that learning is not in contrast to having fun.

It is certainly not the most thorough or detailed analysis of Douglass' life, especially when one considers that Douglass wrote more in-depth accounts of his own life than any future scholar would. However, it is quite useful in that it aptly catalogues the political shifts which Douglass underwent in his life and the impact of his ideas on American and European society.Jin-Ping's text narrates Douglass' shift from radical, anti-constitutional abolitionist to Lincoln supporter adeptly. Douglass' activism was particularly important in that he was the most prominent anti-slavery orator who actually experienced slavery, and that he always walked a fine line between simple anti-slavery spokesman and revolutionary. If you are looking for an in-depth account of Douglass' life, read one of his autobiographies. However, if you are looking for a fascinating analysis of his politics and its impact, Jin-Ping's work will suit you well."},{"Title":"Richard M. Nixon: Our Thirty-Seventh President (Spirit of America: Our Presidents)","review":"When it comes down to who are the two most important American Presidents in the 20th century the only possible choices are Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard M. Nixon. At first glance it would seem the choice for the top spot would obviously go to FDR. After all, he had to deal with both the Great Depression and World War II. But in terms of the events of my lifetime it is equally clear that Nixon had the greater impact, changing American politics because of the Watergate scandal and eventually redrawing the map of the world because of his foreign policy of detente. Young readers might not really appreciate the idea that &quot;Only Nixon could go to China,&quot; but they will get a sense that despite the flaws in his character, Richard Nixon's presidency had a big impact on the country and world in which they live.Ann Graham Gaines begins this juvenile biography of Nixon for the Our Presidents series with the fact that this was the first president of the United States to resign from office, but that he is remembered as an important leader. Nixon's life is divided into four chapters: (1) Young Nixon covers his childhood, education, marriage to Pat Ryan, and his military service in World War II; (2) Early Political Career traces his rise from Congressman to Senator to Vice-President for Dwight Eisenhower; (3) President Nixon begins with his lose to John F. Kennedy in the 1960 election and ends with him being reelected to a second term in 1972; and (4) Nixon Resigns tells why all of his accomplishments were washed away by a political scandal. It is not surprising; therefore, that Gaines spends more time explaining Watergate and how the cover-up rather than the burglary that eventually forced the President to resign. Given what young readers may now about the Clinton impeachment, they will certainly find this an interesting story to read about.Given my own thoughts about Nixon this book certainly conforms to my expectations. Although it touches on the Vietnam War, the two things young readers will get from this volume is that Nixon established relations between the United States and both China and the Soviet Union, and that Watergate ended his presidency. The result is a competent introduction to Nixon's life, which is really too full to be handled in a volume this small, but Gaines hammers home the basics. The book also contains detailed sidebars on Pat Nixon, The Office of Vice President, and Nixon in China, while the margins are filled with Interesting Facts (e.g., Nixon visited every continent except Antarctica as Vice-President). Illustrations consist of both color and black &amp; white photographs detailing Nixon's personal and political life. Final Note: The policy in these books is to refer to the subject by their first name, which I understand, but it sure is strange to see Nixon referred to as &quot;Richard&quot; the entire book, and anybody in school during his years in the White House will understand exactly why that is the case."},{"Title":"Shrewbettina's Birthday","review":"My sister and I both fell in love with all of John Goodall's little books as children. This, as well as most of his others, feature beautiful Victorian illusrations (though not at all fussy) of animals getting into mischief and interesting situations. The best part of these is that every other page is cut in half, so when you flip it over it forms a new illustration (hard to describe, but the effect is wonderful). Also these books are wordless, so my three-year old as well as his eight-year old cousin both enjoy these. This book tends to be a bit more feminine, as is Naughty Nancy. For boys and girls both I highly recommend the Creepy Castle, or any of the Paddy books (all by this author)."},{"Title":"Shrewbettina's Birthday","review":"I had this book as a child and it was my absolute favorite.

So, it is not a book for learning about Sodom by modern archaeological standards, the writing is at times flowery and overdone to readers of the 21st century. These considerations do not dismiss the book out of hand.It is a wonderful book in describing explorations in Palestine before Albright; the father of archaeological Bible History exploded the area to the mass public with information. The writer does well convey the sense of adventure, danger, and thrill relevant to the time, place, and purpose of the exploration. For this purpose alone, I recommend this book, not as not as a realistic explanation of Sodom; but as the real life adventure of men, moving us forward in knowledge, facing, and overcoming the perils of such an adventure."},{"Title":"Army of Terror (Star Wars: Galaxy of Fear, Book 6)","review":"I loved this book because it talked more about Hoole than anyone else. All of the other books are mostly based on either Tash or Zak. During the whole series (I read book one first, and then all the way through book six), I had always wondered about Hoole, and his character, his past, ect. This is the book where I found the answers to my questions. This book is a true treasure that I'm glad I kept. When I bought this, I wasn't disappointed at all--and neither will you! If you don't like this book, it's probably because you're too old for it. There's no way that you can like all the other books in this series (Books 1-5; Eaten Alive, City of the Dead, ect.)and NOT like this one. This book is the best of all!"},{"Title":"Army of Terror (Star Wars: Galaxy of Fear, Book 6)","review":"i think this book is the best yet. i dont own it, but thanks to my local library i check it out every time. i have 5 younger siblings, and they always want me to tell them a bedtime story.finally i reread the story 10 times and memorized it. its a big help. i dont have to carry the flashlight into their rooms now.i reread all of the series and now i mimorized all of them. i them all a huge 5*. i am what people call a starwars nut. i like the part whenever the rebels come in. and like others i like it that this focuses most on hoole. basicly I LOVE THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Army of Terror (Star Wars: Galaxy of Fear, Book 6)","review":"This is truly an excellent Edition to the Galaxy of Fear series.

However, it does seem to border on the line of \\"making light\\" of a very complicated and debilitating desease. I'm sure it's important for those in a depressive state and/or those living with someone who is depressed to understand how the \\"depression got there\\". Whether it's a concern that they've done something to bring this on or the common characteristic most men share of \\"wanting to fix it\\". However, the depressed person while in the true abyss of their depression, is not interested in how or why, we just want to know what to do to return to the normal, if there is such a state, predepression person we once were. This is another book I'm having a hard time finishing. So far, the good information I've received from this book has overshadowed the parts that seem to lead me astray in my voyage of overcoming my depressive state. I expect to finish reading the book, possibly omitting parts I don't find particularly helpful at this time in my life, probably to read at another step in my recovery."},{"Title":"Depression For Dummies (For Dummies (Psychology & Self Help))","review":"Overall proably one of the worst books ive ever read in my entire life.

It would make a great movie."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I think my takeaway emotion from this book was kind of bemused annoyance. To me the plot devices that were issues to the characters never seemed like things that would be issues to me, so I spent most of the time thinking that they'd gotten themselves worked up for nothing. Usually authors make a point to illustrate how these things that are supposed to be irritated irritate the people they bother, but the book depends to much on you agreeing with its characters. It wants you to be like, 'I know, right??'People are 'sassy,' or in this context, 'unnecessarily irritated by everything but pleased with themselves about it.' Mostly it just featured people I could like well enough but just not care to much about. Some conflicts were interesting, but they were ultimately flimsy or resolved fine enough.But then at the end there's this weird doughnut-centric sex scene but then also her parents arrive and...well. For that scene I started out understanding it and by the end it seemed somewhat out of character, and the two leads were so smug where the whole book they'd hated each other so i felt people were entitled to be somewhat surprised they were having doughnut sex at the end.So yes I didn't dislike it and it was enjoyable enough to read but there wasn't really anything I latched onto or loved about it. That's the thing, having read it a few months ago what sticks out in my mind are a few random scenes and a few character details, but the main plot detail that kept them apart and hating each other the entire book has been lost from my mind. I don't know if I'll ever be inclined to read it again myself, but to the voracious romance novel reader I might recommend it."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Wow. This book is hilarious!Characters were believable. I felt as if they were people I knew.Storyline was intriguing.

I was concerned that I wouldn't like reading it on my kindle (since I've read it in paperback form in the past), but once I started reading, there were no problems. It's a romantic comedy with sharp wit. Really a great read. Especially if you're tired of reading glamorized harlequin novellas and want some fun. :)"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This is my first Crusie book and honestly I don't read a lot of what would be classified as Romantic Comedy so I was up for something new and interesting and this book certainly delivered.It was hysterical. The dialogue was witty and snappy and made me laugh out loud in more than a few places. The characters seemed realistic and I enjoyed the chemistry of the main couple.The plotline is fairly typical of romance, well-known cad makes a bet to bed a less-than perfect 10 heroine, but the twist in this one is that Min, the heroine, actually knows about the bet from the get-go and it's interesting to see how well she handles the situation.Despite being overweight and not as pretty as her sister or her friends, Min is smart, hardworking, and loveable because even though she's playing the typical man-hating b*tch, you can tell she's not really like that. Crusie never takes the anti-male sentiment too far.And Cal is written really well, too, considering technically he's a man-ho but we love him anyway because it's easy to see that he's not TRYING for that. He's just oblivious that he's hurting people, but not because he's self-absorbed. He's got some problems that he's slowly trying to work out. And some of them are doozies.The book starts off well and reels you in pretty fast with it's funny characters. It drags a bit in the middle if I'm being honest and the whole bet thing has a few chapters toward the end where it gets slightly out of control as a plot point.But I'm sold as a reader and I'll definitely be picking up some more of Crusie's books in the future."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"A great read! I love Crusie's characters and dialog but I agree with another reviewer that this book is even better: smoother, more believable dialog.I like how the main characters met - it felt very real - I even like that at first glance Calvin wouldn't have asked out Minerva. After the way they were 'tricked' into going out, they learned more about each other and became more interested. At the same time the characters become more interesting to the reader and their motivations are deeper and more real.The families of Minerva and Calvin are admittedly dysfunctional, this can be a tired and irritating formula, but I liked the way the characters dealt with them. They suported each other and didn't let their families run all over them.Great cast of supporting characters and lovable main characters with funny, bright dialog. One of the best reads of the year. I can't wait for the next new Crusie! I hope to see some of the supporting characters again."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I received this book as a Christmas present from my in-laws (of all people). I was a bit hesitant - do they really know what I like to read?! Surprise surprise! They got it right! \\"Bet Me\\" is one of the best books that I've read lately. The characters pull you in and you keep turning pages to see what kind of crazy situation they'll get themselves into next.After reading \\"Bet Me\\" I went to the library and checked out other Jennifer Crusie books. \\"Bet Me\\" got me hooked!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"For months I've had \\"Bet Me\\" sitting on the top of my TBR pile. A good friend just raved about Jennifer Crusie, and since I'd turned her into a Suzanne Brockmann fan, she felt justified in turning me toward Crusie's collective works. So when I finally got around to opening this book, it was with great expectation.I'm glad to say that I wasn't let down. \\"Bet Me\\" was such a treat to read. The humor was wonderful, and I was immediately taken with both the hero, Calvin Morrisey, and the heroine, Minerva Dobbs.Instantly the characters had a chemistry with each other despite the fact that they both tried to fight it through nearly the entire book. What was exceptionally clever is how Crusie brought attention to this connection by using a secondary character - a psychologist ex-girlfriend of Cal's - to list clues indicating if the couple was developing feelings, only to have those very clues show up in Cal and Minerva's interactions with each other.The only problems I had with this book were Minn's mother and Minn's obsession with her weight. Minn's mother was so extreme in her nastiness - in her complete fixation on her daughter's physical appearance and disapproval of same - that she almost came off as a cartoon character. I kept waiting for Minn to turn around and smack the woman, mother or not, especially given that Minn felt no compunction in speaking her mind to every other character. And while it was completely understandable why Minn herself was so obsessed with her weight, it really became annoying that it was such a significant obstacle between Cal and Minn. Cal never expressed anything but appreciation for Minn's figure, yet Minn could not let him forget that it was less than her definition of perfect.Still, it was refreshing to read about a woman who didn't conform to society's (and romance readers') expectation of physical perfection and an amazing, sexy desirable man who loved her all the same. The dialogue between these two was wonderfully real, fast paced and at times, wicked. Once they allowed their passion to run free, the scenes were downright steamy.I've already got a whole stack of Crusie's just begging to be read. I can only hope they are all as good as \\"Bet Me\\"."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"A girl can not have enough good shoes. This book has plenty.

He did great! I could have kicked myself for letting it sit that long in my house unread! I loved the way the main character was so human! Most of the romance books I have read, the women have been beautiful with model thin bodies (yeah, like that really exists in the real world AND she is still single!). I was truely laughing out loud at more than half of the book. After I finished this, I ran out and bought ALL of Crusie's books, and now waiting for her to release another. You will NOT be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"When Min agrees to go out on a date with Cal she knows the only reason he asked her out was because of a bet. A stupid $10 bet to see if he could get her to sleep with him. Well Min has never been one to back down from a challenge and decides that one turn deserves another so she decides that it might be fun to make Cal miserable for as long as he is wiling to endure it.Unfortunately, Min had it wrong, Cal actually turned down the bet and asked Min out on his own accord and cannot figure out why she is being so horrible to him. After the worst first date ever they both agree that they should never go out again. But the more they want to avoid one another the more they realize that maybe they shoud give this whole datinig thing a second chance.I heard that 'BET ME' was one of Crusie's first works but for some reason was only recently published and it definitely has the feel of her earlier romance books. Lately Crusie's books have been romance with a hint of mystery wheras 'BET ME' has no mystery whatsoever but is one of her most fun romances to date!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"My sister gave me this book.

It took me a few times to get into it. I guess I was not in the mood. But it was an enjoyable read. I loved ALL the main characters. I was kind of mad at first that the relationship between Cal and Min started on a bet, but the longer they knew each other it seemed like real love bloomed. Cal was a great catch, and I thought Min was a girl who deserved him.I was not real happy with the ending. I thought more could have been put into what happened to all of them instead of just a few lines. I grew to like all of them, and felt let down on their \\"futures\\". Out of all of Jennifer Crusie books, this was one of the better."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Jennifer Crusie always creates great characters and this book has them too. I didn't find the theme as exciting as some of her other books but it is a good read. Still has twists and turns to keep you reading."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I loved this book. I love that we have a whip-smart heroine, whose vulnerability hides behind a wall of snark. The chemistry build-up, the relationship build up between the two main characters were believable, although to be honest, their eventual coming-together was a bit anti-climactic.Still, everything preceding that was smart, comedy-filled, with enough insecurities and conflict thrown in that it made the sexual tension just that much juicier.The rest of the characters were also interesting, adding purpose to the story. None were superfluous, and everybody had enough back-story to make them fully come alive in my head. Even Bonnie, who annoyed me slightly, had a purpose and therefore still merited her place as Min's best friend.The only thing I can complain about, and why it's missing a fifth star, was the over-the-top ending, where all the cast of characters invade their private space. Everything else before that were still in the realm of realistic, but the ending was just way out there. If that had happened to me, I'd tell everyone to get lost until I was dressed. LOL."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"That describes me when I read this book. Long on reading, short on sleep. At the end of it all, I don't have a bad thing to say about it, except for the formatting glitches in the Nook version (missing paragraph breaks, that sort of thing).I loved the characters--flawed but realistic and adorable. I loved the prose--fast and catchy. I loved the way events spun completely out of control for these two \\"meant-to-be\\" lovers. Also, I loved the cat. And the layers--the way little things came together in the end to create the big picture that created these characters in their present day.I'm sure if I sat down and thought hard about it, I could find something to ding in this book--like maybe that things went on long enough to push events closer to \\"contrived\\" than they should have been, or that Cal's family (and Min's mom!) were just a little over the top. But it's been a very long time since a book kept me up that late, and I don't want to think about that stuff. I just want to grin at how fun it all was!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This is a fabulous book because it doesn't try to be anything other than what it is - funny and warm and life-affirming - and succeeds totally in all of that. Gorgeous heroine we can all relate to, yummy hero, laugh-out-loud moments. Occasionally for me Crusie gets a bit too zany and adds a few too many ingredients (e.g. murder) to her stories, but books like this one showcase her true talent."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Bet Me was a fun read! I couldn't wait to get back to this book. Cruisie knows how to make all of her characters stand out and demand a laugh or two."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"\\"Bet me\\" is hands down one of my favorite romance novels and Jennifer Crusie's best book. It's quick, witty, romantic and just a lovely read all around. The heroine, Min, is hilarious and her love interest, Cal, suits her perfectly. The banter between the two is laugh-out-loud funny at times and the chemistry seems real, which is a hard thing to pull off in a book. The secondary characters are all really fun and I love how the author managed to weave food and shoes into the story, making them almost characters on their own.I first read this several years ago but it is one of my go to books when I'm looking for a quick read that I know I'm going to enjoy."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"If I had to chose a book to be my best friend, I'd choose this one. I have read it many times. If something horrible is going on in my life, you can bet that it won't be long before I pick up my (rather worn) copy of this. If I have a few unexpected days off (like say, during the recent snow storm)...this is the comfort read I'll be sinking into.Jennifer Crusie's brand of humor is all her own. Every single character is infused with something that makes them feel so real - maybe that is why I love the book so much. The characters feel more and more real every single time I read the book. Kinda like Harry Potter - every time I pick it up I feel like I'm visiting family.Minerva Dobbs is probably the number one character I would choose to be friends with IRL. We have so much in common - she really does remind me of me in so many ways. Which is good, because I wouldn't say no to a Cal if I happened to run into one...maybe she'll bring me luck. I also love the way that she and her two best friends are complete opposites to the point that their personalities clash - that is how it is with me and my friends. We're all so different, if we weren't friends...we wouldn't be friends. haha. I know that doesn't make sense, but I bet you know what I mean.Even though a lot of the book is about Min and her \\"shortcomings\\" and her trying to come to terms with who she is versus what everyone else expects her to be...she is very confident. There is this great scene with Cal...they're in the park...and they start talking about Elvis only to discover that she is talking Presley and he is talking Costello. She says something like \\"Good thing this isn't a date, or we'd have a really awkward moment trying to come back from that one.\\" That scene always sticks with me as an example of being comfortable with yourself and just taking things as they come.It has been so long since I read this for the first time that I don't remember when, how or why I ended up with a copy...I just remember reading it three times in a row because I loved Min's story so much. So if you're a contemporary romance or chick-lit fan and you haven't read this...do so immediately!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Bet Me had me laughing out loud through out the book. Crusie has such a great sense of humor, she should be writing scripts. This could be a great romantic comedy. I am forever a Jennifer Crusie fan."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I am an enthusiastic fan of Jennifer Crusie and this book is the one that started it all for me. Late in 2003 I picked up an advanced reader's copy of Bet Me without any particular expectations. It was Christmas season, I had had a hard day at the bookstore and I was just looking for something light to read. I remember sitting down at about 9 o'clock, thinking I would read a chapter or so and then being completely unable to put the book down until I finished it. Over the years that have passed since then, I have read everything else Ms. Crusie has written (some of them, like Bet Me, more than once or twice). I can't say enough good things about her work.Bet Me is the story of Minerva Dobbs and Calvin Morrissey. Min is an actuary, a statistician by nature as well as by employment. Short and curvy, Min suffers from a common female affliction - she is convinced her body is unattractive. She's both kind and sensible, sharp and witty, and the only risky thing about her personality is her wild taste in shoes. Cal, on the other hand, is more of a gambler. He comes from wealth, owns his own company, and bets on any and everything. He's Greek-God handsome, incredibly charming and avoids commitment like the plague. Min and Cal have nothing whatsoever in common and good sense would tell you they don't belong together. Fate, however, has other plans.On the very night that Min's boyfriend David breaks up with her (okay, she didn't care that much about him, but he was supposed to be her date to her sister's wedding) she overhears him making a bet with Cal Morrissey. Specifically, a bet that Cal won't be able to get her into bed within a month. A few minutes later, Cal is crossing the crowded bar and asking Min out to dinner. Min is outraged. She knows she should tell him off, but the wedding is only three weeks away. What if she could string him along until then? She could take him to the wedding as her date and then dump him. It would serve him right to be played. The only problem is, Min isn't sure she can keep her hands off him for three weeks. What's a girl to do?Bet Me is a truly romantic story that doesn't rely on sap or sex. There's humor, honesty, mistakes and coincidences galore and Ms. Crusie's wonderful story-telling ability shines through. If I could only keep twenty books in my library, this would be one of them."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book was simply great. Story was funny, entertaining and full of romance and sexiness! I really liked all the characters in the book. Characters were flawed, but very likeable and relatable. Minerva is a regular girl, who is not perfect or thin as a model, she represents the average woman, secure in her career, but insecure about herself and her body image. Cal is your successful businessman, kind, yet flawed where relationships were concerned. Two characters that seem to be opposites. I like how these two characters grow and mature as the story moves on.Story moved fast, very funny and entertaining. The love scenes were steamy and very romantic. One of my favorite contemporary romances, story seemed plausible and characters could have been anyone. I loved that Cal could see who Min really was and viceversa. Beauty does not have to be defined a certain way, and it is in the eyes of the beholder. Very refreshing book!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"actually i didnt read it in english i read it turkish still it was really good i really feel like i'm in the book i love the characters and the love between mimi and cal and now i know its stupid but i've order the english version and gonna read it right away......highly recommended"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"A good, interesting read.

Can't go wrong with JC books."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Finally I've found a book with a chubby star who doesn't think her body is the most important and horrible thing of her life. Usually, when the main character of a book is a fat woman, story runs around the fact she hate her body, wants to change it, and nobody loves her untill she loses 20 pounds.In Bet Me, the main character is a strong and zaftig woman, Min, who has a good life. Yes, she's overweight, but this is only a problem for her because she has to fit in a bridesmaid's dress. She has the problems all women have with our looks, but she's still sexy, go clubbing and has good friend and even lovers. Yes, she dreams about lose a few pounds, but she likes to eat and hate her mother and is ex boyfriend, whom are always watching what she eats.The love affair between Min and Calvin is full of misunderstandings, and have a slow progress, like practicaly all the real romances. Calvin don't want to fall in love with Min, but it's inevitable for him. He HAS to love her because she's different, not for her body, but for her funny personality.This is a book with strong characters, a funny story, a good amound of strained momments, and a sexy love story. Perfect for a quiet weekend and for today's women without complexs. I loved it."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book turned me on!

This book keeps a smile on your face with every page. The basic storyline is about two 30+ people who come with baggage but with yelling, laughter and chaos a mature health relationship starts. I loved Min's mother character very real ~ she sometimes steals the show. Take a chance and buy this book - you will enjoy every morsel."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Bet Me is a fabulous book. Though it had a rough start, it really picked up towards the end. The main plot of the book is about Minerva Dobbs, a practical, sworn off of men, carb counter, who is being swooned by Cal. Cal is a serial dater that always wins his bets. When Cal recieves a bet to try to make Min fall in love with him, his world goes crazy. To make it worse, Min knows about the bet. First, they argue over everything and decide not to see each other, but fate has other plans. Where ever they go, they accidently bump into each other. They each finally realize that they love one another. Min tells Cal that she knows about the bet and he decides to throw it, but Min decides the prize is to great to risk. Ten thousand dollars and true love is too precious to let go."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Bet me was a lot of fun. This book is about a non-typical herorine, plus sized, a little insecure, but very vibrant. Min is a wonderful character and her cast of friends only add to the story. Min and her current boyfriend end up in splitsville when Min overhears him at a bar betting the gorgeous Calvin(Cal) that first he can't get her to leave with him and second that he can't get her into bed within the month.Min furious decides she'll let the bet go and run things her way. This is the beginning of a wild ride with two groups of friends in an all out girl vs. guys battle of the sexes.This was a wonderful romp and I look forward to more of Ms. Crusie's work!This is an excellent summer read or any other time, but right now it was just what I was looking for!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This was a very funny book. Move over Janet Evanovich whose books lately have gone downhill. JC's humor in this one is excellent. Repartee excellent. No so svelt Min meets gorgeous Cal and puts him in his place. His thoughts are sooo funny and the whole book is not mean spirited. Thought all the characters were very good especially the Mothers. Very entertaining and worth the read."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This is my 1st Crusie novel and I liked it... didn't absolutely love it the way I have some other \\"chick lit\\", though.I liked the sexual tension between Min & Cal that builds up throughout the book. It makes the physical act that much sweeter and more fulfilling for the reader when it happens. The food obsession and carb count that others have complained about parallels this point and is also today's reality. It's all about carbs these days and denying yourself guilty pleasures like bread and Krispy Kremes. When you finally allow yourself these luxuries, you appreciate them in a new and special way.The first chapter, although essential for understanding the bet, doesn't grab your attention. Once you get past that though, it begins to pick up and hooks you in. I also agree that there are some unlikeable and meddling peripheral characters, but they are necessary for the conflict in the story and sometimes add humor to the scenes. One *minor* thing that bothered me while reading this was how Crusie shortens the character's names: Min & Cal, in particular, but it also extended to include Cyn and others. As if these characters didn't have dreadful enough names to begin with.All in all, it is a fun, enjoyable read. Just don't take it all too seriously."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"When is the next Jennifer Crusie book coming out? She is one of my favorite authors and I was sorry to see Bet Me come to an end."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Sorry, but what happened to this author??? She used to be witty and interesting. Now she has gotten so lame. The contrived humor, the one-note characters, the gimmicky plot devices. I used to love her work but the last two books have been real stinkers! Also the stuff with Min's mother reminding her about her weight kept falling flat because these weren't remotely well-crafted or nuanced interactions. Instead, Crusie keeps beating us over the head with what we're supposed to find funny. I wish someone would tell this author to stop trying so maybe her books would feel natural again."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I don't read a lot of \\"chick lit\\" -- but I do love Jennifer Cruisie. Cruisie's wit shines through in her characterization, her dialogue, and her ability to laugh at situations she's doubtless been in, through her characters' eyes.All of that seems missing from \\"Bet Me\\", her latest. I'm told it's an older manuscript that got polished for publication -- but much of what I enjoy about Cruisie's work is missing. There are no really likeable characters here, especially in the parents of lead characters Min and Calvin. In terms of romance and sexual situations, which Crusie excels at - you can get warm reading what Calvin thinks about Min, but you really can't see much real passion from any of the other characters for their various partners. The characters I hated included Cynthie, David...and I was pretty impatient with Bonnie and her outlook on fairy tale lives (although her proposal to Calvin's friend was witty)...and Crusie went on and on about Min's weight, her self-consciousness, and her carb count. Truly, this book was an advertisement for Krispy Kreme donuts and chicken Marsala.Crusie can do much, much better, and I'm looking forward to her next work of original, and not reworked material.2 stars - I really wouldn't bother, if I were you."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"After I read Bet Me, I thought 'been there, done that. ' It seems like the author combined 'Fast Women' and 'Welcome to Temptation,' and threw in some new music (Elvis) and fairy tale stuff. There's the little kid and the baseball game, the three tight women friends, someone gets hit with something, the frozen mother and so on. And speaking of the frozen mother, it would be so nice to see this author portray a woman in her fifties as something other than an ice matron or manipulative or frozen or unfulfilled or incomplete or dead below the waist. When you think about some of her older female characters (Gwen, Liz, Nanette, Cal's mother, Maddie's mother) Crusie seems to perpetuate these stereotypes of the woman over fifty."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I found BET ME to be a big disappointment. Populated by cardboard characters, it lacks charm and wit. I hope she's getting paid by Krispy Kreme because it's mainly a glorified ad for them."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I enjoyed the interaction of the main characters and their friends in this story. Some of the plot wore me out, though."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"After looking over the other reviews, much to my surprise, I realize that the vast majority of reviews of this book thought it was great. I found it to be childish, ridiculous, and a predictable waste of time. I found the characters to all be caricatures of unlikeable personalities. I felt like I was watching a bad skit on Saturday Night Live as Jennifer Crusie tried to add what was supposed to be humor, but read like slapstick shlock (e.g. one character repeatedly whacked the male lead with her purse; there was one scene where all the characters unexpectedly showed up at the same time at the female lead's apartment). I'm sorry I didn't follow my first (and continuous) impulse to stop reading. The end didn't justify having to endure all the cliches, caricatures, and ridiculous scenes."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This was one of the most boring books I've ever read. The story line is/could be cute but the writing is horrible. Too many he said / she saids and details that don't help to develop the characters."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"If I had friends and family like Min, I would have told them where to go long ago. I found it hard to believe that a 33 yr. old female put up with so much from them.I usually love most of Crusie's books but this was not a favorite. I didn't like most of the characters and thought they were nuts."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I started the book thinking it would be a great escape from reality. Well, it was and it wasn't. It seemed as though the author was trying to write both Bridget Jones's Diary and Sex and the City...but she didn't quite pull off either. Don't get me wrong, it was a somewhat enjoyable fantasy book, however, I am not going to suggest it to any of my friends."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I've heard a lot about Jennifer Crusie and looked forward to this book because it was supposed to have a \\"voluptuous\\" heroine. The storyline sounded cute and so I waited and watched and finally bought it in hard back, which I very rarely do.I'm very disappointed because in complaining about her size (which Min did OFTEN), she indicated that a size 8 was a couple sizes too small for her. That, in my mind, makes her maybe at the most, a size 12. A size 12 is not a big woman, it's an average size woman.Next, I found myself almost repulsed at how often Cal FED Min, like it was some kind of fetish. Min complained how her mother told her to not eat and then Cal turned around and ordered her to eat (the buttered roll scene?). What's UP with that?I also disliked Cynthie and David and felt those characters were extremely one-dimensional. Sadly, the \\"gang\\" (Bonne, Roger, Liza, Tony) were all just as bad. Then there were the mothers! Can't even begin to comment on them! And let's discuss Diana... what was she so upset about all that time?! The resolution to that question was a waste of our time.I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this book. Unfortunately, I didn't and I won't bother reading any other Crusie books. :("},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"At first you think Bet Me is going to be one of those \`big misunderstanding' books, where Calvin Morrisey accepts a $10,000 bet from Minerva Dobbs' ex-boyfriend to get her into bed within a month. Yes, you read that right, $10,000. And of course you just know that he's going to get her into bed, she's going to learn about the bet, her heart will be broken, and all hell will break loose! Wrong! Well sure, it sort of starts out like that, but that's about it. There's nothing normal or predictable about this book. Drawn into the betting circle, so to speak, are Cal's two friends and business partners, Min's two girlfriends, her ex and Cal's ex, and - well, heaps of other family and friends. The joy of Crusie is watching sane people make a fool of themselves, all done with wry, self-deprecating humour, friendship bonds that are priceless, food (oooooh, yes, the food), animals, and a cheerful thumbing of the nose at all that is sacred in society. Like no-carb diets, for example. Min is a plus-sized heroine and Cal loves every lush inch so much he tries to feed her up. Her joy of all the naughty, forbidden foods is orgasmic for her and him! Gotta love this guy, even when he unashamedly sneaks peeks at her lacy underwear down her top. He develops a shoe fetish, previously unknown until Min walked into his life with her do-me, believe-it-or-not shoes and peek-a-boo toes, and an enormous appreciation for tying her up so she can't have her way with him too quickly. He has a bet to win/lose, and he'll do it in his own time, thanks. There are so many excellent lines in this book that your head will reel, and so many sexy vibes your bones will melt. This is Crusie at her very irreverent best."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"The book starts with a well done mis-communication - the bet. David bets Cal that he can't get Min to bed in a month. Cal refuses but says he's willing to bet ten dollars that he can walk out the door with her. Cal's ex girlfriend Cynthie walks up and Cal wants to get away from her. So he tells Cynthie he's with someone and goes to Min. Min overheard part of the bet but not all of it, and she thinks it's a bet to have sex with her. She is angry, but she leaves with Cal because she wants to be rude to him. Their paths keep crossing, and each time she insults him. But at the same time they are kind of falling for each other, but they don't want to. It's a fun set up with clever dialogue.Later there is a fight separating the couple (which follows the romance formula). That too was well done. A third party tells a lie to Cal which he believes. It was believable.Min is an actuary. She's smart and caring. She has a round shape and will never be thin. Her mother has always insulted her appearance and pressures her to lose weight. Cal encourages her to eat forbidden foods, bread, butter, doughnuts. He enjoys watching her sensual love of food. And he likes her looks.A great scene is when Min has dinner with Cal's family. I read this book five years ago and that dinner scene stayed vivid in my mind ever since. I just now did a second read. The first time I read the book I laughed out loud many times. I wasn't laughing as much the second time, probably because there were no surprises, but I still loved it.DATA:Story length: 391 pages.

Calvin Morrisey is a man who is used to getting what he wants. With his stunning good looks, debonair manner and all-around sex appeal, he has never met a woman who was a challenge. When someone bets him that he can't take sleep with the chubby wallflower in the bar he declines--ever the gentleman. He does, however, accept the bet that he can get her to go to dinner with him.Minerva Dobbs is used to playing second fiddle to her gorgeous younger sister and her slim best friends, but even she is appalled when she hears the suave gentleman make a bet that he can sleep with her. She decides to take the bait and go out with Calvin, but only to prove him wrong.The interaction between Minerva and Calvin is more or less a comedy of errors. They both fight their attraction for most of the novel even as the reader can see them falling more and more in love with each other. Crusie has a knack for conversation and witty banter that is a joy to read. The characters all have distinctive voices and it's not just the same old chick lit novel told over again. There was a spark to this novel that made me read it in about four hours and even when I finished I wished it hadn't ended. This is my first Jennifer Crusie novel, but I look forward to going back for more."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"What a great romantic comedy.

It was refreshing reading about a not so perfect main character. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Look beyond the cliches. Beyond the \\"plump gal\\" and the \\"handsome hero.\\" These two characters compliment each other. THAT is what makes this book stunning. There are some readers posting reviews who's names i wont mention, even tho i REALLY want to (!), who think that guys that look like Cal don't fall for girls that look like Min. YES THEY DO!! Cal falls for Min because of her personality (despite her initial prickliness) AND because she is beautiful in a soft, womanly way. Min falls for Cal because he is confident and charming (and that is some what because of the way he looks). Once you get inside this book, you will really root for the two romantic leads. Not because one is considered handsome by society and the other plain, but because they are interesting and brilliant people. I wont linger on the plot as you;ll know it more or less by now but I will say that this is an absolutely delightful read and I would have given it 5 stars were it not for the fact that at times these characters talk too much (says me) and i prefer less wordy exhanges. However, the sexy scenes are definetely not too wordy at all! Take a chance on this book.

This was my first experience with a Jennifer Crusie novel, and I just wish I had discovered her sooner. She is a recommended author from some friends who have never steered me wrong before.I was rooting for Min and Cal right from the start and found myself smiling every time they even spoke to each other. I loved Cal's descriptions of Min's body and how sexy he thought she was. It was very refreshing to read about a hot, sexy, romantic man who was that attracted to a woman who was not a super model. I'm sure those men do exist...somewhere!I also loved the supporting characters. There was not one that was not appealing in some way, even the parents, Cynthie, and David. Tony took a while to grow on me, but in the end, he emerged quite the hero himself.My only complaint is that Min, who is described as fat, is probably about a size 10. Since she was able to very uncomfortably squeeze in to a size 8, she can't be more than a 10, and a size 10 is not fat! No, she's not a stick figure but fat is stretching it quite a bit. Other than that one small flaw, there was nothing wrong with this book.

Her books are clever, funny and I love it that she's from my home state and writes about the area where I live. I'm also married to an actuary, so this book about an actuary had me laughing out loud. I listen to the audio versions of books and this one is beautifully done by Deanna Hurst. I'm not so crazy about some of the other readers of Crusie's books, but this one is a good listen."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book will always make me think of Krispy Kremes and fun shoes. It is one of the funniest books I've ever read. Many books have Big Misunderstandings, but none of them tackle it quite like Jennifer Crusie! Min mistakenly thinks Cal has made a $10,000 bet that he can get her into bed within one month. She's wrong, of course, but it makes for some hilarious twists and turns as she stings him along long enough to have a date for her sister's wedding but makes sure he loses the bet.All humor aside, one of the things I love about this book is how body image is handled. Min's family tries to keep her on a diet and tells her she's overweight, so she believes she is fat. Cal adores her just the way she is and works to get her to see herself through his eyes as he feeds her real food.

I have a LOT of work to do at our business today, which will be rather difficult as I HAVEN'T BEEN TO BED BECAUSE I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT reading, &quot;Bet Me&quot; by Jennifer Crusie. For the first time in a LONG time, I could not put the book down!I think that it is a crime to have the Spotlight Review rating this only 2 stars!! It is one of the BEST books that I have read all year. I guess that everyone is different, but I can't believe that we were reading the same book.Jennifer Crusie's books ALL have great dialogue, but sometimes her previous books seemed just a little too &quot;dysfunctional&quot; in a witty kind of way. Even though &quot;Bet Me&quot; has its strange moments, it is a captivating book.The dialogue completely submerged me into the characters. The entire time I was reading it, I thought, &quot;My God - that is exactly what people would say.&quot; It wasn't canned or stilted- it was funny, but more believable than any dialogue I think that I have ever read.I hope that Jennifer Crusie will write more books like this. What is truly a shame though is that the first reviewer's views are far from the majority opinion of this book. Sadly, that is what too many people will look at. This really is a book worth buying.

I discovered her last year and have read almost every book she's written -- and have been delighted with each and every one. She writes romantic comedies ... really good, funny, heart-warming, witty, intelligient romantic comedies.This one is about a normal girl ... I say normal because she isn't a size two with gorgeous blond hair that catches the light just so & has the perfect job and is the envy of all around her. That's the typical romantic comedy heroine. Not in this book. In Bet Me, we have Minerva Dobbs: a slightly overweight, under-confident, intelligient, hilarious, witty heroine. I laughed throughout this book ... Crusie has a writing style that I haven't seen before. All of her books are romantic comedys, they all have unlikely heroines, and they all have animals. Usually its dogs - but in this one it's a mangy looking cat. Her books have lovable characters -- REAL characters. People you can see yourself actually knowing .... People you can see YOURSELF in. This book struck a chord with me in many ways .... but I loved a scene towards the very end. Minerva is standing in front of a mirror after putting on a dress that our hero has chosen for her and he's trying to make her see what he sees ... a beautiful and sexy woman.If you're looking for a light, warm-hearted read .... Bet Me is a good bet!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Jennifer Crusie goes for it and tells a love story the way it should be told - with total, reckless abandon. In this modern-age fairy tale, actuary Min Dobbs knows handsome Cal Morrissey is a bad risk. He's a habitual lover-and-leaver, and too charming to be up to any good. Cal Morrissey knows that love's a long shot and the best you can hope for is a good time in the mean time - and uptight Min doesn't even look like a good time in the first place. But when Fate steps in to put them together, everyone knows resistance is futile.From delightful main characters to an engaging supporting cast, Crusie hits another one out of the park with \\"Bet Me.\\" Crusie's signature tight storytelling and graceful humor are as present here as ever, but she's added a layer of mythology without apology which creates a thoroughly charming set of characters in a lovely world where fairy tales can come true. It's a good bet that you won't find a better warm fuzzy this year; \\"Bet Me\\" is worth every penny of the hardcover price."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Minn lacks self esteem to go with her curvy body. Her favorite feature is her odd taste in footwear, and the belief that a girl can never have too many shoes. She just broke up with her boyfriend David (though never making the plunge and sleeping with him). The only thing that depresses her about her breakup with David is that she won't have a date to his sisters wedding.While at a bar, her friends goad her into walking up to a cute guy - Cal Morrissey, a serial dater afraid of commitment who just broke up with his therapist girlfriend. As she makes her way to Cal, she inadvertently overhears David making a bet with him that he cannot bed the girl in the grey suit within a month. Being the gal in the grey suit, she's shocked at first, but decides two can play that game, and sets out to make Cal's life miserable for that month (and heck, he'll make a cute date for the wedding). What she doesn't realize is that he didn't take the bet, but rather just bet that he could leave with her (for $10). Though their dinner date is a bust, circumstances keep throwing the two together, and Cal and Minn slowly start to develop feelings for each other - but Minn is still hurt because of the bet. Cal is mystified that his regular charm doesn't work on her - she seems immune. The big question is whether the two can weather the storm and discover their true feelings.With dialogue so witty and fresh that you can really imagine the conversations actually taking place, it'll have you craving chicken Marsala and Krispy Kremes. Despite their flaws, there is great chemistry between Minn and Cal. \\"Bet Me\\" was the first book I read by Jennifer Crusie. After this one, I was hooked on her writing style and sought out the rest of her books. Her writing is so fresh, her characters so quirky and believable, and her novels just cannot be beat."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I couldn't put this book down - after I read it I had to go right back to some good parts. It's standing up excellently to re-reading: it was just as funny the third time as it was the first two.Jenny herself described this as a &quot;cheesy romance&quot;. There is no suspense element, and the plot is not only straightforward, but extensively foreshadowed. These are not flaws, because the writing is wonderful, the dialogue is hilarious, and the characters are interesting, as usual. I particularly liked how true everything was; there are at least six different theories of love and relationships among the various characters, all of which turn out to apply to the protagonists. In recent books by Ms. Crusie there is usually some element a bit over the top; in &quot;Bet Me&quot; it's the fairy tale themes. How many actuaries get to play Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, Cinderella, Snow White, a girl who cries wolf, and the Beast in the course of a single story?Crusie writes contemporary romances in much the way Dorothy L. Sayers wrote mysteries, or Lois McMaster Bujold writes science fiction, or Georgette Heyer wrote Regencies. Which is to say excellently well, but with no two books quite alike. In particular, they don't tend to repeat themes. If you like the writers voice, and enjoy watching her grow and change, this is wonderful. It does lead to different readers having different favorite books. This week my own favorite Crusie is probably &quot;Faking It&quot;, but tastes vary. Fortunately it doesn't matter much; they're all very good.If you insist on suspense with your romance, try Jayne Ann Krentz or Nora Roberts instead. If you want a story more focused on a serial heartbreaker hero, try Catherine Asaro's SF novel &quot;The Last Hawk&quot;. If you want a recent fairy tale romance as fantasy rather than as a contemporary, try &quot;The Fairy Godmother&quot; by Mercedes Lackey. If you love &quot;Bet Me&quot; and want more straight contemporary romance, try Susan Elizabeth Phillips. If you really need the same theme over and over, stick to authors like Stephanie Laurens instead.Jenny went on to suggest &quot;... the world needs more cheese&quot;. I'm from Wisconsin, where we heartily agree with that sentiment. Especially when it produces books as wonderful as &quot;Bet Me&quot;."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Okay -- wow, this was good! I have never read Crusie before, so I was expecting just another semi-generic chick lit novel. I've never been so glad to be disappointed!I think this is the most perfect chick lit book I have ever read. It was hilarious, for one -- the one-liners just kept coming the whole novel through. And they were *good* one-liners, funny, smart, sexy, and witty. The characters were fabulous -- well-drawn, quirky, likeable (the good guys), deliciously unlikeable (the bad guys), intelligent, and fully fleshed-out. These were people I wanted to get to know and hang out with, the kind of people I could see myself being friends with. And the plot was utterly absorbing. Once I started, I couldn't put the book down. Literally. I stayed up until 9:00 in the morning finishing this thing; by the end, I was so tired I could barely keep my eyes open, but I kept on reading instead of doing the sensible thing and, y'know, sleeping, because I just *had* to know what happened next. It's been a while since I've been that caught up in a book. I'm going to have to check out Jennifer Crusie's other novels, because that was really a lot of fun!Oh! I forgot to mention the best part! The overweight heroine doesn't lose weight to win the heart of the hero! Not only is she as fat for the happily-ever-after ending as she was for the beginning, but the hero kept feeding her all the way through the novel because he liked the look on her face when she ate something yummy. I was starving when I finished _Bet Me_ -- people kept eating pasta, chicken marsala, and Krispy Kreme donuts! I've been waiting a long time for a book that said you don't have to be thin to be happy, and actually *meant* it. Thanks, Ms. Crusie!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I have not laughed so hard for a long time. This was my first book that I've read by Jennifer Crusie, but it certainly won't be my last. Crusie makes believable characters with more attitude, and more issues then the National Geographic. I could certainly relate to Min's overbearing mother, and her lousy luck with outfits.. well except shoes. We both have excellent taste in those! LOL.. This book was well written, and it was refreshing to have a main character who wasn't the stereotypical female romantic lead. Min is 33, curvy, and very individualistic. The book was not predictable in any way, and it didn't get bogged down in melodramatics. This is definitely going on my favorite books list!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"If you liked Tracy and Hepburn, Bogart and Becall, Gable and Lombard just to name a few then I think it's safe to say that you will like Cal and Min. Like the preceding couples, they click in a memorable way. And like the archetypes above, they are sexy and fun to read about. Once I picked up Bet Me, I had a hard time putting it down. Not because I was worried about the ending or that it kept me in suspense. Nope, it was just so much fun to read that I enjoyed almost every minute of it.Crusie has matured in her writing and it shows in this offering. Her characters are sophisticated, smart and likable. They are movie material. I always thought WTT was movie material but more in a Farrelly Brothers type of movie. Bet me is akin to Mike Nichol's material. Either is lots of fun and true entertainment but Nichol's films have that touch of something that makes them classics. And Bet Me is like that. It has that certain something where the characters are bigger than the pages and they come right off and on to the stage. All the characters in this book are well written and indispensable. Each shines their little bit of flashlight on the fun and development of the romance between the leads. Whether it's the lesbian neighbor bartender or the ex-psycho- analyst girlfriend who is an almost stalker.Bet Me was an exercise in written foreplay. Badinage type foreplay, where the characters delve into every aspect of each other before giving in to the inevitable. The sexual banter and development of the relationship between Cal and Min is really good stuff and like I said hard to put down. JC really puts a lot into the cultivation of her characters in this book especially the heroine. She is a woman that you can relate to in some ways if not all ways. We all have our physical drawbacks and a person in our lives that makes us feel inadequate. So, Min is a sympathetic character like Brigid Jones was. Min is never going to be model thin and her mother is never going to be happy about that. She has an overprotective dad as well as in appearance, a perfect sister and Min isn't exactly the sweetest person in the world. Min has attitude and she doesn't want to settle. She's not expecting Prince Charming like her friend Bonnie but in a relationship she expects a little endurance and respect. Her ex provided neither.Cal appears to be the consummate playboy type. Gorgeous, well off, buff and intelligent with a reputation as a heartbreaker. A love \`em and leave \`em womanizing male creature with no feelings. Appears is the operative word here. Cal like Min has layers and depths and is not as shallow as he seems to be. He has had to contend with dyslexia his whole life as well as overbearing parents. And though it seems like he can't maintain a long term relationship, it's obvious he has never fallen in love before.The secondaries are great in this book and very memorable. Even the per se villains the exes are well drawn and add just the right dimensions to this book. I was trying to think of my favourite scene in this book and I was running them all through my brain. It was nearly impossible to pick one but if I had to, I would have to pick the post coital scene near the end where everyone and his mother literally show up. Great plotting and excellent dialogue in this book. Bet Me gets an A from me and I really hope it does get made into a movie. There are rumors that there may be one. Wouldn't that be fun."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book is simply a gem. Wonderful book! I admit to being one of the many who did not sleep for an entire night becoz i absolutely couldn't put this book down! Jennifer Crusie's dialogue is sharp, incredibly witty, well-paced, and juz too funny! Characters are also brilliant in that they're developed well and very convincingly. Heroine Min Dobbs is a smart and lovable person with very realistic insecurities abt her weight, while Cal Morrisey is a charming and kind fella with very good romantic instincts. Crusie's writing is juz fantastic, the humorous scenes are laugh out loud funny, and the sad scenes are heartbreaking enough to jerk tears (well, for me anyway, i guess becoz i can relate).Not being a writer myself, I am kinda running out of words to describe how good this book is. But let me put it this way, right after i read the last page of BET ME, i immediately went back to the front cover and started reading it all over again. Juz coz i wasn't ready to leave Min and Cal yet. It is THAT good."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I'm in dissertation mode of my Ph.D. in comparative literature and feel as if I've read almost every book published. Some of those I enjoyed and some I didn't. This book, however, I loved reading.Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when he or she lauded Crusie's dialog skills, which are stupendous.Clearly, _Bet Me_ is not _Beloved_, and isn't supposed to be. So ff you're looking for entertaining, well written purely escapist women's fiction, look no further. Crusie is your answer. In fact, I find her talents light years beyond the current champion, Nora Roberts.Another reviewer complained of numerous, ill defined characters, but I don't see that at all. Just not at all. _Bet Me_ moves along at lightening speed, and I was sad to come to the end."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"The only problem I had with this book, personally, is that I can't help but compare it with Welcome to Temptation, which is the best Crusie book out there, bar none, and perhaps the best witty romantic contemporary fiction novel available, period.However, Bet Me has its own charm. Min Dobbs, our plump, witty heroine, is conflicted about accepting the attentions from Cal Morrisey, a red hot training seminar maven who, under normal circumstances, would be out of her league. However, Cal's interest is piqued when Min's smarmy ex-boyfriend points her out and initiates a bet that Cal can &quot;get&quot; Min within a month... and Min overhears their exchange.Crusie shines in the drafting of outrageous characters (this time, in the form of Min's mother, a cluelessly social-climbing barracuda; her and Cal's friends, and a cat named Elvis... not for this particular volume the ever-present Crusie dog... for me, vive la difference!). Characters are the key for this novel, and each one sparks independently of the others. Together, they combust. Min and Cal work out the kinks in their pseudo-but-evolving relationship in the face of considerable and hilarious impediments.As always, Crusie relies on cleverness, wit, and fundamental humor, plus generous italicized thought revelations, to create depth in her story. However, Min's comparative ordinariness is the single most outstanding component of this book; she's round, professionally accomplished, entrenched in a weird family, doesn't want kids... Min is a real woman (finally!); not for this story an impossibly slim, impossibly beautiful, impossibly exquisitely heartstricken young thing who's dying to fall in love with the right man and crank out babies in ostensible sequels that would be too boring to read.This book is not boring.If you like Crusie, this is a great book for you... it's a solid effort of an increasingly mature writer with growing mastery over her genre."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"One of my least favorite plot/device in a romance novel is \\"The Bet.\\" (My other least favorite is the \\"pretend to be lovers until we fall in love.\\" But that doesn't really apply here.) \\"The Bet\\" is just so annoying. It usually all plays out likeShe's All Thatwhere the hero yells \\"I made the bet before I knew you.\\" It can rarely be pulled off well and believable. So, when I first stumbled upon this book in my Amazon Recommends list I automatically shunned it. Then, one of my favorite book blogs put together a list of favorite reads of 2010 and this book was listed. The blogger had nothing but good to say about BET ME, which intrigued me. How can a book with \\"The Bet\\" plot be that amazing? So, I cracked open the story with a huge prejudice that I was NOT going to like it. I was wrong.I won't go into a summary of the book. The blurb does it justice as well as several of the other reviews.What I enjoyed:1. Min--she's a 33 years-old actuary who calls it as it is. She's funny (without all the constant one-liners), snippy, flawed, and real. She's a real woman a few pounds more than thin, much to the chagrin of her mother. She's learning to standup for herself and to be her own woman instead of her mother's ideal. She cuts through the crap and gets down to what really matters.2. Cal--Handsome Cal's screwed up childhood and family life molded his known dating history of \\"love \`em and leave \`em.\\" But, that's more to do with the women he dates than with what he truly wants in life.3. Min & Cal's friends--I loved the diversity of this group of people. They all were fully developed and complimented each other. They added so much humor, insight, and \\"romantic pushes.\\"4. Min & Cal's family--I loved the dysfunctional family dynamics of both families and how that played into the storyline. It cracked me up to see Min's mom trying to butter up Cal's socially elite mother at such an inopportune moment. Hilarious.5. Showing, not Telling--the writing excellently SHOWED us the development of the characters, the development of Min & Cal's romance, the development of the secondary characters. Things weren't spelled out, instead we were given a full and beautiful picture. I loved the subtlety used.6. The Villains--the ex's played a huge role in this story. Even though they were the \\"villains\\", I understood their motivations. They weren't anybody I'd like to hang out with, but that's the point, isn't it? Both were demented in the head in a completely humanly possible way, which made them real and believable. When the villain is cartoony, it makes the story unreal.7. The Betting--what?! I liked the betting? What is the world coming to? Cal and his friends bet over everything. Min catches onto this early on (obviously) and totally turns the tables on them and plays on their bets! How does \\"The Bet\\" play out? Well, it wasn't \\"I made that bet before I knew you!\\" Ms. Crusie totally made it work.8. The Ending--I like my romances with a Happily Ever After. This one delivers with a big smile.What I didn't like:1. The Actuary--I'm not so sure an actual actuary will start spouting statistical information. It wasn't over board, and the information she spilled out pertained to the story.2. Chicken Marsala--it seems to be the only thing these two eat. I know this sounds petty, but really, they eat this EVERY time food is mentioned.I was highly entertained by this book and couldn't put it down. I didn't want to let go of the story and found myself re-reading it instead of stopping. I read it 2 times in 3 days."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"[BASIC BOOK SUMMARY]Curvy, witty. thirty-three-year-old, Actuary Minerva Dobbs is dumped by her self-centered boyfriend. What makes it worse? The bastard does it three weeks before her sisters' wedding, her skinny and perfect sister. And her anal-retentive, passive aggressive, mother will not let her hear the end of it if she shows up to the wedding without a man. This is enough to ruin her evening, but things go from bad to worse. After her two girl-friends convince her to approach an absolutely gorgeous man, Calvin \\"Cal\\" Morrisey, for her escort to the wedding, she overhears her moments-agoex-boyfriend make an anger inducing bet with Cal.The bet? Ex David bets Calvin that he can't get the woman in the grey-checked suit at the bar to go to bed with him. Who is this poor grey-checked suit woman about to be humiliated? Well, wouldn't you know that Miss Minerva Dobbs is. In her anger she devises a plan. She will let Cal pick her up, take her to dinner, and maybe she can string him along as her date for the wedding, and make him really work for a bet he has no chance to win.Meanwhile, Cal is doing his best to avoid his marriage minded ex while he enjoys a few drinks with he best friends, and business partners, after work. But then things go to hell. His irritating client, David, slithers over with his ex, Cynthy, and the pressure is on. He somehow has to avoid his eager ex and his client's attempts to make an immoral bet to get a woman into bed. He's nearly managed to weasel out of it when his ex's presence forces him to compromise on the topic of them bet. To escape the bar and the situation, he takes the bet that he can get the suit to go to dinner and makes his exit, escaping the situation.So these two would-be-lovers embark on their chaotic ride with dinner. Minerva has Cal's \\"number\\" and out maneuvers, out-bitches, his sexy \\"used car salesman of seducers\\" gimmick. Cal thinks Minerva is an uptight repressed woman that he definitely should stay away from. What's the problem? Fate has other ideas. Somehow these two just can't stay away from each other, and if it's not their friends' relationships with each other that brings them together and pulls them apart, it's the interference of their insane neurotic families. Try as they might to avoid each other, they just can't stay away from each other physical attraction and their niggling inner voices, which keep whispering, \\"this one\\", keep complicating things. Fighting their mutual attraction and distrust, these two fight an up-hill battle of a comedy of errors. Sacrasm, sexual-tension, the dynamics of family issues, and the support of friends weaves a hilarious and heartfelt tale of the roller coaster ride that is love.[BOOK REVIEW]Crusie has done it again with her great characters and witty dialogue. What really makes this a book to read over and over again is the author's dry wit, varying cultural references, and her ability to weave seemingly co-incidental events seamlessly. The dynamics of her characters, the ways in which they interact and grow, are real and easy to relate to. There is a concept of fate, and a development of the Chaos Theory that weaves perfectly, and hilariously, into the story in addition to an ongoing theme of fairy tales (with plenty of subtly presented parallels and allusions to such tales as Cinderella).While it is the great characters, with real personalities and issues, that make this a great story, it is especially Crusie's ability to write witty, fast pace dialogue, with individual voices for each character, that really draws in and holds the reader's interest.Another thing about this book that impressed me was that Crusie covered three very different romantic relationships dynamics in this book without cluttering the main love story. Whether you believe in an uncomplicated happily ever after or if you believe in living in each moment, this book is relatable. Each of the main women have their own different ideas about love and are still able to be supportive of another's beliefs, worries, and needs.This is perfect book for a book club, a group of close girl friends, or even the solitary reader who wants to settle in for an evening in alone with a glass of wine and loud raucous laughter. So, prospective reader, order a copy and enjoy, for it is most certainly worth it. Even better, get a copy on audio CD's as well (the reader does an amazing job). This is the kind of book you can read or listen to over and over again."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Crusie shines in this modern day fairy tale that makes you happy you read romance. I love all of her books, but this is my all-time favorite! Get ready to laugh!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I'm not a big fan of romance novels. However, I couldn't put this book down and I lost a few hours of sleep trying to find out how Cal and Min were going to end up. Because Crusie writes from both characters' POV, you really root for them because you know what's REALLY going on. Some of the events were a little far fetched, but it just added to the fairy tale part of the story.I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good love story. Be prepared to lose some sleep because you just can't put this book down."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I'm always leery about picking up strictly romance books, because usually a lot of the ones I try reading are too (for lack of better word) fluffy. This one was definatly not like that. Once I started it I didn't want to put it down. Min and Cal's relationship is amusing, as is the shoe fetish going on. I got a little bored during some of the parts where the story shifted to David and Cyn plotting, but it never lasted long. I enjoyed all the different character's outlook on how love works and also the characters were all well wrote. I'm a sucker for fairy tales, so I loved that it was kind of wrote out to be a modern one. I'll more than likely be picking up another book by Crusie soon."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I LOVED this book!! I read it 2 days! I could not put it down! This is the first time I have read anything by Cruise...but it definitely won't be the last! I have since shared this tasty treat with my friends and family, and they all loved it!! I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Crusie is the best in contemporary romantic fiction- but you've got to like some laughs; if passionate pathos and despair are your thing, you won't be pleased. Bet Me is at the top of my list of her books, though Faking It and Welcome to Temptation are duking it out for pure entertainment value. Her dialogue and situations are outstanding. Her books step on the edges of suspension of disbelief without ever going near the shores of Dynasty type writing. Her characters are fully rounded with flaws, families and friends that just make us like them more. Reading a Crusie novel is the best form of escapism. She has a fabulous sense of humor and her heros are perfect for being so far from perfect and therefore believable fantasies. She writes a sex scene like no one else. The hero is never virile and unbelievably potent and the gasps usually (initially) come from something stuck in the cushions under the couch. Then they deal. The most unlikely, yet lovely, aspect is that her heros want to talk and figure out how to do better in the future. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"For me, Jennie Crusie has raised the bar by which all contemporaries are judged.Bet Me is another winner. How can you not fall for a guy who loves his lady as much for her faults as for what he sees hiding beneath them. And it's hidden deep.Min Dobbs is like an anti-heroine, she's so tough on Cal, a sensitive, dyslexic hero who sees her weaknesses and her needs and is there for both. Of course they meet on a bet, but that's the best kind of setup in my book. Shaky ground; it's never gonna work; both Min and Cal are certain, but Crusie pulls it off despite their struggle.It was so much fun watching Cal lure Min into his world with tenderness, Chicken Marsala and Krispy Kreme donuts. What a hoot. If you've never read Crusie, you're missing out big time.Bet Me is another Crusie masterpiece."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"There is NO ONE out there who writes repartee as well as Jenny Crusie!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I can't believe that I just discovered Jennifer Crusie last year! I really, really enjoy her novels and her heroines! They are intelligent, full of personality, realistic, human, and (most importantly) never skinny, over-highlighted, complaining \\"it\\" girls. In a literary world full of the woeful tales of starving, depresseed, and delusional heiresses, Jennifer Crusie is such a relief to find.Bet Me is about Minerva Dobbs and her attempt to find Mr. Right without losing her integrity and self respect. I would talk about the plot more, but you, if you enjoy romances, all you need to know is that you should just read it. Minerva is an incredibly likeable character, and the writing and the plot are just hilarious! This is a romance for intelligent, witty women who want something more literary that Harlequin and less glossy than Jackie Collins or Danielle Steel."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I am a crazy Jennifer Crusie fan, and this is by far my favorite. The characters are quintessential Crusie, and as with any great book it's not just the main characters which are appealing and real, but all of them."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book was a pleasant surprise. It was what I was expecting, light, fluffy, easy on the brain, but it also surprised me by being more. Great dialogue, great characters, a plot that has more twists and turns than the Danube river (not that I have any idea what I'm talking about there!) this book when down smooth and easy.This book reminded me a lot of Good in Bed by Jennifer Weiner, in that our heroine is on the heavy side and she's been burned by a guy and is decidedly NOT looking for love. But in walks Mr. Right and she's knocked for a loop she wasn't expecting. And he's just as surprised as she is, since he wasn't exactly looking for her either. Misunderstandings, bets, chicken marsala and lots of laughs insue as these two do everything in there power to stay away from each other. The sexual tension is hot, the love scenes hotter, and with a wicked cat named Elvis with a penchant FOR Elvis (as in Presley) this novel definitely seems to have it all. Highly recommend for a great distraction from the real world."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This is a good book by J Crusie. Her writing is light and funny.

But not the bet that Min thinks he picks her up on.Both Min and Cal know that the other is THE ONE, but fight tooth-and-nail to avoid consciously admitting that small detail to themselves. Fate conspires against (they believe...for, I believe) them, maiming them a bit each time they deny the rightness of their love.The secondary characters (Bonnie and Roger, Tony, Liza, Emilio, and Shanna) truly add to the story, and keep up the flow of wonderfulness going.I have read it, re-read it, and will continue to re-read it until I no longer have sight or hearing or breath in my body!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"The story line, guy makes a bet to get girl, seems over done... but the aurthor runs with this story line and leaves you laughing.

Prior to this I'd only read one Jennifer Crusie book, and wasn't too impressed with it.This book was much better than I expected. It explores traditional gender stereotypes about relationships and portrays two non-perfect people: Min, an overweight career-minded woman who's frightened of being hurt in relationships, but needs a date to her sister's wedding; and Cal, a relationship-scared learning disabled business owner who has been told his whole life that he's damaged goods and is scared to commit to anyone. The story also amusingly features their best friends, family members, and acquaintances, including two exes set out to destroy the main characters' blooming relationship.Bet Me was a terrific \\"read\\" and I was sorry to have it end.

This book is laugh-out-loud funny, with a fast-paced plot, excellent characterization, and great dialogue. Others detailed the plot, so I won't go into it in my review, but did want to mention that the too-frequent references to the heroine's weight got to be a little too much at times.

Good characters, great dialogue, just plain out fun!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I usually don't delve too deeply into the love stories, however, this is a fun read. This book travels through the relationship from start to finish, and is based around the guy being \\"bet\\" to get a date with the main female. This is an interesting cast to follow. Both main characters have real families, with real problems. And that follows them into their own relationship issues too. The book is interesting, but light-hearted at the same time with the main characters love of silly shoes! Good book!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Before reading 'Bet Me' I had already been a huge fan of Jennifer Crusie. I had read all the books she had released so far, and I was completely in love with all of them, so you can imagine how excited I was to be reading 'Bet Me' for the first time. Little did I know that this book would seriously become my absolute favorite!The characters were great, the story was brilliant, everything about this book was absolute GENIUS!! And I may be overexaggerating, but there's just no other way to describe it. Even though it bugged me that Min was in so much denial even when proof that Cal was perfect for her was staring her right in the face, I still loved her and felt for her because she was going through sooo much. And I absolutely loved Cal, he was hilarious! This is the first book to ever make me laugh out loud, and being the huge romantic that I am, the love between those 2 touched my heart very much. Jennifer Crusie is the one author I can count on to give me my 'romance fix' with her wonderful stories, but this book hit me the most in the best way possible. I love this story and Ms. Crusie so much, and I can guarantee that after reading 'Bet Me', you will too. :o)"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I LOVE Jennifer Crusie but she is at her best with Bet Me! I could not put the book down, in fact I stayed up all night reading it. I have enjoyed the quick wit and dialogue of all Crusie's books, but my favorite by far is Bet Me. I have bought copies for all the women in my life who have in turn bought copies for all the women in their life! I haven't met a person who didn't love this book!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Rather than retelling the plot, I'll focus my short comments on my reaction/review of the novel:I really enjoyed this novel with all of its sauciness and sexual tension. This book, more than any others I've read in awhile, really builds the chemistry between the two characters so that you can't put it down! If you're wanting some good, escapist reading, this is a good choice."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Min Dobbs has had it with her stuck up ex-boyfriend, her weight-obsessive mother, her sleazy future brother-in-law, and her ugly apartment. Then one night at the bar she overhears her ex-boyfriend, David, making a bet with one Calvin Morrisey. The terms? Cal has to get Min in bed within a month. Outraged, Min decides to string Cal along through at least one miserable date, before parting ways. What she doesn't expect is to fall head over heels with commitment-phobe Cal. Suddenly he's feeding her Krispy Kremes, buying her perfect shoes, and belting out Elvis in a crowded restaurant. Despite meddling exes, Cal's frigid family, and her overprotective best friend, will Min finally find her fairy tale? And will Cal be able to risk it all for love? Crusie will delight readers with her trademark humor and witty dialogue in this novel about a pleasantly plump sweetheart and her playboy prince.I'll admit that this book was not what I would call true-to-life. After all, I've never met someone as perfect as Cal (who assures weight-conscious Min that men prefer women to be \\"soft and round\\" and sexy is all in the head *sigh*). But, Min and Cal's relationship is pretty realistic. Crusie demonstrates how love doesn't necessarily happen at first sight (i.e. the hilariously horrendous first date), but takes time and effort. Min may be funny and smart, but she's insecure about her appearance, a feeling almost all women can relate to. And despite his confident outlook, Cal has some family/childhood issues that come into play as well.I love Jennifer Crusie and \\"Bet Me\\" is a fabulous example of her ability to tie in romance, humor, and wonderful characters into a great read!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Min and Cal's relationship isn't off to such a great start when Min 'overhears' him and his friends making a bet on whether he can bring her home. But as the book continues and these two fight and fall in love, I couldn't stop reading. The story is funny (very very funny), romantic, and very honest. Min and Cal get input from family and friends, but in the end it's only how they see each other that counts. Also, after reading some of the sexy scenes, I'll never look at a Krispy Kreme the same!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I picked up the book one afternoon and didn't put it down until almost 7am the next morning.Min is anything but perfect and fun. And she wears great shoes! What woman can't relate to that?Calvin, the main hunk, is everything we hope he is and more. Through in some food, some crazy and loyal friends, an overbearing mother and Elvis, and you have a romance comedy that you just can't stop reading.It breaks the rules to the traditional romance novel and I love it for it.It was a joy to read."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Oh, for all us hopeful romantics out there, this is the book. When you find yourself down and discouraged about finding your prince and fairytale ending, read this book. It definitely reminds you that fate works in mysterious ways and that ultimately, when \\"the one\\" comes along, fate takes over and handles everything for you.I absolutely loved the story, not just for its fairytale story and ending, but because it could happen, it's not too far out there to the point where it just gets your hopes up for nothing. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I love this book! This was the second Jennifer Crusie book that I read, but it got me addicted to all her other books. She is one of my favorite authors. It is a very funny read and very well written.

Min is my hero."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book is a pleasure to read, especially for fans of romance. And for fans of Chic Lit. And for fans of funny, witty dialogue full of a surprising amount of social commentary and wisdom for the modern woman. This wonderfully original slant on the old fairy tale examines the barriers we erect for ourselves to stop us from really falling in love. The genius of this book is that it comes back to touch you when you're least expecting it, and you realize how true-to-life Crusie's recipe for love can be!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I thought Bet Me was cute. It's not deep literature no, but the characters seem a little more real that your usual romance novel. Min and Cal are not the princess and prince you normally see in similar books. I'm sick of perfect hero meets perfect heroine and they marry and have kids etc. This book made me chuckle more than once. Jennifer Crusie's characters are fun and interesting, not fake and perfect."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I read this book when it was first released and have read it three more times since. If you want a book to end by giving you a really good feeling inside then this is the book for you. The dialog just rolls along so naturally and is so engrossing you can't stop turning the pages and you never want it to end. A good read is one of the cheapest things offered in today's world and the return received with this novel is more than worth the cost."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"'Bet Me' is an absolute, hands-down all-time favorite.

It was my first Jennifer Crusie novel and I was not disappointed. Like others I could not put this book down. I related with the characters, I laughed, and I cheered. This book will not disappoint it is up in my Top 10."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Lately I've been feeling a bit blue. Nothing desperate. Just in need of some cheering up, some laughter, something bright inside amid all this dreary weather we're enduring outside. I found myself craving it every night when I settled down to read and just not finding it in the books stacked around me. Then about month ago Keishon over at Avid Book Reader reviewedManhuntingby Jennifer Crusie. I love Keishon's reviews and eclectic taste and I remembered I'd been wanting to give Crusie a try for awhile now. I asked for suggestions in the comments there and got several good ones. The consensus there and on a few other sites I checked was that BET ME is widely regarded as one of Crusie's best titles. So on my next trip to the library I picked it up and settled in that night, not sure exactly what to expect, but hoping for the best.Minerva Dobbs is ready to kill her suddenly ex-boyfriend David when he dumps her in a crowded bar a couple of weeks before her sister's wedding. Flanked by her two best friends, Liza and Bonnie, Min tries to focus on the fact that she never liked David much anyway and she's actually quite relieved to be rid of the smarmy loser who insisted she stay on a strict diet and always picked the restaurants they went to. At the same time, in another corner of the bar, Calvin Morrisey is happy to be rid of his marriage-hungry former girlfriend and is looking forward to just running his company and spending time with his buddies. He is neither amused nor interested when David Fisk bets him $10,000 he can't make it with Min within a month. Lucky for Min, she overhears the conversation and determines to beat (and hopefully humiliate) them both at their own game. So when Cal approaches Min in an attempt to get away from David, the game is on and he doesn't even know it. What he does know is this woman wants to be with him approximately as much as he wants to be with her, which is to say not even a little bit. Also, there is nothing exciting or colorful about her except the unlikely and impractical shoes she's got on. But he asks her to dinner anyway and she inexplicably accepts. Hilarity, heat, and shenanigans ensue.Jennifer Crusie had me from page one. I liked Min and Cal so much it was perfectly delicious watching them push each other's buttons and alternately despise and surprise each other. I liked all four of the best friends--particularly the sappy-but-impossible-to-dislike Bonnie and Roger, determinedly pursuing their happily ever after no matter how hard their well-meaning friends tried to convince them it doesn't exist. Yes, it was utterly predictable fluff. But the writing was surprisingly deft and the characters were no cardboard cutouts. Every now and then I'd run across a sentence that was at once airy and light and perfectly placed to resonate with the reader or sketch out what was going on between characters at the time. There were a couple of \\"villains\\" that behaved just as you might expect, but even they turned out to be grayer than I thought. But secondary characters aside, Min and Cal make this romantic comedy. They're real and fully-fleshed out and they have histories and families and careers and it all comes into play as they try and fail to remain detached from each other. So much of why I had a ridiculously good time reading BET ME was the nonstop humor. An early example from that first dinner:Cal turned and saw Emilio, this time with a fragrant platter of chicken marsala, golden-brown filets and huge braised mushrooms floating luminously in dark wine sauce.\\"Oh, my Lord,\\" Min said.Emilio beamed at her as he served. \\"It's a pleasure to serve someone who appreciates food. Taste it.\\"Min cut into the chicken and put a forkful in her mouth. She looked startled and then she closed her eyes and began to chew, her face flushed with pleasure. When she'd swallowed, she looked up at Emilio, her eyes shining. \\"This is incredible,\\" she said, and Cal thought, Me, look at me like that.\\"Try the mushrooms,\\" Emilio said, happy as a half-Italian clam.\\"Go away,\\" Cal told him, but Emilio stayed until Min had bitten into one of the huge mushrooms and told him with heartfelt passion that he was a genius.\\"Can I get some credit for bringing you here?\\" Cal said when Emilio was gone.\\"Yes,\\" Min said. \\"You are a genius at restaurants. Now be quiet so I can concentrate on this.\\"Cal sighed and gave up on the conversation for the rest of the meal. There was a skirmish at the end when Min tried to insist on separate checks, but Cal said, \\"I invited you, I pay. Back off, woman.\\" She looked as though she were going to argue for a moment, and then she nodded. \\"Thank you very much,\\" she told him. \\"You've given me a lovely meal and a new favorite restaurant,\\" and he felt appreciated for the first time that night.When they left, she kissed Emilio on the cheek. \\"Your bread is the greatest, Emilio, but the chicken is a work of art.\\" Then she kissed him on the other cheek.\\"Hey,\\" Cal said. \\"I'm right here. I paid for the chicken.\\"\\"Don't beg,\\" Min told him and went out the door.\\"Morrisey, I think you just met your match,\\" Emilio said.\\"Not even close,\\" Cal said, grateful to be without her for a moment. \\"This was our first, last, and only date.\\"\\"Nope,\\" Emilio said. \\"I saw the way you looked at each other.\\"\\"That was fear and loathing,\\" Cal said, opening the door.\\"God, you're dumb,\\" Emilio said, and Cal ignored him and went out into the dark to find Min.Sigh. I loved this book. Clearly a case of the right one at the right time. I took it back to the library knowing I would need to go out soon and procure my own copy because I can tell I'll want to revisit these characters. I laughed so much reading it and by the time I finished everything was bright and lovely inside once more.Note: I went on a bit of a Crusie binge after this and, four books in, BET ME is far and away my favorite. Definitely the best of the lot."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I love all of her books but Bet Me is one of her best yet! I had a hard time putting this one down.

Take it with you on vacation."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Never has almost 500 pages sped by so quickly; I think I read this RomCom in one sitting. Very cute, very funny, very satisfying in the end. I love that Minerva Dobbs is a \\"big girl.\\" (That is, guessing by the descriptions in the book of her not fitting into a size 8, she's probably a size 12, perhaps even a 14. The horror!) While Calvin Morrissey only seeks her out initially, because of a bet placed by her asshat exboyfriend, David, he quickly becomes enthralled.A few of the food themes were a little overdone - I'm sure chicken marsala is delicious and all that, but it seems like that and Krispy Creme donuts were ALL these two were eating. Generally people who love food and eating like more than 1-2 things. And enough with the Elvises already!This is another book with excellent use of the subplot romances and background characters - there are many, but they are all very quickly distinct, from Liza to Tony to Diana to nephew Harry. The 'rents are NOT evil people but who have managed to screw up our hero and heroine quite nicely, thank you. The ex-girlfriend who wants Cal back is not a villain; Crusie's use of Cynthee was interesting, she was both an antagonist, and something of a Greek chorus, filling the audience in on what stage of love that Cal and Min were experiencing.Another thing I loved that was different, was that while they liked kids, neither heroine nor hero WANTED them. This was consistent throughout the book, and in the epilogue, they did not in fact HAVE kids. I love kids; had one of my own, but not every HEA needs kids, and I love that Crusie matched a couple and gave them a HEA without the obligatory offspring."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This is by far Crusie's best book.

I was hooked on the first page and literally read it straight through. The main characters, Cal and Min, are great characters. If you preview the book and like what you see, you'll probably enjoy it. Her witty fast paced writing style reminds me a lot of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series. It's a cute romantic story that's also funny and sexy.

Really, really, REALLY love it.The best thing about this book is how straightforward it is: it's a classic, funny romance. Crusie isn't trying to explore any deep issues or confuse the reader with a complicated plot, a sideline mystery, or tons of characters. We get Min and Cal, two very likeable, believable characters, falling in love and that's more than enough to keep your interest.The dialogue is sharp and funny and the build-up to Min and Cal finally really getting together is perfectly paced. The love scene is sublime. Even Min and Cal's fights made me smile.I've read all of Crusie's books, and this one was absolutely my favorite. I truly have nothing negative to say about it. It's the best contemporary romance novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I am a huge JC fan and so have been saving this book for a good holiday read. Sadly it was not as good as her previous works. Maybe JC took on board the comments made in relation to 'Faking It' - too confusing and having too many characters.

Did anyone else think that Bonnie was Charlotte from Sex in the City (without her fantastic manic side?) or that another outspoken redhead friend was just tired?Don't get me wrong - I will still buy all of JC books.

It's nice, silly, typical chick lit, but too many things annoyed me about it.First, it's just too long. The 'ole cat & mouse game only goes on for so long, especially when nothing else is happening in this plot.Min & Cal have a colorful array of friends, but very little character exploration is done with them. It makes you re-read dialogue between them because nothing has stood out between the pack.I recommend the movie \\"Down With Love\\" if you like this book. It reminded me a lot of the movie, only I liked the movie much better.Don't get me wrong- I did enjoy a lot of the book. Min's character is real & great! I really dig that strange cat, Elvis, too. She & Cal are fun to read as they go at it.

Having read most of them, I can say that while a few have been dreadful, most of her books have been quite good, and some of them have been brilliant.BET ME falls into the brilliant category.BET ME is the best of that notorious category known as chicklit.The plot here is not linear or predictable...the gimmick which forms the hook of the story is original and amusing...the characters are real and endearing...and the dialogue--well, the dialogue is honed and sparkling. Typical of Crusie's writing, the laughs here are quick and genuine.At her best--and BET ME is among her best work--no author does it better than Jennifer Crusie."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Bet Me is quite similar to the wonderful Welcome to Temptation - Little League, icy mothers, difficult sisters, improbably handsome hero, stray animals - but still very enjoyable, with witty dialogue and a fun plot.

And what a perfect reward for all her pains Cal is - better than Krispie Kremes. (Vegas Here I come) *ahem*Min and Cal's relationship is so skillfully developed thatI didn't even notice how long Crusie made us wait for one of her famous &quot;hot&quot; scenes until it finally happened. And the dog we've come to expect is in this case a cat - but what a cat.I just loved this funny and wickidly sharp book and I know it's one I'll read again and again - especially when the old self-esteem needs a boost!Well said....Diana"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Is there such a thing as a fairy tale romance? Does anyone ever live happily ever after? Actuary Minerva Dobbs finds out in BET ME, the latest in a string of Chick Lit books written by the popular author Jennifer Crusie. In this story, the focus is on a young woman who does not wear a size six dress nor cares about how she appears to the opposite sex. She is tired of the dating scene and of her criticizing mother, and is ready to move in with a cat.The story opens in a bar in New York with Minerva and her soon-to-be ex-boyfriend David breaking up. Apparently he is not happy that she has refused to have sex with him during their entire dating relationship, and he decides it's time to move on. Not that Minerva cares; she is actually relieved. She was tired of David's advice on how to lose weight and what not to eat, and wished that he could have accepted her the way she was. She leaves David and seeks out her two best friends, Bonnie and Liza, who are waiting for her at the bar.Min soon notices a trio of men across the way who are watching them. Three guys for three gals --- a perfect match. So Min decides to go over there and see what's up. As she approaches, she overhears them talking about her (in a rather unflattering way) and the man who has caught her eye is making a bet with his friends that he can convince her to go out to dinner with him by the end of the evening. On that note, Min runs back to her safe corner with Bonnie and Liza, and as the women wait, the man who caught her attention, Calvin Morissey, walks over to them, and subsequently asks Min out to dinner. Min accepts.What Min does not know is that David was the one who made this initial bet with Cal. She also isn't aware that David bet Cal $10,000 that Cal could not get Min to have sex with him within a month. David thinks this is an easy win for him, since he is under the impression that Min simply is not interested in sex. But what David does not understand is that Min simply was not interested in David, period. Cal, on the other hand, has a reputation for never losing a bet. He does not take David's sex bet seriously, but nevertheless wins the $10 bet regarding dinner with Min, thanks to her eavesdropping just minutes earlier. She basically went out with Cal just to infuriate David.From that point on, the crazy up and down friendship between Cal and Min begins. The two are obviously attracted to each other, but they drive each other nuts. It's like oil and water. They talk, they tease, they flirt. But neither one wants to admit that there is anything going on between them. Bonnie and Liza notice that something exciting IS going on between the two, and so do Cal's friends, Tony and Roger. Soon, the six of them become regular buddies, with Roger and Bonnie falling in love, Tony and Liza \\"dating\\" but with no serious intentions for a commitment, and Cal and Min arguing, flirting and stealing kisses every now and then.Min soon sees another part of Cal's life --- his personal relationship with his family, his ex-girlfriend Cynthie (who is secretly plotting a way to get Cal back), and a childhood that left Cal scarred and scared about being a failure. Cal also meets Min's wacky family, including a sister who is having pre-wedding jitters, an overbearing mother and an overprotective father who may be having an affair with his secretary.BET ME is a winning book. Although this reviewer feels it went on a bit too long, Jennifer Crusie does an excellent job creating some very funny characters. We see each individual written into this story as someone uniquely important in his or her own right, yet integral to the love story of Cal and Min. There are subplots that surround the fairy tale; although at first this reviewer did not see the point in throwing in all of these characters, it all comes together nicely by the end of the book. BET ME is recommended for all fans of Chick Lit.--- Reviewed by Marie Hashima Lofton"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I had previously picked up Crusie's \\"Crazy for You\\" and \\"Welcome to Temptaion.\\" I found them to be slighlty entertaining but really just romances disguised as contemporary; nothing too exciting or interesting and mostly predictable. I'm a big fan of chick lit so I enjoy comedy intertwined with romance but not the Harlequin type. This book, which I read in one day as I could not put it down, was HIGHLY entertaining and enjoyable. It did not dissapoint and the I felt the plot was unique and refreshing. The characters were all well developed and therefore you enjoyed them... in fact, it made me feel like I was part of the group (and I wouldn't mind having one just like it! LOL) Although there are parts that are overdone, Cynthie and David for example, the overall effect is definitely one to entertain. If you like this book, check out the works of Janet Evanovich and/or Whitney Gaskell."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I enjoyed this read, because it was a light way to read through my work week. Each chapter introduced a new side of each character, and it kept me reading and wanting more."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I totally loved reading this book. It was an easy, enjoyable read that you can sit back and enjoy without putting a lot of thought into the book. The characters are able to put chills down your arms when you read about their feelings for each other. I absolutely loved reading this book."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I've gotten into chick lit over the last year or so and have been exploring new authors. I picked up this book based on some viewers reviews and LOVED it! I've re-read it at least 4 or 5 times already and still enjoy it.It's a great story with real live, warm, characters who are relateable and likeable, but certainly not perfect. Some of the storyline had me laughing out loud and some of it had me staying up way to late to read it. It's a bit more relateable then some of the other books in this genre and features some great writing and snappy dialogue between the characters. None of them are one-dimensional and all are relateable in some way.It's wonderfully written and by far, my favorite Jennifer Cruise book. I hope her future writings are as good as this one."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This was an awesome book! The best book I have read in a very long time. This book just touched me. It made me want to read it slower because I didn't want it to end. I fell in love with the characters. It has humor and I'd be laughing out loud and grinning the whole time! It was such a good story. I am buying and reading more Jennifer Crusie!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Hey all you Big Beautiful Women. . .this story will make you feel great! Sorry skinny gal's. . . you will enjoy it too!This was my introduction to Jennifer Crusie! What a great read! I was tired of reading all the gore of crime books and needed a fun reprieve. THIS WAS A GOOD BET! Now, I am hooked on reading all Crusie's books (in copyrighted order!).As for the story, you will find characters with true emotions and warm personalities. The endings may be predictable, but that will put a smile on your face as you finish the story."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Calvin Morrisey cannot say no to a bet, not to save his life. This man will bet on everything, but truly, it's part of his charm.Minerva Dobbs calculates the odd, lives within nice parameters until she meets the Heartbreak King, then she's all-in.The story opens with a break-up scene. Min won't sleep with David, so he's cutting the relationship short and only a few short weeks before she needed a date for her sister's wedding. That's when she sees him, Cal Morrisey. A man with the reputation of a love-\`em-and-leave-\`em sort. After a lengthy discussion with her friends, Min approaches Cal only to mistakenly overhear a bet between David and Cal. Frustrated and hurt, Min sees a way to pay them all back. Calculating the odds of success she works the bet in her favor. She thinks.This hysterical romp will grab your attention. It's a one-sitting read. Becareful where you read it, because there are many places you will actually laugh out loud at the antics of Cal, Min, and their friends. In this one novel, you get Elvis preoccupation (both of them), one-eyed felines, shoe-fetishes,101 things you never knew to do with Krispy Kremes and much much more. This is a must have for anyone interested in romantic comedy. Yet again, Jenny Crusie steals our hearts with truly magnificent characters, who make us yearn for, laugh for, and hurt for them. This is a Five Angel Recommended Read if I ever saw one."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This was one of the best books I've ever read!!! I couldn't it down. I actually laughed out loud, and I kept a grin on my face the entire time. This is totally and completely a must-read!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Jennifer Cruise did an excellent job with creating belieavable characters. I became totally engrossed in Minerva's story. I found myself laughing out loud in several scenes. This was definately a great read and I'll be going back to read some of Cruise's earlier works."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"It took me forever to find the time to get a healthy start on this book but lo and behold jury duty rolls around and man am I glad it did! This is a great read and a terrific story. I enjoyed reading about a curvy woman who called the shots and was able to step up to the plate when it came down to the wire.As hopeless of a romantic I am, I was able to identify with Min and the girls very quickly. And the banter between her and Cal trying to convince each other that their very presence disgusted them was right on par with true love. In addition to the witty conversation and the richly detailed scenes, the book moves with a quick pace to keep your interest and move the story along.This is my first novel that I read by Crusie and I am encouraged to read more. It was a perfect book in a day read and I recommend it for people who can laugh and learn that love is stubborn, maybe more stubborn than we are ourselves."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I listen to Jennifer Cruise's books on unabridged audiocassettes because there aren't many choices for romances in this area. Jennifer Cruise's books have never been all that great to me.This one came as a big surprise. I actually liked the female character, there wasn't a sex scene every 20 pages, the story was cute, and the female character wasn't a thin, long-legged Barbie type."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This was a great book from beginning to end. I loved it. The characters were great and the writing was excellent. For the reviewer who gave the book 1 star, Cal did not make the bet about getting her into bed. You should re-read that part because I think you missed it. This goes to show that men and women are not all superficial enough to care about weight and looks. It is also about personality which I think that both Cal and Min have in abundance."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Reading the reviews, I was sooo excited about this book. It's nice, silly, typical chick lit, but too many things annoyed me about it.First, it's just too long. The 'ole cat & mouse game only goes on for so long, especially when nothing else is happening in this plot.Min & Cal have a colorful array of friends, but very little character exploration is done with them. It makes you re-read dialogue between them because nothing has stood out between the pack.I recommend the movie \\"Down With Love\\" if you like this book. It reminded me a lot of the movie, only I liked the movie much better.Don't get me wrong- I did enjoy a lot of the book. Min's character is real & great! I really dig that strange cat, Elvis, too. She & Cal are fun to read as they go at it. Their fights are silly & funny, yet witty & intelligent.This is my first time reading Cruise & because I found some really good elements to this novel, I think I'll try her again."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I have been a fan of Jennifer Crusie since Tell Me Lies, and this book is not up to the par of some of her other novels. Min is just so cranky that I can't imagine why Cal keeps coming back. I also thought that the secondary characters were not as well developed as some of the other novels - Fast Women, for example. In fact, Cal and Harry were the only two characters I really liked. Also, I don't know how Cal and Min could eat chicken marsala so often."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"The story is cute, and I laughed aloud a couple of times, but I wish I'd read this when I was about 18. I think I would have appreciated it more then. I'd draw the analogy to a Julia Roberts movie...entertaining, but you're almost dumber for having partaken. At 18 I wouldn't have minded the lack of character development, I wouldn't have minded the cartoonish supporting characters. (...)But at my age (...) I feel like this book was wasted on me because it is a silly and superficial, albeit cute, story. And for heaven's sake, where was Jennifer Cruise on the day they taught conversational writing in school? Playing hooky and stuffing her face with Chicken Marsala? After the first chapter, I was already fed up with the \\"he said...she said...he said...she said...he said...\\" How about \\"he retorted,\\" or \\"she replied?!?\\" (...)"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"[spoiler alert!]of course, of course. All the characters are paper cutouts and you know it all in chapter one. Way too predictable. Though this does have the spin of fat girl gets the cute guy!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"A great hilarious read. Again, Crusie nailed the characters. It's different from the typical romance novels where the heroine has a perfect body. This one is bigger than a size 8, and is funny and warm. The hero is hot. You won't be able to put the book down."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I bought this to read on vacation... it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Of course, it's predictable -- in my opinion, all romances are. You know the girl is going to get the guy (or vice versa) at the end. I enjoyed the chemistry between Min and Cal, although I felt that a drop-dead gorgeous guy going for someone (presumably) so overweight seemed a bit unrealistic. That said, the true lack of realism, in my opinion, were all the family members and friends. David and Cynthie's behavior seemed not only not true to life, but utterly assinine. Ditto the behavior of family and friends in the final chapter before the epilogue at Min's apartment... c'mon! On what planet does THAT happen?! I can just see my dad running over to my apartment just because I'm getting hot and heavy with a man... NOT!!Still, I don't regret the read, especially for a vacation."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I didn't love this and I didn't hate it. Maybe it was the fact that they kept eating the same meal over and over and I just wanted to scream arn't you sick of that yet, maybe its because instead of a dog they had a cat and I don't like cats, maybe it was just that Min was not the best and she complained to much. Min is an overwieght woman who agrees to go on a date with Cal despite knowing, or thinking that he is only dating her for a bet. They can't seem to aoid each other since her best friend and his best friend decide that after meeting each other they have found their soulmate and their other two friends are sort of seeing each other to. The story makes the reader question fairy tales, who we see ourselves as and how that determains what kind of life and the hapiness we'll find."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I know this is a trivial matter, but I've been listening to &quot;Bet on Me&quot; on CD over the past day or so on a long road trip. I find the &quot;Min said,&quot; &quot;Cal said,&quot; &quot;Nannette said,&quot; etc. very distracting. In a conversation between two people, even on an audiobook read by one person, &quot;she&quot; or &quot;he&quot; would suffice. Again, I'm not reading it, and in my head it could be completely different, but this lack of personal pronouns is very choppy and distracting to the story.Otherwise, I'm enjoying it.And I'm a grammar snob. Maybe an abridgement would be helpful for the audio version of Ms. Crusie's books."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book was so ridiculous I couldn't finish it. The bar scenes the pick-up lines the author described were so trite and phony I felt like it must have been a flash-back to Studio 54. I honestly don't think the author has ever experienced the bar/pick-up/dating scene. It felt as though she was writing about what she thought it would be like and certainly not from any personal experience. I found the situations so unbelievable I laughed out loud. Do some research next time, Ms. Cruise because believe me you are way off base here. I gave it one star because I liked the cover. Read The Devil Wears Prada or the Nanny Diaries instead."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book is every overweight girl's fantasy in print. The author must have pitched this book to the publisher as \\"Plump plain girl lands gorgeous successful man - and I have included much product placement for Krispy Kreme donuts (maybe we can get them to pay us for advertising)\\".The plot: gorgeous successful man asks the woman out on a date to win a bet with his friends. This is the only true note in the book, because, in real life yes, a man like that would never (without some sort of financial/social incentive) hit on a plump, plain, frumpily dressed woman in a bar and ask her out.The heroine is unpleasant and snappish, eats half a dozen donuts a day, doesn't exercise, and then blames \\"her genes\\" for that fact that she is not slim. The gorgeous, successful man loves her because, it seemed to me, she is the supportive Mommy that he never had who protects and defends him.The book was filled with contrived family dramas which are supposed to be both amusing and poignant and end up being neither. He meets her parents and it is a disaster. She is invited to dinner at his parents, and she uses the opportunity to lecture them about what bad parents they are to her new boyfriend - this is supposed to show how 'spunky' she is, but just showed what a supremely rude know-it-all she is. At the end of the book, the heroine's parent's freak out on being informed that their 33 year old daughter might be having her boyfriend over to stay the night, and they run over to her apartment to stop her. From what? Being \`ruined'? What is this, Victorian England? Also, everyone falls in love in a matter of days, and the heroine decides that she doesn't want children because she would never lose the pregnancy weight. It was all supremely irritating."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I always thought that people tended to stay in their own social econonmic level? Not in this fantasy! Cal happens to be partner in his own business, recieved a Porche for graduating high school, parents are loaded, get the idea? Min is overweight, Cal is perfect ~ yeah right. The story is Predictable. Pretty much it's dialog between Min and Cal. I purchased this book because of the reviews, which were positive, boy was I wrong."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This could possibly be one of the most poorly written books I've read! I knew it would be fluff before I read it (perfect for an airplane), but this book hit a new low. It is poorly written, with difficult to follow characters and it's boring, boring, BORING. Save yourself a few hours and find another book."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Maybe it's me, but I do not like men who bet, even jokingly, as to whether they'll get a woman in bed. That pretty much blew it for me."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I am a avid reader, but in opening this book, the story is so confusing and you can't keepup with all the changes and down right boring. Worst book I ever bought. I flat coundn't finish it."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I can't believe I even lasted to page 218 before giving up and tossing this book into the recycle bin. It was predictable, unrealistic and painfully boring. I won't be trying another Jennifer Criuse book anytime soon!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I wish I could say I liked this book...then I wouldn't feel so bad about the $$ I paid for it! But in truth, Bet Me by Jennifer Crusie was a real disappointment. The characters felt so one-dimensional, especially Min's mother, who existed as little more than a one-note cliche. A lot of the conversations read more like scripted banter, but one really stuck out to me as not ringing true at all. When Min and Cal were discussing weight and Cal went on and on about how men love to touch soft cushy women and women don't realize this and worry about being thin. He said something like &quot;women get skinny for women, men don't care about that stuff,&quot; and I was just rolling my eyes! Please, that sounded a lot more like the author's FANTASY of what's true, it was totally oversimplified, but more annoyingly, the whole conversation just struck me as fake. Not to mention, Cal is a man in his mid-30s actually betting with the guys about how fast he can get Min in bed. And this is supposed to be the &quot;hero&quot; of this story?? NOT!!! Ugh, I just could not get into these characters or their shallow lives! If you have an ounce of maturity, I would skip this one."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"As such, \\"Bet Me\\" makes occasional leaps from the inane to the bizarre. For example, when the protagonist sees her sister in her wedding dress, she thinks she looks like a \\"sex-crazed princess on heroin.\\"I'm not sure what exactly a sex-crazed princess on heroin would look like, but a bride isn't what comes to mind.The author would do well to rethink the dismissal of Hawthorne et. al. that appears on her website."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Once upon a time...I was surfing the web and stumbled upon jennycrusie.com. When I saw that she had a new novel coming out, I wrote down the date, marked my calendar, tied a string to my finger, etc, etc all so I would remember to rush right out and get it. And I did.Bet Me is an entertaining, enlightening read that takes figure-insecure practical Min Dobbs and gorgeous comittment-phobe Cal Morrissey and puts them in a wacky situation, the kind we've come to expect from Jenny by now. When Min's boyfriend David dumps her before her sister's wedding after she refuses to have sex with him (but who would?), an outraged Min is ready to give up dating and get a cat. Then she stumbles upon Cal, who is avoiding his marriage-seeking ex-girlfriend, the perky and irritating Cynthie. One thing leads to another and Min thinks Cal is trying to get her into bed to win ten dollars, when in reality Cal turned down the bet. After one date, they decide to go their separate ways, but Fate and the fairy tale have other plans.This story is a sexy and hilarious read with wacky characters and outlandish situations, and yet the irrepresible Ms. Crusie can tie them all together. Look for nods toward excellent music, excellent food, loving people and examples of how you can't overcome destiny. I especially loved the fairy-tale-ish happenings, such as losing a shoe and being \\"woken up\\" by a kiss. Bet Me is definitely my new favorite book, one that I read at least every two weeks, and I can't wait for Jenny's next one!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book started out so good! I was interested in the characters and what they'd get themselves into next. The ending was so contrived and silly - I just kept shaking my head in amazement - it was SO BAD!!! There are no adults ANYWHERE who would do what these characters did in the last couple of pages! How can someone write such interesting and funny characters and then pffffffft in the ending?"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book is great! I started it and couldn't put it down til I was finished. I have read all of Jennifer Crusie's books and I found this one to be written in her same funny, sexy style. I especially love her female lead characters, they always seem so real and likeable. This book is a great summer read!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Some may argue about the semantics of novel writing and Crusie's application of them in &quot;Bet Me&quot;, but I just enjoyed her colorful, hilarious characters. She comes through once again with lots of laugh-out-loud moments throughout this book. &quot;Bet Me&quot; definitely leans towards the more light-hearted end of Crusie's collection of novels so far, but there's nothing wrong with that! Crusie is at the top of the game of romantic comedy and REALLY funny dialogue. Another truly enjoyable read. Another Crusie keeper for me!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I loved this book! I read it in an afternoon. I read some of the reviews prior to picking up the book so I was prepared to be disappointed. Crusie has the ability to do humor that few authors have achieved and she came through with this one. I'm a WWII history buff so many of the books I read are pretty heavy. Occasionally I want a light read and Crusie is one of my favorites. Why does she need to &quot;fully develop&quot; all the characters? I don't need an analysis, just a good time and she delivered! Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Jennifer Crusie is the Jane Austen of Contemporary romance. This is her best book ever. It is a rollercoaster ride of fun, romance, humor, and insight.Calvin is a player, who hasn't got any idea of the kind of woman he wants, as a matter of fact, he's pretty sure he doesn't want one for keeps.Min is a today woman, her mother worries about her weight more than she does. She is independent, has close friends, and is not looking for a permenant relationship.This book has a large cast of quirky secondary characters. Every one is a jewel. I laughed so hard I almost fell out of my chair.There is not a boring, slow minute in the book.IF you are looking for an excellent way to spend some time, this is it.I loved every character, and the ending was absolutely GREAT!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS. I cannot belive that every reader on here has not rated it 5 stars! What a FUN book! I LOVED Cal. I thought he was sweet, clever, charming, and [very attractive]...and as for Min...Oh My Gosh...She was a riot! The dialogue was unbelievable! I have never read dialogue like that in my life! It sounded so real it was hard to believe that these were only two made up characters speaking and not real people!Im so sad that its over! I am so excited to have found Jennifer Crusie. I fully intend to hunt down and purchase everything I can find that she has put out there... \\"Bet Me\\" is one book that I will be reading over, and over, and over...A DEFINITE KEEPER."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Jennifer Crusie's \\"Bet Me\\" deals with Min who was dumped by her boyfriend David who made a bet with Cal, (a gorgeous and charming guy who gets any woman he desires) that Cal would not be able to take Min out for dinner and bed her in a month. Cal, however was not interested in the bet but Min overheard bits and pieces of the conversation and she was convinced that Cal was taking the bet. Playing along, she went out with Cal for dinner and soon, Cal seemed to creep into her life. Min was torn between her feelings for Cal and the fact that she thought he was only interested in her because of the bet. In the midst of this, David who was convinced before that Min would not be interested in Cal had second thoughts and tried to win Min back in order not to lose the bet. Then there is Cynthie who was Cal's ex and believed strongly they are destined to be together forever.This book is entertaining and the characters are interesting. Crusie also wrote very well the sexual tension between Min and Cal. However, my only criticism of this book is that, the length of \\"Bet Me\\" is a little long as the entire book deals with the bet and after 200 pages or so, Crusie is still writing about that. I was a little bored and feel that the book could definitely be shortened. Regardless of that, it is still a relatively entertaining chick lit."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"When all your romance novels out there are about your perfect size 8 women it is wonderful to read a humorous love story about a real 'rounded woman'. Crusie doesn't just offer the standard pat romance plot either. Between bets gone bad and overcoming self image problems Cal and Min battle out parents and friends to discover that sometimes 'fairy tales' can come true if your willing to take the risk. I LOVED this book!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Because of all the 5-star reviews, I thought this book would be a fun, romp-y kind of read. In reality, it's one of those \\"throw the book at the wall\\" experiences, except I was reading it on an E-reader, so definitely did not to break that just because I hated this book so much. I don't venture into this realm of \\"chick lit\\" often, but it's a guilty pleasure, so I thought \\"why not?\\" Here are some reasons:- trite writing- annoyingly contrived situations, like the two protagonists (Min and Cal) caught kissing by Min's best friend, Liza, and she hits Cal with her purse. Who does that? This happens 3 times in the book, and is completely ridiculous.- Min sarcastically calls Cal \\"charm boy\\" to his face because she doesn't want to be swayed by his charm. Yup, that is annoying too. Who says that? Where did Crusie even come up with this term, meant as a put-down?- the food references. Just because Min is \\"roundish\\" she's on a diet all the time, and Krispy Kremes seem to ever be in arm's reach. It's tiring that Krispy Kremes become the short-hand for all things sinful. Hearing about someone's dieting is about as entertaining as watching paint dry. Been there, Bridget Jones.- ugly shoes. Min is supposed to have \\"great taste in shoes\\" and Cal notices. Unfortunately, her killer shoes are bedazzled with plastic cherries, floppy flowers, and plastic fish. No guy, no woman would call these 'great shoes.\\"- Cal chides her about being a risk-averse actuary who probably has a plain black cell phone. She in turn thinks that he is one of those guys that needs to have a \\"bell and whistles\\" type of phone. I read that this book was published in 2010, but was written a lot earlier than that, but please, EVERYONE has a smart phone now, and even before that, phones were getting sleeker. Crusie's editor should have red-flagged this point, because it's just a stupid point in the book that makes you question the writer and her lack of inventiveness here.- two-dimensional, annoying parents who are not developed at all- Crusie write a line about \\"her bra was so sheer it was probably illegal in several states.\\" Last I heard, Victoria's Secret does ship to all 50 states, so not sure what this line even means. Lazy writing.- Min is not a very sympathetic character because she distrusts everyone, all the time, but this distrust is meant to endear us (the readers) to her if only she could see clearly how much Cal is in love with her. Blech!- a situation at the end where Min's ex-boyfriend David calls parents, sisters, and best friends and tells them that Cal is seducing their daughter \\"right now\\" and to get over to her apartment, and they all actually do. She is 33 years old. Horribly contrived scene. Cal and MIN are ALWAYS interrupted and are never alone, which is frustrating, because they never get the opportunity to iron our their differences.I gave it two stars, because I like a smattering of the characters: Bonnie, Cal, Shanna and Harry, the least annoying and best drawn of the bunch."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I picked up a book by Jennifer Crusie a few years ago (STRANGE BEDPERSONS) and it was one of those books that made me shrug. It wasn't bad, it wasn't great, and it didn't give me any desire to dig further into her oeuvre. However, last week I was really, really in the mood for something (1) contemporary (2) light and (3) funny, and Jennifer Crusie was the best name I could come up with.This time, I decided to do it right. Jennifer Crusie has written a lot of books so I browsed around for a while, trying to figure out if there was any consensus about which of her books are really BEST. A couple of titles came up repeatedly - this one, BET ME, and WELCOME TO TEMPTATION (spoiler alert: right after I finished BET ME, I picked up WELCOME TO TEMPTATION and loved it too).I won't recap the plot because it's been done elsewhere - Crusie's strengths are pretty well known, she's very funny, she does great dialogue, she keeps things moving along. I think a few other reviewers have noted that BET ME shows us that she can construct a good story, too. BET ME has great stakes, and Crusie tightens the noose mercilessly, ratcheting up the tension.The difference between BET ME and STRANGE BEDPERSONS was night and day for me. STRANGE BEDPERSONS has the same strengths, yes, but not to this degree. BET ME sparkles. It feels effortless, but has real heart. I turned the last page with that happy, warm feeling that the best romance novels give me. It made me believe that Crusie deserves her reputation."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Thirty-something Minerva Dobbs has lost her hope in men, period. Her mother adored her latest ex David, who appeared to be prime husband material. Instead he dumped her at the local bar with the \\"this isn't working\\" line just three weeks before he was to be her date at her sister's wedding. In Min's despairing state, her cynical, beautiful friend Liza and fairy-tale believer pal Bonnie push her to ask out the good-looking and successful Calvin Morrisey. Meanwhile, Cal is betting David that he can get Min to dinner with him. Before she knows it, Min is off to eat with terminal player Cal. Unbeknown to him, Min overheard the bet, and has her claws out farther than usual in a bid to beat the men at their own game. But after a dreadful dinner of Min's man-eater mentality and Cal's affected charm there's no danger of the bet being on; in fact, they both mutually agree never to see one another again. Fate has other plans, however, and coincidental encounters turn into freak meetings where heat and sparks continue to fly and Cal and Min begin to realize that maybe they are meant to be together after all.Boy, am I loving all these pick-me-up reads, Bet Me being one of the best. Several of my blogging friends have been telling me all year to read some Jennifer Crusie, and I'm so glad I finally did, and at the perfect time too. It hasn't been since my last Julie James book that I've had this much fun reading. Feisty Min and heartthrob Cal are a riot. Crusie knows how to write snappy dialogue and fast-paced stories with plenty of encounters between the two love interests. And with just the right balance of lightness versus substance and quirky secondary characters, I was never bored. From Min's frilly shoes and the subtleties of chicken marsala and Krispy Kreme donuts to the chaos theory and the psychological infatuation/commitment theory, Bet Me is thoroughly entertaining. And the scorchingly sexy conclusion? Almost too hot for me but very rewarding. Like the best romantic comedies, Bet Me was hilarious, engrossing, too sweet to resist and the perfect weekend, girl's-night-in read. I will be recommending it left and right to the all the romantics-at-heart I know."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"When her boyfriend David dumps her three weeks before her sister's wedding, Minerva Dobbs mostly feels annoyed. She knew there was a reason she never had sex with the man. In a quirky show of support, her two best friends convince her (goad, really) to take the gorgeous hunk that she sees talking to her ex by the...horns...to show the weasel up. The only problem is when she gets close, slipping in from behind them, she overhears David betting the handsome beast Calvin Morrisey that Cal can't get her into bed within a month!Min's not a thin, hot redhead like her best friend Liza and she's not a petite blonde cutie like her other best friend Bonnie. No, Min's under no illusions. She's chubby, she hates her body, and the only risk she takes with her statistics-minded self is on shoes that express far more personality than her boxy, conservative clothes. She's just been dumped and she's feeling a bit vindictive after hearing about that bet, so when Cal approaches her not five minutes later, she's intent on making him pay a little for being the shallow, callous jerk he is.Cal thinks Minerva Dobbs is the worst date he's ever had, but he doesn't lose bets he makes. He bet that idiot client of his back at the bar that he could take Min to dinner and by God, that's what he's going to do. Sure, he knows David was drunk, and there was no way he'd ever agree to any bet to get a woman into bed, not even for $10,000, but he didn't hold it against him. He'd maneuvered the man and the bet to take the caustic and snippy Min to dinner (woah, when she smiles at his friend Emilio she's like a whole other person...but she's still snippy) and then he'd walk her home (seriously, how come she's so nice to Emilio? Cal knows he's more charming than Emilio but she's not being nice to him), wish her a good life (oh, wow, she's got the sexiest shoes - and toes) and never see her again (despite the fact that the way she eats food is the most erotic thing he's ever seen).Cal and Min couldn't be more wrong for each other. Cal's a superficial hit-and-run player and Min is a practical actuary who spouts statistics about...everything...all the time, hates her body, and thinks happily ever after is a fantasy for suckers. But they keep running into each other. And despite the pummeling his ego takes from Min's caustic wit...and despite the headache from all the eye rolling that Min does to combat charm boy's superficial smarm, a spark is born...and then flames...and then an inferno. The romp is long and riddled with potential disasters, but it's the most fun either Cal and Min will ever have. Bet me.What a light, fun read this was! I'm not saying that just because chicken marsala is my favorite meal of all times, either, though that certainly didn't hurt. After a particularly dark reading experience just prior to this, I went looking for something that would make me smile and warm the chill from the last book. I found Bet Me and couldn't be happier that I did.Full of quirky, funny characters and zany, endearing situations, I quickly fell for Cal and Min, despite their peccadilloes - or maybe because of them. Cal, the darling, starts out like a superficial (but charming) guy who's tired of the dating scene and just wants some peace and quiet in his life after his last girlfriend tried to race him to the alter. Min is sharp as a tack and intelligent, but her body image sucks and she dresses to hide the curves her mother's been nagging about since her childhood. To say I know someone just like Min - and her mother - would be a gross understatement.Together they're an incendiary mix of humor, heat, and frustration and their evolving relationship is adorable, with deeper undertones that start to show themselves as the reasons for their initial character traits start to become apparent. Crusie does a fantastic job of keeping the message light, but there are a few good messages there for women who put too much emphasis on body image for their self esteem.The message stays light, and the book is firmly entrenched on the more humorous side of romance, and I, for one, am very grateful. For a long book, it read very quickly, as the narrative is butter smooth and the dialogue fast, intelligent, and wickedly sharp. There's not a lot to complain about here if you're looking for a nice bit of brain candy.There are one or two aspects that kept my appreciation for Bet Me in the four star range, like the blow up at the wedding that seemed a bit out of character for Cal and Min so it sort of felt like conflict for conflict's sake instead of organic story development. So, too, a big confrontation scene at the end including both sets of parents, which went way beyond ridiculous. Who acts like that? There were a few other issues similar to those, issues that didn't bother me too much as long as I kept my tongue firmly planted in my cheek, but they did prevent me from rating the book higher.That's okay, though. It didn't keep me from downloading a few other titles by Crusie and it won't prevent me from going back and rereading this one. I enjoyed Bet Me. Very much. And it was just the fun, light romance that I desperately needed when I needed it.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I have read Bet Me several times, I have lost count. I have it in hardcover and paperback. And every time I read it, I want to read it all the way through to the end without stopping for anything. This book would definitely be on my desert island list."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This is my favorite Jennifer Cruisie book of all time. The characters of Min and Cal are so relatable, so real, and yet their story is like wish fufillment personified. Who wouldn't identify with Min? A slightly overweight, average-looking woman with a great sense of humor, plenty of intelligence, and many of the same self-esteem issues and fears that every woman faces. And who wouldn't want a man like Cal? Gorgeous, funny, sweet, successful, but not without flaws and self-esteem issues of his own. This book had the trademark Cruisie humor, a low-key but fun plot, and enough sweet, romantic moments to make even a cynic sigh a time or two. Oh, and also, if you're a fan of Krispy Kreme donuts, and have perchance, a time or two, fantasized about oh, bathing in a tub of them or being hand fed them by a gorgeous guy between kisses . . . then you have found the book you've been waiting for all your life. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I listened to this book on CD, and I have to say I really enjoyed it. My library did not have a huge selection of chick lit books on CD, so I picked this one up as a last minute decision.I had tried to read a Jennifer Crusie book before, and I really was not keen. This however was wonderful. I do not know if it was the reader, but she certainly did a great job.I loved the romantic tension between Cal and Minerva. I also liked the fact that Minerva was down to earth, but still had a bit of a girly side to her. Also,all the talk of chicken marsala made me try it. I actually had it twice while I was listening to this book (in a two week period).I will definitely give Ms. Crusie a chance again. I am hoping that I will have another good experience.Pick up Bet Me. I think fans of chick lit will really enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I want to add my straw in the wind to say I love Jennifer Crusie's work and I love this book. Her characters are never perfect but always intelligent and witty Bet Me has several themes running through it all nicely woven into the plot and all of which add to the depth and sparkle of the story. I won't write a plot summary, except to say that this is the story of two sets of three friends, who have very different ideas about how men and women find each other and develop loving relationships. Min and Cal, the main characters, develop a relationship, not just in spite of a major misunderstanding, but in spite of having nothing in common to the point that their out look on life is antithetical. Although one of Min's friends, very professionally successful young woman believes in the fairy tale, there are no Snow Whites or Cinderellas in this book. These are all bright, financially independent women. While the Prince, Cal, is rich, gorgeous and successful he needs to be saved as much as anyone, and still manages to enrich Min's life and not with money.One of the men believes that relationships begin and develop due to chaos theory, including strange attractors. There is even a successful writer of relationship books with her own theory of how things develop between people, which leads to hilarious misunderstandings. Ultimately Min and Cal survive the help of Min's Mother's idea of what makes a woman attractive. Cal's family's idea of what makes a person successful, and their friends help and advice. All for the most part lovingly given.Like all of Jennifer Crusie's books, even the early ones, Bet M is a romances in the truest sense of the word. The world does not fall away from the lovers. Their story is underpinned by characters as vibrant and interesting as the main characters and with affection and loyalty they hinder as much as help the journey and from first meeting to commitment there is always a journey."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"About a year ago, a girlfriend handed me this book and on the shelf it went. Every time I chose a book to read, I looked over it...why did I wait so long? What a fun read!Minerva gets dumped at the beginning of the book (good riddance David, you are an idiot.) Then, when her friends ask her to pick up on Calvin she listens in on a conversation that no girl wants to hear. David, the jerk, bets Calvin the cutie that he cannot get Min to bed in a month. So, when Cal comes to ask Min to dinner, it is a circus at its beginning.Her best friends Liza and Bonnie stick around to find out more about this Calvin and they are sucking up to his buddies to find out the juice.Chaos theory happens.The six become unlikely friends and Minerva and Cal decide to be just friends, even though they keep kissing quite often. Throw in a sister who is getting married, a mother who thinks Min should not eat because she is fat, an adorable nephew of Cal's, his exgirlfriend and even David the jerk and you have a hilariously fun book!Will they do the deed and win Cal the \\"10 dollars?\\" Will he love her and leave her as he has done in the past?

I have read it repeatedly and laugh through the whole story each time."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book, like many of her books was a non-stopper for me. Since I opened the first page I could not put it down. It is hilarious too!The story starts off at a yuppie bar where Minerva Dobbs is being dumped by her bf David. David is dumping her in hopes of giving her an ultimatum to sleep with him (that backfires on him). He dumps her and she goes back to her bff's Bonnie and Lisa who are schoked to learn that David dumped her. Liza (the devils advocate) prompts Min to start looking for a new romantic interest in the bar so she can have a date to her sisters upcoming wedding. After eyeballing the bar Liza spots Calvin (the suit) and prompts Min to make a move on him, or she'll go and get him for her. After Min takes a deep breath and a shot she decided to go pick him up. While she's going up the stairs she over hears a conversation with David and Calvin where they're making a bet that Cal can get Min into bed and outta the bar for X amount of $. She gets really upset and decides to go back to her friends and tell them she doesn't want to pick up Cal.Meanwhile....Dave has just dared Cal to pick up Min. So, he goes and hits on her and the rest you must read!

I must admit, I had trouble putting it down.A story about a gorgeouos serial dater who meets a plain \\"chubby\\" girl and end out out to dinner in part because of a bet. (Lots of bets of various sizes are made throughout this book and I think it works for this story.) As they have mutual friends that are involved, and a mutal love of the same restaurant, they end up seeing more of eachother over time and something starts to happen.They try to resist and you can almost feel the sexual tension in the story. Loved that. It's absolutely believe in spite of the \\"types\\" of people they are as Cruise doesn't a great job writing their story. You find many things about the characters lifes, parents, past relationships and I think that adds to the credibility of the match.Much drama and humor is added to the story with a jealous ex-boyfriend and girlfriend who will stop at nothing to keep them apart. They both have interesting families (mostly not in a good way), a sister's wedding to deal with, a sweet nephew, complimented by a great group of friends. It all adds to the charm.The only issue that I had with this story was the climatic ending. That was a little unreal and not the as romantic as I anticipated due to the amount of tension throughout the book....and I felt there was too much emphasis on Krispy Kremes. Perhaps I just don't get the draw of the donuts."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Loved this book.

Deborah Curran"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I've read my fair share of romance novels over the years, and this is my all-time favorite so far. Min and Cal are well developed. We see who they are and some of what made them that way, which makes them all the more real. The dialogue among all the characters was clever and fun. I laughed out loud a time or two the first time I read it.I don't expect that I'm going to be reading Literature (yes, with a capital L) when I pick up one of these novels, nor should anyone else. I'm looking for a good story I can escape into for a while. Jennifer Crusie delivers, and \\"Bet Me\\" is a guilty pleasure I can turn to again and again."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This is my favorite of all her novels, and I've been reading them for years. Min's internal dialogue, where she tells herself not to say what she's thinking, makes me laugh every time I see it. And the twist that almost keeps Min and Cal apart at the end is perfect... she pushes his buttons and he pushes hers.I enjoy the humor in Jenny Crusie's writing, even when her plots get too convoluted. Her straightforward writing style works for me, too, and her characters are always entertaining.The sex scenes are too graphic for my liking, but I can always skip over them. I know a lot of people who want that sort of stuff."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This is the first Crusie novel I have read and I pretty much got what I expected after reading other reviews on Amazon, but I do think this book is way overrated. Bet Me is a terrific vacation or beach read. I think that the characters were a little too mean for reality and I got really tired of the people telling Minn (and Minn telling herself) that she was overweight and could not eat butter or carbs. If you are looking for a fun little romance to escape from for a while this is your book. If you are looking for reality, depth or a detailed story line keep looking."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I have loved all of her books.. I never enjoyed reading until I someone gave me one of her books!! I am now in love with reading!! Thank you Jennifer Crusie!! You Rock, Just sherrie"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"What I Loved: Minerva Dobbs is a fantastic lead character. She is funny, snippy, real, and just downright screwed up as the rest of us. I laughed a lot reading this book and I even cried at some points. I probably would have done exactly what she did if I was in the same predicament. At 33, perpetually single, she is a good reputation of most single women in her 30s. Calvin was a fantastic leading man. He was stubborn, charming, screwed up, and gets into plenty of situations that put him into hard situations. Those two together are the most fantastic couple I have read in a long time. I love Liza, Tony, Bonnie,Emilio, and Roger they were fantastic friends to Cal/Min. David/Cynthi were great \\"villains\\" and perfect thwarts along the way. The parents will just crack you up and the siblings are a big part of their life too. Everything meshes together really well.What I Liked: Everything! This truly was a great book:)Complaints: None :)Audiobook specific review: The narrator Deanna Hunt did a fantastic job. She did a great job with the book :)Why I gave it a 5: I liked everything about this book. It was such a fantastic read from beginning to end.

The snarky quips kept me up well past my bedtime as I fell in love with the realistically flawed young adults looking for love while they came to terms with their own imperfections.Minerva \\"Min\\" Dobbs decided \\"The world was full of good men. Those days are gone\\" as she daydreamed of stabbing her currently-becoming-ex-boyfriend to death with her plastic swizzle stick for breaking up with her weeks before her sister's wedding. Just to ensure the universe has proved her point, she overhears the same ex a few minutes later bet Calvin Morrissey, hottest guy in the cheesy themed bar, that he can't get into Min's bed within a month. The beasts!Seizing the opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, Min decides to encourage the seduction, ensuring she has a jaw dropping, mother-pleasing escort to the wedding with enough time left over to teach both men a lesson. Calvin's charm and polish crumble under Min's keen observance and ruthless honesty. The two end up developing an unlikely friendship and they find acceptance in each other's eyes for what they dislike most in themselves.Surrounding the unlikely duo are four close friends trying to look out for them, family trying to perfect them, and exes trying to win them back. And oh, a cat named Elvis.Cruise's style is fast-paced and humorous. Her characters find a way to be very human and relatable through their choices, self reflections and brutal honesty with each other. I was amazed at how much depth she was able to create in the characters without dragging the reader through an emotional minefield. The tone was light and upbeat ensuring a constant smile on my face as each character endeared himself to me.When you are ready to curl up with a good book, laugh out loud, and fall in love with new friends, Bet Me by Jennifer Cruise is a sure bet."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I loved this book the writing is wonderful and truly drags you into the story.

I think I always thought the term sounded prententious. Or perhaps I was turned off by the whimsical book covers. However, I picked this book up at a local paperback exchange because Amazon had listed its title in my recommendations. Amazon got it right. I loved this book to pieces.The story of Minerva and Calvin is full of comedy and witty conversation. The character development was great. The characters, both major and minor, were vividly depicted. I really felt that I knew them.The warmth and comedy is reminiscent of Susan Elizabeth Phillips, although Crusie's hero is not as masterful and stubborn as many of Phillips' are. Also, Crusie's heroine is more self-reliant than many of Phillips'.The plot was sweet and fast paced. However, this does not mean that the main plot and its subplots did not recieve the attention they needed. In fact, at the end of the book, I was satisfied that all problems were sufficiently resolved and understood.I recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun read. Do you like to laugh? Do you like books that you can't put down? Do you like heroines who are \\"real\\"? I think you should pick this book up today.

And although I enjoyed \\"Welcome to temptation,\\" I found Crusie's other books to be more of the same. But this one was very good.It was funny,different and enjoyable.I guess I liked it so much because it appealed to me on a personal level since like Min I too have weight issues.And Cal is just the perfect hero.He reminds me of my favorite literary male character - Darcy from Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" although he's not a straight-out stuck-up snob.But I felt that he was - although not blatantly so.It's really romantic how he boosts Min's confidence and stands up for her even though she's not always a pushover.And she does the same for him.That really rings true for me.I can understand why these two characters would fall for each other even though they fight against it - they compliment each other,genuinely care for each other and accept each other just as they are.You can relate to the problems of the main characters and really want them to end up together.The supporting characters are also wonderful and go beyond the usual stereotypical boorish mother and man-hating best friend.I loved Harry and his shoe fetish.Another great thing about this book is how during crucial scenes there are sometimes two conversations going on simultaneously - one serious and one funny.So,one moment you're all solemn and the next line has you cracking up.The only thing I didn't like about this book had to do with the writing.The conversations are staged like this - \\"......\\" he said, \\"........\\" she said, \\"......\\" he said, \\"........\\" she said.Sometimes we don't need references in order to understand who's speaking the line and this makes the story flow more smoothly.I just wish the editor had spotted this.Other than that I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This is the 4th Crusie book I have read, and definitely my favorite so far.

At first the story was witty and the characters so true-to-life. The one liners had me laughing out loud. I loved the heroine and rooted for her all the way. Then suddenly it all went wrong. The one-liners became annoying and the focus of the story went off course. Crusie writes with the sole purpose of creating a life her secondary characters...which boggles my mind. The story was then focused on Min's sister and her wedding. The main characters' relationship was never fully developed and Min went from being lovable to obnoxious. Cal developed into a pathetic guy with a puppy dog mentality of \\"I like big women.\\" The constant, and I do mean constant, references to Min's weight were unnecessary. You loved her from the start for who she was, not what she looked like.Oh, and did I mention the constant advertising for Krispy Kreme donuts? Chicken Marsala? Elvis Costello? Julia Roberts? Did I mention the jokes and the food references getting old? Again and again?And one more thing, the bet was the most confusing plot I've ever read. I've never heard of someone losing a $10,000 bet and chasing after the winner with a check to pay him off. If I had lost that big a bet, I'd change my phone number and stay out of sight."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Well, let me break it down to you the way I felt about the book as I was reading it. The beginning of the book was pretty good. With quick one liners and funny predicaments. I thought the book had real potential at that point, with the scene at the bar and the bet, etc. Then the entire theme dashing hero falls for her plain plump girl really hit you over the head - repeatedly. It isn't that I haven't read previous books about the ugly duckling getting the prince charming. It's just that it wasn't believable in this case. Even romance novel believable. Generally the plain girl isn't told over and over how unattractive she is without the reader still finding some qualities, physical and otherwise, in her that are attractive. Her eyes are gorgeous, her skin is luminous, or her smile lights up the room....she posseses some outstanding qualitiy that makes her worthy of heroine material. She might have have that dynamic personality or an umbeatable sense of confidence that compensates for her lack of beauty. But, in this book, I was constantly reminded of how unlovely this girl was. How lacking in confidence she was. How everyone found her so unattractive. It was hard for me to see why the hero found her attractive. Sure, they had some funny exchanges, but...come on...not enough to carry on a strong romantic attraction.And why as the hero constantly having to reassure her of how beautiful she was? Explain to her how she looked so \\"round\\" and plump and real, and that she was never going to be thin, but that she was beautiful anyway...was he her counselor? I mean, I'm all for a guy pumping up your self esteem, but this guy was took it as a second job, it was so over the top. It made you think that the physical attraction was too manufactured. Just what was it that liked about her?The weight issues in this book were over-emphasized to death. I don't mind reading about it in books, but this book took it to an extreme. It overshadowed talking about anything positive that the heroine had that would make somebody want to be with her.There was no secondary storyline. In Crusie's other novels, there generally is a murder story, an adulterous affair, or a mystery that is being conducted in parallel with the romance. Or rather, the romance develops as a by-product of that mystery. Here, there was absolutely no other subject other than the love affair between the two characters. Therefore, all the emphasis was placed on the romance, and the romance failed to entirely deliver.I'm not against this book. I'm all for satisfying the inner plain jane in every female reader by having the hot stud pick out the less dazzling beauty. But, his getting turned on by her \\"sturdy legs\\" and her admittedly unattractive wardrobe...I just wish the author had made the attraction a bit more convincing, that's all."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book is so lame. I bought the Kindle version out of the rave review and the cheap price, but I couldn't believe I was reading a crap like this. It's full of cliche and unrealistic plots and characters. I love reading romance and enjoy watching romantic comedy movie, so I understand it can sometimes consist some coincidences and events just to add that romantic spice. And I think this book has a good potential to go on a movie if it were not so ridiculous and stupid. The characters are one dimensional and the entire story is surrounded with a silly bet, which is alright if the author can develop more depth on her story. The lines just keep jumping from Cal and Min and their silly friends, with coincidences and trashy comments. I gave it two stars for its sometimes funny lines, but other than that this book is totally waste of time. I would have gone for Sophia Kinsella over this."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I know I am a very small minority here, but I did not like this book. I found the characters to be flat and boring.Min's food fetish was annoying and, I must say, somewhat offensive. Why is it that the character without the perfect body is obsessed with food and has low self esteem? Is it not possible for a chubby woman to have interests that do not involve taste.Other than the job, which was purely background, Min did nt have a whole lot going for her. Did she travel? What kind of books did she read? Did she have any interests at all? I think her friend was right in saying that she brought nothing to the relationship with Cal.Cal was o.k., though he suffered a similar lack of character development. We know that he is gorgeous and likes to hit and run, but what else has he got?The writer did not show enough of either character to get me truly invested.I do not regret reading this book, but it was my first and last by this author."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book is everything you expect from Jennifer crusie and more. This book was full of hilarious dialogues and characters. Every character is weird in their own way and real too. The important thing is that nobody is normal and that's the fun part because what's the fun in being normal?Cal and Min were great together. All their confortations from starting were full of witty dialogues and sexual tension. Both of their families were horrible. Min always used to ask her mother 'who are you and what did you do to my mother?' she was convinced her mother was really her step mother because her mother would never let her eat anything good. When she met Cal's family she thanked God for her own family because although her mother was interfering and dominating type but at least she wasn't as cold and heartless like Cal's.This Hilarious tale is full of Elvis's songs, Krispy kreme doughnuts, funky stylish shoes,a single intelligent cat, chicken marsala, a lovesick psyciatrist who kept analysisng everyone and Cal was her favourite subject,a fairy tale beleiving best friend and another protective fairy godmother of Min, a sister who is more excited about her wedding than about the man she is going to marry,a mother for whom food was enemy.I loved this story. it was hard for me to put it down before it was finished. Cal was Great and Min was sweet, inspite of her man hating attitude, but you can't really blame her after what she witnessed two men trying to do to her for a bet.Go for this one definately if you are Jennifer Crusie's fan and even if you are not and you would be one, if you like funny romances."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I thought this was an excellent book.

I know not every woman needs kids to be happy, but I just can't help it, I like my novels to end that way.Other than that very tiny preference, I loved this book.

Furious, Min decides to use Cal for a month because she now needs a date for her sister's wedding. When Cal introduces himself and asks her out to dinner, she accepts. During dinner she realizes that she may not be able to hold out against this handsome man and decides to scrap her plan but fate will continue to throw these two together.I read another book by this author entitled \\"Welcome To Temptation\\" and I did not like it. I will always give an author another try so when I read the first chapter of \\"Bet Me\\", I thought I was in for a good read. Well, halfway through I was again bored with these quirky characters. I am not a sourpuss or a prude and I love \\"Sex In The City\\" but all these characters really needed to get a life. Min is voluptuous and is constantly bemoaning her weight. Min's mother constantly reminds her about her weight. Cal is a hit and run lover who cannot commit to a woman. One friend, Bonnie is living in a fairy tale world. Min's sister, Diana, is not a happy bride. Min's mother is a pain in the butt. Cal's mother is a self-centered witch. And we hear the same things over and over and over.

There were no quirky, funny secondary characters in this book like there had been in her others. All of the characters were lacking depth and fire. Even Jennifers' usual great dialogue was flat. From the moment the book started, you knew the ending, but there were never any curveballs thrown in along the way. And 3/4 of my way through the book, I still didn't feel any real chemistry between Min and Cal. Min is described as everything from being full figured to fat, but Cal seduces her with food every step of the way and uses Krispy Kreme donuts to tease her. What is sexy about that? I wanted to scream at her \\"Run for your life - you will die of a coronary before your 40th birthday if you stay with the guy!\\" If you want to read a fun Jennifer Crusie book - buy Welcome to Temptation or Faking It instead!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Wow, is this bad!

I found the story pretty far-fetched and the characters all sounded like the same person. All the voices seemed like slight variations of the main character. As long as the author was just writing story, it was an okay read, but as soon as the dialogue started, I really had to struggle to keep reading.It also probably doesn't help that I'm a statistician and the main character is an actuary who uses \\"statistical terminology\\" in her everyday conversations. I'm pretty sure the author did not study statistics, because this is how I imagine a non-statistician thinks statisticians speak, but the terminology was all wrong. But this is a point that probably won't bother most readers of this book.The number of times Krispy Kremes and chicken marsala are mentioned were irritating. Can't the characters eat anything else? This took place over a four week period and how many times did Min have chicken marsala? It had to be 2-3 times a week!I also found the shoe references pretty awful. When I think of a cool impractical shoe, I think of 4-inch Manolos, not clear plastic mules with molded cherries.I really found it hard to believe the author was a New York Times bestselling author, but I guess romance books are read more for the fantasy than as great literature. In truth, my idea of fantasy is more Sex and the City than this. This seemed more like a very weak Bridget Jones imitation."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I had never read this author before, just knew she was popular and I wanted a light read -- picked it up at the library. I could not get past the middle of the book, and that was a struggle to reach. The book was just extremely boring, full of tiresome cliches and unlikeable characters. The main character is thoroughly repellent and not admirable in any way. There is no motivation whatsoever for the male character to be interested in her. This is typical fairytale bad romantic (ie \\"date movie\\") garbage where some very unpleasant woman is pursued by some guy who loves her anyway and they all live happily ever after. This is not decent character development or writing. I don't know how the author got a job at a university, but I imagine she is laughing all the way to the bank by the money she gets from these formulaic novels with low standards. The \\"snappy dialogue\\" is typical of current poor-quality TV sitcoms, and is not how people in real life ever talk. This is just a book of one-liners and dislikable characters, and the author should go write for TV shows."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Although I am enjoying this story, the transcription errors that riddle this ebook version are driving me crazy. &#34;I'm&#34; routinely comes through as &#34;F'm&#34; or &#34;T'm&#34;.

But live takes a quick downturn when she overhears her ex-boyfriend and some of his friends betting on whether one of them can get her to bed in thirty days. On the other hand, Cal Morrisey is a hunk. If she can string him along, she'll have that date to the wedding. It's a plan, except that Min's emotions tend to get in the way. David was a sleaze, but Cal is close to the real fairy tale prince. And Min can't afford to have her heart broken again.She may think she's fat, but Cal thinks Min is about perfect. If she'd only wear clothes that show off her figure rather than hide it. He turns on the charm not to win the bet because he wouldn't really bet on getting a woman into bed, but because he's attracted and ready to move on with his life. But Cal has his own issues and he's not sure he can deal with a woman who's always rejecting him, who likes Elvis Presley, or who keeps asking him strange questions about secrets. Still, fate seems to have plans of its own and Cal and Min can't seem to stay apart even when they try. Of course, things get serious when Min's ex-boyfriend and Cal's ex-girlfriend gang up to break up the new couple.Author Jennifer Crusie creates a fresh and contemporary telling of the cinderella myth. Although the shoes are no longer glass slippers but [attractive] fruit-enhanced pumps, and the wicked stepsisters are transformed into ex's, it's still the classic fairy tale--but told with Crusie humor and insights into the human condition. Min's insecurities about her weight, her issues with her mother, and her fears about her future all ring true. And it's refreshing to see a romance heroine who doesn't think that instant pregnancy is a great thing.(...)"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book was hilarious from start to finish.

It was everything a fun-filled ride should be: light hearted, witty, honest, and romantic. The character of Min was realistically crafted, and a true woman.

It was perfect for the reader who requires her story be tied up in a neat little package with a perfect bow.Size-wise Min is very voluptuous, like an old 50s pinup and then some.

In this story, a young woman is discouraged by the dating scene, after being dumped by a boyfriend for not having sex with him throughout their entire relationship. She then meets the most gorgeous man ever, Cal Morrissey, soon after that breakup. Their relationship grows through a series of bets, which puts Cal deeper and deeper into trouble with Minerva Dobbs, the young woman in question.Cal and Min meet in the worst possible way - through a bet. But as they get to know each other as friends, the two fall in love, but refuse to admit it to each other. As their friends watch with amusement the charade that Cal and Min go through, pretending they are only friends and that they cannot stand each other, Cal and Min slowly realize that they can't live without each other. But as their ex's try their best to keep the two apart, Cal and Min's best friends try to decide whether the two belong to each other.The book is told in the typical style that \\"chick lit\\" is famous for, with a humorous tone and a lot of comic relief. While I found this book to have gone on a little too long, I still enjoyed it and do recommend it to others who delight in reading books in this genre. It's a fast read and although not the perfect book, I think readers will enjoy getting to know Minerva Dobbs and maybe even relating to her, as Min tries to find that perfect fairy tale romance and happy ending that all of us hope to find in our own lives."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Min Dobbs is a thirtysomething actuary who believes fairy tales are for other people.

Cal has his own challenges in life, though, one of which is David the creep, who also is one of Cal's firm's clients. David attempts to get Cal to bet him he won't get Min into bed with him in 30 days.

She had to learn how to stand up to her mom and embrace her true self. Cal taught her to love herself again. He wouldn't put up with any excuses.The storyline and characters were very real. I loved seeing them change and grow. Min does a complete 360 by the end of the story. It was not easy work. Moms always think that they know best and Min's mom was no exception. The mother's goals for her daughter only hindered her true growth and change. Min had to deal learn what she needed for self was not necessarily what her mom wanted but she had to be gentle with her mom at first.This book made me laugh, cry, and was very difficult to put down. Jennifer Cruise's writing style is easy to follow as well as enjoyable to read. She really lets you feel what the characters feel. Another thing I really liked was that the characters were not perfect. They made mistakes and the emotions ran from joyous to fuming anger. It was not uncommon to have two characters going thorough the spectrum of emotions at the same time.I highly recommend this book to hopeless romantics or anyone who likes a real romance novel. Every thing that happened felt right and never was rushed or out of place. It was a good rainy day; snuggle under the covers, and leaving you warm and fuzzy type book.Reviewed by KristaFor BBW Reviews"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This is the first Jennifer Crusie book I've read, and it will definately NOT be the last. I could not put this book down. Not only were the characters on a whole, witty, well-written, and real, but the star of the show for once is not a little bitty perfect woman with \\"slim hips and a narrow waist\\". Min Dobbs is built like a real woman -- she is not a toothpick -- and through the book both she and others recognize her beauty.Cal Morrisey is every woman's dream guy and the chemistry created between he and Min is electric. The interactions between the two had me laughing out loud. This book is a must read for anyone who has ever played the dating game. It will make you believe in true love and fairy tales all over again."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Jennifer Crusie is a master at creating believable and fully developed characters. If that's all she had to rely on, her books would still be good. Add snappy dialogue to the list and you're in for a good read.Minerva Dobbs is not what we've come to expect from Chick Lit heroines. She's round and soft (pudgy if you have to label) and she's been dumped by her boyfriend of three months, just weeks before her sister's wedding. All because she won't sleep with him.When Min overhears her ex make a bet with another man that he can't get her into bed in a month, she's livid. Her actuary brains cools down as she looks at all sides of this. She needs a date for her sister's wedding in three weeks. She has no intention of sleeping with this guy, and just to punish him, she can string him along for 3 weeks and dump him.What she doesn't count on is that gorgeous Calvin Morrisey has so many hidden layers. She tries to resist her attraction to him and remember that bet. The fact that Cal has a bad habit of making side bets on her throughout the book doesn't make it too hard for Min to stay focused--until Cal short circuits her with his kisses.Cal's certainly not interested in getting involved with anyone, and even though he continues to remind Min's ex that he did not make a bet to sleep with Min, no one will believe him.Lots of fun, silliness, smooching, denial, secrets, and eventually, yes, sex and love ever after. The story has its flaws, but who cares when Crusie gives us an irreverent look at how the universe can maim us if we don't pay attention to love."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I had read a lot of good reviews about this book, so I had high hopes for it. Now I am halfway through it, and don't know if I can force myself to read the rest. It is so BORING. They do and say the same thing almost every page. Minerva (wth is up with that name? I know they explain it, but still...) and Cal somehow keep winding up together, even though they say they'll never see each other again. Then all they do is eat and Cal thinks about how sexy Min looks when she eats. Yeah. And Min is bitchy to Cal, but he doesn't seem to mind. Then there are the ridiculous characters of David and Cynthie, who are plotting to break them up. The obvious \\"evil doers\\" to create problems for them, I guess. One of the worst scenes in the book is when Cal and Min are on a picnic, and every time Min opens her mouth to speak, Cal shoves a piece of doughnut in her mouth. I don't know if that was supposed to be sexy or funny, but it just grossed me out, and I would be pissed if someone did that to me. I gave this book 2 stars because some of the one liners were almost funny, mostly with Minerva's mother and sister. In conclusion, do not buy this book unless you like reading the same thing over and over."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Minerva Dobbs has self-image issues, which is not shocking considering the grief her mother gives her over every carb she puts in her mouth. Min's a sensible girl with cheeky taste in shoes, and she's met her match in Cal Morrisey, who's hot enough to melt the cherries on her shoes.After being dumped, Min's in a man-hating state of mind the night she overhears her ex bet Cal that Cal won't be able to get \\"frigid\\" chubby Min into bed within a month, and is too furious to hang around and listen to the outcome. So when Cal approaches her a few minutes later, she can only assume the worst.Horrible families, ten-dollar bets, and over-protective friends aren't enough to fight the fates that seem to want Cal and Min together. Bet Me is a wonderfully light and enjoyable read. If I had a rating system, this one would get top marks!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This was the first romance novel I've read in quite a while, and I'm glad I did. As a former Ohioan, the first thing that caught my interest was the setting (Cruisie doesn't specify where, but my guess would be Cincinnati).But the things that kept me reading were the interactions of the characters. I liked it that Cal and Min both had friends and families. I liked the dialogue. I liked the changes of viewpoint (particularly Cal's--I've never read a romance novel before that let a reader into the hero's head).But I especially liked the fact that the main characters are not perfect.Cal has problems and buttons, but he's learned to deal, and he's a nice guy (!).Min's a heroine that an average reader could possibly identify with. She's not beautiful, but the hero thinks she is. And by not getting specific about numbers, Cruisie allows the reader to sympathize with Min, whether she's a size 20 or a size 12 (trying to squeeze into a size 2 world).I also think this would make a fun TV movie."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I am hitting myself for passing up this book many times. The shoes put me off from buying this. Don't MISS this book. I read it twice in one night. I love Min she's the sister or best friend I wish I had. The perfect book where you need an instant pick me up. I want more."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Judging by the cover of \\"Bet Me,\\" a silly looking pair of shoes, a chick-lit connoisseur could be excused for dismissing the book as another \\"Sex in the City\\" ripoff. But don't be fooled-this is one of the better books the genre has produced, and owes nothing to half-baked efforts that focus on rich beauties in the big city. Jennifer Crusie has a real knack for dialogue and plotting, and the heroine comes to life as far from perfect but without too many phony \\"quirks.\\" The ending especially is a cut above, sticking to the characters' flaws and principles without too much sugar-coating. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I'm a fan of contemporary fiction and not usually a romance reader...but now I'm happy I got the audio version of this book on a whim. I was so pleasantly surprised, I'm hooked on Jennifer Crusie stories now!The main characters in \\"Bet Me\\" are interesting and flawed - I especially like that the heroine struggles with insecurites about her appearance (like most real-life women) and isn't necessarily an effortless knockout like so many women in romances. Also, the storyline is not completely stereotypical - I was guessing until the end about how some of the threads would tie together. The supporting characters are interesting and entertaining, as well.My only criticism is about the constant \\"he said\\" and \\"she said\\" at the end of each line of dialogue - but maybe this was only present in the audio version for clarity. It did seem repetitious and unimaginative. Even a few \\"she replied\\" or \\"he asked\\" might have helped break the monotony. Even so, this was only a minor distraction, in my opinion. The story was so much fun and the characters so engaging that I still give the book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I digested this book in two days. I couldn't put it down. The dialogue was delightful, very funny and witty.Cal is a wonderful character. I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read Jennifer Crusie's other books. The secondary characters were also funny.This book is a real modern day fairy tale and I loved every minute of it. Jennifer Crusie's voice is here to stay. Also recommended are \\"Don't Call That Man\\", and \\"He Never Called Again.\\""},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I picked up this book, thinking it sounded pretty interesting, and wanting something light after all the thrillers I've been reading. This book did not disappoint! I could not put this book down! I was up until 2am reading!The characters were fun (although Crusie did not get into her sub characters stories - and that would have been good), hilarious and I loved that Cal was so into Min. I thought he was a true romantic. He made her feel gorgeous and sexy and what woman doesn't want that?If you are looking for something fun, light and with a little romance, BET ME is a book for you!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Great read - I stayed up until 3 so I could finish in one setting. Wonderful main characters that were so real and genuine they felt like a breath of fresh air in the world of 'cookie cutter' hero/ines. The author did a wonderful job of matching up this odd-ball pair with sly witt and laugh-out-loud humor. The secondary characters were intersting and multi-demensional, people you actually wanted to read about versus filler material. Crusie wrapped it all up with her killer writting style and so fun one liners i.e. &quot;Min's father met them in the hall, a lumbering man with a shock of blond hair and heavy white eyebrows who should have been hearty and welcoming but instead had the vaguely paranoid look of a sheepdog whose sheep were plotting against him.&quot;The reason I rated this a 4 is that the main character Min was overweight and could not be comfortable with herself (until the latter part of the book). Her boyfriend, Cal, was understanding, supportive, and completely comfortable with her size but she wasn't. As a result I felt uncomfortable for her through the majority of the book. I realize that the character was 'in process' and her outlook had changed dramatically by the end still this is why a 4 not a 5. Give me a chubby character who is comfortable in their identity and secure with their self image and you get a 5!This was my first of Crusie and it will not be my last, I plan on getting the rest of them and hoping that they all will be as fun, intersting, and entertaining as 'Bet Me' Worth your time and money!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book was wonderful. From start to finish, I was entertained and laughing all the way through. I fell in love with Min and Cal from the start. Min's story is a wonderful message to any woman who thinks they can't find a good man because they don't have the perfect body. Min and Cal's first kiss is probably one of my all time favorite love scenes. The ending of this book is absolutely hysterical and had me laughing out loud. (Not going to spoil it for those who havne't read the book) Anyone who regularly reads Jennifer Crusie's books will definately rate this one a 5. The only thing that I thought wasn't really necessary in the story was in the end where we find out what happens to everyone in the future. That was fun to read but the ending itself was good enough :-) Thanks for reading."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I loved this book! It was funny and sweet and hot! I could not put it down! Cal and Min were so cute, determined not to be attracted to each other and constantly assuring the other that they weren't!A definite keeper!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"There hasn't been a bad Jennifer Crusie book. I appreciated the humor and the people. After all, life is full of all those people she introduced us to. Carbs, weight, appearance, diets, clothes. These are all topics of multimillion dollar industries. To have a man say, curves are good. Women lose weight for each other. To have a male give the encouragement for a woman to say, 'I am beautiful' is a rare and wonderful thing. To do so with humor, great shoes and an ensemble of good freinds is a delight. Too bad we don't have fresh Krispy Kreme where we live."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This woman has never let me down...Her writing is always hilarious and tightly plotted, and the characters are always quirky and loveable. And to correct a glaring mistake made in some readers' comments on this book: CAL DID NOT MAKE THE BET. Minn's scum of an ex-boyfriend did. To everyone else: Buy the book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"If you're going to read a new author THIS is the one! Absolutely the best book I have read in months! I hope all her others are as good, because my book budget is toast!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book was the only book i have ever laughed at out loud. It si funny, with a romantic twist to it. Minerva Dobbs believes in fairy tales, at least she used to until her boyfriend dumps her after two weeks, one week before she was supposed to habe him as her date to her sisters wedding. Min and her friends are in their thirtys but they still like to have fun flirtying with guys at bars. She then searches for a guy about the bar and fortunantly, finds one. She finds a guy that is drop dead georgous, but his friends bet him to take her out for dinner. The bet gets a little over hand, but it all turns out in for the best. Minerva has some curves, and so its not as easy for her to find a date. She finds out later that it was a bet, but decides to play along. This book is all about fate and how it comes up in the most unexpected ways. I recommed it allllllll the way!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book has all the element's of JC's books that we've come to love and expect, only it was better for me in one way - the main characters didn't jump into bed immediately. That said, the book is so full of sexual tension it crackles! I love that these characters take time to fall in love the old fashioned way - through talking and getting to know each other - while playing around the fringes of sex enough that they drive themselves nuts. In my opinion, this is the best Crusie book yet, hands down!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I've had this book on my bookshelf for months only because I saw it sitting on the shelf at a book store and thought the cover looked cute and the story sounded all right. I finally decided to read it because when I'm on my lunch break I don't really have anything to do so I pick up a book. Let me tell ya, I couldn't only read it for 15 minutes a day. I had to take it home and I couldn't put it down! I finished reading it yesterday and I already want to read it again. And I'm looking up her other books so I can figure out which one I want to buy next. Great book, highly recommended. I hope all her other books are this good!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I don't usually go for the romance type books but I thought I'd take a chance on this one. I was glad I did. I enjoyed the characters and their stories. It was a good read, sweet, funny, thoroughly enjoyable. I put this up with Good in Bed and In Her Shoes by J. Wiener- witty dialog, good one-liners,characters you can relate to. I will definitely be picking up other books written by this author."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Minerva and Cal. Bets. Love in the air. Friction erupts. Hilarious writing. Need I say more? Get this one! It's a winner."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Jennifer Crusie is always a &quot;sure bet.&quot; I know I'm going to be satisfactorily entertained by her book, whether or not it becomes my favorite. BET ME did that, though it's not destined to be a favorite. The entire time I was reading it, I kept seeing scenes from a made-for-TV-movie scrolling through my head. As one other reader said, any other author would have gotten 5 stars. But I've read ALL of Crusie's other books and know that this is not her best. Is it good? Oh yes. Did I laugh out loud? Several times. Did I feel the heat? Quite nicely. There are so many good things to say about it, and I liked all the characters I was supposed to like, and disliked the undeserving, and being on Atkins myself, commiserated with Min about the carbs (though I kept saying EAT THE BUTTER, IT'S OKAY!)I just couldn't quite get over the feeling it was written to be a TV movie instead of a book. I hope it does come out on film. Kate Winslett would be great as Min. Nothing will deter me from eagerly awaiting Ms Crusie's next book, however. She is consistently entertaining, and one of the best authors in today's market. BET ME is a good book that I enjoyed thoroughly, though it did not take me away like her others have done. No one can do that quite like Crusie."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I am an avid reader. I read at least one novel per week, usually romance. My favorites are Nora Roberts, Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Janet Evanovich, etc. I have read Jennifer Cruise in the past and thought the books were cute reads. When I read this book, I laughed out loud. I loved the characters, they were so real and the dialogue and thoughts were exactly right. This really is a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Bet Me is a fun book--great main and secondary characters (Min being round and plump was great!) and great banter.What distracted me from the book was the number of props and lines in the book that have appeared in Crusie's other books--Dove Bars, ragged orphan animals and reference to rum and Cokes as wimpy drinks, to note a few. It got to the point I was looking for them, and I found I was getting more and more disappointed when I would find them.Crusie writes well and the bantering is fantastic, but the lack of freshness did the book no favor."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"She's done it again. If there's anything to believe in, it's Jennifer Crusie. Her witty dialogue keeps the story rolling, and there's no way you can get bored. She kept me laughing for all 384 pages, and made me believe in fairy tales again. You can't go wrong by reading Bet Me."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I, like a few others, was a little underwhelmed with &quot;Faking It.&quot; Nevertheless, I decided to give &quot;Bet Me&quot; a try. I liked the two primary characters and their quick repartee and the building &quot;tension&quot; between the two. The early description of the cat had me chuckling and awakened my dog out of her sweet slumber. I finished the book last night and thought to myself, &quot;that was a sweet story&quot; maybe because I too, am in search of my own fairy tale. That's by two cents worth."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I got this book because I read Jennifer Crusie's novel \\"Faking It\\", which I found to be quite excellent. I was hoping this one would be as good, but this is more on par with the other popular female writers (which I thought Crusie had surpassed with Faking It). The story is completely and utterly predictable, even though it's completely unrealistic. The characters of Cynthie and David are absolutely insane, while Cal and Min are pretty predictable. I did enjoy the inital dialogue between Cal and Min, especially when she was giving him a hard time. But the story very quickly devolved. I found the ending to be completely contrived and just over the top, in a bad-sitcom sort of way. Crusie, you can do so much better than this!That said, Crusie is still a good writer, and the book was enjoyable. I highly recommend her novels Faking It and Welcome To Temptation."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I like this Jennifer Crusie book. Her main characters weren't perfect and yet still found their prince charmings. I felt that she did a good job connecting Min's weight issues to the insecurities in all of us. I was sick of Chicken Marsala by the end of the book. I agree with other write-ups that this book was not her very best. From the inside cover, I got the feeling that it wasn't Ms. Crusie's favorite either. Even still, she never dissappoints me. She is an outstanding writer."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Generally speaking, I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Crusie's books. That being said, I was a bit disappointed in her latest work. While the references to Krispy Kreme doughnuts were funny (to a point), it seems as though Min would have straightened her mother out a long time ago regarding her food choices and her weight. I also agree with some of the other reviews that this isn't Crusie's best ensemble character development.Fun to read, but not as much fun as it could have been. Let's hope she goes back to her previous self in future novels."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Are they kidding? A bestseller? I don't get it.The dialog made it almost tedious to read this book. The characters seemed to have the same conversations over and over (just in different scenes). I got a little bored and frustrated about half-way through, ready for the characters to get together already, realizing that there were, like, another 200 pages of the same lame thing. But I had to forge ahead and finish to see if there was some moment of greatness so the book could redeem itself. It did not.It's not a bad book, and it kept me entertained for a few days at the beach, but I can't see it as anything more."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Jennifer Cruisie is a fantastic writer - her writing is fresh, not cliched and clever - when hy did I have to drag myself through this book one painful page after another? I've decided it's because I'm way to old to be reading this genre - for those who love chick lit with cute repartee, you'll love it! She's a fantastic writer - just not for someone like me who loves gritty angst-filled stories with deep characterizations. Now if only I could write those sorts of stories myself! I'm getting there!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book was a fun little romp, even though it offers no truly exciting plot or heart tugging emotion. It is the witty dialogue that keeps you reading. The hot love scene happens nearly at the end of the book, so you will need to have patience here."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I have to admit, I was hesitant to buy this one in hardcover. I did not care for her last book, Faking It. But boy was I glad I took the chance after finishing this one! The romance between Cal and Min reminds me of the characters in Fast Women (love the Glenlivet) and Welcome To Temptation. Cal, Min and friends are really well-developed and you find yourself immersed in their world within 30 pages. This book was a one-nighter. I loved it. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This was my first Jennifer Cruise novel and selected because of the large number of positive reviews. Writing was smooth but I didn't really enjoy the storyline. Fat girl gets hot-hunky guy who enjoys watching her eat?? I consider myself a 'fat' girl (I'm about 40# overweight) and I wouldn't consider dating a guy who was smaller than me or kept offering me doughnuts!! The heroine tried on the hero's shirt and couldn't even button it because it was too small on her.I enjoy other author's 'fat' girl romances, such as 'Wishes' by Jude D. and 'Night Play' by Sherrilyn K. because the heros were BIG hot hunky guys and weren't determined to watch the heroine eat. I plan to try to another of Ms. Cruize books and hope for the best."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"According to the author's website, this was an old unsold manuscript that was rewritten and updated, a la Dean Koontz. Although it is a fun book, it feels like an early effort, not up to the standards of Faking It or Fast Women. Wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Excellent reading - an enjoyable story - it will bring a smile to your face. The music on the discs is perfect for the tale."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"3.7 stars I enjoyed this romantic twisted knot of a tale. The women had strong independent roles and were intelligent. I've had enough of the poor dumb women clich&eacute;s'. It was filled with quick snarky lines and tender sweet moments. Yes there was a'bad' buy and although he wasn't stupid he was an idiot and very believable idiot.Now about the story, I don't really need to tell you anything about it. It's a contemporary romance, there is a cat, a handsome man, a woman,one witch of a woman, the evil man, some friends, two crazy nut-o families and some really good Italian food. If you're looking for fun, light romantic comedy with a HEA this is a good book for you."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Light hearted read. Enjoyed it and will read some more of her books. Have already ordered a couple more. Lots of funny situations"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"The skeptical person that I happen to be was the draw to this book. While the summary leaves plenty of room for speculation, I kept an open mind to how this book played out and I am I pleased to say that this book is a sure thing for enjoyment.Min and Cal are probably the most sincere characters I have ever read. They did everything that they could do to avoid falling in love, but with them.... love was something to be reckoned with. The admiration that these two had for one another regardless of how everyone in their path tried to destroy them really touched me. Min's opinions about her embarrassment over her weight rang so true to how I feel about myself. Cal's thoughts that weight is never an issue... it is the person inside that matters gave me hope. Regardless of the fact that this book is a fictional story, it was a feel good story to all that read it. While their first meeting was unconventional with having a bet be the catalyst for their connection, it was the journey that they took to getting their fairy tale ending that made reading this all worth while.This is just one of many books I have read of Ms. Crusie's and ranks number one on my list of enjoyable books to read. Of course, I also loved \\"Anyone but you\\" by her also. So if you are up for a feel good story.... you definitely need to read this book. I highly recommend it!! Then, of course, you need to read \\"Anyone but you\\", too."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This was the first book I have read by Jennifer Crusie, and the title of my review pretty much says everything you need to know about it - it's a fun, light, sexy chicklit/romantic comedy novel. Minerva Dobbs ('Min') is a sharp-tongued actuary with a shoe festish and an overbearing mother who wants her to be a size 6 instead of a size 12. Calvin Morrisey is an entrepreneur with a reputation as a 'love them and leave them' ladies' man. Both have witty and loyal friends, and cross paths after recent breakups in their lives at a local bar. They initially go out as part of a bet, and betting is a running theme throughout the book. Crusie pokes fun at relationship self-help through the character of Cynthie, Cal's ex, a relationship expert and wanna-be author who wants him back.This book is distinguished by the witty dialogue, which is pretty contrived - a bit like watching a television sitcom aka 'Friends' - but entertaining and lighthearted. If you are looking for a good, fun escapist romantic read, this is for you. If you want depth or realism, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"omg.......this has been one of my favourites for years! minnie is like a real life person filled with insecurities....a heroine i can relate with......an absolute must have"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I love picking up a Crusie book because I never know what to expect. Her stories are entertaining and always a world apart from other writers'. Bet Me is one of my favorite books, one I've read at least three times. It's funny and romantic and just an overall great read! I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I think of my favorite romance novels as some of my best friends. I save them and bring them out when I need comforting or something familiar. Bet Me is one of those for me. I cannot even say how many times I've re-read it. At least 5, maybe more like 10. To me, it's just that good.There's a reason Bet Me was voted #1 (out of 1,231!) by Goodreads voters in the list of \\"Best Ever Contemporary Romance Books\\". It really has it all. Great (yet flawed) romantic leads, wonderfully delightful supporting cast of characters, humor, food... It could use a bit less conflict and bit more sex, but the lack of sex is sort of the point to the book (and when we finally do get to it, it's pretty damn good) so we'll give it a pass on that one. Cal and Min play off each other so well, in what could be a frustrating game of cat and mouse, but Crusie writes it with such ease and humor, it just seems right. And the depth she gives to the characters personalities made me feel like I was part of their group of friends and knew each and every one of them. Details like Min's \\"couples-only\\" snow globe collection and Elvis obsession to Cal's dyslexia and hatred of baseball coaching (which he does anyway). I was sad to finish Bet Me because I felt like I was saying goodbye to friends I had come to love. But, I guess that's the good thing about books - when I miss those friends, I just dust my copy off and get to know them all over again."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I thought this book was so juicy and good.

I can't say enough about this book or this author!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This is the first book I've read by Jennifer Cruise. I liked parts of the book, but other parts of it drove me crazy. There was some good dialogue, but the word said was over used. There were good parts and interaction between the characters, but there were a lot of long and drawn out scenes that slowed down the book. Several times during the book Cruise could have ended it, but it kept going. The frequency of betting was getting old also. I liked the relationship between Cal and Min, and thought Bonnie was amusing. David was a chump and towards the end I couldn't stand him or Cynthia. Pretty early on, almost from the beginning, the ending was predictable. I liked the ending, but actions by the family members didn't seem realistic. Overall it was all right, but would have been better if it had been shorter and quicker paced."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I love Jennifer Crusie's audio books. I think her humor really comes through. I listen to her books while I'm on the treadmill and I find myself laughing outloud. I have a hard time turning the tape off because the stories are so good. I can honestly recommend this one (Bet me), Welcome to Temptation and Fast Women."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Looking over the reviews, \\"Bet Me\\" seems to be a book that you either love or hate. Personally, I thought that parts of the book were worthy of *10 stars*, but I *love* romantic fiction and am not looking for realism in a book like this one. Jennifer Crusie is *excellent* at adapting the fairy tale into a contemporary romance. I loved the characters of Minerva and Calvin--an insecure, chubby Cinderella with a sharp wit and her gorgeous, commitment-phobic Prince Charming.Minerva Dobbs has just been dumped in the middle of a theme bar by her handsome boyfriend of 3 months because she will not sleep with him. She is more upset about losing her date to her sister's upcoming wedding than losing David (the boyfriend), but she is feeling pretty down on herself and on men in general. Her friends try to distract her with a gorgeous guy (Calvin Morrisey) standing across the bar from her, talking to David. When her friends goad her into approaching the hunk, Minerva overhears David betting Calvin that he cannot get her to sleep with him in the next month. Minerva thinks that she has heard Cal agree to the bet and starts fuming. When Calvin approaches her to ask her to dinner, an angry Minerva agrees, thinking that she will string him along until after her sister's wedding and then dump him. Cal cannot understand why all his legendary charm falls flat with a very prickly Minerva, and Minerva cannot understand why she finds Cal so attractive, despite all that she knows about him.I loved the character of Minerva, a curvy girl on a low carb diet in a world full of skinny Minnies. Her insecurities were very real (but I agree with Cal, all that talk about not eating food was pretty boring.) Calvin was a wonderful literary creation--a gorgeous, charming, \\"love 'em and leave 'em\\" type who gets blindsided by his deep attraction to Minerva. So *unlikely*, I know, but that is what makes romantic fiction *great*! They both have awful families, intrusive friends, meddling ex's and some real insecurity issues.The dialogue was snappy and very witty and the plot quite clever. I loved the slightly mystical touches (minor accidents befall the H/H when they deny their love to others) and the fairy tale references in the plot (a shoe is lost, a \\"wolf\\" approaches a woman in a red hooded sweater, a kiss \\"awakens\\" a sleeper) that underscored that Cal and Min were \\"meant to be\\". Food was used as a metaphor and plot device a bit *too* much for my taste (ha!)--enough already about Chicken Marsala, donuts, bread and butter! I admit that I did love the scene in which Cal seduces a kiss out of Min on a picnic table with the help of a Krispy Kreme donut (the donut acting as a metaphor for the kiss itself--both forbidden *bliss* for Min!) My other quibble with the book was with the epilogue. Min complains near the end of the book that nobody ever writes stories about happily ever after--and she is right. While everyone agrees that the heroine should get the handsome prince at the end of a good romance, \\"happily ever after\\" means different things to different people and is best left to the reader's imagination (I think anyways...)In summary, \\"Bet Me\\" is a sexy, light, humorous romp with an engaging hero and heroine. I think that Jennifer Crusie is a *wonderfully* talented author and would also recommend \\"Welcome to Temptation\\" (a book by JC that I liked even more!)"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I was starting to get a little worried. I thought &quot;Fast Women&quot; was so so and that &quot;Faking It&quot; was a near miss. Then there was that fall into the land of rereleasing. With &quot;Bet Me&quot; Ms. Cruise is BACK. This book is laugh out loud funny, unpredictable and very well written. I hope we don't have to wait three years for her next great book."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Minerva Dobbs is a young lady that begins to have doubts about every finding Mr. Right when her boyfriend dumps her for not wanting to have sex. \\"IS that all men think about?\\" she judges. Just when things seem to have gotten as bad as they could get, they go even lower. Her ex-boyfriend, pegging Min as a cold-hearted lady with no sex drive, bets Cal Morrissey that he is not able to bed her.Min decides to have fun in raising Cal's hopes before she ultimately plans to leave him with the desires in his hand. A funny thing happens on the way, they actually go beyond their original plans for each other and start to come to terms with the fact that they may have found their perfect match. Sometimes, destiny is grand and Jennifer Cruise takes us through a humorous journey in search of the Cinderella ending that everyone dreams of but always feels is beyond our own reach."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"First off, I concur with the previous 140-some people who characterized it as a humorous and sexy romp and good beach reading.Second, this being a review and not a book report, I promise I won't rehearse the plot one more time.Third, love Crusie or hate her, but don't say her writing's poor! It may be formula (which is why the cover doesn't say WAR AND PEACE-coincidence? You be the judge!), and you may well hate the formula (some days even I do), but the execution of the formula is generally flawless. Crusie, unlike way too many popular authors, doesn't go mad with adverbs, doesn't refer to people as \\"the man\\" or \\"the blonde\\", avoids endless just-slightly-wrong synonyms for \\"said,\\" and knows the difference between MAY and MIGHT and LIE and LAY. Unless you can say the same for your own prose, you might want to count to ten before bashing Crusie's style.Fourth, though...ah, fourth. As some of the reviewers have mentioned, the book does circle around weight and acceptance of weight: Min's \\"round,\\" though we never hear a number (probably a good call); her mother's mad for thinness, like so many other mothers, and Cal, the beautiful guy, feeds her and encourages her not to worry about her weight, which she ultimately agrees not to do. Many, including me, have mixed reactions to this aspect. Some readers think Cal's a sicko for feeding Min and undermining her efforts to diet, despite the fact that, left to herself, Min doesn't really want to diet. Some applaud the book's message of self-acceptance, despite the fact that, for many women, learning to manage diet and exercise in ways they can live with IS about self-acceptance and that, for many others, obesity is the visible sign of despair and other kinds of constraint. For some women, thinness means power and self-acceptance; for others, fat means the same things. It's a very interesting dispute.I think this schism in readership reflects our cultural divide about weight in general, and women's weight in particular: we're supposed to accept and love ourselves as is, AND we're supposed to maintain a certain weight. We're supposed to be sensual creatures who enjoy food, sex, and a trashy novel in the hammock, but we're supposed to control the flesh, conquer it, overcome the body with the mind. What this divide says, to me, is that depending on one's state of mind, either stance can be \\"right\\": there are ways in which we should and want to take control of our lives, and other ways in which we shouldn't and don't want to, and still others in which we literally can't, and which category our weight falls into really, REALLY varies from person to person, from woman to woman. Cal's right to feed Min because her desire for thinness is externally imposed; he's wrong to feed Min because it's just another external imposition of control on her body. Min's right to want carbs and sweets because she enjoys them and doesn't seem to link them to anything else, but she could be wrong to eat them if the circumstances were only a little different: if she were diabetic, if being heavy made her deeply unhappy, if her appetite were just a way of anesthetizing other feelings.If anything, maybe Cal's wrong to feed Min when he doesn't know any of this about her; the trope of the romance novel, though, says that even when Mr. Right doesn't know anything about us, he really does. I don't know how much I like that trope, even though it speaks to a universal desire to be understood and still loved; the suggestion that Mr. Right understands Ms. Right better than she does herself may sometimes be true, but would be very dangerous as a rule of thumb. However, the broader message--that heavy women and beautiful men can do well together--is a nice rejoinder for Hollywood, which spews the opposite dictum nonstop and limits its treatment of this possibility to *Shallow Hal.* Moreover, the idea that self-acceptance is crucial to accepting love is worth considering.And what all this means in the long term, of course, is that we can't, or at least shouldn't, make quick judgments about what's going on inside people based on weight. Weight's a kind of floating signifier: it means what the person wearing it most deeply believes it means; sometimes(dare we say it), it may mean nothing at all. And yet we treat it as a universal moral signifier. For those who say this book is a formula-driven piece of predictable hackery, that's a fairly sophisticated message."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I am listening to the CD, after giving the book a quick read when it came out. The premise is great, but the dialog gets boring because its all \\"xx\\"Cal Said then \\"xx\\"Min Said \\"xx\\"Bonnie said \\"xxx\\"David Said. The word SAID must have been used 10,000 times in this book. It slows down otherwise snappy dialogue."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers that Ms. Crusie's last two efforts (BET ME and FAKING IT) have not been up to par with her usual standards of excellence. Although the characters are likeable and there are some witty lines, the book lacks any kind of plot. It consists mostly of couples pairing off in a singles bar. It reminds me of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; meets &quot;The Dating Game&quot; (which is not a compliment since I don't care for either show).Also, I felt the author threw in some things to try to please everyone. Min is overweight and carb conscious. The bartender (who is also Cal's neighbor) is a Lesbian. One couple decides to remain childless, which disappointed me because they both like children and it is pointed out a couple of times in the book that they would make beautiful children. I will continue to read Ms. Crusie's books, but hope for better in the future."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"\\"Bet Me\\" was the first Jennifer Crusie book I ever read. Now, after reading them all, it's still my favorite.I adore Min Dobbs. It's rare to find a main character in chick lit who's overweight and doesn't end up having to lose pounds to get the guy. Plus, Min is funny, sarcastic, and a solid woman. The guy in this (Cal Morissey) is a bit of a cad at first, but he gets to your heart and manages to win you over. And the plot is great- their friends and family remind me much too much of my own sometimes.My only complaint would be that the major sex scene comes fairly late in the novel, but it's worth the wait, and Crusie keeps you laughing and reading until the last page. A great read anytime."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Until recently I haven't had much interest in \\"chick lit\\" or romance novels. A friend recommended that I read Bet Me because I reminded her of the main character, so I took a leap and loved this book. The main character, Min, was a feisty, fun character with a biting wit. I also enjoyed the cast of peripheral characters...Min's friends and those of her unlikely love interest, Cal. Outlandish happenings abound in this book, but that was part of the fun. Above all, Crusie writes great sexual tension that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book. I will definitely pick up more Crusie in the future."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Minerva &quot;Min&quot; Dobbs has only three weeks before her sister's (Di) wedding, when her boyfriend (David) dumps her in a bar because she refuses to go to bed with him.

I normally like historicals and paranormal romances because I am more drawn into the world and out of mine. Cruise successfully captured my intrest even without a unique setting or super powers.Min has just been dumped when she secretly hears her ex betting a gorgeous man at the same bar that he can't get Min in bed in a month. Pissed off, she decides to let the handsome Cal take her out this once and make him regret it. Cal has no intention of taking the stupid bet. He is willing to get away from his ex girlfriend though, so he decides to ask Min out to dinner to make an escape. What follows is a story about two people who fate has decided need to be together whether they like it or not.I really liked Min. Her character is real and likeable. I like that she wasn't perfect looking, and her friends add humor to the story. Cal was an interesting hero. He has depth beyond good looks. I love it when a hero thinks the heroine is gorgeous even when she isn't looking her best, which Cal did. The two ex's added some more drama with there outragous plans to get Cal and Min back, and I really liked the idea of fairy tales and how they would play out in real life. Overall, this was a really enjoyable read. It is certainly my favorite contemporary that I have read. I still prefer historical and paranormal romances, but I will probably give Cruise another go since I enjoyed this novel so much."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"When I first bought this book, I was sure it was going to be an offbeat book that is decent enough of a read for a bargain price. What I got was an author who knew her business and how to grab the attention of this skeptic.

Worth 22 bucks, and worth the time to read it."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"If I could've rated this book higher than five, I would've. I started Bet Me at six o'clock last evening and stayed up until two in the morning to finish it. I could'nt put the book down. Did I figure the ending of the book out within the first few chapters, yes. Did I care...NO. I've been reading a lot of chick lit and have liked most of what I've read, but have found a lot of flaws in the characters and such, but not in this book. I loved Min's style. Her wise cracks made me laugh and I loved the way she didn't get too down about her mom's constant arguing over her weight. The guy she falls for; Cal, started out looking like scum, but once you got into the real him who could'nt help fall in love with him. Her friends and his friends complimented each other and there was real chemistry between the friendships they had with each other. I can't say enough about how great this story was! I will say to everyone out there, read this book!!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"\\"Bet Me\\" is possibly one of the best books I have read in a long time, and it's going on my shelf as one of my absolute favorites. I am a very avid reader and although I alternate between genres, there is always a fondness for 'chick lit'. And I think this story is one of the best.First off, it delights me to find that the heroine in this story is both voluptuous and strong willed. Min is someone that I belive I know quite well, and someone I hope others see me as. She is a heroine I feel I might some day reach - and that is a wonderful thing.To keep this brief: I think Crusie did an excellent job of writing real, engaging, witty characters. I would love to know these people and find my Emilio's. The romance is wonderful and even as they fight it you can feel the reality and truth behind it. It makes shivers run up my spine and has me happily writing a review at 4 am just so I can tell you all how wonderful it is. I loved how Min spoker her mind and stood up for those who needed it. Harry is a jewel as is Liza and Shanna. In sum: The writing is comical, witty, spine-tingling and real. I couldn't put it down, it was finished in 27 hours with an 8 hr work day in there somewhere. Couldn't put it down.Critics ('cause no review should be perfect): It broke my heart that so much came between the lovers - but it always does. It may have gotten long, but I still ate it up. If for awhile Cal seems too perfect, he gets more real, believe me. Okay, I'm on a book high and can't think of any more critiques.I strongly suggest this book."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"A friend (that is not an avid reader like me) raved about this book and told me I must read it. I had never heard of Jennifer Crusie before but took my friend's advice that it was a great read, hilarious and hard to put down, so I got the book. She was definitely right! It was the most humorous book I've probably ever read! It had me laughing all the way through it. Normally I will chuckle or smile through some books but this one had me laughing out loud with all the witty comments and sarcastic humor. It was such an enjoyable read and definitely is one that you don't want to put down. Yes, it's somewhat predictable but it's such a light hearted, fun book with truly believable characters that you won't mind that you can probably guess how it will turn out. The additional chapter at the end was icing on the cake for those of us who like complete closure at the end of a book. I recommend it highly! Can't wait to read more of her books! I'm hooked now!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I just read BET ME because a girlfriend recommended it. I loved it, and plan to recommend it to others. It's too early to call anyone, so I will start with an Amazon review!BET ME is light, fun and charming. Jennifer Crusie does a great job of capturing single girl struggles and making them light and fun. Like many good tales it starts off with 'once upon a time:' \\"Once upon a time, Minvera Dobbs thought as she stood in the middle of a loud yuppie bar, the world was full of good men.\\" It turns out that she is here being dumped by her \\"tall, dark and righteous\\" boyfriend just a few weeks before her sister's wedding. Instead of being a tragedy, this of course opens up space for a good man to show up.The loser boyfriend has been cranky because Minerva has not been sleeping with him. He looks like Prince Charming but has had the poor taste to indicate she is too plump. Cal, when he shows up, loves Min's curves, and keeps feeding her decadent treasts like chicken marsala and Krispy Kreme donuts with chocolate icing.Crusie does a great job keeping the whole think light and fun. The dialog between Min and Cal (the good man) has the energy and crackle of the dialogue in romantic comedies like \\"Desk Set.\\"Late in the book, we meet the Families, and get a dose of what each has to overcome in order to be happy. The pace slows a little here, towards the slow and significant, but never completely loses the energy and charm that keep you turing page after page.A note for the modest: The hero and heroine do finally fall into bed together, and we do have that described to us. If you are bothered by a fairly explicit description, this may bother you.A thumbs up for BET ME! This is Chick Lit at its best."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I'd never read any of Crusie's books, until I picked this one up at the store after it caught my eye. I have to say, I've already went out and bought a few more of her books, because if they're as good as \\"Bet Me\\"- I'm a new fan & I'm hooked!We first meet Min Dobbs as her boyfriend is breaking up with her- in a bar- for not sleeping with him. Thank god her friends are there for support, and so are some good looking available men. Cal catches her eye and she's definitely interested, until she sees him talking to her now ex-boyfriend & making a bet that he can't get her into bed in 1 month! No longer interested in his good looks, out of spite she does agree to leave the bar with Cal. Only, this casual acquaintance seems to take a life on of it's own...and Min & Cal begin running into each other where ever they go. Their love/hate relationship becomes irresistable, even though both of them try to deny it.This book was such a pleasant, fun read! Very quickly I became attached to the characters in the book, the friends of Cal & Min, their families, even their conspiring Ex's! I think this is one of the best romantic comedy books I've read in a long time. As another reviewer put it, the dialogue and situations in the book are realistic, they do not come off as contrived or fake- as some books do. I'd certainly love to see a movie version of this book- and like I said, I'll be reading much more of Crusie in the future!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I love this book. I have read all of her books, even re-read most, but this one I pick up again and again just so that I can smile while I read it. I read very fast.I enjoy the fact that Min, is a normal, average sized woman who stands up for who she is and doesnt take any crap from Cal, no matter how handsome he is. The conversations/arguments are witty, honest and sometimes make you laugh out loud.Her characters are realistic, the situations they find them selves in are as well. Really, how many times do you find youself with a group of you closest friends and talk about what if. I think that all close groups of friends should have weekly \\"if-dinners\\". The melding of the groups, male and female very honest.I always recommend Crusie, to all my fellow readers, whether it is this book or another of hers. Her stories are witty and heartfelt. They, especially \\"BET ME\\" will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Bet Me isn't Jennifer Crusie's best work, but I think it's still pretty quality, since I tend to regard Jennifer Crusie as one of those authors who is great even when she's bad (kind of like Susan Elizabeth Phillips and Julia Quinn--they just stand head and shoulders above everything else out there in lighthearted romantic fiction)First of all, the characters aren't quite as quirky as some of Crusie's others. While they definitely still have spunk, I just felt as though this novel was lacking in some of the originality of Crusie's other novels. No con-artists or film stars or mayors/pool sharks here. The most interesting thing about the hero and heroine's families was that they were rich, which really isn't all that interesting at all.Secondly, Crusie tends to bludgeon the reader with her themes, as some other reviewers noted. Elvis, Krispy Kreme, Chicken marsala... over and over and over! She also spends far too much of the novel preoccupied with emphasizing Min's insecurity about her weight.The novel loses a little steam towards the end, when Min stops being a smart aleck and starts fishing for reassurances about her figure constantly. Also, the sub-plot concerning Min's sister's wedding just didn't pack quite the punch as some of the other sub-plots in Crusie novels. I found myself skipping pages to get to the part where Min and Calvin finally get together, but even that seemed to lose my interest (perhaps because it took so long to get to the point!)All in all, however, this novel was still very funny and very sweet, and inspired me to actually use butter for about the first time in forever. Crusie does a wonderful job with Cal; and of course, what woman wouldn't appreciate a man who feeds her donuts and calls her beautiful at the same time? Cal was a wonderful hero, and the initial spark between Min and Cal was great. I just felt that this one lost a little bit of momentum between the middle and the end. However, if you are looking for a funny, light read, this one should satisfy. (Or make you intensely hungry for donuts... haha..)"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. As someone who has tried the low carb low fat diet, I found the food scenes particularly entertaining and very easy to relate to-I thought they added a certain amount of realism to Min's character and made Cal even more likeable(what's not to like about a man who will feed you?). The only characters I didn't like were those you weren't supposed to-Cal's Mom, Min's Mom, Greg, and Cal's Brother, but you understood that they put up with them because they were family, and thats what you do with family.

I highly recommend this book because Jennifer Crusie is among a very small circle of writers who are consistently funny. The caliber of her writing transcends the romance genre. Add in her ability to write comic, yet sexy love scenes and the circle grows even smaller. If this were the first Crusie I was reading, I'd be jumping up and down for joy in discovering this writer. She's that good.I read \\"Bet Me\\" in one setting, and I enjoyed it. It's funny and witty and fast-paced. The small feeling of dissatisfaction I felt after reading it was the sense that the story could have been more. This is a return to a more romance-focused story than Crusie's later efforts and I missed that a little. The subplots involving Harry/Bink/Reynolds and Diana/Greg weren't as fully developed as Crusie's usual subplots, which are often so strong they threaten to overwhelm the major plot, but in a good way. I missed that in this book and I think Crusie missed the boat. The romance between Min and Cal wasn't enough story. It needed these subplots. The characters were there, the hint of conflict was there, Crusie had my interest but then their stories were cut short a little. That was my only complaint and it's a minor quibble."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"OK, I finishedBet Meand it was an amazing bit of chick lit that was enamoring and funny all the way through, kept my interest in the stupid things they all did and made me wonder why I liked it so much, it was light reading but captivating, hard to put my finger on but I enjoyed the whole thing, it was about 300 pages and was at least a 4.5 Star read as far as entertaining, who cares about any deeper meaning or crap, it made me laugh and had a great ending, what more would I want?"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This really is one of my favorite Cruise novels.

We go from the \`heroine' holding Calvin in contempt for his shallowness to Calvin out hero thinking that Minerva is a stick up the bum, overly practical and boring person.

In the real world, a 'fat', chip on her shoulder, frumpy, bitchy girl doesn't win the heart of the gorgeous heartthrob, who is intelligent, self motivated, and can cook.. I'm sorry, first impressions go a long way and her first, second, third impressions were horrific.

The dialogue was absolutely delightful, very witty, very funny, very warm. Cal is sexy as hell, and Min is so funny and so insightful. I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read Jennifer Crusie's other books. The secondary characters were a hoot. This book is a real modern day fairy tale and I loved every minute of it. Jennifer Crusie's voice is so pure, so true, so funny. It's a wonderful, warm, sexy book!!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"In her early thirties in Southern Ohio, Minerva Dobbs still dreams of forever love stories, but currently is down on men though she still hopes to find that one male who is a good person and nice, especially to her. Her thoughts as she linger in the upscale Yuppie bar is that her latest loser David deserves a swizzle stick shoved by her into his heart though he probably wouldn't miss a beat.Hollywood handsome Cal Morrissey has a $10,000 bet with his pals that he will bed Min within a month. Min knows about the wager and decides to play along with Cal so that he can escort her to her sister's wedding and then dump him with her sheets remaining dry. As Cal and Min compete for the upper hand and their friends interfere either by separating or pushing them together, they fall in love. However, will Min trust this slick stud with her heart especially when she agrees with Gloria Steinham that \\"Women's total instinct for gambling is satisfied by marriage\\".The Steinham line is a great opening to a humorous off beat relationship tale as it distinctly shows the gender differences that help turn this tale into an audaciously delightful screwball comedy. Min is a delightful cynic while Cal is a charming schemer. The support cast including Krispy Cr&egrave;me is an eccentric bunch, but the novel belongs to the lead couple war to implement their respective plan that makes for a fine time for readers who appreciate a wacky romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I can't tell you how much I loved this book. To give you an indication, I got it from the library (not liking Crusie's last book, I wasn't willing to risk a waste of money on a hard cover) and read it. Now, I'm buying it myself! I usually buy hardcovers once every year or two, so you get the idea. Like Crusie's other books, this made me lol--for example, when describing Min's dad: he was &quot;a lumbering man with a shock of blond hair and heavy white eyebrows who should have been hearty and welcoming but instead had the vaguely paranoid look of a sheepdog whose sheep were plotting against him.&quot;So, why did I like this book? Let me count the ways. I loved Cal, an extremely handsome man who realizes that he loves, loves Min and that she should eat! He defends her beautifully from her mother who is always vigilent. carping about Min to diet. In turn, I also loved Min who considers herself fat and cannot really believe a good looking man would be attracted to her. Yes, the book is predictable, but that's half the fun--you don't have to worry that something unpleasant will happen and you anticipate and enjoy what you know will happen--even before it does. If you have weight issues (and how many women don't?), you'll love this book too."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I find myself comparing this to Crusie's other books instead of the tons of mediocre romance novels that are out there. This is a great book compared to most, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I did Welcome to Temptation or Fast Women. She set such a high standard with those books, and I haven't found the last couple to be up there.The protaganist characters are charming, but there are too many secondary characters with not enough to do. They are interesting, fun people, but they should have either been more developed or a few of them culled out. Crusie always does her sub-plots, which, in the two titles mentioned above, are awesome. The subs in this one aren't as developed and therefore seem a little distracting.I read and re-read constantly, because I DO insist on good writing, and the authors that I like can't keep up. Therefore, I'm not at all sorry that I bought this in hardback, because I will come back to it - just not near as much as I will her other books. So, I don't know whether to recommend this to a first time Crusie reader or not. If I said to get it first, you'd not be getting her best, but will get a good story - but if I said to read Welcome to Temptation first, you might be like me and be a bit disappointed by this one when you do read it... Tough call. Those who are already fans will like it, I'm sure. You just may not love it as much as the others!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I bought this book as an ebook for my Kindle, and could have not been more disappointed. It's such an excellent book, but whomever put it into ebook format did not even bother editing it before putting it up for sale. The paragraph formatting is messed up, words like \\"I'm\\" and \\"I've\\", frequently are messed up as \\"Fm\\" and \\"Fv\\", and there is missing punctuation, spaces, and on occasion, entire words were somehow translated into numbers. Don't even bother wasting your money if you want this as an ebook, because it's nowhere near worth it."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Jennifer Crusie is a dazzling writer. She knows how to feed the heart of women. This book is my ultimate favorite, it's the Pride and Prejudice of our time.Min Dobbs knows that happily-ever-after is a fairy tale, especially with a man like Cal Morrisey, who asked her to dinner to win a bet. Cal Morrisey knows commitment is impossible, especially with a woman as cranky as Min Dobbs. When they say good-bye at the end of their evening, they cut their losses and agree never to see each other again.But fate has other plans for them. Min and Cal are dealing with meddling friends, wedding cake, a jealous ex-boyfriend, and Krispy Kremes.I recommend all of Crusie's books:charlie all nightfaking itcrazy for yougetting rid of bradley"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I have long been a fan of chic lit, however I was just recently introduced to Jennifer Crusie. Boy am I glad that I was. \\"Bet Me\\" is an entertaining read full of sharp quips and quick paced dialogue. The characters are fun to be with and really easy to get to know. We are first introduced to Min Dobbs as she is unceremoniously dumped by her loser of a boyfriend, only to have him turn around and make a bet with Calvin Morrissey that Cal won't be able to get Min into bed with him in one month.Min, overhearing the bet, decides to play Cal and give David a run for his money. However, she decides that after one date with Cal that annoying David isn't worth the trouble and her and Cal part and go their seperate ways. The rest of the story is truly romantic (and hilarious) as Min and Cal are pushed together again and again. David, on the other hand, continues to see his money slipping farther and farther away, ending in hilarious results.I was very entertained by this read and can't wait to try my hand a more Jennifer Crusie novels. So if you're looking for something light hearted and fun to read, try \\"Bet Me.\\" You'll be glad you took the gamble!!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book is so realistic and down to earth! It hits home in some many areas, yet it is dramatically funny! Once you begin reading this book, you won't want to put it down!

It gives hope to every smart, energetic, and intuitive woman alive!"},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book came recommended to me and I have never read this author before. It is a quick read with witty dialogue. The plot line and relationship reminded me a little bit of \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\". The main character was interesting, but I never could really relate to her. It does describe the modern dating scene in detail (which looks a little scary to me - glad I'm not in that arena!) While I liked the book, I did not give it 5 stars because I like books with more intricate plots and greater character development. This is a good book for a quick read on vacation or on the week-end."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I've heard that the author herself described this novel as a \\"cheesy romance\\".Is it a cheesy romance? You bet, pun intended--it uses some old romance-novel tropes like the Big Misunderstanding, and focuses almost entirely on the love relationship rather than other issues.Is it a lot of fun? Yes! I enjoyed every minute of this book. I relished the banter and friction between Min and Cal as they got to know one another. He can't figure out why she's so acerbic--but then he doesn't realize that she thinks he made a very slimy bet with her ex-boyfriend. And she can't figure out, if he's only with her to win a bet, why her gut is telling her his feelings are real. Meanwhile, after a whole life spent dieting and being prim, she's learning how to live a little, from chocolate-iced donuts to red lace bras. Add in some quirky friends, some dysfunctional parents, and mix well.Yes, the plot was a little improbable, but the sweet, sexy dynamic between Min and Cal was worth it. Think of it as one of those Krispy Kremes Min loves so much: a little fluffy, but sweet and satisfying."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This was my first Jennifer Crusie book and I think I've found one of my new favorite authors! I LOVED it!She has a great writing style, and I appreciate that she can give information about each character's past without being boring or trite.Bet Me is about an unlikely couple that fights their attraction to each other. Min is bitter with men because she's just been dumped for not sleeping with the guy. Cal is a smooth ladies man that seems to be a typical commitment-phobe. While at a bar, Min's recent ex bets Cal to 1.get Min to leave the bar with him and 2.get Min to sleep with him. Their relationship may have a rocky start, but fate has other plans.Min's character is chubby, and I really liked that in this book the chubby girl didn't have to loose weight to win the guy. Finally. On the other hand, I did find it a little annoying how much she enjoyed food, and how much chicken marsala was mentioned. I think i'll laugh at that whenever i see it on a menu now.Crusie's plot is really clever and you can't help but love her characters. Bet Me is funny, fresh and romantic. It's like a breath of fresh air compared to many other books in the same category. It's one of the best romance books I've read. I'm definitely going to read this book again one day and get her other titles.It's a must read."},{"Title":"Bet Me (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I could not put it down when I picked it up and started reading it yesterday. I ended up staying up to 4 am to finish it (and now I am extremely tired due to 2.5 hours of sleep). But the book was worth it!There are plenty of summaries about the story already, so no need to get into that again. However, I do want to point out that (IMO) Min is not what I would call \\"fat\\" per se, she's voluptuous and curvy - that's a far cry from fat! It's mentioned in the book that she's a couple sizes bigger than an 8 - so I would say she's about a 12 (that's what I pictured in my head anyway). Well that's not fat, that's pretty average. Of course, compared to her size 2 sister and size 4 mother, she would appear on the heavier side.In any case, if you love Crusie's writing style, you will love this book too!

This book, Delta of Venus, defines erotic. There are some passgaes in it that read like music, others that are so subtle, and yet they all arouse the senses and cast an erotic veil around the reader.

With her prose she is interested more in dealing with the senses than with facts and events. So much so that the stories are built out of images of a dreamscape rather than real situations. The real situations do exist but they are just an excuse to invade another territory: the one of love.When it comes to love, Nin deals with it in two different spheres in the stories of \\"Delta of Venus\\". There is the carnal love -- that one that gives pleasure to the body -- and the spiritual one -- that one that give pleasures to the soul. But most characters are in search of a kind of love that conjures both types. Needless to say that it is hard to find, almost impossible. However, Nin and her creations never give up.Her feminine point of view brings refreshment and charm to a field dominated by man: erotica. Explicit at some point, but never vulgar, Nin seduces both male and female readers because, above all, she has written good fiction. The erotic aspect is, after all, just a detail in her net of relationships, lovers and friends. Her exposition of dark secrets of desire and the human soul is true and sincere. \\"Delta of Venus\\" is a book that will be read for many years to come -- probably forever -- because of its beauty and, mainly, because of its realistic portray of sensuous love."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Overwhelming, this work incited literary jealousy in me.

These stories are told so passionately, and I found interest in even the smallest details. These stories stand on their own in many areas, and not just as something to get the reader off. I only wish Anais Nin was still alive!

Some problems that I saw with this book are as follows: She killed the erotic mood frequently, and some of the stories seemed churned out. The book seemed like it was written for money and not for passion. It was bland and really had no depth; it was like watching a porno."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This collection of erotic short stories by Anais Nin, along with her other collection \\"Little Birds\\", is something I remember as one of the most sexually interesting and erotic books I've ever read. Nin likes to break taboos in her erotica, which will shock and disquiet a few readers, yet she does it with an originality and sensuality that makes you curious to read on.David Rehakauthor of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\""},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"If you enjoy slow sweet soft sexuality then this is the book for you. I enjoyed the style of narration used in the third person. Women and Men will find this collection of short stories to be arousing in many ways. The sexual descriptions are bold but not what modern readers would call hard core pornography. A new or used copy of this book will make a welcome addition to your erotic bookshelf. Enjoy.Master Jeaux"},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I loved this book. It was written in a time when sensual was sexual and it definitely shows through. I prefer Anais Nin's writtings over a lot of more modern authors becauses she focuses on the whole issue. She doesn't just concentrate on sex, she writes about feelings, longings, relationships, fidelity and infidelity making the stories jump out at you and become so much more than just an erotic tale."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I grew up with this book when I found it among some old books I inherited.

The writing is wonderful and the sex is, well, just hot. I've ready many similar books since then, like right now I am reading Abby Lee's Diary of a Sex Fiend: Girl with a One Track Mind.

In fact, it's a prerequesite! I just recently discovered Ms. Nin, and this is the best erotica I have read since &quot;Playtime&quot;. Full of imagination, sensuality and poetic verse, this is the best of erotica!"},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Tip treacle from a jar and you get a glowing golden stream that whirls into a pool you feel tempted to dive into. This is how Anas Nin writes, drawing us into her universe of pleasure and sensuality; poetry and surprise.I found a 1969 hardback edition of \\"Delta of Venus\\" at the World's End Bookshop in London's Kings Road, and have since marred the pages with yellow highlighter and pencil annotations. The value of the book is not to maintain its mint condition, but keeping it to read again and again.\\"Delta of Venus\\" contains 15 short stories, a necklace of exquisite cut diamonds, each perfect, each capturing human sexuality in its many and varied facets, new affairs, affairs that have ended, lovers 'convulsed with excitement' and 'in the frenzy of orgasm.'The writing is fresh, moving, sensual and daring. In 'The Basque and Bijou' we follow two girls riding on a warm day; we smell the aroma of the horses, the feeling in their clenched bottoms gripped in tight jodhpurs, the sun and shade through the trees. They rest in a glade and are unable to stop themselves removing their clothes until, at the moment of greatest erotic tension, Leila takes a horsewhip to Bijou's buttocks and she climaxes under its blows. Later in the story, Bijou, naked still, is held down by two men who watch as a large dog, intoxicated by her smell of arousal, licks her private parts. 'The dog was beautiful, with a big tousled head, a clean tongue.''Pierre', in the story taking his name, makes love to a girl who has just drowned and, from that day, 'he could not hear rain without remembering how the water came out between her legs and out of her mouth, and how soft and smooth she was.'Erotica, in the wake of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" is in vogue and readers, as well as writers, would do well to go back and read Miss Nin, Mistress of the Genre."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I love to read good erotica. However, &#34;good erotica&#34; is usually an oxymoron. I'm not talking about reading pornographic material or &#34;50 Shades of Grey&#34; or contemporary sexploits. I refer to rich, well-crafted prose written very much like a poem, complete with elements of surprise and the use of literary tools. Anais Nin writes that way. &#34;Delta of Venus&#34; and &#34;Little Birds&#34; are two of the best books of erotica I've ever read, and I suspect that will remain a constant. I have gone back to them over and over throughout the years and rediscovered new mysteries Nin tucked away for her readers."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Buy it, use your imagination, enjoy it, practice, alone or in a crowd but never while wearing tube socks(okay, fishnet hose) on a newly waxed floor."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"The manager of an apartment I lived in the early 80's was a member of a book club in which Delta of Venus and Little Birds were two that she had ordered. One day she brought them over and thought that I would like them.Now, I had never read erotica before, so I had no idea what to expect. I would say that those two books were my '50 shades of grey\\" moment. I experienced something from reading those books that the majority of women had experienced as teenagers. I, of course, ended up buying the books myself, still have them and pop them open occasionally to read a few of the stories to the man in my life. Some liken erotica to sexual porn stories, but there is a world of difference.Erotic. Sensual. Tasteful. Anais Nin."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This book was so exciting. Parts of this book were however very sadistic. I think to truly enjoy this book the reader has to be open to the ideas Anais Nin portrays in her book. Two stories were especially provocative. The story of a female body being pulled from a river and being sexually manipulated by a young man was the first. The second was a story of a man being aroused by two very young girls, and how the three of them play together. Otherwise I thought that most of the stories could be anyone's fantasies."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I have never till this day come across an erotic novel such as Delta Of Venus.It captures the true feminine sprit of the female sexuality.It generates the warmth and tenderness of the writer's lyrical aproach to sexuality and the erotic.Best book by Anais Nin in my collection."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Delta of Venus is a shameless piece of erotica, not to say pornography. The characters are driven by their carnal appeites the way crack users seek a fix. There's little likeable about any of them in this strange circus of personalities.But.... but.... it's really well written! Anais Nin is a talented writer and brings all her talent into this book -- which is dreamlike and surreal, a completely courageous examination of lust in technicolor. There's no real love in the book. No romance except in the adventure-sense of the word. Delta of Venus is a book that celebrates the exietcne of lust in all its variety and it's tough not to respect it for that. Some of it is disturbing, like The Hungarian Adventurer with its depiction of an addiction gone hopelessly out of control. When I finished the book I felt like I had passed through a circus of sexuality.Its a captivating read but nothing for puritans."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This book is full of amazing short erotica stories. Anais writes with her heart &amp; soul. Once you pick up the book you don't want to put it down. It makes you want to be the characters she's writing about."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Anais Nin may have pushed back some boundaries in her day, but in the 21st century her writing holds little of value. Reading through the stories in Delta of Venus, I was bored by the repetitiveness, and the undeveloping one-dimensionality of her storylines and characters; her language is powerful and descriptive, but dishonest. It seemed a little sad that the stories' characters were so bound by the limitations of their sexuality. As a writer, she should have brought her characters more to life. The fact that these stories arose out of commissioned porn - if what Nin claims is true - is apparent."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"A long time ago, a guy I used to date picked this up and began reading it to me while we were lounging. We sat there all day, him reading, me laying with my head in his lap and listening. I bought my own copy to remind myself of how nice it felt, and in the hopes that one day, I'll get to read it to someone new."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Anais Nin is famous for writing erotica that was decades ahead of its time; this is a collection of several of her erotic short stories. They are quite good, quite well-written, but I can't say that they're flawless. There are two main problems, one of which is certainly the result of her having written the stories for a patron whose stated interests clearly colored her writing, and the other of which may be a result of the same influence or may be the result of Nin being, in spite of her best efforts at being liberated, a product of her time and culture.The first problem is that the stories seem rather rushed and disjointed; she provides a fair amount of description and plot, but somewhat spottily and occasionally sacrifices both to rush to the descriptions of the sex act. This is clearly the result of the creative tension between her desire to write a good story, and the fact that her patron was constantly telling her to cut out the boring stuff and get to the sex. The second problem is that far too many of her stories involve female characters longing to be dominated by aggressive, even brutal men. This may well be a common fantasy, but it's far from as universal as she portrays it to be, and I'm unsure whether she utilized that fantasy as frequently as she did because she was catering to what she expected her patron to be interested in, because it was privately a fantasy of her own, or because she was a product of her time and assumed it to be near-universally true, but in any case I found it somewhat off-putting.Other than these two quibbles, I find this book to be very nearly as good as its author's reputation would suggest."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I just ordered this book and I must say it is fantastic, I am nearly finished with it already and to be honest I wish it was longer. I am not ready to leave this poetic, erotic fantasy world that Anais has laid out before me. I have been reading non stop since it arrived and I just can't seem to get enough. Everytime I close my eyes I am transported to the sensual scenes that her writing gifted to me. A couple of the stories took me out of my comfort zone sexually, but even those are written in such a way that they make you feel the longing and the desire that the characters do. My favorite story in Delta was MATHILDE. I highly recommend this book for anyone that likes there erotica to have style and meaning and poetry. Not just trashy sex scenes, if your into the trashy this book is not for you. I just ordered Henry and June written by Anais Nin. I hope its as wonderful as this book."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I've been trying to re-read some of the books of my youth, in part to determine how my perspective has changed over the years. One that has been on the list, since it was one of the first 20 books I've read, is Henry Miller'sTropic of CancerMy \\"gut\\" has been telling me that will be a bit of a slog, so I compromised, and decided to read this one, by Miller's good friend, with similar subject material, and which I read when it was first published, in the late \`70's.This too proved to be a bit of a slog, and if I didn't abide by my practice of (almost) always finishing a book once I started it, I never would have made it. You start with a preface, purported written in 1940, about a wealthy male collector paying a dollar a page for this work, and his admonition to \\"leave out the poetry.\\" Particularly since the dollar a page remark makes it to the back cover, the purported origin just reeks of being a ploy from the marketing department. So, consider my own fantasy, and it is just that, since I have no factual information to support it: it's the mid-70's, two women from the publisher's marketing department meet with Anais Nin, in Los Angeles, late in her life (she died in early 1977); they had a couple of drinks, drew up a list of all known sexual fantasies on the proverbial cocktail napkin, and challenged her to write one book that incorporated them. And she met the challenge.The problem I had, and it is shared by some 1-star reviewers, is some of the supposed fantasies aren't. They should not have been listed on that cocktail napkin: pedophilia, necrophilia, priests and boys, and violence would certainly be on my short-list to delete. A couple of those supposed fantasies were not discussed much in the \`70's, now pedophilia and the particular subset, priests with boys, seems to be the weekly staple of most popular news sites. Regrettably, Nin's first story starts with pedophilia, and the third concerns priests and boys. Off putting enough to discard the book, perhaps into the fireplace.And that would be a shame, since there are some quality stories, incorporating some fairly reasonable and quite pleasant fantasies. The best story is \\"Elena,\\" and it is almost a fourth of the book. I'd buy it just for this one story. There are insights into the male / female relationship that are worthy of the best of Barbara Pym or Anita Brookner, and certainly Nin provides a more comprehensive view, as it were, whereby Pym and Brookner would just tail off into ellipsis to be fulfilled by the reader's imagination. As inHotel Du Lac, Switzerland is the setting where Elena first meets Peter, of the mysterious \\"work.\\" Later she becomes fixated by his somewhat worn belt, and wonders how many before have undone it.Augmenting the spectrum of fantasies is the geographic dispersion in setting, with Paris, naturally being preeminent, but ranging to Peru as well as the sea at Mallorca. There are scenes of artists and models, fairly standard fare which enables an easy incorporation of voyeurism, and there is once scene involving Marianne, and allowing for gender reversal, seemed to come straight out of Krzysztof Kieslowski'sDecalogue: The Ten Commandments, but since Nin's book came first, by more than a decade, perhaps it served as an inspiration for Kieslowski. There is other standard fare, including the warming effects of horseback riding, with the setting being the Bois de Boulogne. The climactic scene, as it were, could be the three-way lesbian fulfillment. As for the poetry, well, phrases like \\"the effulgence of their pleasure,\\" seemed to have flown under the radar of that buck a page big spender.Forget the marketing ploy, avoid the true perversions (and crimes!), and concentrate on the poetic and more comprehensive view of the male / female relationships. 3-stars."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Delta of Venus, Erotica by Anais Nin contains of fifteen erotic stories written by the author, and Anais Nin is known for her erotic writing. So be advised, all of the stories in this book are X-rated.In my opinion, Anais Nin is an excellent storyteller. Of course, I have read harsh reviews by other readers. Some say she can't write a story. And those readers are certainly entitled to their opinions. After all, that's what this whole exercise is about, diversity of opinions. But I liked her stories. She writes in short paragraphs with lovely descriptions, and more adjectives than I have in my entire memory. And she definitely knows how to use words, colorful words, sensual words, to create the exact image and the precise message she wants to convey to her readers. Some of her stories are outrageous, and her story plots are simple. But it's sex. How complicated can it be? But like I said at the beginning, these are erotic stories, and their only purpose is to entertain and titillate your libido. So whatever your sexual proclivity, I'm sure at least one of her stories will arouse your primal pleasure center just as surly as if you had tiny electrodes implanted into your brain. Plus, Anais Nin's charming style moves her stories along smoothly and at a reasonable speed. You can easily get through most of the book in one or two sittings.

How much of it is true is difficult to ascertain because authors are used to writing fiction even about themselves. Then the stories begin and expound on forbidden sexual topics: incest, rape, addiction, threatened sexual mutilation... and others that seem tame by today's standards - pseudohermaphroditism,anal stimulation, anal intercourse, bondage and domination. The author's claims the book is erotica written by a woman in contrast to all the erotica of her time written by men. Each tale has very little in the way of a story line and there is little continuity between each tale.

Because of the success of a certain Twi-hard bestseller that is several shades of garbage, I have decided to delve into the world of erotica. Well-written erotica that is.

Delta of Venus was on an Amazon list of \\"The Top 25 best erotic fiction\\" so I gave it a go. Two little girls are molested by some Hungarian \\"Baron\\" in the first 25 pages. I mean, come on. Please, can someone suggest an erotic novel that is 1.) written by an author with command of the English language and 2.)not full of deviant sex (rape, child molestation, necrophilia etc.) Can't a novel be well written, sexy and graphic without including whips, chains, inscest and violence? I haven't found one yet. Delta of Venus is certainly not one."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Ok I got it. I got it after the first 3 stories. Unless you are studying the difference between male and female fantasy, I found the book boring."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"As a blogger who writes quirky and unconventional perspectives on LOVE, I am compelled to read what is moving the public. Anais Nin's Delta of Venus was definitely an improvement over Fifty Shades of Grey. However for me, erotica is not personally moving sans the romance. Nin herself writes that sex without love lacks color. Delta of Venus is a series of short sex stories. I stayed with it anticipating that one of the essays would capture my attention. Instead I was once again disappointed in reading about atypical sexual perversions void of emotion. More interesting is to consider how scandalous Delta of Venus was in the context of the tImes. Howard Roarke in the Fountainhead got me going more than the characters in 50 Shades of Grey and Delta of Venus. Back to writing on ILoveYouOften.com, an optimistic reality check on love and relationships and other good stuff!"},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Delta of Venus joyously explores the art of human sexuality. Anais Nin's writing style is at once lyrical and straightforward. While she leaves no doubt in the reader's mind just what is going on, her countless love scenes are imbued with so much warmth and dignity that one could scarcely find them offensive. But most importantly, Anais understood that sex is nothing without emotion, and it's the emotions of her myriad characters that cause the reader to turn happily florid with every page. She understood that while sex is not to be taken lightly, it's certainly not something to be restrained, either. Lastly, of all the locales depicted in this collection of stories, she lends a special affection to Paris. I suspect that of all of Anais' lovers, the City of Light was the dearest to her heart, to wit: &quot;At five I always felt shivers of sensuality, shared with the sensual Paris. As soon as the light faded, it seemed to me that every woman I saw was running to meet her lover, that every man was running to meet his mistress.&quot; and &quot;But we were enjoying an orgasm, as couples do in doorways and under bridges at night all over Paris.&quot;"},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This is the first of Nin's works I have read. I had no idea erotica could be so exciting! I had always been turned off by it because it seems very male-centered and raunchy. Nin manages to be sensual without being crude.

A must read for any woman."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Looking for erotica that is not too far over the edge into bizarre? Although the language in the book is quaint due to the era in which it was written, it is still lushly erotic and perfect for reading to your significant other.

Her words are eloquent and yet not wordy. The short stories are developed so that they follow the previous offering in such a way that you believe yourself to be a third party and the only person capable of appreciating where you think she is going with the book. Just when you think you might know the ending, Nin adds another delicious twist and you are once again caught off guard. Nin should be the standard for modern erotica. There is nothing prissy or insulting in her writing. It is simply what erotica was always meant to be whatever your sexual persona may be. Enjoy..."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"\\"Delta of Venus\\" is an absolute pleasure to read. Each short story here flows seamlessly into the next, making it read like a never-ending hallucination. Anais simultaneously shocked and aroused me with her stories. Her writing is startlingly beautiful, like that of an (eroticised) angel. While her style is conspicuously feminine, Anais Nin doesn't shy away from more hardcore territory, as she confidently explores the taboos of sex: incest, bisexuality, paedophilia (The Boarding School), bestiality and even genital mutilation. Anais's decadent world is rich with exotic imagery and opulence. This is no \\"Mills and Boon\\" - this is a literary delight I'd recommend to anyone seeking an all-out retreat from reality. The sheer majesty of Anais's talent for writing is just as seductive as the erotic content within the book."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This book was first published in 1969, and is the work of that queen of the sensual, Anais Nin (1903-1977). The book is a collection of fifteen short stories. The stories themselves are not always entire narratives in the traditional sense. They do not necessarily tell an entire story, but what they do do is paint with words an erotic feeling.Yes, if you are expecting Penthouse Forum, you will be very disappointed. But, don't get the idea that this is some sort of chic-lit. Within these stories are described scenes of rape, bondage, incest, and much more. No, this is a fascinating work of erotica, one that describes human sexuality in terms of feelings and desires, rather than as a purely mechanical affair.This is a profoundly deep book of erotica, one that I give my highest recommendations to. Buy it and read it!(Review of Delta of Venus)"},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This book was intense, graphic, sensual, moving, deliriously engaging.

This is though, some of the best writing, erotic and non-erotic, you will find. The writer approaches the subject with great passion, and there is no way you cannot appreciate her use of words. I enjoyed and think quite highly of the author's Little Birds, but I do feel she probably does even a better job with this one. If you buy one of the works, you might as well go for both of them as each belongs in your collection. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"The great work of Anais Nin's life was her diary, and everything else she wrote, no matter how much energy and passion she invested in it, seemed distracted and a bit colorless. This erotica is no exception, and it also has the distinction of being composed to the tune of a tightrope act; Nin was required to deliver hardcore sex, but she could not help adding her own poetry to it. The conditions of composition are here important to whether or not you'll enjoy this semi-hardcore, semi-erotica writing.If you're a Nin fan, however, this is a must-have."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"With other kinds of literature, we might say that a story is successful if it entertains, if it strikes us as realistic, if we recognize ourselves and our lives in the characters and events, or any number of other characteristics. With erotica, the temptation is strong to assume that it's only successful if we read it and get horny. And with \\"Delta of Venus,\\" with its intended female point of view, we might be inclined to say that it's only successful if it makes women horny.Still, that seems an unlikely criterion. This is not sheer pornography, after all, even though Anais Nin claimed that she wrote these stories for an anonymous collector who constantly demanded more sexual content and less literary quality. Whoever the original audience was, collector of smut or otherwise, Ms. Nin at the time hung around with a group of extremely inventive and daring writers, including Henry Miller. The likelihood that she would write without at least intending to do so with quality is pretty slim. So the question remains - if the intention of these stories is at once to arouse the reader and to satisfy the author's writerly ambitions, how can we tell if they are successful in their intent? Particularly if we are a man reading erotica allegedly aimed at women? (Which is exactly what we are, by the way, in case you were wondering.)One way in which these tales stumble is the odd and very noticeable tendency to refer to body parts in the abstract. Surprisingly often, a character will be looking at or touching the body of another, and the narrative will refer to \\"the breasts\\" or \\"the hair\\", not to mention \\"the\\" other things. I found this a little surprising. In many essays on the politics of writing about sex, feminists protest that sort of dissociation, advising that tearing the body apart in words is exactly the opposite of erotic and recommending that we find a way to appreciate the entire body, and the mind and heart while we're at it, in our erotica. Given that, I would not have expected a woman writing for women to use the article \\"the\\" quite so often. But maybe I'm being unfair to Ms. Nin - she was exploring an area of erotic writing that had barely been touched upon in her day. And besides, however uncomfortable it makes me personally, why shouldn't a women objectify a partner from time to time if she wants to?Thus we bump up against one useful element in \\"Delta of Venus\\" - as it did when first published, it can provoke some very useful debate to this day. Which is all very well, but you could say the same thing about any controversial piece of junk; \\"The Turner Diaries\\" might provoke useful debate, for goodness' sake, but it's still a piece of fascist propaganda and artistically illiterate besides. Political usefulness does not necessarily make for good fiction.The same can be said for the erotic quality of these stories. I, for one, found some of the later ones arousing, and many of the early ones not at all. Ms. Nin had the courage to explore a wide variety of sensual expressions, and I'm a trifle surprised to find that in many of these stories the female protagonist ends up unsatisfied or discovers her greatest joy in utter submission to some man. Sensibly, however, the author expanded her repertoire of sensual plotlines to include a good many other possibilities, including tenderness and violence, voyeurism, domination, love and anger, even more troubling activities - everything, indeed, except monogamy and marriage. Oh well.None of this addresses the question yet of what may make \\"Delta of Venus\\" good fiction, rather than only erotic fiction, but it does begin to get at the point. As I said, regardless of what her personal tastes may have been, Ms. Nin was careful to include almost as much variety of experience as she could in her stories, which necessarily required her to include as much variety of character as possible. In other words, the narrative takes an obvious interest in the sexuality of these people, but it also takes an equally intense interest in the other parts of their lives, although without the same emphasis. So \\"Delta of Venus\\" approaches the whole person as a sensual being, and is all the more sensual for that. It's a lovingly humanist approach to the erotic. Yep, it's good fiction.Some of the psychology seems a little elementary in this day and age, and as with most erotica the characters are all impossibly attractive, but I for one find myself grateful to read stories about people enjoying each other's bodies with their minds and hearts fully functional. Whether they turn me on at that moment or not.Benshlomo says, The body is holy."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"If I had one book to take with me to an island paradise/exile, it would be this one. It's characters have real desires, qualms, fantasies and histories. It will excite you, remind you of past amours, and fill you with dreams and fantasies ofyour own. Most of all, if stuck on a tropical paradise all alone, it will make your exile more of a paradise than you would otherwise be able to hope for. No need to wait for rescue before fulfillment.."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Delectable is the word that sprung to mind while I read Delta of Venus. The stories are erotic to the core, but they also contain a great deal of symbolism and darkness. Rape, exhibitionism, voyeurism and incest are a few of the disarming and disturbing subject matters addressed in this book. My favorite stories are &quot;Boarding School,&quot; &quot;Mallorca,&quot; &quot;Manuel,&quot; and &quot;The Hungarian Adventurer.&quot; These stories enthralled me from beginning to end. They were a delectable reading experience! I look forward to reading more of Anais Nin's work in the future."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Brilliant, beautiful prose and an effortless ability to seemingly turn every action into an erotic act by the magic of her pen makes this collection of short stories not only great erotica but also great literature. Beautiful."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"There's absolutely no way you can call Anais Nin's lush erotica either 'smut' or 'pornography'. It is much to poetically, tastefully, artfully written to debase it with those negative terms. She delves into the soul of woman as no other writer, whether writing erotica or in her luminous diaries. Every woman should read her work to better understand her own soul's journey.....Her words take flight and transport you to inner landscapes too wonderful for words.......If my house were on fire and I could only save one author's works, it would be all of Ms. Nin's books that I own...."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"\\"He did not know that when the erotic and the tender aremixed in a woman, they form a powerful bond, almost a fixation,\\"and contrary to Pierre, one of her characters, Anas Nin can write a full doctoral dissertation on the matter. Teeming superlative eroticism and sensuality, Delta of Venus is the pre-eminent anthology of luxury from a feminine panorama, wherein each and every one of the rich though not-necessarily-explicit details are contemplated to the extreme. Prolific with lascivious, quixotic imagination, the fanciful and mystical substance of Nin's writings prove unfailing to delight the most passionless of readers."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful if you are stuck alone somewhere this is defenitely the book to have.Give a copy to everyone you know from your lover to your mother they will only say thank you"},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"A truly brilliant and breath-taking fusion of the art of writing and the art of love making. I have read and re-read this book countless times and each time discovered something new about it - like a precious gem when held in the sun, gives out a different shine with every turn and twist, each distinct from the previous yet equally dazzling! A note of caution, this book is not for the devout conventionalists! Everyone else, read it! you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I loved reading this! I felt like I was reading something I shouldn't be. I also hesitated taking it in public to read for fear people would think I'm a pervert, but you know what? I think the average Joe has no idea who Anais Nin is. And, if someone DID know, they would probably want to sit and discuss the book with me.I did have a good time and realized that we all are basically the same. Same wants, desires, needs and hopes."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I was a little worried when the first story featured a pedophile, but the rest of the stories were hot. I guess what turned people on back then can still turn them on now.

If you're attracted to the world she writes in (Paris in the early 40s, everyone smokes opium and lounges about wearing silk chiffon), it is a voluptuous dream and a serious turn on. If you're not, then you will be bored by the long descriptions of lips and thighs and smells and head trips. Some of the sex is scary-freaky, but you're so stoned by the prose you can't get too worried. I love making a little gift of this to lovers, with a sexy, nasty note in the flyleaf. Which is entirely in the spirit of the book. Spray it with some of your perfume first."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Apparently these pornographic novels was a commissioned work for an unknown book lover in Paris. Anas Nin seems to have an inclination towards describing sexual scenes bordering on tabu areas like violence and incest."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This is the second of her books I have read. I will not purchase anymore. I found it rather boring as I did her first book. Unfortunately I purchased both books at the same time. I would not recommend. There are so many more ... books out there that are better."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Capturing, as no one else has, the purely female language of sex and erotica, Anais Nin manages to expose a world of readers to how the women's erotic mind works.

Come see what erotica is really like."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I found a beautiful red hardcover copy of DELTA OF VENUS in a Red Cross Op-Shop.I paid 50 cents for it.It is now my favourite book.Seriously beautiful, poetic, intellectualised erotica.Overflowing with rich and sensuous imagery.It takes you away to another time and place."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Although it is true that Ms. Nin's gift for writing lush, expressive, sensual words makes this book successful as erotica, its dark presentation of the human psyche depressed me too much for me to enjoy the experience. Still, these stories enthrall me every time I read them.The New Yorker once published a parody of these stories entitled &quot;The Delts of Venus.&quot; Read it if you can find it! It's published in the &quot;Fierce Pajamas&quot; collection of humor writing."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"When I was 8 I peeped on my aunt breastfeeding through an open doorhole from which the knob had been removed. I blew into the hole to clear out some of the wood shavings, upon which a shard flew into my eye.This is how I feel about reading this book. I got what I deserved for being a voyeur and reading erotica on the sly. Just when you get lulled in by the good prose style of Anais Nin she stabs you in the eye.If erotica is supposed to give you the jollies, here is where I cringed:1. Incest (with both sexes)2. Pedophilia3. Female genital mutilationAll of these were involuntary acts of sex where a clearly stronger aggressor victimizes a weaker party, and sometimes a combination of these, and I'd only gotten through the first three stories!The worst part is I read before I sleep and I had a dream about a homosexual pedophile shortly after reading that story. I thought this would be a fun read but I kind of feel like the old Europe feel isn't all that sexy to me: Hungarians, Parisians in old Lima, that sort of thing. But Anais Nin writes well, so this review doesn't get 1 star."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This novel was the first book of erotica I had ever read and it got me started on a quest to discover and collect erotica. Many years and books later and it is still my favourite erotic novel, which I cherish. It's stories celebrate the true beauty that is passion, lust and desire. She writes the Art of love making in all it's intensity and creativeness. These short stories transports you to a truly secret sensual place, embracing the times that was modern paris in those days. Read this! Read it! Buy It! Love it!"},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I guess I was expecting better writing from Nin. I have heard so many good things about her writing and I have read a few books by one of her \\"good friends\\", Henry Miller, that I decided to pick up Delta of Venus and was a bit disappointed. In the introduction Anais Nin describes the conditions under which she wrote much of what is contained in this book. Some wealthy \\"collector\\" had commissioned erotica at the rate of $1/page and he was not interested in anything but the physical act of sex. Well, Nin delivered. Much of the content is the description of various sexual situations and lacks what I would consider art. Reading Delta of Venus I felt like I was reading a more tasteful version of Letters to Penthouse. I must admit, this is my first exposure to Nin so I am not saying she is not a gifted author. I understand she was commissioned to write stories of this nature, I'm just saying I expected something more."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Delta of Venus represents a new approach to an old literary form. Erotica has occupied the minds of women and men since the human race was created. Anais Nin has taken the telling of this style of entertainment to a new level. Unlike some recent releases about the sexual relationships between men and women, the writing does follow the rules of grammar without losing any of the excitment and intensity of the images the words create.This is a book for those of us who like erotica but are sick of the poor execution of the written word."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"A non stop chain of erotic encounters recounted with a perception and sensitivity only a woman can express.Mature, imaginative people will highly enjoy it. It is far superior to any more recent products."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This is truly one of the best in erotic literature if not THE best. She casts a spell over the reader and creates a world in which the most erotic and forbidden is plausible."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Like her diary, this is a book of unserpased passion and a acute sexual and sentual curiosity, that seems to be unquenchable. I recomend it to any who love Nin's works, or to those who enjoy life, love and lust"},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Anais Nin fills the pages of this book with well-spun stories all about our favorite subject, sex. From young virgins discovering their sexual impulses to dashing travelers engaging in exploits around the world, these stories are unforgettable. What's more, because Nin puts such great detail into the psychology behind sexuality, such as jealousy and pride, it paints a picture of human's sexual nature. Her feminine sensibilities allow her to explore risque sex in a way that feels almost clean enough to discuss over dinner... well, maybe dessert."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This is my first foray into classic erotica and Anais Nin is the best classic eroticist--??--known. I found the work to be very good, though some might say that it is a bit flowery--but then again, it was a different time when she wrote it. I really liked it and would recommend it to others, esp. those new to erotica as this is a good one to start with. I'd also recommend her other, more famous work,Henry and June: From \\"A Journal of Love\\" -The Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin (1931-1932). (Also watch the movie starring Uma Thurman--it's fantastic!!)"},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I remember the first time this book entered by Apt, in St louis. I was at SLU. It was Saturday afternoon, and the warm air shooting around the apt had us in shorts, we sat down on the bed and started reading this wonderful book.

I found myself searching for my book later in life to be able to enjoy this great writing."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"After I read this book I told all my friends read it. This is really more than erotica and sex, this is a work of art. You change the way you look and think at sex and erotica. Every night I remember the book and wish to reread it again and again.

I thought it was amazing! The stories seemed very erotic and well written. It was hard not to be impressed by how much passion and beauty that Nin captured in each one of the erotic encounters! Sadly, with erotica, it is the passion that is lost first, and Thank God Nin was a woman who could rise above the rest!I am sad to say though, that I normally re-read everything eventually, and in this case, I am unable to enjoy the book a second time. The emotion seems to be gone and to me that seems to be an indication that the plot was carrying my attention and not the writing itself.Not her best work, but I still highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This is a great book. I first discovered this book, when I was young, in my mothers dresser. Anis Nin had such a style that has always distinguished her work from just porn. She has an erotic beauty in her work. Who needs pictures?"},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I totally disagree with the reviewer who says that Ms. Nin doesn't vye for female rights. The stories in DoV show women as empowered. In those tales where they let go of their \\"empowerment\\" it is only, as you will notice, for a short time. The natural state of females in this text is sexually subversive, creative and soulful beings. Words like wanton harlot are hurled by threatened males on the make...Ms. nin will last for all time...because she summons the essence and sublime beauty of Venusian power like no other woman writer has before or since. Thanks God for Ms. Nin especially in this day and age when the desexualization of our entire culture by the cyber age has made sensuality and true erotica like DoV a thing of the past..."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This book doesn't even deserve a star. I just fell upon it, on a bookshelf with loads of old books in my house. I'm nearly 17 years old, and perhaps this book is the kind that you appreciate as you get older, but honestly, I don't see myself enjoying this book even in 20 years... I've read so many reviews raving about how 'poetic, sensual, wonderful' it is and what a talent the person is...sorry I don't see it!Anyone can write a bunch of sex stories. I didn't see anything poetic in the writing...it was plain. As for sensual and arousing? Hardly. It was crude, and vulgar. It was sex, sex, sex... and presented harshly, with none of the sensuality, the sweetness, the gentle pleasure one likes to associate with sex... it was boring, repetitive, and I'll admit disturbing.What was the point of the story where the Hungarian whatever forced himself on his adolescent children? Or the raped little boy? It was just weird. There's just the sex, and no development of any points she may be trying to make. It's kind of just left there...unfinished... unsatisfying. Frankly, it was so distasteful (VULGAR), I was shocked. And I'm not religious, puritan, conservative or any such thing...quite the opposite, I have an open mind. But this book left me cold."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I hope more and more people will discover the flame in her writings - and see the frustration and the real pain in this hard living woman.

Trying to understand why anyone would think it to be wonderful, beautiful, sensual or erotic. It is just the opposite. I don't care what time period it was writing in! I am open minded but there is just some stuff that is JUST PLAIN SICK! She writes beautifully but i don't think genital mutilation, raping kids or necrophilia is OK! Not to mention incest or both sexes.

Nin is always ahead of the game in exploratory erotica!"},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"Hmm - why is this book such a bore? Surely the appeal of erotica is in reading about things that cannot normally be discussed; ideas that would not normally be thinkable, behaviour that would not normally be permissable. So what does it say when none of the sad packs appearing in these short stories manage to bring forth any concepts which are novel, surprising or confronting? Incest, necrophilia, exhibitionism all get a look in, but in a way which is unappealing - the book seems to assume an audience with the traditional Western attributes of repressed sexuality, a belief that sex in sinful, and hatred of the human body. To answer my own question, the implicit assumptions that pleasure is evil, sexuality is sinful and that people are ugly, is what makes it a bore."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I tore this book to shreds after I read it. Though the book is charming at times and intelligent once or twice, it is built on the premise that only the unfamiliar is erotic. Nin has written the same basic story over and over here: woman encounters stranger, has sex with stranger, experiences epiphany. I wanted nothing more than to stop reading, or to discover something truly erotic within the stories -- trust me. It isn't there. DON'T FALL FOR THE HYPE!"},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"This was the worse book I ever read!!! Nothing but a bunch of bizard sexual stories that go no where.

I had nightmares for years about being sexually molested and was often afraid of boys and men. Now in my early twenties, I realize that the detached style of narration does not mean that the author condones these acts or implies that they are normal and healthy (I refer especially to the rape and pedophilia), and that is a unique, even ground-breaking book due to Nin's style and breadth of imagination.However, I still think no review of this book is complete without this caveat: Some of what is protrayed is not erotic--it is violent and abusive.Please, keep this book out of the reach of kids and yes, I would say even teenagers who may not be mature enough to comprehend that difference. Leave something lying around that portrays healthy, loving relationships."},{"Title":"Delta of Venus","review":"I have read many books more exciting than this one. I thought it was very bland. She is a good writer but perhaps the subject matter was a little outdated. I will not read her works again."},{"Title":"Your Old Wiring","review":"This book is a great resource for the non-professional who has to evaluate and/or repair old residential electrical systems. It is well-organized, thoroughly safety-oriented, and practical. The author, David E. Shapiro, is a master electrician with substantial experience. He not only translates the National Electrical Code into practical advice for the do-it-yourselfer, he isn't afraid to express his opinions and recommendations, which is rare in this kind of book. This kind of practical advice, based on long experience, is more valuable than the just-the-facts approach taken by so many DIY authors.There are two problems with the book, however, and both are related to the graphics. Many of the photographs are blurry or otherwise unhelpful, and there are a number of places in the text where more phtotographs or illustrations would be quite helpful. I would have given this book five stars if the graphics were done as professionally as the text.Finally, the book doesn't really deal with the \\"knob-and-tube\\" type wiring found in many older homes. The author is clear that many subjects are beyond the scope of this entry-level book, and knob-and-tube is one of the subjects that doesn't make it in."},{"Title":"Your Old Wiring","review":"I expected the photos to be hard to discern, as it was stated by other reviewers. As a Master Electrician, I found that this is not the case. Apparently, the photos are not for amateurs, since it requires someone who has actually seen such wiring \\"in the flesh\\" to really understand them.No other book deals with old wiring so well. The subject is too often neglected by the industry.The author wisely recommends consulting an experienced electrician. Unfortunately, too many young ones do not understand old wiring and many old ones are up to date with the current electric code."},{"Title":"Your Old Wiring","review":"I found this book incredibly helpful in dealing with a 1950's house with basically good wiring...Shapiro doesn't pull any punches and only tells you what you need to know to safely do basic electrical maintenance."},{"Title":"Your Old Wiring","review":"My thoughts reflect the previous reviews pretty much. This book has been excellent at helping me deal with my home's 1950's era wiring. The major drawback to the book is the photographs. There are many photographs that I imagine would be very helpful, except that they are in black and white and it is extremely difficult to tell what exactly the pictures contain. Other than that, excellent book."},{"Title":"Your Old Wiring","review":"I thought the book was a bit pricey and most of what I've read so far isn't very advanced.

This is the rare volume, and rare author in non-fiction, where there simply is NOTHING that can in any way substitute. Both his books on old electrical wiring (the other being \\"Old Electrical Wiring\\") cover real-world situations that those of us who have, or have worked on, a really old house have had. Other books, particularly the Black and Decker wiring volume offer wonderful pictures and diagrams--everything clean and antiseptic and new. That is fine if you are working in a house stripped of it's wallboard, or replacing an outlet in a newer building. This is the book to save, upgrade, and repair 40+ year old wiring systems. If you want something more advanced, the same author has the book \\"Old Electrical Wiring\\" (with a new edition coming out fall 2010.) It does have some faults, no in-depth discussion of repairing knob and tube wiring and not the best pictures ever. Despite these faults, the information is so unique and so valuable to people with old wiring that I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Your Old Wiring","review":"This is one of the best advanced primers on electrical work that I've seen. It requires a thoughtful read to absorb its details and mindset that stresses the myriad dangers arising from old, sloppy installations. The book's thoroughness teaches the novice to recognize limits. It is worth many times its price for making the homeowner intelligible on electrical concepts and terms, a useful skill to have when consulting with professionals. I've been reading it on and off for years, and always gain new insights. Definitely worth five stars, especially for knowledge that could save a life."},{"Title":"Your Old Wiring","review":"Sorry to say this book was not of any use to me. Ive been an electrician for 20 plus years. Mostly industrial work. I wish I could get my money back. I used to teach electricians in the Air Force.

I never even finished reading the book. It was full of alot of useless fluff.

In her book she not only tells the particular story of her own family, she evokes a time &amp; place in this country when the sons &amp; daughters of immigrants tried to find their place in America. The book tells a colorful story of a small time crook &amp; dandy - one of the foot soldiers in the Cleveland bootlegging rackets. His violent life &amp; death continues to affect the wife &amp; 2 small children he left behind throughout their lives. Hughes manages to convey a child's sense of bewilderment as she tries to piece together just who this father was &amp; what his legacy to her will be.The book is also the story of Hughes relationship with her mother, a difficult &amp; complex woman who emotionally victimizes her young daughter throughout her childhood. How she is able to break the bonds that tie her to her mother &amp; learns to live a productive &amp; happy life is the real story of this memoir.This is an interesting read for anyone who's taken the journey through their own family history. Although it's filled with the pain of a lonely &amp; emotionally abandoned child, the woman Hughes becomes is able to triumph in the end."},{"Title":"Lost and Found: A Daughter's Tale of Violence and Redemption","review":"The reconstruction of an evidently miserable childhood and equally miserable marriage results in a rather tedious memoir, Lost and Found: A Daughter's Tale of Violence and Redemption.Adding to the current spate of dysfunctional family tell-alls, Ms. Hughes weaves the story of her life to date by alternating imagination enhanced childhood scenes with psychiatric sessions.We learn that her father, Lou Rosen, a bootlegger was murdered by the Cleveland Mafia when the author was two. Her mother told her that he had died of pneumonia, but to Ms. Hughes's child's mind he had simply disappeared.A young widow, 27-years-of-age, her mother \\"has been a bootlegger's wife long enough to understand the code\\": no one will harm her if she does not speak. She retreats behind a wall of silence, emerging only in fits and starts - fits of uninhibited vituperation and starts of moving from job to job and apartment to apartment.A negligent mother at best, she had been so misused by her own mother that she had spent 12 years of her young life in an orphanage. For Ms. Hughes and her older brother Kenny home becomes a series of rooms where they subsisted on Chinese take-out in cardboard boxes and feared that their mother would suffer another asthma attack.Ms. Hughes pretty much went wherever she pleased and to school whenever she pleased before dropping out of high school to model in local department stores. Eventually she visits the public library and consults old newspapers where she learns the truth about her father's death.Kenny does not return home after college but for Ms. Hughes there is only one escape from her mother's diatribes and unrelenting possession - marriage. At the age of 18 she weds Nate, \\"a well known prosperous businessman, a catch.......Nate was Prince Charming in a red convertible come to save me.\\"Despite a lavish home, servants, travel, a 55 foot yacht, and all the accouterment of wealth that Nate showers upon her, this is still not a Cinderella story. Ms. Hughes has no kind words for her husband, instead finding him boorish and cruel.Finally, she is driven to despair and begins the lengthy ritual of analysis. She seems to have had a love-hate relationship with her psychiatrist, Dr. Herman, yet credits him with helping her find the courage to continue her education and divorce Nate.She buys her doctor a gift, writing, \\"I wanted to give Dr. Herman something for helping me stop the steam roller that my father had started, my mother had fueled, and Nate had damn near driven over me.\\"There's that \\"me\\" again which is what Lost and Found is all about. What about the three children she had? They do not even emerge as stick figures in this biography. Do they feel as neglected as she once did or did she reverse the family pattern and nurture them with maternal affection? We hope so.There are few insights to be gleaned from Ms. Hughes's story. Indeed, many may sympathize with the troubles she endured simply because of the family into which she was born. While others may echo what that famed psychiatrist Lucy once said, \\"Get over it!\\"- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Lost and Found: A Daughter's Tale of Violence and Redemption","review":"This is a book I couldn't put down. Babette Hughes' story is tragic and devastating, yet redemptive and triumphant. The dichotomy of her relationship with her mother is eloquently depicted; I could just hear and feel her saying, &quot;yes, I love her--no, I don't.&quot; It must have taken great courage to overcome her fear and then lay it open for all of us to share. It is the kind of life that should make all of our marginally disfunctional lives seem perfect in comparison. I'm recommending this book for my book group and anyone else I know who reads."},{"Title":"Pentium Pro Processor System Architecture","review":"Suitable as a fast introduction to the Pentium Pro,but limited only to that. Gives an overview of thefeatures that distinguish the chip from the Pentiumprocessors. A decent description of the processor'spipeline.

Selous was one of the giants of Vitorian Africa and in this work, written at the urging of President Theodore Roosevelt, he compiles many of his most keen observations about life and wildlife in Africa. Fascinating not only as a period piece, Selous's thoughts are remarkably prescient about the state of game in Africa even today. Though it was written before the rise of the commercial poaching that has ravaged so much of the continent, the book gives an excellent insight into the need to carefully observe, record, and interpret the ecological signs found in the wild. Clear and lively in style, the tales told within encompass everything from dietary habits of hyaena to the effects of sleeping sickness on agriculture. Especially interesting are the authors remarkably forward-thinking ideas on race relations, ideas that would not become the rule in southern Africa for over 75 years. An altogether satisfying read."},{"Title":"African nature notes and reminiscences,","review":"I have read plenty of elephant hunting volumes in the likes of Bell, Stigand and several others but this Selousbook is different. It's not entirely an account of Selous'adventures with his rifle but rather as the first portion ofthe book's title suggests, an informative wrap-up of the ways and characteristics of various African game. Selous is a unsurpassable raconteur when it comes to telling of big game, as this book proves. There's a chapter on Selous' search for the elusive inyala antelope, and it is of great interest. A book well worth parting with your cash for. Simply a true must-buy !"},{"Title":"The Lost Cities of Africa","review":"Davidson's contribution is masterfully presented and I came away with the impression that he is a leading authority. However, this book is lacking in two area. First, there is a stunning dearth of illustration, in a book that should be replete with maps of trade routes, city outlines, and illustrations of artifacts. The reader is left wondering where just where did all of these event happen? Second, the text is too obviously derived from lectures, in that it often repeats and reasserts points that the reader has likely accepted several chapters ago. This makes for dull reading. I have long awaited such a book, knowing that such a history had only to be revealed. Although I learned a great deal from this text, I was on the whole disappointed by the presentation because it detracts from what the book has to offer.

In other words, I approached this novel with very little in the way of expectations and, perhaps for that very reason, was simply amazed at my good fortune. This story, itself one that does not easily fit into any genre niche, is without a doubt one of the two or three most poignant modern novels this reader has ever had the pleasure of encountering...made &quot;Papa Kurt&quot;(Vonnegut) sound tired and blase'. Embued with vivid, striking imagery...plot turns impossible to forsee, yet satisfyingly logical...complex in its multilayerings, but as smooth as a luminous egg...an absolutely staggering ending, very hard to describe. I finished the book feeling awed and humbled. Snippets of dialogue, fantastic scenes, emotional depths, these and more swirled through my mind for weeks afterword. If Lucius Shepard's powers were not yet fully matured when he wrote this, I daresay he may write THE best fantastic story of our generation."},{"Title":"Green Eyes","review":"I read this book when it was first published because of a Damon Knight Blurb on the cover: &quot;I wonder if anyone else knows what a good writer Lucius Shepard is?&quot; Being a Damon Knight fan I bought the book on his recommedation. Because of the book I read all of Shepard's books.Green Eyes was one of those delightful books you find now and then that you read non-stop. It appears to be three novelettes of differing genres put together to make a novel, but woven together with such skill it becomes a whole. Because of the three separate parts to the novel I had no idea where Shepard was going with this story. If you are lucky enough to find a copy of this book I envy your first reading."},{"Title":"Green Eyes","review":"This is Shepard's first book, and he knocks it out of the park. It begins with a fascinating concept: if you can revive the recently dead, for just a few minutes, what will they tell you? What have they seen while dead?And then, the story takes off in completely unexpected ways, and the book becomes completely unique, spanning genres and confounding expectations.If you like horror, if you like SF, if you like fantasy, this will fulfill your expectations."},{"Title":"Green Eyes","review":"Unique, unexpected and original, this book lured me in with its fascinating premise of raising the dead, whose brains then advance in intellectual and metaphysical ways.

Dealing with those twin foes of love and war, it challenges the reader not only to 'navigate' through the novel in a manner satisfactory to them but also in such a way as to do justice to Moulthrop's well-woven story.The novel is set against the background of the Gulf War and the accompanying media frenzy. Imagery and symbolism become important elements in enhancing the reading experience and an appreciation for world avents is helpful but not crucial in reading the lexias.The novelty of having a map to navigate with rather than a contents page encourages reader participation as you follow the lives of Emily Runbird, her family and friends as they battle 'the enemy'.Moulthrop demonstrates to us that hypertext novels are far from boring with his clever use of typography, illustration and the best element of all, surprise. This is a prime of example of how the multi-layers act to give each reader a unique reading experience.Take a stroll through the garden -- I guarantee that you'll be surprised."},{"Title":"THE THREE FAT MEN A Novel For Children","review":"this is the most fantastic book i have ever read. i had read this book when i was just 10 and i used to read this book twice a month. the most important feaure of this book is that the reader is completely absorbed in this book from beginnin to end. dr. gasper is very interesting character. he can do anything. suok is so beatiful and adventurous. the struggle against three fat men is described in the best possible interesting manner.this book is responsible for making me so adventurous. after reading this book i tried to walk on rope ( as suok does this with perfection) .i recommend this book as the best birthday gift for any child."},{"Title":"THE THREE FAT MEN A Novel For Children","review":"Yes, this is an ideological piece written to glamorise the Soviet revolution etc etc, but in reality, it's a great book that can be enjoyed by anyone from children that are old enough to appreciate the idea of justice (quite early).Set in a fictional, magical Italian-type world, the tale tells of a revolution in a country that is ruled by a greedy and immoral aristocracy (that indulges opulently while the populace starves) headed by the Three Fat Men. The men have a young boy Tutti who they are raising as their heir. To make him cruel they forbid contact with children allowing him only a doll for a companion and they build a zoo with wild animals so that he learns cruelty.The book begins with the capture and encagement of the revolutionary Prospero and the breaking of Tutti's doll.

At once a peculiarly hilarious satire full of magic and whimsy, it is also a beautifully written work of literature, brimming with profound metaphors and brilliant turns of phrase. Aplin has done a masterful job with the translation, capturing all of Olesha's wit and whimsy, while dulling none of his satirical barbs. This is a \\"fairy tale\\" ostensibly written for children, but which will be even more appreciated by grown-ups.As reviewed inRussian Life"},{"Title":"THE THREE FAT MEN A Novel For Children","review":"I read this book as a child, and found it memorable and engrossing, with wonderful illustrations. It was quite different from any of the other children's books available - the folk tales and fairy-tale, the Blytons and Nancy Drews. I picked up another copy years later - not nearly as attractively produced, but still a wonderful book. I'd strongly recommend this for boys and girls of 9 upward."},{"Title":"THE THREE FAT MEN A Novel For Children","review":"Many praise Olesha's \\"Envy\\", but I prefer \\"The Three Fat Men\\" to it, firstly, because it is better written and, secondly, because \\"Envy\\" deals with the reality of post-Revolution Russia, which is as rough as a piece of emery paper, whereas \\"The Three Fat Men\\" is a fairy tail describing a magical world. There is little magical, however, in \\"The Three Fat Men\\", the fairy tail is basically a revolutionary pathos about destruction of the old and creation of the new. It is written in a very cheerful spirit, mostly imitating old French and Italian tale-tellers. It is not for no reason that settings, names of characters seem French and Italian. Even though \\"The Three Fat Men\\" was written under the author's impression of the Soviet revolt of 1917, it bears no mark of pro-communism or any other political orientation. Therefore, it should be enjoyed by children of all countries."},{"Title":"Middle Grades Language Arts Book (Basic Not Boring)","review":"Purchased this for my daughter who will be starting 7th grade.

The rapid-fire chapters create quirky memorable, but beyond all else truly real characters. The life which Miller breathes into these creations is full and colorful and engaging. While the tale of small-town life, it holds a quality of relevance for anyone looking for answers or courage in the face of adversity. BIg Cicadas is a book to which I know I'll be returning on a regular basis."},{"Title":"Big Cicadas","review":"I received a copy of Big Cicadas just after it hit the bookstore shelves. It went right into the stack on my desk, in the queue for summer reading but with about fifteen others ahead of it. Then the stack got knocked over, reshuffled and BC wound up on top... I wish it had happened sooner.Reading Big Cicadas was my first diversion in several years from biography, historical fiction or action/adventure. But then, Big Cicadas has elements of all three in a homey, thoroughly enjoyable small town fashion.It is the biography of every stranger who ever settled in a small town where everyone knew everyone else and where visitors were more welcome than new settlers.It's a journal of small town-style adventure. The author sets the stage so effectively with his writing style that even the most worldly of readers finds excitement in the same day to day events as the story's characters.And it is history and sociology as well.Still Creek is a 90's town with 50's values. Here the residents are content to enjoy the seasons while the town drifts into the next stage of sociological evolution in its own good time.I recognized all the characters and all the scenes from my own youth. The sights and sounds of summer, the voices, the people, the tragedy and the recovery... all were as real and believable as a childhood memory. The author's gift for seamless joining of dialogue and scene description makes the small town action move along like a ride on a super train - fast, smooth and satisfying.I'm looking forward to Gregory Miller's next effort."},{"Title":"Big Cicadas","review":"&quot;Big Cicadas&quot; is a modest but remarkably accomplished first novel. Gregory Miller renders the many facets of small-town life -- bright and dark, salutary and sinister -- with a skill that evokes Sherwood Anderson's &quot;Winesburg, Ohio,&quot; and the author's talent for capturing the inner lives of young people took me back to Ray Bradbury's &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; and Stephen King's &quot;Stand By Me.&quot;In Jay Jarvis, Miller has given us a believable and fascinating protagonist, a principled individualist reminiscent of Mersault in Albert Camus's &quot;The Stranger.&quot; The central mystery -- why won't Jarvis sign a manifestly rational and benevolent petition? -- comes to a surprising and satisfying resolution.So this is a novel with many influences -- but ultimately Miller transcends them to give us his own unique voice and vision. Readers of all literary tastes will fondly recall the hours they spent in Still Creek, Pennsylvania, with its suspenseful eddies and subtle currents."},{"Title":"Big Cicadas","review":"Completing the school year for a teacher is a rewarding experience. The summer that follows is a time of renewal, self-exploration, and a time to pamper yourself in you own pleasures. Gregory Miller's first fiction venture was the greatest of these pleasures for this public school educator. Having dealt with the complexities of leaving my home in a small Pennsylvania town that really does not understand anything (nor does it want to know anything) outside of itself I can appreciate the views that Miller has presented. This is an excellent read I would recomend to anybody who has ever had to come to terms with being able to see outside the walls that their home has established for itself... I too look forward to future works of the author..."},{"Title":"Big Cicadas","review":"Gregory Miller's first novel is an easy, entertaining, and thought provoking read that examines life in smalltown Pennsylvania. As a resident of the state, he captures the nuance of life here with precise brush strokes, while managing to examine larger themes of friendship, growing up, gossip in small communities, and a host of other issues. This book is very layered and a huge accomplishment for a first time author. Big Cicadas is to Pennsylvania what Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Born to Run&quot; is to the state of New Jersey."},{"Title":"Big Cicadas","review":"I was very, very pleased with this book. Although I don't normally read fiction, the plot of 'Big Cicadas' appealed to me and I found it to be a very quick read. The greatest thing about it is the development of the main character, Jay Jarvis, which is achieved through vignettes, flashbacks, observations, events, and even the achievements of other characters. In the end I felt I knew him, and I could certainly relate to him.I also like the pacing of 'Big Cicadas,' which is achieved through short chapters that often don't, on the surface, seem to have anything to do with one another. By the end, however, Miller weaves everything together with dexterity and finesse...There's one moment in the book when I sat back and said, &quot;Ah!&quot; Everything fell into place.Finally, the overall message of the book struck me forcefully -- I won't give anything away, but I will say that in the end, 'Big Cicadas' could easily be viewed as a kind of elemental tale. Certainly it transcends its setting. Most certainly, it left me with a feeling of hope."},{"Title":"Big Cicadas","review":"&quot;Big Cicadas&quot; is a pleasant surprise that stays with you long after you finish it. It reveals its story through short vignettes that capture the feel of a life lived in a small Pennsylvania community in its many facets and through subtle imagery that allows the reader to see the characters both as they see themselves and as others see them. Nothing ponderous here! Just a great read."},{"Title":"Big Cicadas","review":"Big Cicadas was recommeded to me by a friend and as this was the first published novel of Greg Miller, I didn't know quite what to expect. However, despite the fact that this was his first novel, it immediately was clear to me that Mr. Miller has mastered the quality of not overusing language. His words were simple and precise, yet also very moving and affective. It reminded me a little of Richard Yates, an author I hold in the highest esteem.Big Cicadas tells the story of Jay Jarvis. Jay has led a simple life in a little town in Pennsylvania and after one of his students Jeff dies from drowning, he begins to reassess his life and in essense tries to 'find himself.' It is a journey that has been chronicled many times but Miller manages to add fresh insights to it. Jay is relatable character and his dilemma is a universal one.The book flows very well and once you start reading it, you won't want to put it down until it is over. Miller makes great descriptions both of his characters and small town life. I highly recommend this book and am looking forward to reading more of Greg Miller's work."},{"Title":"Big Cicadas","review":"Big Cicadas is enjoyable on many levels. The story begins with Jay Jarvis, a middle school teacher in the small town of Still Creek, living his comfortable life. But the teacher's life starts to crumble when he doesn't conform to his community's wishes. This novel successfully investigates the journey Jarvis takes to remain an individual mind in a community of conformers. When Jarvis looks to his past for help, his character's depth is amplified. The writing style is intelligent and effective. Also, Miller infuses feeling into his characters. One conversation in Big Cicadas comes to mind that had a powerful emotional impact on me. I especially enjoyed the conclusion where I felt everything just fell into place. This novel was an excellent read. I've already recommended it to many of my friends."},{"Title":"Big Cicadas","review":"This book is a great read. Simple and short. Straight to the point. Many different stories that come together in the end. A sad beginning leading up to a wonderful ending make. The book takes you inside the characters. You become one of the members of the small Pennsylvainia town, and are not just an outsider looking in. You are not just reading the words, you are living them. Greg Miller creates a small town and brings it to life in this exciting and emotional novel. A definate read."},{"Title":"Index to the Code of Canon Law: In English Translation","review":"This book is only an index, and one must have the British (not the American) translation of the 1983 Code of Canon Law in order to use it properly.

I have never read a Gilchrist book before, but am a huge fan of Stephen Pressfield's books and was inspired to read Green's and Kagin's accounts of the Greco-Persian and Peloponesian wars. I stumbled on this book by accident and found it to be tremendously entertaining. Yes, the characters might be developed more but I did not find this a serious distraction. I would compare it to Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea - some things are not fleshed out, but there are so many parts that are stunningly good that the book overall is quite worthwhile."},{"Title":"Anabasis: A Journey to the Interior","review":"I'm writing this review partly because of the one-star review. My own view of the book is somewhat different. I have read all of Ellen Gilchrist's books and would say this one is not her best work, but still worth a read. As with other of her books, the social milieu and the relationships of the characters are where the interest and focus really lie. I have to believe she did plenty of research before writing this book because it mostly rings true. If you haven't read Gilchrist, you might want to give this one a try later, after you read Net of Jewels, or The Annunciation, or I Cannot Get You Close Enough."},{"Title":"Anabasis: A Journey to the Interior","review":"I read about half-way through this book and found that I just did not have the desire to finish it. I feel the author did not work hard enough at interpolating appropriate details to create an atmosphere. She probably put a lot of work in, but not enough for me."},{"Title":"Anabasis: A Journey to the Interior","review":"Ellen Gilchrist does a splendid job in re-living ancient Greece for modern times. She entitles her novel ANABASIS, the title the Xenophon uses to describe the march against the Persian king. Auria, the principal character of her novel, is a brave Greek girl who stands up to traditional society in word and action. This is particularly important because the setting of the novel takes place in the time of Pericles, Athens' ablest leader; however, as he dies from the plague, everything deteriorates. Auria compares well to Greek heroines who had equally important functions. One Greek writer was Euripides who protrayed the brave TROJAN WOMEN in similar fashion. Ellen Gilchrist had learned about ancient Greece from her mother, and she does a splendid job in making it relevant to the contemporary time. When compared to all her other writings - at least the ones I have read - , ANABASIS is based on a time she has learned about whereas all her other writings take place in times she herself has experienced."},{"Title":"Anabasis: A Journey to the Interior","review":"Rather than my own summary, I am fine with this Publishers Weekly excerpt: \\"During the Peloponnesian War (431-404 B.C.) between Athens and Sparta, Auria, a runaway slave girl, transforms herself into a warrior, healer, lyceum teacher, painter, ceramist, poet, songwriter and fiercely loving adoptive mother of an infant girl whom she rescues from a cave.\\"I like actual history in historical fiction.

Otherwise, move on."},{"Title":"Strangers In My Sleeper","review":"This is a good book, and fun to read. It could use more and better maps so you can follow where he's going more easily. The pictures are postage-stamp size grainy black-and-white photos at chapter headings. There should have been one or more photo sections like many books have, with larger pictures.So 4 stars for the writing, 2 stars for the lack of maps/photos, average it out to 3 stars.If you're expecting a Bill Bryson style book that will have you giggling you'll be disappointed. This is more like a Paul Theroux travelogue minus some of the cynicism."},{"Title":"Blooming: A Small-Town Girlhood","review":"Susan Allen Toth first appeared on my radar screen with her three volumes of travel essays on England (My Love Affair with England: A Traveler's Memoir,England for All Seasons,England as You Like It). She's a soul mate. In BLOOMING, penned in the late 70s, Ms. Toth shares coming-of-age memories as delightful as those from another of my favorite authors, Laura Shaine Cunningham (Sleeping Arrangements, A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY).Susan was born in 1940, and BLOOMING is her account of life in Ames, Iowa until she went East to college in 1957. The ability to relate will increase to the degree that the reader's background shares commonality with the following: maturing in the late 40s and 50s, living in a Midwest plains state, being female. I can only claim identity with the first, but that limited coincidence didn't affect my ability to thoroughly enjoy this volume.Toth's remarkable memory of her childhood and teenage years could serve as the source for Norman Rockwell paintings as she remembers swimming pools, boyfriends, girlfriends, science classes, the public library, parties, summer jobs, the traditional holidays, and yearly trips to the Minnesota lake where relatives owned a cabin. She was unusually reticent about her immediate family. We learn only that her father died when she was in the third grade, and she and her sister were raised by their mother, a teacher. This absence of familial information is somewhat disappointing as it's perhaps a gold mine of stories not told. For instance, Susan writes about her sister, one year older:\\"My sister and I, who fought most of the time, declared an unspoken truce on Christmas morning and hugged awkwardly as we exchanged gifts. For those brief moments, we really wanted to please each other.\\" So, what did they fight over? Boys? Clothes? Maternal attention?The realist might point out that most of the world's children, and many in America, didn't live formative years as idyllic as depicted in BLOOMING. True enough. But I lived the male version in Southern California, and Toth's was sufficiently similar in rhythm to remind me of those Good Ol' Days when I didn't know how good I had it. Thank you, Susan."},{"Title":"Blooming: A Small-Town Girlhood","review":"Once I began reading this great book, it was hard to take a break for even mealtimes. When I was growing up here in Ohio during the 1950s, it was quite a bit like in the author's story. Not perfect, but a very good life!"},{"Title":"Blooming: A Small-Town Girlhood","review":"It's a refreshing Step Back In Time reading. Difficult to believe such an era ever existed. Today's readers will learn a lot about how to live a simpler, equally enjoyable life."},{"Title":"Blooming: A Small-Town Girlhood","review":"Growing up in 1950's Ames, Iowa presented the picture perfect childhood for author Susan Allen Toth. Toth lived in Ames until she left to go to school in the East in 1957. Sharing memories of competing/battling with her older sister, school, summers at the pool, girlfriends, fashions, slumber parties, dating, finding refuge at the library, getting a summer job and trips to the family cabin on a lake in Minnesota, Toth paints an idyllic childhood. It wasn't until a bit later I learned her father died while she was in grade school, and her mother worked as a teacher to support their family. Perhaps it is her ability to recall only that which took place in her immediate world. She has a gift of recalling an experience, an adventure and with words transporting her reader to that very time and place. Not only does she evoke the experience but the emotions. I grew up in Texas a decade later and had a very different childhood, but shared the same type memories.Blooming is the first in what I consider a trilogy of Toth books. The next book details her college experiences at an Ivy League school and the third is a must read for anyone planning to attend their high school reunion. Each book benefits from her growing awareness and her realization that the world is not just Ames, Iowa. Each is touching and funny. Start with Blooming and read all three. These are book that are great to return to when you need the comfort of a familiar old friend."},{"Title":"Blooming: A Small-Town Girlhood","review":"A superbly written book.

I also didn't see her motivations of &quot;going east&quot; for college, such as restlessnes or desire to do &quot;better&quot; than her friends. however, I could truely appreciate her apprehension on the train ride."},{"Title":"Blooming: A Small-Town Girlhood","review":"If you were born and raised in the Midwest during the 40's and 50's you will have many happy memories reading this book!

When one of her friends starts to date a boy that is out of their circle she suggests that her friends class finally shows. She is an avid reader but seems so unconnected to anything that is going on in the world. I don't think she would have been someone that I would have been interested in when I grew up in the fifties. I thought it was a story going no where and had a hard time finishing it."},{"Title":"Blooming: A Small-Town Girlhood","review":"I am not going to say much about this book. I had to read it for a class. In today's society, we get bombarded with ideas that it was really different growing up in the 50's compared to now. I think that this book is low on the substance with too many, oh yeah I can relate to that time."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"In general, I enjoyed this book; Seth Mnookin is a good writer, if a little bland, and the book flowed nicely. But it had plenty of problems. Let's make a list:The Good1)It's easy to understand, even if you don't know too much about baseball. I consider myself an avid Red Sox fan and a baseball connoisseur, so explanations of ERA and batting average bored me, but it does make the book more inclusive to a wider audience. It also includes a brief history of the team for those that are less familiar with it.2)There are plenty of entertaining anecdotes and side stories in here. The sections on Nomar are particularly well-done. I now have more background information on the Red Sox ownership troika than I would have ever thought possible. What an interesting group of people.3)The section on the sale of the team would make a new book in and of itself, and is very well-done and interesting, providing you have a rudimentary understanding of economics and finance. If you don't, or hate numbers, prepare to be bored silly and skip about 75 pages.4)There is a lot of new information on the process that brought about the Schilling trade. I found the tale of Jed Hoyer's ugly Thanksgiving stomach virus to be two of the funniest paragraphs in the whole book, though I'm sure Jed would disagree.5)And, of course, the famous Epstein/Lucchino rift is very well-documented and traced, to the point that I found myself getting frustrated with the characters for not noticing that Theo was acting increasingly bizarre and doing something about it months earlier. If Mnookin noticed, somebody else should have. A very nice job leading into the final explosion.The bad:1)I said there is a lot of background information that makes it more inclusive for casual fans. This is true, but the corollary is that if you are a true Red Sox fan, many parts of this book will drive you batty. The entire history of the team section at the beginning is largely irrelevant to the rest of the book, and Mnookin spends way too much time rehashing information that most respectable Sox fans already know, like descriptions of games and whatnot. It really slogs at times.2)For a guy who spent all this time with the Red Sox front office, he sure didn't include as much revelatory material as I thought he would. It was a disappointment. Casual fans may be impressed, but hard-core Red Sox fans will recognize many of his insights as already being common knowledge from Boston Globe or even AP stories.3)The style is easy to follow but also fairly pedantic and dry.4)Mnookin does a good job with the Epstein/Lucchino fiasco right up until Theo quits, and then after that his analysis is severely lacking. I realize that he was not with the team much after this point, but given that this was one of the most momentous things to occur in the history of the ownership group, which was exactly what he was writing about, you'd think he might put things off a little bit to try to gain more insight into what was going on.5)The book gives a very sympathetic portrayal of pretty much every character except Dan Shaughnessy. Not that there is a problem with portraying Shaughnessy as a jerk, because he is. But John Henry is not a saint. Tom Werner is not a saint. Larry Lucchino sure isn't a saint (to be fair, his portrayal was more negative). And I got the distinct impression that Mnookin didn't have nearly as much insight into Epstein as he did into the ownership troika. That's not to say there wasn't any, because there was, and I understand that Epstein is not, by nature, eager to open up to someone like Mnookin, but it was noticeable.5)The pictures. Funny thing to get upset about, I know. But he spent a year there. Did he bring a camera? There isn't one single picture of the Fenway offices or any of the characters at work or with Mnookin or any such thing. No pictures of Joe O'Donnell or any lesser characters. I recognized every single photo from the Globe or AP except the one of Theo against some graffiti-covered wall. Visuals would be nice, thanks.I'd recommend the book, but be prepared for it not to be quite what you thought it was going to be."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"I love this book. I was 10 in 1967 when I first joined \\"The Nation,\\" and your summaries of games of the past is spot on, including things I remember and things I had completely forgotten about. Reading Feeding the Monster was like reading about your immediate family, with parts you want to relive and parts that are painful to think about. I read it through so quickly because I couldn't wait to find out what happened in every chapter, even though I obviously already knew the final results. Then I went back and read it more slowly and savored every page. I'm glad the book sets the record straight for a lot of us about what happened with the team historically, the sale of the team to John Henry, and what goes on now behind closed doors most of us could have never hoped to open. I've never read anything that had such amazing details about a team's makeup, about player negotiations, and about the pressures of playing (and working) in sports (or in Boston). I've also never read such poetic descriptions (and intimate details) about what goes on on the field and how the players do what they do. The chapters on David Ortiz are worth it in and of themselves. I'd recommend it not just to Red Sox fans but to baseball fans, people who want to learn about American business, and people interested in social history. Even Yankees fans will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"After reading all of the hype about this book, I was prepared to be disappointed. Between all the reviews and articles, I thought I had read all of the revelations. I was totally wrong and I've never had a perspective like this one. I've read many, many books about the sport and have never read anything that combined management and ownership and players and the on-field aspect like this one. I think it's probably something I'll go back and read repeatedly as time goes on, like \\"9 Innings\\" and \\"Moneyball\\" and \\"Ball Four\\" combined into one.Because people are so passionate about the Red Sox and about baseball I suspect there will be lots of different reactions to the book. Already it seems to have angered those who think they're the only \\"true\\" fans. Take the review in the Globe, where the writer (a host of a sports show) said he would prefer to remain ignorant (his words, not mine) about what actually happens in the game, or one of the reviews here written by Bill Nowlin, who has written many, many books of his own about the Red Sox (eight since 2004 alone). He makes fun of the title but doesn't say he's good friends with Rob Neyer and took part in research for Neyer's book. He also says this book made a mistake by saying Kevin Youkilis was on the World Series roster, but Youkilis was indeed on the roster, replacing Ramiro Mendoza, who'd proven himself utterly worthless in the ALCS.I think that's to be expected when writing about baseball and the Red Sox. People feel very strongly about both, regardless of what else is going on in the world. I wasted many hours of my life reading all of the books that came out after the 2004 World Series, and this is one that finally looks at the whole history of the last six years while giving you the behind-the-scenes access and the beauty of the game. If you want to know anything about either baseball or the Red Sox this may be the best book produced in the past ten years, and may be one of the best baseball books ever."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"My husband brought this book home and I could not have been less excited: I'm a Cardinals fan (married to a Yankees fan, which is hard), and I didn't think I ever wanted to think (or read) about the 2004 World Series again. Then I started reading the introduction and felt this was the most amazing book about baseball ever written. It's poetic, gripping, and full of juicy information and so knowledgable and detailed at the same time. The two of us fought over it at night - and neither of us would have expected to read it (or enjoy it!) when we started. Some of the statistical information will seem common sense to fans (like explaining batting average) and some will seem obscure (like talking about \\"defensive metrics\\") but that's a tiny thing in a majestic book. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"As someone who has been reading baseball books for many years, I was blown away. This provides a better inside picture of what it's like than anything I've read -- it's like Ball Four, but with the real story on everything and not just the players. There are so many new details in here - the sale, the amazing details about the Nomar trade, the Ortiz signing, Manny. But maybe the best part is how it gives an amazing picture of what being a part of a ball team is like, and does it in a way that's like a novel and a history all at the same time. I can't remember the last time I read a book cover-to-cover without being able to put it down."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"Seth Mnookin has a tremendous range of skills as a writer...he is a talented historian, journalist, and sportswriter...a rare blend of skills that all shine in this phenomenal work! The last 5 years of Red Sox history are thoroughly detailed..from the sale of the team by the Yawkey Trust right through the early parts of the 2006 season.Somehow Mnookin blends objective reporting with tremendous passion for his subject...the complexities of the sale of the team are clearly explained...who all the competing parties were...how alliances formed and shifted...how Massachusetts politics dominated so many conversations...how close the Henry group was to not getting the deal!!!The Lucchino-Epstein relationship is explored with great care and thoughtfulness...we see them as each geniuses in their own way...with the love and tension of a father-son relationship...the feelings of betrayal on both sides...the reconciliation carefully led by godfather John Henry...Mnookin is careful to avoid assigning credit or blame...instead, he prevents a balanced perspective, leaving the reader to ponder the subtleties and moral ambiguities...And there are some wild suprises...Which member of the Red Sox almost boarded one of the ill-fated airplanes on September 11? Why did his plans change at the last minute?Who was afraid for his life when taken to the Boston waterfront for a \\"chat\\"?Carefully documented, masterfully written...this is a MUST READ!!!"},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"I burned through this book, as I do believe it's a great read for true Sox fans. To disagree with a few reviews: 1) I don't think you can get this sort of behind the scense glimpse at the management level info from reading the Globe/Herald. You can't believe 1/2 of what they print. 2) It doesn't focus on the clubhouse/players, as someone pointed out, but that's not the goal.It's a review of what got the Sox to the '04 title. At the same time, it shows the greed of the Sox owners and the stubborness of Lucchino that made them fall down in '05 and now '06, and I fear will probably prevent them from getting another title soon. It's true that the Sox brass treat the team too much like a business (yes, I know it's a business) on the baseball operations side than they should. There is plenty of money to be made elsewhere.So it definitely focuses more on the management than the players (which was it's goal, no less) so if you're looking for that kind of detail, this is a great read."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"Mnookin has written an informative look at the Red Sox from 2001-2005, but as a not very fanatical follower of the game, there's not much new here. The author speaks of spending a great deal of time with the team in the book's notes, but he chooses to leave himself out of the narrative - this is generally a good idea in non-fiction, but when most of the anecdotes are as well known as these, (Manny wants a trade, Schilling negotiating his own contract, making a move for A-Rod, etc), a fresh perspective is needed..The author does a great job describing the sale of the team, especially the scenes reminding the reader of the venom spewed by local media against any group who was not hand picked by them. Much of the locker room talk is fun & quite salty. David Ortiz is not written (for once) as a big, happy cartoon-character & all of the Cowboy Up! & Idiots! snoredom is kept to a bare minimum. Thank you for that Mr. Mnookin.I do have to bring up the footnotes. Any casual fan of the game should have a decent understanding of the myriad of statistics mentioned - but seeing an asterisk attached to common stats like ERA & OBP, followed by David Foster Wallace sized explanations makes me wonder who this book is marketed to. Maybe Mnookin was asked to add them by an editor who doesn't understand the game. They're really quite odd.Overall, this is a good, not great book, and much better then the endless quick cash-ins that arrived shortly after the 2004 World Series win. I think there's more to be told, but we probably have to wait for a writer to visit the principal's farms & real estate offices in 20 years to hear the rest."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"I too felt much of the book was what we already knew. Much of the difficulties had been in the local press and I live in Hartford CT. Having been able to attend Fenway back in the 60's with my Grandfather's season tickets and many skipped high school days from Newton North High and Northeastern I was really looking to hear some juicy tidbits that failed to materialize.Boston press has always been demonized and it is a city obessessed with sports. We deify our athletes until their first mistep and then they area treated to the local torture treatment. I never really got the feeling of being inside the clubhouse and knowing the real players during this time. It does make a good summer read by the pool and found myself gripped by his descriptive play by play of the 2004 comeback series with the New York Yankees. For those interested in statistics it will be even a more interesting read."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"Although both major Boston papers are filled with Red Sox stories, much of what is written is wrong, biased, or irrelevant. Because so much ink is slung so indiscriminately, many involved with the Red Sox don't really want to open up to the press. In a remarkable departure from the policy of not providing any information, the team's new ownership decided to let the public in to know more about the team. One aspect of that new philosophy was to allow author, Seth Mnookin, unparalleled access to the team's management.Now, that may not seem like a juicy subject, but it is if you are interested in how the Red Sox can hope to field teams that can compete with the New York Yankees and the unlimited budget for personnel in the Bronx. In Feeding the Monster, you get a realistic sense that the Red Sox are going to have bad years . . . in order to have good years. Now, that's quite a contradiction to the constantly upbeat publicity that the club has put out since the new owners took over. That \\"promise them anything\\" philosophy in fact becomes a major bone of contention that almost drives Theo Epstein away.There are places where the book seems to falter. Some players are dismissed as being a problem for the club based on a few incidents or characteristics. Most of us have our drawbacks. While we're performing, no one cares. When we don't perform, those drawbacks are often cited when we lose a job. The same happens to baseball players.But the behind-the-scenes look at management is unprecedented . . . and dispels a lot of myths happily carried forward by the local media. I was glad to see the record set straight about how the club came into its current ownership hands, for example.It was interesting that this book came out describing the 2006 season as a problem year just as the Red Sox collapsed in the five-game series in Fenway . . . and the Yankees went nowhere. In the excitement of the great wins early in the season, it was easy to overlook that the club didn't have the pitching to make it very far. It was all the more remarkable that the early season went so well. Congratulations to the Red Sox for accomplishing as much as they did in 2006.Wait until next year!"},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"Excellent insights regarding for the sale of one of the world's premier sports franchises."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"It was with much anticipation that I picked up my copy of \\"Feeding The Monster - How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top\\" by Seth Mnookin. After all, this award-winning author had been given unlimited access to behind-the-scenes goings-on at Fenway Park during the entire 2005 season. Early excerpts from the book held the promise of several hundred pages of juicy revelations of what really goes on behind the Wizard's Curtain on Yawkey Way. So, I made my way expectantly through over 400 pages of Red Sox related material, and came to the past page feeling as if I should cue up on my stereo an early rendition of Peggy Lee's hit, \\"Is That All There Is?\\" And I was not sure why I was so disappointed. There were tidbits that were fun to read. Mnookin makes it clear in this book that he does not have much respect for Dan Shaughnessy and the whole \\"Curse of the Bambino\\" boondoggle. Nor does he harbor much admiration for Dr. Charles Steinberg, whose over-eager passion for ensuring the Red Sox ubiquitous and ever-expanding press coverage ultimately pushed Theo over the edge and played a large part in the contretemps that led to Theo's decision to resign.Listening to Bill Simmons of ESPN last Friday helped me to begin to put a finger on my disappointment with Mnookin and his writing. Simmons made the observation, while talking on WEEI, that in reading this book, he could not figure out what audience Mnookin was trying to address. If he were targeting diehard Sox fans, then why spend over 100 pages rehashing well-known Red Sox history and the curse of the Bambino nonsense? Add, why feel the need to explain in a footnote what \\"OPS\\" is all about!As I thought about my disappointment with this book, I came up with a gastronomic metaphor. Assume that I had learned that a great chef, with unlimited access to live lobsters of enormous size and to the finest ingredients in the world, after a year of working on a secret recipe, was going to be selling lobster rolls to the public. I would line up to have a chance to sink my teeth into one of those lobster rolls - anticipating the subtle spices, huge chunks of fresh lobster meat from the tail and claws - served on a freshly baked bun with some unexpected special twist thrown in. Then, imagine my disappointment when the lobster roll is actually served on a stale hotdog bun, and the bun is stuffed mostly with filler - limp chopped celery, gobs of Hellmann's mayonnaise - and the meat has clearly been previously frozen and consists of small, stringy pieces from the body of the lobster. It does not taste bad, but it is a far cry from what I expected the gourmet chef to serve up.Having laid out my sense of disappointment at the paucity of \\"claw meat,\\" let me hasten to add that the book offers some insights that make it a worthwhile read for those who love the game of baseball. Mnookin offers a fascinating peak into the tortuous behind-the-scenes process by which the John Henry group was awarded the right to purchase the Boston Red Sox from the Yawkey Trust and a bevy of limited partners.He offers a wonderful paean to the glories of Fenway Park - worth sharing here:\\"Fenway Park was, inarguably, a gorgeous monument to American baseball. It still used a manual scoreboard, and scoreboard operators could sometimes be glimpsed peeking out from behind the numbers to catch the action on the field. The very same steel beams that blocked some patrons' views allowed the second deck to be built almost directly on top of the infield grandstand, creating an intensely intimate setting. Unlike most stadiums, Fenway didn't have an upper deck, and first-time visitors could not help but be struck by how Fenway allowed fans to gaze out onto the Boston skyline, with the Prudential and the John Hancock buildings rising behind right-center field and the famous Citgo sign blinking over the Wall in left. The odd triangle of grass that was delineated by the end of the Red Sox bullpen and Fenway's centerfield wall was as inexplicable a patch of outfield territory as exists in baseball, and a point of stubborn pride. The Green Monster rose majestically over the outfield grass, where it turned screaming line drive shots into harmless singles and transformed breezy pop flies into home runs. It was here that Carlton Fisk had willed his walk-off home run in the sixth game of the 1975 World Series. It was this field Babe Ruth and Ted Williams once roamed. \`The ballpark is the star,' Globe columnist Marty Nolan wrote in 1999, trying to explain the Red Sox's - and Fenway's - sway over New England. \`A crazy-quilt violation of city planning principles, an irregular pile of architecture, a menace to marketing consultants, Fenway Park works. It works as a symbol of New England's pride, as a repository of evergreen hopes, as a tabernacle of lost innocence.' Baseball commissioner Bart Giamatti compared Fenway to \`Mount Olympus, the Pyramid at Giza, the nation's Capital, the czar's Winter Palace, and the Louvre - except, of course, that it was better than all those inconsequential places.' Pitching great Tom Seaver said simply, \`Fenway is the essence of baseball.'\\" (Page 67)So, read the book and enjoy it, but don't expect Mnookin, graduate of Newton North High School and Harvard University, to be Todd English or Ming Tsai! The fare he offers up is more pedestrian and mundane, but still contains some tasty chunks of meat.Al"},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"I share the lukewarm reactions to this book apparent in Amazon customer and press reviews. It adds little new but I am still glad I bought it. It doesn't live up to its title and is mainly just a straight chronicle of the Red Sox back office, including its squabbles and financial tergiversations. It has the merit of being hype-free and takes its subject seriously. It seems very fair-minded in its judgements about such personalities as Theo, Curt, Petie, and Manny and is very much centered on John Henry and the ownership issues but somehow the character sketches don't bring them to life.There's nothing wrong with the book and overall I like it -- and praise it with faint damns -- but I'm a Red Sox Nation member of over 40 yrs of neurosis. If you, too, are similarly of semi-sound mind, then it'w worth buying it. My only major criticism is that its comprehensive index does not contain a reference to \\"Evil Empire.\\""},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"This book is disappointing for Red Sox fans, and I would assume of little interest to non Red Sox fans who are tired of having the Sox shoved down their throats since October '04. Considering Mnookin had his own desk at Fenway and all of this supposed insider access to the team, there is little to no new information here for those who have followed the Red Sox closely. If you read the Globe and/or the Herald during this time period and followed the team, there really isn't anything new here. Mnookin also spends several chapters telling the history of the Red Sox. If you're a Sox fan, you've heard all of this a hundred times before.In many ways this book reads as advertising for the Red Sox (look at the book's title). The only person Mnookin really criticizes harshly is Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy, who he paints as a modern day Max Mercy. While this may well be the case, it's hardly new information, many Boston fans dislike/distrust Shaughnessy already. It's pretty easy to go after a guy most people don't like anyway.It's always interesting to read about the Sox, but you might want to rent this from the local library rather than buy it. You've read this all before."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"Dispel some of the rumors surrounding the Boston Red Sox with this behind-the-scenes look at the team's management."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"Reading all the pre-publication marketing and press, it seemed as if Mnookin was going to provide lots of inside, \\"behind the scenes\\" scoop from the front office. All of the author's blog entries and the bits and pieces released through the media indicated that. What this book actually is, is quite different. There is some of that stuff - and it's completely and utterly fascinating. But the vast majority of the book is a season-by-season chronology of the team's on-field performance from 2002 through 2005. Diehard fans already know what happened each season. We don't need a summary. What we do want is the inside story, the stuff Mnookin's special access was supposed to provide. Unfortunately, he didn't really live up to the hype in that area. It's still worth reading, just don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"I still give it four stars, because I enjoy reading good books about the Red Sox. This is definitely better than average, hence it gets more than three stars, but it's very disappointing.The disappointment starts with the title, not exactly original - in fact, it's practically the same title as Rob Neyer's truly enjoyable 2001 book, FEEDING THE GREEN MONSTER. Neyer attended every single Red Sox home game during the 2000 season and writes about his experiences.Much was expected from Mnookin, given that he had unprecedented access (including his own desk at Fenway), but in the end he really offers very little in the way of either information or insights that would not be familiar to those who have followed the Red Sox the last few years.There are also some odd errors, from saying that Kevin Youkilis was on the 2004 World Series roster (page 404), to saying that Trot Nixon was signed through 2007 (page 257), and from writing that the Red Sox were known as the Pilgrims in 1903 (page 23.) None of those things are true.There were also a few spelling errors indicating insufficient proofreading (I was amused at the notion on page 159 that baseball \\"consists of a discreet series of interactions between two individual combatants.\\")Then there was the idea that one of Tom Yawkey's \\"main business interests\\" was running a house of prostitution in South Carolina. For a man running businesses doing tens of millions of dollars annually, that must have been one active house!Seriously, though, the book presents a good updating of recent Red Sox history during the Henry/Werner/Lucchino period, up into the early days of the 2006 campaign. Maybe it is the mark of how thoroughly the Boston media masticates all things Red Sox, but there is very little of anything at all new here. To repeat myself, little new in the way of facts and nothing really surprising or insightful in the way of analysis.I suspect that some of those working in the ranks of the Red Sox would find other things that really disturbed them, but I am in no position to comment.There is room on my shelves for straightforward Red Sox books and this one (despite the title that's so similar to Rob Neyer's) is welcome there. I just wish I could give it a more enthusiastic review."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"It was October 6, 2000, and for the first time in a generation the Red Sox were up for sale. Bought by Tom Yawkey in 1933, ownership had passed to his wife's trust in '94 after her death. Some wondered why it was now for sale - the team had just won a legislative battle for funding the construction of a new ballpark, and its value was at an all-time high. Fourteen months later it sold - to Boston outsiders, and the rumors of a \\"fix\\" (courtesy of Commissioner Bud Selig) were rampant.The new owners proved themselves willing to work with the Boston fans, players, and writers, and at first it looked like smooth sailing. However, it seems like there were never-ending feuds - between owners, players and coach, etc. The \\"good news\\" is that things coalesced, new stars (David Ortiz and Curt Schilling) were acquired, and the Red Sox won the World Series in 2004 (and are leading their division again in 2006).Professional baseball in Boston goes back to 1871. The Boston team won 8 pennants over the next 25 years, including three straight. Another high point was acquiring Babe Ruth (age 19) from Baltimore in 1914, and his evolution into an outfielder as part of filling out the roster during WWI. The \\"bad news,\\" was his being traded to the Yankees in 1919 for $100,00 - largely as a result of his becoming a difficult personality (wanted his salary doubled to $20,000), though unfounded rumors swirled about that the real reason was that the Sox' owner needed the money to finance his Broadway show \\"No, No, Nanette.Then, after winning more World Series in its first two decades than any other team, the Red Sox went on to suffer a drought for the next 80+ years - despite Ted Williams (joined in 1939, and hit a home run his last at bat), though probably at least partly because the owners passed on Jackie Robinson and Willie Mays, partly when combined with lots of poor managing."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"...otherwise I'd look like a fool. If I'd waited until it made the best seller list I'd have gotten a discount, and then I'd have given it one star.I knew Mnookin was in trouble when he said that Garciaparra's .371 average was the highest for a Red sox player since Ted Williams batted .388 in 1957. I looked &lt;everywhere> for something that made Ted's .406 irrelevant to the comparison, but couldn't find it. In addition to several factual errors, Mnookin is an awkward writer and does not choose words carefully. Clement was \\"ushered off the field\\" the day he was hit in head with a line drive?

Did you know that the \\"Curse\\" is actually based on less than factual material? I didn't! This book also helps provide insight into what probably happened in the clubhouse and in the front office during this past disasterous season. A Must read for any dedicated Red Sox fan."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"This book is an in-depth look at the interworkings of the Boston Red Sox. As with any Red Sox book worth it's salt, it begins with a brief history of the team itself, exploring the so-called curse, as well as the Yawkey ownership. It follows with a thorough account of the sale of the team to the group eventually led by John Henry. It then hit the big time with a behind the scenes look at the 2003 Red Sox team and front office. With unprecedented access to the front office, Mnookin shows readers what happens before something happens. It's a hard look at personalities and egos both on the field, and in the offices.The jacket of the book talks about Mnookin's access. It brags that he had a key to Fenway Park, and a desk in the front office. The theory being that the kind of access he had must mean that he has the best information. In reality, it means he has the most one-sided information. I'm not saying the Red Sox front office spent time misleading him with false information or opinions. (Although, I wouldn't put it past them.) But, there are two sides to every story, and Mnookin mostly got one side. The good thing? He told the side he had wonderfully. This is a fantastic book. The section on the sale of the team was especially interesting to me. The back and forth between the team and bidders, and bidders themselves was fascinating. It was also interesting to hear the Red Sox version of many of the personnel issues facing the team. This is certainly a must read for any Red Sox fan."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"The count of books on the Boston Red Sox after their 2004 championship mounted up quickly. There is an empty forest in Oregon because of all of the publications.\\"Feeding the Monster\\" is one of them. It might not be the absolute best of the bunch, but it's, um, in the ballpark. (Trust you could see that coming.)Seth Mnookin somehow convinced the Red Sox to let him move in with the team during the 2005 season, and write about the team from a close-up perspective. He even had a desk at Fenway Park, which as could be imagined gave him great access to the people connected with the team. Mnookin played reporter at times during home games, going into the clubhouse and press box for information.Mnookin comes into this project as something of an outsider to sports writing. He's a contributing editor at Vanity Fair and wrote the book, \\"Hard Times,\\" which looked into the Jayson Blair affair at the New York Times. He obviously follows baseball general and the Red Sox in particular, but he's far enough outside the culture to give this an interesting viewpoint.While there is plenty of other information in the book, \\"Feeding the Monster\\" essentially boils down to the story of the \\"new\\" Red Sox ownership, which took over before the 2002 season. John Henry, Tom Werner and company obviously took advantage of the chance to give their side of the stories of events. Mnookin is a good enough reporter to check out facts and give other sides of the story, but it's fair to say the new owners come out looking quite good.Any organization has its soap-opera aspects, and the Red Sox have had quite a story from 2002 to 2005. The biggest one, of course, was the World Series win in 2004 that ended 86 years of frustration. Mnookin doesn't get too caught up in the day-to-day exploits of the team, which is a good decision -- the readers already know that. There is plenty of new information here, what with backgrounds on player transactions, contract negotiations, front office problems (such as the one that led to Theo Epstein's brief departure), etc.There are many good details along the way. For example, the work of statistical analyst Bill James is revealed in part for the first time here. James one time did a study of every play in a Red Sox season to determine which players were costing the Red Sox production with a lack of hustle. The winner by a long shot: Manny Ramirez. For example, Kevin Millar is shown to be a good, happy-go-lucky influence in the clubhouse ... as long as he is playing, and playing well -- which he wasn't in 2005. For example, I was stunned to discover that Byung-Hyun Kim's numbers as a reliever in 2003 were about the same as Keith Foulke's in 2004.Mnookin does make a couple of curious editorial decisions. The first part of the book is a 54-page review of the franchise's history; the author notes at the end that he cut it in half. I would guess that most of the readership base is quite familiar with the story, even if Mnookin does make some good points in the story. Speaking of familiar -- and this is a little petty -- a few of the footnotes cover such ground as how to calculate earned-run average and slugging percentage. Think anyone who picks up a 400+ page book on baseball won't know those things?This isn't a ground-breaking book on baseball, but \\"Feeding the Monster\\" has plenty of great material. Proud members of Red Sox Nation will race through this book in no time."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"Could not lay the book down. A must for Baseball fans. The personalities are described in depth, sometimes shockingly so. It's a great follow-up to Moneyball, with the same system of recruitment playing a big part of this book also."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"First, a confession. Although I was born a third-generation Yankee fan, I switched my allegiance permanently when I moved to Boston in 1975 and have been a diehard member of Red Sox Nation ever since. So of course I loved this book. If you're a Red Sox fan, you will too. But it's a must-read for every baseball fan, I think, because it takes readers inside the modern game with all of its complexities -- from superstar athletes, arrogant owners, and impossible fans to team-owned TV networks, arcane union rules and the playoffs-or-bust mentality -- and offers a case study of how new owners with deep pockets and fresh ideas can make big changes happen fast."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"The highlights of this book that were most interesting to me are the sections on John Henry and Larry Lucchino, Nomar Garciaparra, and the acquisition of Curt Schilling.The details present in this book by Mnookin's unprecedented access to the team and management pretty much makes this a must read for Boston fans -- however, for an author who grew up a diehard Red Sox fan and is already intimately familiar with baseball and the history of the team, the book feels like the editors or publisher perhaps pushed the author into a lot of background info on the team and explanatory details on the game itself, which were unnecessary.Still, it was a good read.I also just read Ian Browne'sDice-K: The First Season of the Red Sox $100 Million Manand highly recommend it, and having read the Yankees title that corresponds with it, I'm looking forward to this new release on the Boston Red Sox as well:Boston Red Sox: An Interactive Guide to the World of Sports (Sports by the Numbers)"},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"Very informing and well detailed book.

All the principals involved in building the team of \\"idiots\\" who humiliated Yankee nation in 2004 are here. I loved the inside details of the soap opera front office maneuvers, including the long and drawn out sale to John Henry, Theo Epstein's ascent and fights with Larry Luccino, the signing of Curt Shilling and the hiring of Terry Francona. This book is a must for every member of Red Sox nation!!"},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"Taking the long view, as Seth Mnookin does at the beginning of this piece of reportage, the Boston Red Sox are a failed franchise, a broken watch.Much like the famous New Yorker cover that maps Manhattan at the center of the universe with other, lesser places marked as specks on the horizon, Mnookin's story centers on the team that John Henry, Tom Werner and Larry Lucchino assembled to change that legacy. Off in the irrelevant distance are a dueling Babe Ruth and Harry Frazee, an oafish Joe Cronin, a drunken Tom Yawkey, an overrated and ultimately inconsequential Ted Williams, and some guys called Yaz and Pudge and Pesky. From the get-go, this is not a work of Sawks idolatry.In telling a front-office story, Mnookin sets himself a difficult task. The rise and fall of management teams makes interesting if somewhat limited reading for the type of reader who subscribes to the Wall Street Journal, but it is no simple oversight that publication lacks a sports page to cover the teams that perform on the field. For those who follow the daily exploits of their hometown favorites, owners and managers generally are figures to be reviled. It is necessary, then, for Mnookin as the teller of what is, after all, a heroic sports tale to jump back and forth between the people to whom he has access -- the suits -- and those to whom he clearly does not -- the players. As a result, we get only caricatures of those who are in fact the face of the franchise: a brooding, Hamlet-like Garciaparra; a blowhard Schilling; a proud and fragile-egoed Martinez; a whacked-out Ramirez; a universally beloved Pappi. Is there any magic here? Sadly, no. Like other sports franchises in modern times, baseball teams -- Red Sox included -- mix and match from year to year with few loyalties and scant long term vision. To hear Mnookin tell it, the club brass might just as well have been trading soybean futures.Interesting, yes. Compelling, no.The book is written well and carefully, with some exceptions: were he still alive, no doubt Bobby Bonds would be surprised to learn that Willie Mays is Barry's grandfather. Its background and context give it far greater depth than a compendium of clips from sports pages covering the same subject matter. As a journalist, one suspects that Mnookin disdains his peers on the Red Sox beat. Peter Gammons is the only writer who gets favorable mention, and one interesting but underdeveloped motif of the book is the love-hate relationship -- mostly hate, it seems -- between the team and the writers who cover it.As hot stove reading, this book is good. But it likely will be forgotten as soon as pitchers and catchers report."},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"I just (last night) got back from Asia and thank God I had this book to read on all my plane rides. It was a GREAT book, and that comes from a Cardinal fan. This was as good if not the best sports book I have ever read. I would say that I am jealous of Seth, but I am not. While I would have loved to follow the team and the inner workings as he did, I could never have retold the story as he did. I could not put the book down.Throughout junior high school, high school and college I worked at Busch Stadium in St. Louis because I loved baseball and the Cardinals - as I still do. This book made me remember how much I love the game, and people like John Henry. Seth gave an even-handed and very fair picture of the inner workings of buying and building a baseball franchise. You also appreciate how difficult it is to get to the top, but more importantly, how nearly impossible it is to sustain the level it takes to stay there. Players have enormous egos and sport writers often ignore the consequences of their behavior. This all comes to life in this great book.[...]"},{"Title":"Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts, and Nerve Took a Team to the Top","review":"I enjoyed reading \\"Feeding the Monster\\" by Seth Mnookin because it was better prepared then some of those Red Sox publications that were slapped together after 2004. The book is better organized and obviously the research is better. Largely the book is about the transition of the team under John Henry's ownership and their rise to a world series championship.I am a unique Red Sox fan because being twenty seven, the first game I ever remember was game 6 in 86. I have suffered through many of the emotional lows and the sheer numbness of 03. I really like how Mnookin is able to portray the intensity and history so well.I guess one thing I may have done differant is really elaborated more on some of the bad trades Theo Epstein has made. I really disliked the Shea Hillenbrand deal and the signing of Matt Clement as well as Willy Mo for Arroyo. I think he is a little soft on Epstein. Obviously Esptein is a great GM for bringing a world series to Boston, but I think he does make some big mistakes from time to time. The Clement deal has been a total disaster. I was against it big time when he made the move. I totally support Epstein though in the way he wants to rebuild and harvest the farm system, lots of credit there. I believe that is the only long term strategy for competing with the skankees. He is however an excellent GM who help deliver what so many failed to do.Mnookin's book is definitely well written and interesting. The one somewhat minor complaint is for somebody who has had complete access to the team for so long, he provides very little new information. I'm not sure if all the footnotes for \\"ERA\\" and \\"OBP\\" were neccessary. I think folks reading this book probably have a pretty decent idea what that is all about.

Some pix of dem Sox from the early 20th century onward would have really been appreciated!!I think Mnookin does a great job not only of tracing the long and involved history of the Red Sox, delving deeply into some particulars that only someone on the inside looking out would know, but I also REALLY like the way he patiently explains things like OBP and all those other VERY important stats-gathering processes that go beyond Batting Averages and ERA's.Great book.

If you're picking the book up for the \\"juicy\\" behind the scenes tidbits, don't bother, they've all already been reported in the papers.One thing I found particularly odd, Mnookin has no problem highlighting some of the embarrassing flaws and foibles of almost everybody on the team and in the front office, and yet he doesn't name \\"a certain married player\\" who had pictures of himself with a girl on his lap in a Northeastern dorm posted on the Internet. Is there a single person reading that book who doesn't know he's talking about Bronson Arroyo? It wasn't exactly a well kept secret.

Also he smacked his lips so loud it sounded like someone slapping their hands on water; he gulped when he swallowed; he was washed food down with milk; he made enormous piles of meat, potatoes, peas, carrots and gravy on his fork and then thrust the fork so far down his throat you could hardly see the handle; he used his thumb to assemble big fork loads; he propped his knife and fork against his plate with the handles on the table; he buttered whole slices of bread on his hand; he chopped and smashed and mixed his food until his dinner looked like dog food; he picked up his soup bowl and held it just under his chin while he slurped his soup; he talked while he was chewing; he gestured with a fork full of food so that bits of food shot around the room like stones from a slingshot.\\"Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle cure was a large white pig named Lester. \\"Lester walked daintily into the kitchen, closed the door carefully behind him, climbed up and sat down across the table from Christopher. Christopher was jamming his mouth full of cookie and washing it down with cocoa. Lester looked at him, then took one cookie carefully between the split in his front hoof and ate it very slowly and with tiny bites. He picked his cocoa cup up with his hoof and after one small sip put it carefully down, while he patted his snout with his napkin.\\"Christopher stopped eating, or at least stopped chewing, to watch Lester eat. Christopher's mouth was open but full, he had whipped cream on his upper lip and crumbs on his chin. Lester reached across the table and gently closed Christopher's mouth.\\"I just love the image of a pig shutting a boy's mouth, of anything or anyone shutting someone's mouth! Do you? Love it, I mean. (Betty MacDonald had a knack for humor; she was known for humorous autobiography, and she created the comic duo Ma and Pa Kettle, whom she wrote about in her novel THE EGG AND I.)Anyway, I suggest you read this book to yourself or some kids, or ask kids 4 to 8 years old to read it to you. Your giggles will be worth the effort."},{"Title":"Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic","review":"When I was a young girl I read Mrs. Piggle Wiggle and I loved it!

Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle is the neighborhood's grandmotherly lady who is loved by all the local children and is asked by all their parents for advice on how to deal with their children's bad behavior. The first book of the series, simply titledMrs. Piggle-Wiggle, was written in 1947. Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic, the second book, tells how Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle helps to cure such problems as the \\"thought-you-saiders,\\" the \\"tattletales,\\" the \\"bad-table-manners,\\" the \\"interrupters,\\" the \\"heedless breaker,\\" the \\"never-want-to-go-to-schooler,\\" and the \\"waddle-I-doers.\\" MacDonald produces two more of these books, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Farm (1954), and Hello, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle (1957).Betty Bard MacDonald's first book, and perhaps the most famous one generally, is The Egg and I (1945). I have never read it, but we have seen the film version which starred Fred McMurray and Claudette Colbert, and introduced the characters Ma and Pa Kettle, who were so popular that a series of nine more films were made featuring them. MacDonald based Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle on bedtime stories that she had made up for her daughters, nephews, nieces, grandchildren, grandnephews, and grandnieces. In 2007, MacDonald's daughter, Anne MacDonald Canham, published Happy Birthday, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle, based on stories and characters created by her mother, and the two share the credit for writing it. The first story in the book is an unpublished MacDonald tale, while Anne explains in the book that the remaining portion is taken from notes for other stories among her mother's possessions.Some people prefer not to read books with \\"magic\\" in them. However, even though the cover of Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic pictures Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle in a witch's hat with a magic wand in her hand, there is no real \\"magic\\" in the book. Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle simply has a store of pills, powders, tonics, and other nostrums, including the neatest pig in the world, to help the children overcome their bad habits. It could be argued that Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle is one of the world's greatest experts on the use of child psychology. What I saw in the book is simply a humorous way to help children see how some of their thoughtless activities can be very annoying to others and to encourage parents to be more creative in working with their children's foolishness than just yelling and screaming at them all the time."},{"Title":"Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic","review":"If you like problems and interesting things you better get this book and read it. I rate this book 4 stars because the kids always had a problem. Of course, Mrs Piggle Wiggle had to find a cure for the kids. Such as Sharon- she needed a powder that was called the Heedless Breaker Powder. She needed that powder because she would always break something. I thought that this book was great. I would recommend this book to ages 6 and up."},{"Title":"Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic","review":"I've read the radish cure and the fighting cure. I really love this book.

Like her fictional character, Mrs. Piggle Wiggle, she has an incredible insight into what makes children tick. If anyone has a problem with their child, they call Mrs. Piggle Wiggle and she has a cure in the form of pill, tonic, candy or powder. Do your children whisper and giggle about others? Mrs. Piggle Wiggle's whisper sticks will force them to whisper so quietly no one will be able to hear them. When all the neighborhood children are suffering from the What will I do syndrome, Mrs. Piggle Wiggle invites them to her house to look for the pirate's treasure.The reason the book was ranked a four instead of five is that the book is out of date. Th accepted form of discipline is spanking.

YOU BET!My two elder sisters, younger brother and I grew up on Mrs. Piggle Wiggle's Magic - the edition that HAD belonged to our uncle!The \\"ills\\" the children have are the same the world over. The lessons are clear, and taught gently - Be careful what you wish for, it might come true! Slow down, watch what you're doing. Do not interrupt. There are certain behaviors expected in public.

This one remains my favorite, however. The pages of my copy are quite worn where I turned the pages ...and read and re-read the stories. Yes, times have changed and much is different today from the 50's but Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's delightful acceptance of children with all their foibles is still an inspiration to all parents --and a reminder to me as a mom to lighten up and laugh with my kids and their antics. Betty MacDonald is very clever in bringing childish faults to light by way of terribly funny situations and even more preposterous cures. I LOVE THIS BOOK! and so do my girls."},{"Title":"Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic","review":"My 6-year-old daughter is as charmed by these stories as I was back in the day--we are working our way happily through the whole series of four. We've all wished for magic potions to fix our problems, but most of these cures rely on Mrs. P.W.'s imagination, humor and common-sense more than just magic (our mutual favorite is the Radish Cure for the girl who won't take a bath). Everyone--parents and kid--ends up happier after Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle steps in. The portrayal of 1950's domestic life is sly and funny but also sympathetic--the jaunty, distracted fathers who leave for the office each morning, the weary mothers obsessed with their children's behavior, housekeeping, and creating elaborate meals. The descriptions of breakfasts alone are enough to make you nostalgic--eggs, porridge, bacon--on a school day!--as is the general picture of pre-TV neighborhood life, treehouses, go-carts, games of kick-the-can and parcheesi. One of those rare books that's equally fun for parents and kids, and the Hilary Knight illustrations are perfection. Let's hope they never make a film version."},{"Title":"Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic","review":"I have just finshed reading Mrs. Piggle - Wiggle's Magic by Betty MacDonald.

In addition to living in a haven for children, she helps their parents cure their children from bad habits or disobediance. In this particular book, Mrs. Piggle Wiggle cures three children from &quot;thought you said itis&quot;, in which three children hear things all wrong.

The book provides a good background and overview of the law - both medically and issues-wise.

Charbonneau's first novel and probably his best. It uses the technique of taking modern problems and blowing them up into disasters. A fun read and a book I've kept for years. Old fashioned science fiction. Not on the level of 1984 or Brave New World or even The Space Merchants, but certainly as good or better than others of the ilk. Smacks of Sohl's Point Ultimate, which some critics hate or at best ignore, but has remained one of my favorites over the years. Easily as good as Logan's Run but for different reasons. I will not do a spoiler here. Read it for yourself and don't expect great literature. Just fun and excitment with a few chills.

The average story was made better by the BRILLIANT artwork and powerful action scenes.There was some confusion in the story - Batman being part of a Wonder Woman kidnap plot that he himself was seriously attacked in - and Supergirl being twisted into evil by Darkseid \\"off-camera.\\"Superman and Batman rarely look this good, however (except by Alex Ross, of course), and the two heroes work well together while their internal monologues make for great contrast.All in all, a good read - and a good reintroduction to one of the potentially most powerful members of the DC Universe."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"First of all, this is not one for the \\"graphic novel\\" snobs. This is just a great comic book collection featuring a story and artwork that make for some wonderful fun.Jeph Loeb once again manages to put enough heart and emotion into these characters to elevate this above mere fluff. That depth, along with a fast-paced, roller-coaster ride of an adventure, makes for a thrilling read.Supergirl appears, Supes and Bats disagree on how to handle this development, and Wonder Woman gets in on the action too. Along the way, we get to see some awesome scenes on Apokolips, and a very cool showdown between Superman and Darkseid.Michael Turner's art is beautiful. I especially love the way he draws the most gorgeous Wonder Woman that I've ever seen. Everything else here looks outstanding as well..., but, man, his Wonder Woman is exceptional.If you like comics that are just downright fun to read, this is for you."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"\\"Supergirl from Krypton\\" is a requirement for Supe fans, lots of fun for Bat and Wonder Woman fans, too. My last exposure to Superman comics were big battles without any real suspense or mystery, so I was pleasantly surprised by the Supergirl story. Batman finds her ship, Superman goes head over heels for a fellow Kryptonian, and Wonder Woman plays a large role in training the young girl. Darkseid is a powerful villain, but there are a couple moments when he comes off like a wuss. But overall, great story. Loeb gives Supergirl an origin that connects with the bigger DCU, not just Supe's world. Nice touch. The end of the arc is strong, with Supergirl choosing to become a heroine. When she finally suits up, you can't help but cheer out loud!I'm not usually a big fan of Michael Turner's art, but his style is a nice match with Loeb's action-packed story. (Although I'm still not convinced that superpowered women are most comfortable in thongs). I wouldn't choose him for ongoing artist, but I enjoyed this run. The action sequences look terrific, and Turner has plenty of full-page splashes."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"I've never really been one for reading superhero comics. And though I do see Bats as an intriguing character, Superman has always had my contempt. Not this time. This comic does a wonderful job of contrasting the two, of telling the tales through both their minds, and so captures a truth that is somewhere in between - it captures Supergirl. The art is absolutely stunning but the book would have been a failure if it were not for the absolutely brilliant writing. Read it."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"This was a shame. I think supergirl is a cool character and can be done well, but this just makes clear that DC has no idea what to do with her. There is no characterization, no back up characters and the story can only loosely be called a \\"story.\\" The art is cool and it seems that is all this book has to offer. It's a real disappointment, especially after Peter David's run on the previous Supergirl (linda danvers) which was excellent. Stick with Many Happy Returns, possibly the best supergirl story ever (along with Crisis on Infinite Earths)."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"Great story and great art plus the return of Kara Zor-El (something I've been waiting for about TWENTY YEARS since weeping over the death of Supergirl in the late eighties). What are you waiting for? Grab this book in the hardcover version today!The genius of this work is how Loeb is able to tie-in the new Supergirl to Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman - not to mention Darkseid. The story is simple superhero fare with lots of heart. If you're sick of all those \\"decompressed\\" writing over at Marvel where the hero is unmasked and sits down moping for five issues in a cafe before putting in the mask again to punch the villain on the sixth issue (and the 6 issues should fit nicely into a TPB collection), you'll absolutely LOVE this volume. This is superheroes doing what superheroes should be doing - mind-blowing action, romance and humour."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"This second storyarc in Jeph Loeb's ongoing Superman/Batman run is highlighted by featuring the pencils of Michael Turner. While he does do some mouth watering renditions of the female form, I've never admired his material as much as say, legends George Perez or Jim Lee. That aside, Superman/Batman: Supergirl finds the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight discovering a young girl who is roaming the streets of Gotham and appears to exhibit powers similar to Superman's. This, the official debut of Kara Zor-El in the post-Crisis DC Universe, makes this tale worth picking up for longtime DC fanboys, but Loeb's done better storytelling wise than here. Wonder Woman intercedes as Superman is ecstatic over the discovery of another live Kryptonian, while Batman is, naturally, suspicious, while Darkseid is waiting in the wings. All in all, Superman/Batman: Supergirl is better than the first volume, Public Enemies, but fans of Loeb will find that this is not the scribe's best work."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"If you love Superman and Batman, this is the comic for you.

(Only thing that looked wrong was Kara's shoulders were really narrow compared to her hips in *some* drawings. She still looked good and sexy, but her hips shouldn't have looked like she'd been through pregnancy.)"},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"The artwork is amazing and the story is wonderful, couldn't have asked for a better piece to add to my collection."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"Not that it matters now - and maybe, from now on, we'll have to preface each review of these pre-New 52 products like so - but, in 2004, the \\"Supergirl\\" arc in the SUPERMAN/BATMAN title reintroduced Kara Zor-El to the DC fold. This was back when Jeph Loeb was still writing good stuff and the late Michael Turner was still churning out fine, distinctive artwork. This arc eventually inspired an animated film. Anyway, this trade collection, SUPERMAN/BATMAN Vol. 2: SUPERGIRL, collects issues #8-13.Unlike the old WORLD'S FINEST comic, SUPERMAN/BATMAN consistently explores the innate differences between the two superheroes, as well as their similarities. Jeph Loeb's big plot device is to simultaneously narrate the story thru Supes and Bats' frequently polarized perspectives. The \\"Supergirl\\" arc takes great pains to observe this yin yang dichotomy.Back in 1985, in reading CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS, Supergirl's death devastated me more than did Flash's death, even though Flash was the more iconic character. We all knew Barry Allen was a noble cat, and, yeah, his sacrifice was tragic. But Supergirl, in her final moments, was so alive and fierce, and she fought so hard. Her death simply felt more visceral. There have been various attempts to reintroduce Supergirl since then, but none more successful than this incarnation. She gets a pretty great origin story.When an alien space vessel settles to the bottom of Gotham Bay, Batman investigates. And when a teenaged girl emerges, dazed and speaking fluent Kryptonian, Batman goes on immediate alert because Batman and paranoia go together like \\"superstitious\\" and \\"cowardly lot.\\" Superman, obversely, welcomes this mysterious miss with open arms, seeing in her not only a fellow Kryptonian but his long-lost cousin, Kara Zor-El. Or so she claims. Bats isn't so sure. Kal-El seeks to nurture and protect Kara. Bruce is still very skeptical of her true agenda and of the legitimacy of her Kryptonian heritage. It's not calming him down any that Kara exhibits powers similar to the Man of Steel. He's aghast that Kal-El has right away revealed his secret identity to her. This \\"Is she or isn't she?\\" conundrum takes up most of this storyline to resolve.The Kryptonian inscription on the spaceship's hull reads: \\"This vessel carries my daughter, Kara Zor-El, from the now dead planet Krypton. Treat her as you would your own child for you will see the treasure she will be for your world.\\" Batman's immediate response is to question whether the translation didn't glitch up. We get an amusing moment in which an exasperated Superman assures Bats, for the fortieth time, that the translated word indeed is \\"treasure,\\" and not \\"terror\\" or \\"trouble.\\" Heh.Gratifyingly, Loeb expands on the plot. He evokes images of the Trinity concept by featuring Wonder Woman (in full-on warrior mode) from the third issue on of this arc. Diana is slated to play a pivotal role in mentoring the fledgling Girl of Steel. Loeb also works in a Darkseid sub-plot that pays off huge in later issues. And since Apokalips is in the mix, we're treated to a guest spot by the awesome Big Barda as well (sorry, her husband, the escape artist, is currently on tour).One of the aggravating shames in comic books is that this was the only interior work ever done by the dynamic Michael Turner for DC Comics. His take on the DC icons is spectacular. I absolutely love his rendition of Supergirl and Big Barda. And, thankfully, the writing does justice to his artwork. I love that SUPERMAN/BATMAN Vol. 2: SUPERGIRL starts out as a mystery and an involving character study but then explodes into epic scope. Loeb's canvas eventually attains grandiose proportions, thanks in large part to Wonder Woman's intrusiveness and to Darkseid's expert machinations and, of course, to Michael Turner's humongous talent. There comes a moment in which Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman decide to invade Apokalips, this basically an excuse for Batman to go one on one with Darkseid... and not only survive but win a breathtaking game of bluff. The coda then showcases Superman's own aptitude for sneaky strategy and his epic brawl with Darkseid, as well as Darkseid's inability to adhere to the spirit of a verbal contract. And I'd be remissed if I don't mention just how fresh-faced and appealing Kara Zor-El comes across in these pages. She is instantly more likable than Matrix or the post-Crisis Linda Danvers or Cir-El. Ah, man, Jeph Loeb, you were awesome once. What happened, dude?This trade also comes with an introduction by Jeph Loeb, variant covers by Michael Turner (with one by Jim Lee), sketches by Michael Turner, and a Kryptonian-to-English translation of Kal-El and Kara's dialogue on page 21 of issue #1, as well as a Kryptonian-English cypher key."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"I have always loved Supergirl's story. The book is in excellent conditions and now I can read it and enjoy it everyday."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"This paperback edition is by far one of the most beautiful books I've ever had.The story is ok. Jeph Loeb made a re-introduction of the classic Supergirl, Kara Zor-El. I'm starting to get anoyed with all that \\"thinking\\" Superman and Batman do in every single page. I know that's something of a trade mark from Loeb, but to have books with two characters doing it at once is kind of boring and sometimes confusing.Anyway, and in spite of what I mentioned above, the story is good, and Batman is the man!!!.What it makes this book a lovely one to have is the magnificent art from Michael Turner and the impresice coloring. Besides that I'm under the impression DC made this with special paper. Is not glossy nor the other kind, but is something that's gloriously in the middle and it looks great!!!.The book have an introduction from Loeb (which admits Geoff Jones help him with this), and at the end there's a few alternative covers and some sketches from Turner.The last page of the comic dedicating the story to Christopher Reeve make it even more beautiful.Anyway, if I were you, I'll get this book ASAP. If I were DC I would absolute this book (or make a cool compilation of Superman/Batman stories) and put them in a Deluxe format.I love this book and I'm sure you'll love it too."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"Jeph Loeb and the late Michael Turner collaborated and gave us one of the best looking and non-confusing Supergirl tale. Loeb, who has always understood DC continuity gives a fresh comic book realistic take on Kara and Kal's lineage. The addition of Amazonians and Darkseid along with Big Barda was great. I always enjoy seeing the alternating inner monologues by Bruce and Clark. The art was stunning. Overall, a fantastic read."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"In my youth, I was a voracious reader of superhero comic books, both the DC and Marvel lines. At the time, I had a preference for the Marvel group because the characters were more imaginative and acted a bit more human. The DC heroes were stiff in both behavior and dialog, while the Marvel heroes were portrayed very much like humans that happened to be powerful.The people at DC have finally seen the light and made their heroes a lot more human and that is very clear in this excellent story. Bruce Wayne/Batman is a morose cynic, still an excellent crime fighter yet haunted by his past and not too many bat-steps from the point of insanity. Superman/Clark is an overprotective relative that refuses to engage in the proper degree of skepticism when a rocket capsule lands with the inscription that it contains his cousin Kara Zor-El. The girl inside is very much a teenager, right down to her thong underwear that is prominently displayed above her pants. She is fundamentally uncertain, yet determined to be independent.There are powerful villains determined to take advantage of the situation and the subsequent battles put the friendship and loyalty of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman through a great deal of strain. The battles are titanic in scope and energy as the three heroes work to defeat the forces of Darkseid as they attempt to co-opt Kara Zor-El into their evil legions.This is a great story, full of emotional undercurrents covering a wide spectrum of emotions. In many ways one of the most refreshing changes is the depiction of the super dog Krypto. The dog was one of my least favorite characters in the earlier Superman comics for all it did was go \\"yip yip\\" and never really acted like a real dog. In this story, Krypto is a true watchdog that growls and doesn't like anybody."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"I just recently watched the Superman/Batman: Apocalypse animated film last week and having no idea that it was based on Superman/Batman: Supergirl I just happened to purchase this book this week. As much as I enjoyed the film I was blown away by how much I enjoyed this book. I really thought that since I had the story so fresh in my mind from seeing the movie that I would just passively browse this book and be done with it. From the opening scene in this trade I was hooked. The art is incredible and gives such life and emotion to each character. The internal dialogue of Superman and Batman offer something that the film was unable to portray. Even the ending is a little different from the movie and far superior in my opinion. The movie's ending was a lot simpler then this book, likely to prevent any confusion from a casual watcher. The author and artists gave life to a character that, after numerous revamps, I was shocked at how entertained I was witnessing the rebirth of Kara Zor-El."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"As DC's most recognizable characters, it has made sense to pair Superman and Batman together for decades. They are literally yin and yang, darkness and light, yet still believing in justice and the fight against evil. The current iteration of the World's Finest Team, \\"Superman/Batman\\" owes its existence to writer Jeph Loeb, who continues his tenure on the book with this second volume.The story opens two weeks after the events of \\"Superman/Batman: Public Enemies\\". The kryptonite meteor has been destroyed and Batman is coordinating the cleanup of any debris. The recovery of kryptonite within the Gotham City Harbor, however, leads to the discovery of a Kryptonian craft that was trapped within the meteor - and the young teenage girl it carries. The girl claims to be Kara Zor-El, cousin to Kal-El AKA Superman. Superman is delighted at the prospect of a survivor from Krypton who's family, but Batman is naturally suspicious. The situation becomes even more complicated when both Wonder Woman and the alien tyrant Darkseid take an interest in the girl.This is the best story arc from Jeph Loeb's tenure. His characterization of Superman and Batman is spot-on and his internal narration helps flesh out and sell the divide between these two heroes over the Supergirl from Krypton. The late Michael turner's artwork is stylized and spectacular and enhanced by the coloring of Peter Steigerwald."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"good book. very good storyline to follow from start to finish...shows the strength of the writers and animators...would recommend highly.."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"First off, i think i shouls mention that i rarely write reviews, that said i will get to it now. I purchased this item used or new expecting a pleasant diversion on a rainy day.this is a very well written tale of with a few twists and turns in it that i was well impresssed by. as everyone \\"knows\\" Kara zor-el died at the end of crisis on infinite earths,this has proven to be a bad move on dc,s part as she was and is a very popular character.i was wel satisfied to see she is back although in a slghtly different form.Most of all i was stunned at how the staff at DC decided to show in just one or two pages why darkseid is a real \\"bad guy\\"! Big Blue is as usual his big blue boy scout self and the bat is as usual his almost grumpy grim self. there are good reasons for these states of affairs. this starts at pesumabbly public enemies left off. and Bats is a little cautious when it comes to kara just conveniently showwing up.this will likely be a good place for those who need a \\"jumping on\\" place for these two icons for the 21st century.as i have already stated darkseid is a real thug in this one and gets his too.i look forward to more from this team of writers.i gave it five stars because the images are crisp the writing is well paced but not too bogged down in details. it is truly a tale of Superiour people with truly \\"human\\" values.along the way we learn as i always knew that the Batman just appears gruff because he does care. it is his way of distanceing himself from what he has to do sometimes.he truly means it when he says he will do whatever it takes to protect the innocent and defend those that cannot defend themselves. All in all a good tale. ENJOY IT!!"},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"This book is so cool. I generally didnt like supergirl, but the way she is presented by Loeb and Turner, makes her irresistable. Also Batman and Superman! enough said. I like this book more than the first and encourage Loeb and Turner to continue working together. Great art and great storytelling is what comics are all about, and together they do just that and more."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"While in the middle of legal midigaion with Top Cow in regards to his wanting to launch is Aspen publication, Michael Turner was asked by DC if he could work on a story for one of their titles. Turner said he'd only do it if the story contained Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. Not only did Jeph Loeb, who would go on to write Turner's Ekos title, grant his wish, but made one even better. The official debut of Kara Zor-El in the post-Crisis DC universe.Loeb masterfully weaves together the tale of Kara's arrival, finding herself wondering the streets of Gotham with no clue as to just how powerful she is on this planet. Batman is very suspecious of her, but Superman is struck with joy knowing that he is no longer the last remaining Krypton alive. But his happiness is put to the test when Batman continues to express his doubts and Wonder Woman joins in, bringing Kara by force to Paradise Island for training and protection. And it only gets worse when Darkseid enters the picture.After establishing Loeb's ability to write awesome stories, though in Michael's amazing ability to draw. It doesn't seem that long ago that he beat cancer and it has only driven him to draw better. And being a fan of his work, I can say without a doubt that this is Michael's absolute best work ever. The detail, even the smallest amount, is Perez-like and beautifully brought to life. And Peter Steigerwald's colors is just a beauty to behold.If anything, this story not only tells the exciting and dramatic arrival of Kara Zor-El, but also re-establishes just why Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman are DC's big three and what has made them the most prominent superheroes of all-time. You can't get any better than this."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"This comic has excellent art, and is well written.

The story by Jeph Loeb and artwork by Michael Turner, re-introduces Supergirl to the DC Universe! There are apperances by many DC heroes from the Justice League of America, Teen Titans, and JSA. I highly recommend this book! A"},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"If you were to ask many long time comic book fans what they know of Supergirl's history you might be surprised to hear them ask which Supergirl you were talking about. Just thinking about all the twists and turns this character has gone through is enough to give you a migraine. She has to be one of, if not the most, retconned character in comics. Most of us knew her best as Superman's cousin Kara the last survivor of Argo City. She went on many adventures with and without Superman but she eventually joined the 30th century hero group the Legion of Superheroes where the character had the chance to grow. She later lost her life in battle against the Anti-Monitor in the Crisis on Infinite Earths miniseries, and by the time this reality altering series was over she had never even existed as far as DC Comics continuity was concerned.This trade collects issues 8-13 of the Superman/Batman series. The story opens as Batman is diving in the waters off Gotham City collecting remnants of a recently destroyed Kryptonite asteroid. While arguing with Superman over a comm-link he finds a recently abandoned space ship with Kryptonian markings. He has to cut his examination short however when someone steals the Batboat and crashes it into a pier. He eventually catches up to the thief to find a teenage girl with super powers. He subdues her with some of the Kryptonite he found and takes her back to the Batcave for an examination. When she comes to and tries to escape Superman talks to her and finds out she is his cousin Kara Zor-El. She stays at Superman's fortress in quarantine as her powers grow since Batman is suspicious of her story. We later find out that her ship was supposed to follow Superman's as he left for Earth. She was to be his guardian but her ship was buried in debris when Krypton exploded and she drifted through space in some kind of hibernation until she eventually reached Earth.As Clark Kent is showing Kara the outside world Wonder Woman, Harbinger and Artemis ambush them. They insist of taking Kara to Themyscira (home of the Amazons) for training because Harbinger had a vague vision that bad things would happen due to Kara being on Earth. Harbinger appears to be right when she is killed while trying to prevent Darkseid's minions from kidnapping Kara. With the help of Big Barda they travel to Apokolips to rescue the now brainwashed Kara. When they return home Kara learns to accept her new life on Earth and her role as Supergirl.Jeff Loeb tried to cram too much into these stories. There is no pacing and no build up to the character. Its like he was saying here is the new Supergirl so just accept her. And I have to question the way he handles this story. Why is Superman such a wimp? He lets others push him around and can only stand by and brood. You're Superman for crying out loud. Show some backbone. And I know they have been writing Batman as an even bigger paranoid obsessive than usual lately but this needs to stop. He is such a jerk nobody would put up with him no matter how smart he was. Kara says her ship never left of its own power so how did it survive Krypton's destruction. It is suggested Supergirl might be more powerful than Superman is, but the only sunlight she was exposed to prior to landing on Earth was artificial. We also see that in less than a month on Earth she has learned several languages. How is this possible? Kryptonian technology? But since we are on the topic couldn't Kryptonian technology have taught her everything she needed to know about Earth on the way there? She was supposed to be Kal-el's guardian so why not arm her with as much information on Earth as they had. Worst of all is how she managed to survive inside a Kryptonite asteroid. Long term Kryptonite exposure equals death.Michael Turner has made a name for himself in comics but I can't stand that sketchy art style he uses. It seems he puts little effort into showing us the texture of objects and his characters have little variety in facial expression and emotion. It is only due to Peter Steigerwald's coloring that the art is able to come across as moody. On the plus side though Turner does draw a good Batman.I think the biggest problem with the Supergirl character was that she was never anything more than a pale imitation of her famous cousin. Whatever depth the character might have had was never strong enough to let her step out of Superman's shadow. Whether this Supergirl will be the one that stands the test of time in the DC universe or is just the latest version to come down the line remains to be seen."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"This TPB is one of my favorites. It has excellent art, which explores the worlds of both Gothem and Metropolis and good character. Highly recamend. Very good. Excellent."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"I picked this \\"World's Finest\\" book up hoping for some good, clean, mindless super-fun... Well, it worked for \\"mindless,\\" but as for the rest of it... No luck. The script is by Jeph Loeb, who is normally a pretty sleek, entertaining writer who invests his characters with some depth, without making too big a deal out of it. Here, though, the plot is exceptionally flimsy -- a new Supergirl comes to Earth via spaceship, elating Superman while setting off alarm bells for the ever-suspicious Batman. The conflict between these two old friends -- and later between them and Wonder Woman -- over what to do with the superpowered space orphan is terribly forced and often nonsensical. Uncharacteristically, Superman blows his stack over the Amazon's taking over Supergirl's training, and then blames them (inexplicably) for making her a target for his enemies. The interpersonal drama rings false and falls flat throughout, a failure that is compounded by the intense boring-osity of the villain: Darkseid and Apokalips, one of the most overused (and now uninteresting) uber-baddies in the DC universe.I was really disappointed by this book. It was pretty mediocre, and not up to the high calibre of storytelling I expect from Mr. Loeb... I guess it was okay, but I can't help but feel my money could have been better spent elsewhere.([...])"},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"Esta coleccion de Superman/Batman quita el aliento, te cautiva y quiere devorarlo lo mas pronto posible, es super excelente la combinacion de dos grandes superheroes incluido el increible BATMAN.

A thought provoking arc filled with great art, great dialogue. Then came this complete 180. Jeph Loeb completely fell off the tracks, not to mention the Michael Turner art. Once you realize that ALL of Turner's figures look the same, the book loses something. Not to mention that the story on the whole is nonsensical and uncharacteristic. A stain on the DCU. Do not buy! Go look up \\"Alan Moore\\" or \\"Jim Lee\\" if you want some good story and art respectively. Not this!"},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"This story arc is written by fan-favorite Jeph Loeb and the art is provided by Michael Turner. This arc introduces a new Supergirl in the DC Universe. The premise is that a giant meteor rock has landed in Gotham Bay and contains a girl with no memories and no trace of origin. The only thing that is concrete about her is that she is from Krypton adn her name is Kara. There is also a hint that she is from the House of El and is Superman's cousin. Superman is thrilled to have a living relative from Krypton whereas Batman is suspicious of her. As she is adjusting to life on Earth, she is forcefully removed from Batman and Superman's custody by Wonder Woman. And later on, she is kidnapped from Paradise Island by Darkseid. Thst is it for the basic premise.This is not one of Jeph Loeb's best works. It is pretty to look at (It's Michael Turner, people) and there are some great moments in the story but other than that it is pretty generic. I have read all of Loeb's works for both Marvel and DC and feel that he is a writer of great caliber. Here, however he writes a lot of events and characters that are just there for shock value. For example, Kara is out in the town with Superman and Batman and all of a sudden Wonder Woman shows up and attempts to kidnap her...my question is why? These three are JLA members and good friends. There is no reason for Wonder Woman to try and Kidnap Kara other than the fact that in the final page, you see Batman and Superman gasping saying \\" gasp...It's You!!!\\" Also, Darkseid is disposed of in a very generic and in a less than glamorous manner. However, there are good moments in the story, i.e. Batman taking on Darkseid...that's right Batman vs. Darkseid. But overall it's a pretty generic story.Overall, it's not a great story but it's an okay story...it won't rank up there with Loeb's earlier works such as Batman The Long Halloween or Batman Dark Victory but it's soilid enough to stand on its own. All in all a 3.5 for the story alone and a 4 for the art."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"When I was just getting into comic books, I didn't know anything about the mainstream superheroes and their origins. Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman? They were legends, known from cartoons and pop-culture. But then two series changed all that by sucking me in with their outstanding artwork, and incredible story-telling. The first one was Batman:Hush by Jim Lee and Jeph Loeb. The second is this one, the second part of Superman/Batman. Only this time it's Michael Turner instead of Jim Lee. Loeb though, wrote this one too, and while unfortunately he does not quite match high point he reached with Hush Part 1 (or Spider-man: Blue or Hulk:Gray) for the duration, he still managed to weave a good tale, with the best parts approaching or even competing with his best work.While Hush is certainly enough to make a Batman fan out of the uninitiated, I was really introduced to the character of Superman through Superman/Batman and Superman: Godfall (also highly recommended). Like the previous issues of Superman/Batman, this series picks up with a story being told from the duel perspective of the dark knight and the man of steel. This time of course the story involves one Kara Zor-El, Superman's Kryptonian cousin. You could say that this whole storyline is really an answer to all the people who said \\"How come we aren't getting any cool comics about the REAL Supergirl?!\\". As a serious fan of all female superheroes, I can't help but think that this is a very good thing.The first chapter of the story details Batman's investigation of meteorite that has fallen to earth (as shown in the first Superman/Batman collection). He goes underwater to check it out while Superman complains about how he can't go outside because of all the anti-Superman propoganda being pushed by the President (Lex Luthor). Supergirl escapes from her capsule which was contained in the meteorite, and proceeds to start wreaking havoc on the city of Gotham with her newfound superpowers. Naturally Superman shows up to help out before things get TOO out of hand, but it's Batman who takes the decisive action of knocking Kara out with some Kryptonite so he can take her back for examination (always the detective, never one to be hood-winked). She isn't too happy when she comes to (and starts shouting in Kryptonian {I didn't mention that up to this point that's all she's been talking in}), but quickly mellows out when she meets Supes, who is just overjoyed to finally meet someone nice (and family to boot) from his old home planet.Chapter 2 is all about Batman's skepticism, Superman's idealism, Kara's teenage attitude, and the inevitable conflicts as Superman tries to protect Kara, Batman distrusts her and worries about Superman, and she just tries to figure out where she is and why Superman is trying to control her while Batman is trying to lock her up for safekeeping. There's also a quick jump to Apokolips where Darkseid (Superman's true nemesis in my opinion) is trying to find a replacement for Big Barda, the former leader of his honor guard (this will become important later...). The real fun surprise though, is that when Clark Kent takes Kara to Metropolis for a visit, they come under attack from...WONDER WOMAN!In the third chapter (the point where I originally started reading the series), we see that Diana's spiriting away of Kara was actually planned and approved by Batman (another one of endless paranoid tests eh?). It could probably be argued that this is the best part of the entire series, as we get to see lots of Turner doing what he does best (action scenes with beautiful women. While one friend of mine who's a huge fan of Wonder Woman said she looked like she was wearing a swimsuit (and he was just plain disgusted), I for one got a big kick out of Turner's designs for the inhabitants of Themyscira. The whole point of Kara's being taken there was for her to learn some discipline and control of her powers through combat training. There's some entertaining interplay between the big three (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman) as Superman continues to be overprotective and complains about Wonder Woman's methods, and Batman continues to be skeptical and feels more at ease with Wonder Woman on his side. There's a little to show how Kara is making new friends on the island (Harbinger), but all too soon the peace is disrupted by some nasty monsters sent over courtesy of Darkseid. This of course results in some really cool action (Batman's wielding a battle-axe, Superman vaporizing the whole field of enemies with his heat-vision), and some truly epic moments (a silhouette of Superman amid the flames, the lifeless Harbinger wrapped in Superman's cape and draped in his arms). Oh, and Kara gets kidnapped which REALLY ticks off Superman.The fourth chapter is a fun little trip to Apokolips via boom tube, as Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Big Barda meet up, suit-up, and head out. To make a long story short, Darkseid's female furies attack Barda and Wonder Woman, one of Darkseid's watchdogs eats Batman, and when Supergirl is finally found by Superman she proceeds to start beating the crap out of him (oh those nasty mind-tricks!). This one is okay, with most of the pull being exerted by the nice action scenes and dire situations our heroes got themselves into (everyone looks like they're about to die). Art-wise this episode is a little weak though, as the color tone is mostly yellow and red and the drawings just aren't quite as dynamic as before.The fifth chapter nicely wraps up the whole Apokolips chapter, as Batman escapes, Diana turns the tables on the furies, and Superman finds the guts to punch Kara with a Kryptonite ring to knock her out. In the end though, it's Batman who saves their skins by guaranteeing the continued existence of the planet (reprogramming Darkseid's planet-destroying explosives is a piece of cake for him right?) in exchange for their safe departure. Back on earth there are tears of sorrow, as Superman and Kara face what has happened (mind-manipulation and death of friends you know). And then...Kara takes to the skies in the Supergirl uniform, only to be blasted to bits by Darkseid (WHAT?!)!!The sixth and final chapter is all about Superman's fight against Darkseid (why do I still think of the battle between them in the Superman/Batman animated series as the best ever?) as Superman finally really loses his cool and knocks Darkseid into space and then, thorough boom tube to teh far side of the universe. Once again, though, it all turns out to be a clever little game played by Superman and Batman, and Kara is NOT dead (just hiding). Finally, at long last, Superman, Batman, and the new Supergirl reconcile their differences (Superman stops treating Kara like a little girl and Batman finally sets his mind at ease...for the moment. The real treat of course is the final couple of pages where most of the great DC heroes all assemble to greet Supergirl and joins their ranks for the first time.What can I say? It isn't very often that Michael Turner will do the artwork for an entire series (he's done Fathom and Soulfire that I really enjoy), let alone one outside of one of his personal creations. Increasingly he's become known for doing outstanding covers, and not much else. Getting a chance to see him do a complete series about classic characters out of the JLA is a real treat, and for a huge Supergirl fan like me it's just the icing on the cake that it happens to be about her too. Some people will take issue with Turner's interpretations of the classic characters of the DC universe (Batman's ears are too pointy, Superman's jaw is too square), but I really just love them all. To me they are like the work of Jim Lee or Alex Ross. Bright, beautiful, and larger than life. Awesome.While Fathom had a largely blue tint, this series uses a lot of twilight colors, as well as some wonderfully bright reds, blues, and yellows. This at times results in some truly beautiful pictures, as the blue mountains of paradise contrast withte sunset spectrum of the sky and sand, and the yellow lights of metropolis play against a dark blue sky. Turner's style has really refined significantly since the days of Fathom (and continues to get better in Soulfire). His character designs are simply sharper, tighter, and better than ever before.Let's face it, when Turner, Loeb, and Steigerwald are on it's magic. In the first three parts of this story, that's what it is. The rest of the story and artwork are good, just not as good as the first three. If you're a Turner fan this is a must buy. If you just love Superman, Batman, or Supergirl (and like a little Wonder Woman on the side), this is definitely one to check out. It might not rewrite the book on superheroes, but it IS a whole lot of fun, just like watching a great episode of Justice League, the Superman/Batman show, or Batman the Animated Series. Here's to the REAL Supergirl, Kara Zor-El!"},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"Kara Zor El is back! After 20 years of fake Supergirls (Matrix, Earth angel, Cir El) the girl of steel of silver age gets a new life for the joy of her loyal fans. This beautiful album by Loeb and Turner brings Kara to the 21st century with lovely artwork and a well developed story. In the introduction Loeb says he fell in love with Kara and such love shows in every page of this outstanding work. A must in the collection of every enthusiast of classic super-heroes. Now let us hope that Kara gets the chance she deserves to be fully developed. Supergirl is more than a female version of Superman. As you know Kal-El came to Earth as a baby and was raised in Kansas. His mind is that of an american on a kryptonian boy. But Kara was raised and educated in Krypton until the age of 15. She is the last ambassador of an very advanced civilization. Even if she doesn't have much memory of her life at home she has the potential to became a tutor of his cousin as Loeb suggests in this book. And that's why all those earth girls with Kara's costume were not Supergirls. The krypton background was missing. If you like comics in the old style buy this book! Support the return of the lovely and unique Kara Zor-El"},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"I just love this book. I wish I could find some witty and insightful comment to make...but words fail me! The presentation is stunning, with the added preface by Mr. Loeb and the bonus sketch book material in the back of the book, I can't think of a more fitting tribute to the re-introduction of Kara Zor-El. Admittedly the teleporation bit at the end was a bit too much for me, but the story is still strong and works well for bringing Kara back into the fold. I love the addition of Wonder Woman and her interest in Kara was well executed. As for Mr. Turner's work...love it. He can not only draw some hot ladies...but his men aren't too shabby either. Hands down...this book is fabulous."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"over all I have to say that this was not one of the greatest stories of all time. Supergirl comes to earth and Clark is overprotective while Bruce is paranoid. everyone wants to get their hands on her and she is feeling isolated and angsty. it's been done. but here it is done well. if you have read the first batman\\\\superman comic you wull know what to expect and it is done just fine. if you are not familiar with DC mythos you will be lost but the story is rather nice.over all: a fun read that is well done but not the greatest story ever told."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"When I was just getting into comic books, I didn't know anything about the mainstream superheroes and their origins. Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman? They were legends, known from cartoons and pop-culture. But then two series changed all that by sucking me in with their outstanding artwork, and incredible story-telling. The first one was Batman:Hush by Jim Lee and Jeph Loeb. The second is this one, the second part of Superman/Batman. Only this time it's Michael Turner instead of Jim Lee. Loeb though, wrote this one too, and while unfortunately he does not quite match high point he reached with Hush Part 1 (or Spider-man: Blue or Hulk:Gray) for the duration, he still managed to weave a good tale, with the best parts approaching or even competing with his best work.While Hush is certainly enough to make a Batman fan out of the uninitiated, I was really introduced to the character of Superman through Superman/Batman and Superman: Godfall (also highly recommended). Like the previous issues of Superman/Batman, this series picks up with a story being told from the duel perspective of the dark knight and the man of steel. This time of course the story involves one Kara Zor-El, Superman's Kryptonian cousin. You could say that this whole storyline is really an answer to all the people who said \\"How come we aren't getting any cool comics about the REAL Supergirl?!\\". As a serious fan of all female superheroes, I can't help but think that this is a very good thing.The first chapter of the story details Batman's investigation of meteorite that has fallen to earth (as shown in the first Superman/Batman collection). He goes underwater to check it out while Superman complains about how he can't go outside because of all the anti-Superman propoganda being pushed by the President (Lex Luthor). Supergirl escapes from her capsule which was contained in the meteorite, and proceeds to start wreaking havoc on the city of Gotham with her newfound superpowers. Naturally Superman shows up to help out before things get TOO out of hand, but it's Batman who takes the decisive action of knocking Kara out with some Kryptonite so he can take her back for examination (always the detective, never one to be hood-winked). She isn't too happy when she comes to (and starts shouting in Kryptonian {I didn't mention that up to this point that's all she's been talking in}), but quickly mellows out when she meets Supes, who is just overjoyed to finally meet someone nice (and family to boot) from his old home planet.Chapter 2 is all about Batman's skepticism, Superman's idealism, Kara's teenage attitude, and the inevitable conflicts as Superman tries to protect Kara, Batman distrusts her and worries about Superman, and she just tries to figure out where she is and why Superman is trying to control her while Batman is trying to lock her up for safekeeping. There's also a quick jump to Apokolips where Darkseid (Superman's true nemesis in my opinion) is trying to find a replacement for Big Barda, the former leader of his honor guard (this will become important later...). The real fun surprise though, is that when Clark Kent takes Kara to Metropolis for a visit, they come under attack from...WONDER WOMAN!In the third chapter (the point where I originally started reading the series), we see that Diana's spiriting away of Kara was actually planned and approved by Batman (another one of endless paranoid tests eh?). It could probably be argued that this is the best part of the entire series, as we get to see lots of Turner doing what he does best (action scenes with beautiful women. While one friend of mine who's a huge fan of Wonder Woman said she looked like she was wearing a swimsuit (and he was just plain disgusted), I for one got a big kick out of Turner's designs for the inhabitants of Themyscira. The whole point of Kara's being taken there was for her to learn some discipline and control of her powers through combat training. There's some entertaining interplay between the big three (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman) as Superman continues to be overprotective and complains about Wonder Woman's methods, and Batman continues to be skeptical and feels more at ease with Wonder Woman on his side. There's a little to show how Kara is making new friends on the island (Harbinger), but all too soon the peace is disrupted by some nasty monsters sent over courtesy of Darkseid. This of course results in some really cool action (Batman's wielding a battle-axe, Superman vaporizing the whole field of enemies with his heat-vision), and some truly epic moments (a silhouette of Superman amid the flames, the lifeless Harbinger wrapped in Superman's cape and draped in his arms). Oh, and Kara gets kidnapped which REALLY ticks off Superman.The fourth chapter is a fun little trip to Apokolips via boom tube, as Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Big Barda meet up, suit-up, and head out. To make a long story short, Darkseid's female furies attack Barda and Wonder Woman, one of Darkseid's watchdogs eats Batman, and when Supergirl is finally found by Superman she proceeds to start beating the crap out of him (oh those nasty mind-tricks!). This one is okay, with most of the pull being exerted by the nice action scenes and dire situations our heroes got themselves into (everyone looks like they're about to die). Art-wise this episode is a little weak though, as the color tone is mostly yellow and red and the drawings just aren't quite as dynamic as before.The fifth chapter nicely wraps up the whole Apokolips chapter, as Batman escapes, Diana turns the tables on the furies, and Superman finds the guts to punch Kara with a Kryptonite ring to knock her out. In the end though, it's Batman who saves their skins by guaranteeing the continued existence of the planet (reprogramming Darkseid's planet-destroying explosives is a piece of cake for him right?) in exchange for their safe departure. Back on earth there are tears of sorrow, as Superman and Kara face what has happened (mind-manipulation and death of friends you know). And then...Kara takes to the skies in the Supergirl uniform, only to be blasted to bits by Darkseid (WHAT?!)!!The sixth and final chapter is all about Superman's fight against Darkseid (why do I still think of the battle between them in the Superman/Batman animated series as the best ever?) as Superman finally really loses his cool and knocks Darkseid into space and then, thorough boom tube to teh far side of the universe. Once again, though, it all turns out to be a clever little game played by Superman and Batman, and Kara is NOT dead (just hiding). Finally, at long last, Superman, Batman, and the new Supergirl reconcile their differences (Superman stops treating Kara like a little girl and Batman finally sets his mind at ease...for the moment. The real treat of course is the final couple of pages where most of the great DC heroes all assemble to greet Supergirl and joins their ranks for the first time.What can I say? It isn't very often that Michael Turner will do the artwork for an entire series (he's done Fathom and Soulfire that I really enjoy), let alone one outside of one of his personal creations. Increasingly he's become known for doing outstanding covers, and not much else. Getting a chance to see him do a complete series about classic characters out of the JLA is a real treat, and for a huge Supergirl fan like me it's just the icing on the cake that it happens to be about her too. Some people will take issue with Turner's interpretations of the classic characters of the DC universe (Batman's ears are too pointy, Superman's jaw is too square), but I really just love them all. To me they are like the work of Jim Lee or Alex Ross. Bright, beautiful, and larger than life. Awesome.While Fathom had a largely blue tint, this series uses a lot of twilight colors, as well as some wonderfully bright reds, blues, and yellows. This at times results in some truly beautiful pictures, as the blue mountains of paradise contrast withte sunset spectrum of the sky and sand, and the yellow lights of metropolis play against a dark blue sky. Turner's style has really refined significantly since the days of Fathom (and continues to get better in Soulfire). His character designs are simply sharper, tighter, and better than ever before.Let's face it, when Turner, Loeb, and Steigerwald are on it's magic. In the first three parts of this story, that's what it is. The rest of the story and artwork are good, just not as good as the first three. If you're a Turner fan this is a must buy. If you just love Superman, Batman, or Supergirl (and like a little Wonder Woman on the side), this is definitely one to check out.

It was a very moving book about family where Superman meets his long-lost cousin; so now, Superman is not alone anymore. It's a real labor of love from Mr. Loeb and his team.

The story picks up from the end of the first Volume and creates a story that is ultimately one of the best I have read in the recent publishing of DC comics. The relationships between the characters and the plot all lead to a well-rounded interesting story. Along with the tale comes the graphics that complete the greatness of this graphic novel.

While \\"Public Enemies\\" gives us a story packed with action on a grand scale, \\"Supergirl\\" delves into the thought processes and interactions between Superman, Batman, and this new girl, Kara. From Superman's need to protect, to Batman's unwillingness to trust, this story has my favourite portrayals of the Man of Steel and Dark Knight."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"It's difficult to read this story without a tinge of melancholy in light of the recent heartbreaking passing of Michael Turner. The entire comic industry, along with his family and friends, has lost a remarkable talent and, by all accounts, a great guy as well. He didn't do many complete stories outside of his own projects, which makes this rare assemblage of impressive illustrations all the more cherishable. This trade is one of the very few that I occasionally peruse strictly for his beautiful artwork alone. From his fearsome Batman to his gorgeous Wonder Woman, his amazing ability is evident in every panel. Not to be slighted, Jeph Loeb's writing talent is also quite evident in this tale that is easily the best of the four that he worked on for this title. His trademark dueling internal monologues are showcased along with the return of Supergirl. This time around, Superman and Batman are joined by Wonder Woman and Big Barda on a perilous mission to Apokolips to rescue Supergirl from the clutches of that dastardly despot Darkseid, highlighted by a titanic physical battle and also one of high stakes poker between Batman and Darkseid. The sole flaw is that the story should have ended about thirty pages sooner upon their return to Earth, since the closing pages appear more like an epilogue whose purpose was to set the stage for the introduction of Kara to the DCU, and painfully cheesy it was at that. Nevertheless, still a very solid story with stunning art, the likes of which, sadly, we will never see again. Michael, you will be missed."},{"Title":"Superman/Batman, Vol. 2: Supergirl","review":"I came in late for much of the comics and their first printings so getting this little trade paperback was lovely.

Big fans know what I'm talking about - Supergirl is dead, she's replaced by an ectoplasmic being who is called Supergirl, yadda, yadda, yadda.So, Supergirl from Krypton is re-introduced here as a concept. Thank goodness.The story itself is good, but not nearly as good as Volume #1 in this series.

The storyline is even more intriguing then its predecessor and the art is equally as incredible (no body can draw Batman better then Michael Turner).Lex Luthor may have been insane, but he wasn't wrong. Superman was what drew the kryptonite asteroid to earth. While inspecting pieces of sunken meteor rock in Gotham's Harbors Batman discovers a space ship with kryptonian writing.

Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Barda now have to travel to Apokolips to bring her back. However, are they willing to destroy an entire planet to do so?

Wild food aficionados in particular have good reason to rejoyce, now that Mr. Brill's new cookbook is available. During the past two months, I've made nearly 20 of his recipies, and my experience has been that each one is better than the next. Fortunately, all of them seem to be easily adapted to suit available ingredients or taste preferences. Most of the sections utilizing \\"featured\\" ingredients have an interesting background about the particular plant (or in some cases, mushroom) that adds the appreciation of the dish, and the entire book is organized intelligently, in order to make cross-referencing easy. Furthermore, I've seen nothing even remotely like this book on the market today, or at any time, for that matter. Between my wife and I, we must own close to 50 cookbooks, and this is far and away our favorite.

Who is Wildman?A. Good-natured, with a sense of humor, Steve Brill has been guiding foraging tours in and around New York since 1982. He enjoys telling the story of how he was arrested and handcuffed by undercover park rangers for eating a dandelion in Central Park, a food resource area he highly supports. He's lectured in schools, for youth programs, museums, libraries and environmental groups for years. Brill is also a foraging and natural-cooking expert whose new cookbook teaches you to use nearly 150 of America's finest wild food plants to prepare tasty meals.Brill does caution and wisely so:\\"It is the reader's responsibility to identify and use the information in this book sensibly.\\" He sums up the 29 pages of pre-foraging information with an admonishment to pay particular attention to correct identification of foods in the wild and recommends the additional use of his book, Identifying and Harvesting Edible and Medicinal Plants in Wild (and Not so Wild) Places.A TRIP THROUGH THE BOOKThe Wild Vegetarian Cookbook starts by introducing wild and purchased natural foods and basic methods for preparing them. He gets into seasonings, tips on adapting natural ingredients to traditional cooking methods and explains how to harvest wild foods safely.Next he goes into recipes for \\"unwild foods.\\" Tofu-based cheeses are basic to many of Brill's recipes, and he presents his recipes for Tofu Cream Cheese, Tofu Cottage Cheese, Tofu Sour Cream, and the like. While he employs a lot of in-book cross-references, he creates few, if any, unsolved mysteries.The book is divided into seasonal sections featuring:Winter and early spring: hearty wild greens and rootsMid-to-Late Spring: best time to find wild vegetablesSummer with its plethora of fruits, flowers, greens and mushrooms.Autumn: The further abundance of mushrooms, fruits also nuts.His Table of Contents is a large, helpful, non-alphabetical, listing of recipe names grouped with the wild food it calls for, plus page numbers.

This is surely a cookbook like no other we have ever experienced. The book is a particular delight to wild foods foragers, and for those with an adventurous spirit, a new world of gastronomic delights awaits. To be sure, the book is written with the intention of having the cook utilize some of the many wild foods available in much of the United States, but as Mr. Brill points out, most of the recipes list commercially available substitutes, if their wild counterparts are not obtainable in your area..The book is not only a cookbook, but also a wonderful reference book. Most of the \\"exotic\\" ingredients called for are explained in some detail, and the book is organized in a way that make it's use, as well as it's reading, an absolute pleasure. For example, plants listed in the Table of Contents are not only grouped by type, but are organized in the chronological order in which they are ready to be foraged during the year and during each season. There is a separate section entitled Herb and Spice User's Guide\\", which lists (and describes the use) of not only some of the commonly used spices, (cardamom, cayenne pepper, celery seed, etc.) but a wide variety of more unusual spices and herbs (goutweed, sassafras, wild carrot seed, etc.) as well. There's also a \\"quick guide\\" to making dairy-free cheeses, as well as a \\"quick guide\\" to wild wine! The recipes run the course from completely original, totally different dishes, to some of the more standard, time-tested recipes that have simply been enhanced by the use of non-traditional additions or substitutions for more familiar ingredients.Another wonderful feature is that although the entire book is vegan, those with an ovo-lacto preference will find that dairy substitutions are always easy. Mind you, this book does not grant license to run out and begin tearing up wild plants wherever they may be found, in order to satisfy a desire for culinary adventure; Mr. Brill is a staunch advocate for the protection of the natural environment, and the preservation of the places in which many of the wild foods utilized in his book may be found.To enjoy this book, two pre-requisites are necessary. First, you must have an interest in wild foods. Steve's recipes are not just made with wild foods, they taste wild - no namby-pamby flavors here, every dish is robust and intense. Second, you should be an experienced cook who is not afraid to follow fairly complex recipes with multiple ingredients. A new cook might be overwhelmed by these recipes, although if one were willing to try them and follow the recipes appropriately, success is assured.Ramp season has come again, and we are currently inundated with huge quantities of this odiferous herb. Steve obviously knows how \\"rampantly\\" this vegetable grows as he has created not just one or two recipes for it, but thirty-two! The recipes range from salads, sauces and appetizers, to pickles and even wine. As we write this article, a ramp risotto casserole is baking in the oven, smelling wildly appetizing. We've already tried the tasty Ramp Pesto, and were delighted with the Bernaise Sauce a la Brill we've previously made from Steve's cookbook.And for all of you who may lament not having the option of a truly excellent vegan Vichyssoise, cry no more! The ramp version of this traditional French potato & leek soup is surely cause for celebration. C'est magnifique!Last fall, hen of the woods mushrooms were growing out of the woodwork in our area. Steve has over twenty recipes for these natural treasures. While every recipe was reliably excellent, Cajun Hen and Sesame Hen quickly became our favorites. Cajun Hen produces a spicy dish very reminiscent of chicken and a wonderful base for many more recipes. After preparing our bounty with Steve's recipe, we froze it and used it all winter. Sesame Hen was at least as good, and we found that we could vary it by using almond butter or even peanut butter instead of tahini, with equally excellent effect.There seems to be nothing in this book that is anything other than straightforward, and each section is brimming with fresh ideas, sound advice, a wonderful sense of adventure and even humor. \\"The Wild Vegetarian Cookbook\\" has certainly become one of the crown jewels in our collection of cookbooks, and easily garnishes the coveted Five Star rating (Extraordinary) from these reviewers.Joe & Kathy BrandtRedding, CT"},{"Title":"The Wild Vegetarian Cookbook","review":"Foragers who enjoy using wild ingredients will appreciate Steve Brill's Wild Vegetarian Cookbook, a unique vegetarian cookbook which focuses on natural foods available in field and in market.

I will also teach about medicinal plants and how to heal ourselves with them. It's about time we take our power back and return to our roots. It's the best recipe book I've seen."},{"Title":"The Wild Vegetarian Cookbook","review":"I was disappointed with the contents of the book. I was hoping it would also serve as a field guide for finding the ingredients. The descriptions of the wild foods are not descriptive enough to help you actually find them. Also, there are no pictures of any of the plants. I found most of the recipes to be very complex in flavors. (Mostly Asian and Indian) Not that I mind complex flavors. My fear is the spices would cover up the taste of the wild ingredient to much. The first time I try a new food, I want a simple recipe so I better understand its taste."},{"Title":"The Wild Vegetarian Cookbook","review":"This is a great book that explains how to recognize use, and harvest wild natural foods. He also gives suggestions on some substitutes for some of the wild foods with domestic ones, like leeks for wild leeks, garlic for wild garlic and current with wild currents. He also has recipes that use more uncommon wild foods like Pookweed, common MilkWeed, or Cattails, which are recipes I have not tried yet until I can learn to identify them. What interested me the most that this book is a vegan cookbook not a vegetarian cookbook as the title suggests. There are not animal products used in any of the recipes at all. The Wild Vegetarian Cookbook is the hardback and out of print copy of the recently printed The wild Vegan Cookbook By the same author. It is the same book except for the title. I love to cook and am going Vegan, the recipes I have tried are delicious and not hard to cook. It is a great book for a Vegan. I also collect cookbook and the copy I purchased was in great condition. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in cooking, wishes to explore cooking with wild foods, and is interested learning how to recognize them, and wants to learn to cook with them."},{"Title":"The Wild Vegetarian Cookbook","review":"I was very excited about this book. It is not very comprehensive for helping you identify and harvest wild plants, but it offers great advice for what to do once you have. It has also offered some of the simplest solutions for transferring to a vegan lifestyle that I have read. Very helpful. I was especially excited by the vegan cheese recipes offered."},{"Title":"The Wild Vegetarian Cookbook","review":"There are some fascinating recipes in here, and good information about vegetables that are usually ignored in cookbooks. Be aware, however, that this is a vegan cookbook--I personally was disappointed by this. I know that at least one recipe calls for pennyroyal, and I really don't think that using pennyroyal internally is a good idea at all."},{"Title":"Canyon passage","review":"Logan Stuart and George Camrose are friends with Lucy Overmire and each think they have the inside track with her. Stuart, though, is in no hurry to deepen his relationship with her because he is busy growing his business and making a living. Camrose has a gambling problem, he tries desperately to keep hid. Lucy is independent enough to know her own mind, maybe. The plot and sub-plots in this book make it highly enjoyable and open up the intrigues and mysteries which surround a town full of people; there are no card board characters in this novel! Gold fever, Indian reprisals, greed in general, a mountain wilderness just beginning to grow--all the things necessary to make the country groan and sigh. The movie version with Dana Andrews, Brian Donlevy and Susan Hayward is an excellent adaption of this book, and go quite well together; you can read it first or watch it first, and neither will disappoint or deny you the enjoyment of either. Canyon Passage, a celebrated novel by a celebrated author. Get it."},{"Title":"Canyon passage","review":"Logan Stuart and George Camrose are good friends who vie for the same woman.

Those of us who have actually taken the time train in the sword know that direct transmition is the only way (yes, the schools still exist -- go find one).What this book presents (along with some very good subtle sword pointers) is the proper mental attitude you must gain in order to progress on the path. Mr. Wilson does a wonderful job translating a difficult text. If you are serious about sword, get this book AND go find a teacher ..."},{"Title":"The Life-Giving Sword: The Secret Teachings From the House of the Shogun (The Way of the Warrior Series)","review":"Munenori's book is a classic work of Japanese literature that explores the Way of the sword through what we in the west might call a philosphical approach. Yet, I don't think the distinction between the physical style and philosophical approach would be seperate categories to Munenori. His book sets out to present the Way as a total approach of mind, body, and spirit, and not merely the development of each independently. Reading the book in any other way will probably make it fairly disappointing.The other thing to remember about this book is its a classic by one of the most influential sword instructors of his era. In that respect, the book is rich with perspective on early 17th century Japanese culture. Particularly interesting are the reprinted plates in the back of the book showing the original inked pages of technique.As other viewers pointed out, this is not a book for someone simply learning to wield a sword. Instead, Munenori's book is a fascinating account of swordsmanship that gives the reader insight not only to the richness of the Way, but also wonderful insight on a fascinating historical figure. Highly recommended for those interested in Japanese culture, history of samurai, and the feudal era."},{"Title":"The Life-Giving Sword: The Secret Teachings From the House of the Shogun (The Way of the Warrior Series)","review":"I give this book five stars simply because I love it.

It is one thing to seek enlightenment through books, but it seems only through physical experience can true manifestation of that knowledge be put to use. I love how you learn to throw away the mind, \\"No Mind\\" and live in the freedom of your actions. If your mind lingers anywhere, it becomes trapped. I see this \\"sickness\\" of the trapped mind everywhere today in people. They are trapped in the past, or a future of which they dream, and are looking forward to a reality that does not exist. They are not \\"here\\" when you speak to them. Their mind is caught in a dream, like a lotus eater, glassy eyed and harried.Other than children and animals, it's very hard these days to find people who are absorbed in the present moment. No future, no past, only living for that moment. This book is like a soothing ointment to straighten jagged thoughts of delusion. A must read."},{"Title":"The Life-Giving Sword: The Secret Teachings From the House of the Shogun (The Way of the Warrior Series)","review":"First and foremost this is not a story for entertainment nor is it a manual that will teach you how to use a sword. This is a deeply philosophical investigation into the Zen mind required to master the sword. Experienced practitioners will get the most out of it. Beginners will stumble through it and most of the value will be lost. It requires many reads and deep contemplation together with practice to really come to life.The first 60-pages of the book are very interesting, as Wilson takes us through a brief synopsis of the life and times of Munenori with some descriptions of his character and people he associated with. Munenori was a very colorful character who was a teacher and adviser to shoguns, winning the post against Musashi himself.The Yagyu clan is an old ninja family who live in the mountains outside Nara. Their village is surrounded by rice paddies and is difficult to approach. At one point Musashi traveled there to challenge Munenori (who was conveniently not present) and instead wound up dueling and killing a master of the kusurigama, a sickle with a chain and weight on the end and a common ninja weapon.The actual Life Giving Sword is about 70-pages long and is mostly a philosophical zen treaty with application for any martial art, but geared to the Way of the sword. Also included are 28 prints from the Illustrated Catalog of the Shinkage-ryu, which offers brief descriptions of the techniques and includes the \\"Tengu Series\\".This is an essential book for any sword practitioner, or anyone involved in the martial arts. I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"The Life-Giving Sword: The Secret Teachings From the House of the Shogun (The Way of the Warrior Series)","review":"Great book! Very informative and helpful.

His successful & prolific writings are a testament to this.About a third of the book is devoted to a very interesting background to the life of Munenori & life in Japan as it was nearly 400 years ago. Also, it was a bonus to see in this account many mentions made to another famous samurai that lived at the time - Miyamoto Musashi (author of \\"The Book of Five Rings\\" fame) & their spiritual companion & Zen Priest: Takuan Soho (author of \\"The Unfettered Mind\\"). These two great & so different warriors must have been aware of each others existence, one wonders whether they had ever met in person & if they had, what the outcome would have been?A great historical & truly valuable account by a master writer, which ought to be on the top of any martial artists list of important books.

The book hints at oral instruction as the primary body of the teaching to accompany the book and it shows through in the reading. In my impression, the book reads much more like a book of Zen philosophy than it does a swordsmanship manual. Granted, most books regarding the topic incorporate Zen, however this book leans much more towards Zen instead of its applications in sword fighting. Supposedly, Munenori is the &quot;middle ground&quot; between the extreme, Zen-oriented Takuan Soho (&quot;The Unfettered Mind&quot;) and the practical, loner swordsman Miyamoto Musashi (&quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot;). In my opinion, Munenori (whom the book states was heavily influenced by Takuan) also leans toward the &quot;Zen extreme&quot; style of writing.Personally, I think anyone would be better off reading &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot; by Miyamoto Musashi. His practical approach blends application and spiritual insight in a much better approach. If you are interested primarily in Zen and sword fighting, you are better off reading the two chapters regarding Swordsmanship in Suzuki's &quot;Zen and Japanese Culture&quot;. If you love the abstract, Zen only readings, Suzuki's &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind&quot; is for you. In short, the book isn't really worth reading when better classics are already out there given the subject matter."},{"Title":"Canby's Legion","review":"Baldwin has created a steamy universe with a debauched Emperor and crass commercial Empire. Though the hero, Canby, fights for right, the dark and debauched scenes of sexual orgies -- and in one case pedophilia, make this a book unsuitable for younger readers. Baldwin writes as if he was unhappy with the straightforward good versus evil in the Helmsman series and needed to make a universe reflective of everything that is bad.This is a step down in Baldwin's otherwise finely crafted space operas that are suitable for younger and adventurous teens.Canby's Legion is NOT Suitable for younger readers"},{"Title":"Canby's Legion","review":"Hey, lets face it, Bill Baldwin is not the worlds greatest author.

Mr. Baldwin kept giving us three paragraph summaries of what is going on in the universe, then spent two chapters showing us that the lead villian is fat and disgusting, with no real plot value.

This term has stuck and is often used by historians to describe the period 1877-1914. Twain and Warner see this time as one where men care only for money. These men will not work hard, but merely scheme and plot in order to strike it rich. The dialogue in the book is very snappy, the best being when Laura Hawkins arrives in Washington, DC and meets with the other high society ladies. I would recommend this book to anybody interested in United States History, or just those who want to read a good novel. The book can drag at times, but overall is very engrossing."},{"Title":"The gilded age;: A tale of today","review":"The post-Civil War years were a time of rapid industrialization in America, aided and abetted by burgeoning plans to build a transcontinental railroad. Many people saw an opportunity to get a piece of the action, to speculate with family savings, the little that there were, in hopes of making millions of dollars in return. Investing in coal mining was one example. It is against this background that _The Gilded Age_ takes place.Many in Congress saw an opportunity to support various projects that were supposedly for the public good, e.g. building a university for the newly freed slaves upon land, located in Tenneesee, bequeathed by a family patriarch to his children. These schemes were also meant to line many people's pockets. The novel's Senator Dilworthy supports various liberal causes and \\"family values,\\" i.e. Sunday school education, but is also thoroughly corrupt._The Gilded Age_ is meant to be a morality tale where everyone receives his just deserts: the evil or those just plain greedy are punished, including a vengence seeking young woman deeply wronged by her married lover, and the good and the conscientious are rewarded. While the book occasionally gets bogged down in the scandalous details of this young woman's love life, _The Gilded Age_ is often an interesting, lively and educational glance into the manners of 1870s America."},{"Title":"The gilded age;: A tale of today","review":"Several people here are saying this is just a scanned copy of the book and that it contains only30-some of what should be 63 chapters.

Anyone familiar with the PenguinClassics series knows that they are not scanned photocopies, filled with typos, or missing significant sections of the book.Just thought I'd let you know that you can disregard the \\"don't buy this edition!\\" posts here, because this is not the edition they're actually talking about."},{"Title":"The gilded age;: A tale of today","review":"Literary legend has it that Twain and Warner's wives had prompted these two authors to work together on The Gilded Age. Some versions of the story have it a dinner party challenge-- where the two men were dared to work together in order to produce a novel better than the popular fiction that their wives were reading. Whatever the true cause, it is an interesting experiment. The Gilded Age is a book worth reading, particularly if you are interested in the history or the popular novels of the 1870s.The story follows the fortune of the good but silly Hawkins family and their children, both biological and adopted. The Hawkins family is chiefly concerned with the idea of making their fortune, and invest a huge amount of hope and trust in their twin poles of \\"the Tennesee Land\\" and the schemes of their family friend, Colonel Beriah Sellers.The plot is extremely melodramatic, much in keeping with popular fiction of the day. Hidden identities, lost parents, ruined women and handsome cads populate the storyline. Mixed in with this is the classic Twain \\"pen warmed up in Hell\\"-- he takes on the corruption of the era, pointing his venom at Congress, the railroad, and at the \\"reconstruction efforts\\" theoretically designed to improve conditions in the south while actually being little more then efforts to line pockets, thinly disguised.It is occasionally an uneven ride. The melodramatic plot and characters are often a very odd fit with the vicious,dry and funny commentary that is made about corruption and public morals. I think it is more enjoyable if you have had exposure to contemporary writers such as Mary Jane Holmes. I kept thinking of this as The English Orphans on crack to try to keep the context in mind.Despite the uneven quality, I really enjoyed the book. The political commentary may miss on some of the specific scandals, but the general points should still be pointy enough to make current politicians wince. And, like most Twain efforts (even a co-authored book like this one) it is often riotously funny.The introduction to the Penguin edition claims that the Gilded Age will never be forgotten for three reasons:-- its association with Mark Twain-- the accomplishment of having given a title to a political era-- its status as a shockingly accurate mirror of period corruptionI will not argue with that analysis.Highly recommmended. Kudos to the Penguin Classic edition for the genuinely helpful introduction by Louis J. Budd and the useful notes and appendices at the back of the book."},{"Title":"The gilded age;: A tale of today","review":"The second half the book is missing, and what is there has so many printing glitches that it is hard to read.

Overall, I would not recommend this edition to anyone. Do not waste your money on it!"},{"Title":"The gilded age;: A tale of today","review":"It is not often that one gets to define an age, but that is precisely what Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner did with \\"The Gilded Age\\". As Ward Just points out in his introduction, \\"The Gilded Age\\" is \\"the first (novel about Washington) of consequence in American writing.\\" The full title of the book is \\"The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today\\", and it was published in 1873. Charles Warner was a good friend of Mark Twain and this is the only novel which Twain collaborated with another writer, and it was also the first novel which he wrote which was not based on his own life and travels.The novel is focused on a poor Tennessee family, whose patriarch tries to improve the status of his family by making money on land he has acquired. Never satisfied with the amount offered, he dies failing to sell the land, and the story continues with focus on his adopted daughter Laura. In addition there is a parallel story about two men seeking their fortunes through speculation. The first of these stories is largely by Twain, while the second one is by Warner. While those characters are the focus, much of the action takes place in Washington D. C., and the satire of the government and those involved is timeless.\\"The Gilded Age\\" is certainly worth reading, as is everything Twain ever wrote. I don't personally consider it among his best, but as the novel which defined an age and the only book which he co-authored, it has a unique place in history, both of Twain's writing and of the country. Twain's gift for satire had not yet reached its peak in this novel, but it is still very good, and one can only imagine what changes there would have been if Twain had authored this book by itself. The Oxford Mark Twain edition includes an introduction by Ward Just and an Afterword by Gregg Camfield, and both have insights to offer into the book and the environment which faced the authors while writing it."},{"Title":"The gilded age;: A tale of today","review":"This novel is an interesting read to the 21st-century reader in part because of the demonstration of the burgeoning talent of its famous co-author (Twain) and in part because one can compare its story to modern society and government. The Victorian melodramatic aspects of the book are less interesting, and the family saga aspect of the novel needs work (some characters get lost for a dozen chapters or so and then turn up in Australia, for no apparent reason). Twain's writing for the satirical portions is excellent and worth reading.All in all, then, a decent read, even though part of the novel has not stood the test of time. For someone who is interested in Twain or political novels, I would give it 4 stars.However, I have to say that I found the Kindle version of the book to be inadequate. (YES, I am talking about the Modern Library edition and not some scanned edition.) The book is full of chapter epigrams (over 63 of them) and footnotes, almost all of which are not \\"clickable.\\" In a properly produced book, you can get to a footnote by moving the cursor to it and clicking on it. You are then brought to that note, and after reading it, you hit \\"back\\" to return to the text. This is convenient and about the only acceptable way to read notes in an e-book. (I guess they could be presented at the bottom of the page, though that would probably create difficult formatting problems.)The Modern Library chose not to do that for its own notes and for the epigrams in many obscure languages. Instead, to read a footnote, you had to go through the following simple steps (which I am not making up):1. Hit \\"Menu\\"2. Select \\"Go to...\\"3. Select \\"Table of Contents\\" [Notes is not an option.]4. Page ahead three times until you get to the page when Notes are listed on the Table of Contents.5. Move the cursor down to \\"Notes\\"; Click6. Now page forward through the notes until you find the footnote you are looking for. If it is a later chapter, this could be 5 or 10 pages.7. When done reading, hit \\"Back\\" twice to return to the text.Child's play, eh? You do this *every time you want to read a footnote*! Only the authors' very few original footnotes were directy clickable. The many more editor's footnotes required the above procedure. Alternatively, you could memorize the book location where the notes were, and directly type that in at step 3 above, although that doesn't save as many keystrokes as you would think, because numbers are typed in via an awkward menu, rather than directly.The text of the book tells us that the epigrams are translated on page 475. However, the page numbers in the Kindle edition only go up to page 269 according to the Go to... menu. So much for reading the epigrams! I read all them after finishing the novel, since trying to find them in each of the 63 chapters would have been impossible. Well, it would have been possible if the editors had simply put the translations in the text or made the epigrams clickable to their translations. However, that would have required a little programming work.Oh, I'm not bitter! However, my rating of the production of this e-book is only 2 stars, so my overall rating (novel itself plus Modern Library's production) is 3 stars. If you're the kind of person who doesn't care about footnotes, then you can probably enjoy this publication much more than I did. Or, now that you know of this problem, you can just forget the footnotes and read through without letting them annoy you.Modern Library is an excellent publisher of printed books, but they need to understand that getting us to spend money for an e-book may require thoughtfulness and programming on their part. If they don't put in this work, you might as well just download a free scanned version."},{"Title":"The gilded age;: A tale of today","review":"I chose this book to use for two bookclub meetings, one for the American gilded age and the other for the study of Mark Twain. It's perfect for both. Although it's not the best book written by Twain it is his first full length book and very interesting from that prospective as well. I'll also add that it's not an easy book to read due to the style and language.What is interesting is the story which with some alterations could be written today. The story line explores the dreaming and scheaming of those who want to get rich quick, politicans who are less than honest and those too lazy to work or to have a desire for improvement. It could describe people and situations that we've all encountered (perhaps we can even find ourselves).I'd recommend this book to those who are interested in the age following the American Civil War."},{"Title":"The gilded age;: A tale of today","review":"\\"The Gilded Age\\" was my first Kindle book. I read it along with a history of the Progressive Movement, which was enjoyable and useful for placing myself in late 19th-century America. Twain created a satirical tragedy that masterfully encapsulates the excess of the Gilded Age, and the distractions that drove our entire society into a ditch. It's brilliance is manifested by its relevance to our world today, almost 140 years after its publication. The story describes a fundamental aspect of human nature that we all need to examine more closely.Mark Twain is such an American treasure; I wish he had a contemporary counterpart."},{"Title":"The gilded age;: A tale of today","review":"Witty, engaging and expertly crafted, The Gilded Age reveals Twain's and Warner's cynicism of American business practices (rampant, unrestrained speculation) and Washington politics post-Civil War. For the most part, the main characters are rather flawed. The sometimes loathsome sometimes loveable Col. Eschol Sellers is a well-meaning huckster. Many of the figures on the periphery are out-and-out crooks, dishonest, slimy sorts that would do or say anything for a buck. The only winner in the end is Philip Sterling, the only character willing to work hard to make an honest fortune.Some critics have said that this book was Twain's answer to Ben Franklin's elevation of the so-called Protestant work ethic and something of a critique of American capitalism. That conclusion, in my view, is misguided. While Twain's and Warner's contempt of corruption and dishonest business dealings is glaringly obvious from the way the stories are told, they quite as obviously seem to honor those who truly earned their fortunes or made something of themselves by honest, productive effort. Sterling is an example of that. That is the essence of the Protestant work ethic.Social commentary aside, like Twain's other work, The Gilded Age is terribly funny. About every other page, one of his brilliant witicisms will make you laugh out loud, a situation that can be a bit awkward when reading the book in public."},{"Title":"The gilded age;: A tale of today","review":"Senate Seats for Sale...Corruption in Congress...Speculators Losing Fortunes...Lawyers Making a Mockery of the Justice System...these are all things that Mr. Twain and Mr. Dudley poke fun at in \\"The Gilded Age.\\" These are all subjects that Twain could still make sport of if he were still writing today.Most of the action centers on various parties trying to make a fortune without working for it. While this is not one of Mark Twain's better novels it is entertaining and at times reads like something out of a Marx Brothers movie."},{"Title":"The gilded age;: A tale of today","review":"*** This review is for the cream colored paperback edition with the black lettering.***This edition of the book is extremely cheap. It's fraught with punctuation and printing mistakes that make it very difficult to read. The publishers of the books say that they used some computer software to scan and translate the text of the book to keep the cost low \\"for you, the reader,\\" But would it have really killed them to pay someone $100 to proofread the damned thing? The mistakes are obvious and numerous. Plus, the second half of the book is left out.It really kills me that such shoddy work is allowed to be printed and sold to the general public. Way to take advantage of lax copyright laws, guys."},{"Title":"Curious George Takes a Train (Curious George 8x8 (Quality))","review":"My son LOVES trains, and he also loved the Curious George movie. He has several of the books based on the Rey's style, and the PS2 Curious George game.Curious George Takes a Train is the first George book I've bought \\"sight unseen\\" (from Amazon.com). However, since my son loves both trains and George, I felt it was a great fit.Granted, my son seems to like the book. Out of the four books illustrated/written in the Rey tradition, my son owns three by Martha Weston. The other--Curious George Goes to a Chocolate Factory--is illustrated by Vipah Interactive.Weston is heavy on the black charcoal as it is (as seen in the shadowing of books like Curious George Visits a Toy Store), but she is *especially* heavy with the black illustrations in Curious George Takes a Train. In fact, it often looks as if a child has taken a black crayon and (no lie) colored vertical streaks of black right on top of the people!It's very unattractive, in my opinion, but kids don't seem to notice these types of things. I also felt that the story was a bit harrowing for a George tale (a little boy runs from his father after a toy train, the gate closes behind him, and the boy almost goes out in front of the tracks--but George saves his life.)The story is a bit quick...it goes from the Man with the Yellow Hat strolling off with Mrs. Needleman in the station to George climbing up and messing with the numbers and letters on the train schedule--and then off to saving the boy!If your child is a train enthusiast who likes George, he/she will likely enjoy this book. However, as far as stories go--and illustrations--there are better books in this series, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Curious George Takes a Train (Curious George 8x8 (Quality))","review":"Curious George, Margret & H. A. Rey's loveable monkey (Technically he's a Chimpanzee but we won't quibble too much . . . .) has received a series of new stories but in the same structure and style of the original. In these stories, George is a good monkey who tries to be helpful but allows his curiosity to cause problems. In the end however, George saves the day and all is forgiven. In this story, George, along with the Man in the Yellow Hat, is going on a train trip, causes problems in the station and then prevents a small boy from falling on the tracks. In the end, George and his new friend the small boy receive a ride in the locomotive. (I hope they brought earplugs.)My mother taught me to read with Curious George and the Man with the Yellow Hat more than 30 years ago and it is good to see new stories for the cheeky little fellow. This story does not have quite the touch of the original but is very close. A good story with a good lesson and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Curious George Takes a Train (Curious George 8x8 (Quality))","review":"Curious George is my favorite book series and off course, I bought this book (and others) to give to my unborn grandson.

You can never get enough of Curious George."},{"Title":"Curious George Takes a Train (Curious George 8x8 (Quality))","review":"My four-year-old loves trains, so this book is a hit with him. We find various train books available on Amazon for really little money at all. Curious George tries to be helpful at the train depot, but creates scheduling problems. However, the curious, handful of a monkey saves the day at the end of the book. It's a feel-good story that will make most any child smile.

This time, in a train station mired in mid-century stasis, George rearranges the trainmaster's board in a misguided attempt to help. In the end, George discovers that what it takes to be forgiven is good intentions and the quick wits to save someone's life.

It is a book that will forever change your outlook on life."},{"Title":"Conversations with the Spirit World : Souls who have ended their lives speak from above","review":"I just lost a friend to suicide and thought this book would help me understand it little better. It really didn't. I expected this to be a more &quot;John Edward&quot; type thing where there would be validations I could trust. It was just a stream-of- consciousness typed by the author. It seems to have helped a lot of people, judging from the other reviews, but it didn't do anything for me except cause more skepticism. It seemed to miss expressing any sympathy for those who have taken their own life."},{"Title":"Conversations with the Spirit World : Souls who have ended their lives speak from above","review":"Imagine that we live after death. Now imagine that personality stays the same even after that massive change in location. I am believing more and more in those two surprising ideas - it is like cold water on my face. I need to live harder, and take my life much more sincerely for the opportunity it really is. Life on earth IS the place to get things done - no matter how impossible it becomes day by day. Stay with it.Teenagers and perennial Peter Pans (grownups with a teenage soul) have - by default - a very tweaked view of the real world. It's great in that they can remind non-teens of how many delusions and hypocrisies any culture accepts and nurtures. More than that, teens will shake-you-to-wake-you from your long list of sell-outs, compromises and dullness. On the shadow side, teens need to be constantly shocked into seeing how much mortal danger they ignore, and how little they know about how discipline (boring repetitive work) can provide them the freedom they absolutely STARVE for, and how often they choose escape when they COULD have more power and a growing menu of personal options. I apologize for my crass generalizations, but I need to be expedient. Lysa has provided us a really cool book, here. It was tempting to put it down at first. At first glance it comes off as a book about a bunch of sadly derailed kids who tragically took their own lives, and are now whinging about that choice from their gray, dull after-world. Actually, they have insight from their new perspective - NOT the insight we can find from so many other books of after-death communications. These are the insights of the disenfranchised, the dis-empowered and the failed, and it is really unique and helpful to anyone who cares to look.I am blessed by this gem, and recommend it. It tells me to remember what life is like when you are young and NONE of your efforts work out well. It tells me to listen to the teenagers and children in my life, and those who struggle - not because they need to be heard (which they do) but because they see things the rest of us have all become blind to in the process of moving from young to old, from immature to mature, from struggling to successful. These departed souls - once they get out of their own way - have wisdom we all need a refresher course in."},{"Title":"Conversations with the Spirit World : Souls who have ended their lives speak from above","review":"Hi Lysa:First off, I am a big fan even though I live on the other side of the country (Boston).

I was &quot;directed&quot; to Lysa's book in an odd manner. This book contained the words of people who committed suicide, as told to Lysa from the afterlife. It was of great help and comfort in attempting to understand the reason for the suicide, and assisted in helping me to feel at peace with the current place of being of my loved one. After I read the book, on the last page I found a phone number to contact Lysa for a phone session with Lysa and the deceased. After I did so, I felt as if a 100 pound weight had been lifted from me, as I removed any blame from myself as I was directed to do, and decided to go on with my life. I then scheduled a phone session with Lysa for myself and my children. Once again, the deceased came through. This session was of immense help to my children and assisted in recovering a peace and joy which had been lacking in our household since the suicide. Not only did their father come through to speak to us, but also our dearly beloved deceased dogs, with whom we desired contact. My children felt their anger diminish, and felt more at peace after the session.

I just would like to say how much of an impact your book, Conversations with the spirit world has had on me and my life. This book has touched my soul and my mind in ways that I didn't even know they could be touched. Your book has saved my life a few times -- to be honest. While feeling depressed and suicidal, I know if I sit down with your book I can get something out of it that makes me want to live again.Your book speaks of things happening for a reason and things are already planned. Well, I truly believe that. See, it is a funny story of how I found out about you. One night, my computer had gone on the fritz, I think, so of course I couldn't use it. Desperate to find something to do I turned on the radio to a radio talk show called Love Lines -- a show I, then, rarely listened to. It had been weeks, if not months, since I had listen to the show.But the thing that makes me wonder is that somehow it ended up that you were on that show promoting your book. What are the chances of me blindly turning on the radio to find you speaking of a book dedicated to the toughest struggle I am having. That night, out of all the nights I never listened to it, you were on. That right there says a lot. That I would just happen upon it. But now of course I don't believe that things just accidentally happen. Something so profound doesn't just happen by accident.Needless to say, I bought the book ASAP. Now it is falling apart from reading it and is marked up beyond belief. I may have been dead if not for your book.I don't know what the chances are you may actually read this e-mail personally but I hope you do. Your book, to me, has become a Bible of sorts. In fact, your book touches me more than the Bible could ever touch me. The words within it are so relevant to me and, I'm sure, other people.I won't ramble on like a crazy fan, but I just wanted to say that if not for you, Charley and co., I may have been dead by now. I am not perfect though. I am still 'in training,' I guess you could say. But I'm on my way.Thank you very much, again.

Faithful Catholics were thus largely helpless before claims that the Second Vatican Council mandated the proposed flood of innovations in church architecture, design and liturgical practice.Normally docile though they are, most Catholics do not want their houses of worship to look like high school gymnasiums. They are uncomfortable when commanded to watch each other pray across a central table altar, rather than to gaze reverently at a crucifix above the altar. They are offended when the tabernacle in which the Blessed Sacrament is reserved disappears into a broom closet beside the furnace room. But they have lacked the documentation to prove that these orders represent merely idiosyncratic interpretation by a self-designated elite.In The Renovation Manipulation, Michael Rose explicates the problem and provides exactly the documents needed to enable the faithful -- both lay and clerical -- to defend and preserve the liturgical forms, art and architecture of the Catholic church according to the authentic norms of her tradition and the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy.He has done his Church a great service, and done it thoroughly, articulately and with civility. His book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Renovation Manipulation: The Church Counter-Renovation Handbook","review":"For the past thirty years dissident elements in the Catholic Church have been stripping parish churches, cathedrals and basilicas alike of their distinctive Catholic iconography and liturgical furnishings, all in the name of non-existent Vatican II &quot;mandates&quot;. Faithful Catholics, most of whom have never read the documents of Vatican II, have watched in dismay, or even horror, as these self-styled &quot;liturgy experts&quot; have swooped into their parishes and ripped out Communion rails, marble altars, magnificent pulpits, and baptismal fonts. These liturgical vandals, often sporting impressive-looking &quot;credentials&quot;, have torn tabernacles off high altars and hidden them in side rooms, back rooms, or even in former janitor closets. After reducing elegant marble high altars to shards, they have installed table altars in the middle of churches, surrounded by kneeler-less folding chairs arranged in theater-in-the-round fashion. Stations of the Cross have been dismissed as irrelevant and either thrown out or else reduced to abstract smudges. Beautiful statues of the saints have been removed from their places of devotion, smashed into pieces, and thrown into the dumpster. For thirty years faithful Catholics have known in their hearts that these liturgical demolitions were contrary to the Faith, but most remained silent in the face of pastors and bishops who told them that Church law &quot;required&quot; these wholesale destructions of irreplaceable church interiors that had lifted up their hearts and minds to God. Now, at last, comes Michael Rose's book The Renovation Manipulation which is aptly subtitled &quot;The Church Counter-Renovation Handbook&quot;. Author Rose prints all the devious canards used by the so-called Liturgical Design Consultants on unsuspecting or poorly catechized parishioners, and then proceeds to demolish them with concise and copious references to authentic Church documents. With this book in the hands of the laity, no longer will the so-called liturgy &quot;experts&quot; be able to invade a parish and remain unchallenged when they attempt to bamboozle the faithful into accepting the liturgical deconstruction of their churches. This book is absolutely required reading for any Catholic who sees a notice in his parish bulletin that certain &quot;changes&quot; &quot;may be necessary&quot;, or that a capital fund drive is in the offing. Buy several copies of this book and get them into the hands of the movers and shakers in your parish. Do it before they are co-opted by your pastor!"},{"Title":"The Renovation Manipulation: The Church Counter-Renovation Handbook","review":"This is an absolute essential handbook for any parish that is going through, or about to go through a Restoration, Rennovation, and Renewal process. Michael Rose has done all the homework to combat the LDC's archi-liturgical psychobabble that is meant to disarm and demean faithful parishoners.Rose sites official church documents whenever available to prove that we do not have to stand for letting our beautiful churches be stripped and whitewashed, or be told the way we practice our faith is outdated and wrong according to Vatican II. We are in the fight of our life to preserve the one, true, holy, Roman Catholic Church. Rose's book is critical information for those who want to win the battle!"},{"Title":"The Renovation Manipulation: The Church Counter-Renovation Handbook","review":"Michael Rose does an excellent job in exposing the architectural renovators who have come in and dismantled many beautiful Roman Catholic Churches. Even to this day, with examples such as the new Cathedral in Los Angeles and the many round Churches, we continue to see the renovations continue.This book is a great manual for any parishoner who may be in a parish which is about to undergo a major overhaul or a new Church is in the process of being built. Once you read through this book, one will understand how to defend against the Protestant renovations being discussed. Manipulation has become a key in replacing the tabernacle with a chair or removing the altar rails or side altars, and this book will show that these renovations have no precedence in the history of the Catholic Church."},{"Title":"The Renovation Manipulation: The Church Counter-Renovation Handbook","review":"After suffering through multiple &quot;renovations&quot; where art was destroyed, churches re-arranged and organs thrown out, it is nice to finally have a concise guide to combatting the unnecessary and in some cases, unlawful, renovations of our churches.A previous review said the book was completely out of context and served to divide. What the author failed to acknowledge is that the arguments explained in Rose's book are all real and all wrong. Division is good when the truth is brought forth. &quot;Consensus&quot; based on falsehoods is never right.The quotes used by Rose show that what we currently experience is not what the council intended. Even when adding the caveats to them that the previous reviewer did, the quotes still speak volumes against the church stripping we see today."},{"Title":"The Renovation Manipulation: The Church Counter-Renovation Handbook","review":"I subscribe to Rose's St. Catherine Review journal for faithful Catholics, so was familiar with his well-documented stories of how some members of the &quot;American Church&quot; have been teaching errors in Archdiocese of Cincinnati and other places in nation. I've seen the physical destruction of churches and spiritual tearing-apart of souls over church &quot;renovations,&quot; and was happy to read there is a &quot;General&quot; who knows what battle plans parishioners can implement to stop the heathen among us. Bravo for Michael Rose and his well-written, very helpful and insightful book which belongs in every diocese."},{"Title":"The Renovation Manipulation: The Church Counter-Renovation Handbook","review":"This book does a good job of explaining why faithful catholics resist the changes being promoted by new age liturgists.

It is well referenced. More than anything it exposes an agenda of undermining the majesty and reverance of the Church manifest by secularizing the appearance of design and minimizing the presence of the tabernacle."},{"Title":"The Renovation Manipulation: The Church Counter-Renovation Handbook","review":"The Renovation Manipulation adds no useful knowledge to the discerning reader. Rose uses quotes from church documents to incite opposition to the changes in church design and architecture regarding the positioning of the tabernacle, the removal of communion rails, the use of flexible seating (chairs, not pews), the shape of the church, the place of Latin and Gregorian chant, and the use of statues in churches. His quotes, however, support just as strongly different (even opposing) views when taken in the context intended. What I found most troubling is his inflammatory language that serves to divide the Catholic community rather than inspire dialog. His theology of Eucharist is suspect. Charles Wilson in the Foreword states that &quot;in the Mass the sacrifice of Calvary is repeated.&quot; Rose says on page 15 that the &quot;important sacrificial aspect of the Mass seems to have been dismissed.&quot; Rose says on page 78 that &quot;the Mass is inseparably connected to the Crucifixion (not the Resurrection)&quot;. The Catechism of the Catholic Church (#1330) says that the Mass is &quot;the memorial of the Lord's Passion and Resurrection&quot;, which Rose quotes on page 71. This is not compatible with the three statements quoted above from the book. In footnote 5 on page 5, he quotes The Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, #36.1, &quot;the use of the Latin language is to be preserved in the Latin rites.&quot; #36.2 of the same document says, &quot;But since the use of the mother tongue ... frequently may be of great advantage to the people, the limits of its use may be extended.&quot; In the same footnote, he quotes #116 of the same document, &quot;The Church acknowledges Gregorian chant as distinctive of the Roman liturgy; therefore ... it should be given pride of place in liturgical services.&quot; But this same paragraph goes on to say, &quot;But other kinds of sacred music ... are by no means excluded from liturgical celebrations.&quot; In writing about statues and sacred art in churches, he quotes again from the same document, #124, &quot;The practice of placing sacred images in churches so that they may be venerated by the faithful is to be maintained.&quot; But the very next sentence in that document says, &quot;Nevertheless there is to be restraint regarding their number and prominence so that they do not create confusion among the Christian people or foster religious practices of doubtful orthodoxy.&quot; On page 56, he quotes Canon 938.2 of the Code of Canon Law, 1983, &quot;The tabernacle in which the blessed Eucharist is reserved should be sited in a distinguished place in a church or oratory, a place which is conspicuous, suitably adorned and conducive to prayer.&quot; This does not mean it has to be on the altar, as he would have the reader believe! All in all, not worth reading, unless you want to know how Rose and his followers think."},{"Title":"The Renovation Manipulation: The Church Counter-Renovation Handbook","review":"Michael Rose wants to prove a point that reflects his opinion that the Catholic Church was better in the pre-Vatican II era. To do so he uses extreme examples (there were poor examples of churches before Vatican II, but they are ignored). There is no attempt at scholarly balance. He takes as gospel the reports of those against change who put that which they are against in the most unflattering, and I'm sure at times unfair, light.Certainly there are instances of poorly handled renovations, but the issues are complicated by theology and esthetics. Theological reasons for newer forms of church worship space have been developed with sound backing (and still are evolving in the practice, just as Rose's beloved old churches moved from Romaneque to Gothic).Esthetics complicate the issue. One may not like a certain style without it being intrinsically &quot;bad.&quot; Styles change, and not all will agree and many will be disturbed by new forms. Not everyone appreciated every new example of the Gothic form. Many things, including economics, preclude us from repeating old examples. Even if we could build them just like we used to, that would not really be a virtue. If our ancestors rejected all new forms we would not have the wonderful sacred spaces we have today."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"My absolute favorite novel always find something new to love every time.

Twain's amazing degree of perception of, and attunement with, the essence of Humanity is on ample display in \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" and readers even in this generation nearly 150 year hence will see and feel the almost eerie connection Twain achieved with the eternal Humanity in all of us. Add to that the fact that Twain's \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" is an exquisitely-crafted, often-poignant, oftener humorous panorama of a gorgeous part of our country during a truly wondrous and kaleidoscopic era of our national journey. Well before the reader finishes \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" they will know why Mark Twain is often spoken of as the \\"Voice of America itself\\" and considered among the very greatest storytellers in all of History. Selecting the \\"Best\\" or the \\"Most Enjoyable\\" of Mark Twain's many, many writings would be a task as hopeless as picking the prettiest photograph ever taken anywhere along the Mississippi River.

It gave interesting ideas and showed the foolishness of the knights in the famed 'Camelot.' I loved it.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A &quot;modern&quot; (late 1800s) man named Hank Morgan, after getting into a fight with a subordinate at his factory and being knocked on the head, is mysteriously transported back to Britain, 19 Jun 528 AD, the heyday of Camelot, King Arthur and the Knights of the Table Round. The book is presented as a kind of diary of his experiences there.Hank is able to use his modern knowledge to perform feats which awe the locals and their king and is promoted to being the king's right hand man. Hank goes about making various improvements, with an eye toward eventual revolution to free the common people from the oppressive social system. He starts secret &quot;man factories&quot;, recruiting those real men (and women) who seem to have an inkling that they can and should break free of domination and live in freedom and independence.A main thrust of the story is to disabuse the reader of any romantic notions he may be harboring about this era of history. The author clearly portrays the barbarism, filth, injustice, senseless violence, backwardness and brutality of this time and these people, often mocking their ignorance and superstition in the light of our more enlightened ways.A particular gripe is the humble but ignorant reverence of the common folk for King, Church and nobility. He vents that the terrible violence of the French Revolution pales in comparison to the centuries of depredations imposed on the common people who, in his view, were fully justified in that bloodletting. He rails against the Catholic Church of the day as a chief enemy of the freedom of the common people, encouraging them to remain humble toward authority (however unjust) and comtemplate the higher, God-ordained reasons for their sufferings.Among my favorite of the host of bit-part characters to make an appearance in the book is Sir Ossaise of Surluse, &quot;a brave knight and of considerable celebrity&quot; resulting from significant skill in past knightly jousting tournaments. He is one of the many knights that Hank has put to work as traveling salesmen, wearing bulletin-boards front and aft advertising Hank's many innovative products, such as tooth-wash and soap. Hank explains that Sir Ossaise was &quot;of a light and laughing disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious,\\" which is why he has chosen him to advertise his stove polish (there are no stoves yet). When we meet him, Sir Ossaise has played a trick on another salesman (of toothbrushes) by sending the latter after a group of \\"likely customers.\\" After a long, hard chase, that energetic knight discovers the group consists of five poor souls released the night before from a long dungeon imprisonment, it having been &quot;all of 20 years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth.&quot;One touching scene happens when Hank and King Arthur disguise themselves as commoners and travel throughout the kingdom to assess what's really happening there. Along the way, they are captured for the purpose of being sold into slavery (since they cannot prove their status as freemen and the ancient Roman law holds that they are slaves until proven otherwise). Hank is able to play along, knowing he'll eventually work out a way to get free. The king, with his high-born pride, keeps his chin up and maintains an attitude of resistance and defiance, refusing to yield to the abusive slave trader. Hank observes that the king truly knows how to act like the free man he is, regardless of circumstances.While early in the book it seems we are headed in a promising direction toward a happy and virtuous end, Twain later turns the plot in darker directions. Hank stages a &quot;final battle&quot; between the forces of Chivalry (about 30,000 knights) and his own forces of republican progress (himself and 52 boys!). The Battle of the Sand Belt is an outright slaughter of the larger reactionary force. Unfortunately, the evil Merlin has the last laugh and puts Hank into a 13-century sleep, even as his co-conspirators are trapped in their cave fortress and being sickened by the 30,000 decaying corpses of the opposition (so much for a light-hearted and happy ending).In the last scene, Twain has finished reading the manuscript given to him by Hank back in the 19th century. It is toward morning at the lodge where they are both staying and Hank is sleeping fitfully and making noises in the next room. When Twain checks on him, Hank is muttering about his beloved 6th century life (including a wife and child), apparently relieved that his 19th-century experiences were &quot;just a dream.&quot; We, of course, are left assuming that Hank's 6th century experiences were the dream (but of course, there IS that written record ... hmmmm). Before he wakes up, Hank dies in his sleep, so we'll never know for sure.The author clearly holds the misguided assumption that religion is hostile to freedom (see The Theme is Freedom by M. Stanton Evans for a full treatment of this error). He sees morality, human nature and society as being malleable by human reason, rather than as following fixed norms created by God. This way of thinking sees a strong affinity between the (very different) American and French Revolutions and interprets both as a throwing off of the shackles of religion and tradition which are believed to encumber the pure, relativist, rationalist and optimistic vision of liberty. In summary, its a fun story, but suffers from incorrect assumptions about reality."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The name of the book I am critiquing is A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur&#65533;s Court by Mark Twain tells the story of a Connecticut man who is thrown back in time to the King Arthur time period.

I found this book to be a good one because Mark Twain does a great job of putting a picture of what of what the main character is seeing and exepriencing. The details ore so well put that you can almost believe you were their. Also, the way the characters talk and the dialogue is so fitting to the character.Finally, I would recommend this book to teens because a child wouldn&#65533;t get it and I think an adult wouldn&#65533;t be interested. I hope my review has been useful to you."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an interesting novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people, who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize its faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time was very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods, which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it is a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way that puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur.BY: Christian J. Vazquez"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain was one of the United States' greatest writers, but not one of its most brilliant novelists. A case in point is this 1889 novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court.\\"The plot has been redone so many times as to make a synopsis here seem pointless. The title character is a practical-minded factory superintendent from Hartford laid out by a crowbar-wielding worker and transported to the time of King Arthur. After conning the locals by anticipating an eclipse and pretending he has blotted out the sun, the Yankee sets to work reforming Arthur's kingdom in slow degrees, earning the wrath of the wizard Merlin among others.The novel's defenders point out that while written in the guise of a children's novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee\\" is a cleverly subversive satire that ridicules tradition and progress simultaneously. For seven-eighths of the book, however, it is neither a fair nor a scintillating fight. Our hero, Hank Morgan, is the book's narrator, and perhaps unreliable, but Twain offers no hint of this as Morgan and Twain mock the customs and puncture the myths of this bygone day, informing us whatever existed then couldn't hold a candle to the present day.\\"Somehow, every time the magic of folderol tried conclusions with the magic of science, the magic of folderol got left,\\" Morgan explains.As the book develops, Morgan builds up the society he finds with modern conveyances, including trains, guns, and telephones. At one point in the story, knights ride to battle on bicycles.Anachronism soon devolves as the main source of humor for the book, along with the narrator's off-handed way of telling us about the people he meets, none of whom impress him. One maiden proves such a windy bore it is a surprise to find Morgan later married to her, and quite a fond husband at that. There is one fellow named Clarence who becomes Morgan's chief acolyte, but he only shows up to help Morgan out of the various minor jams that form the narrative thrust of our story.Much of the time, Twain uses Morgan's experience as an excuse to launch into some invective, particularly involving institutions like slavery and the Roman Catholic Church. Critics talk about this as a slam against capitalism, too, but for the most part Twain presents capitalism as a fine and noble thing, ruined only by the blinkered idiocy of Arthur's subjects.Whatever point Twain had in setting this story in Camelot goes by the boards after 50 pages. He references Malory but demonstrates little interest or fondness for the subject. Arthur goes on one meandering journey with Morgan disguised as a serf, Twain borrowing from his own \\"Prince And The Pauper\\", but Arthur otherwise registers little in the story and his court even less. When Arthur's fate is sealed, it occurs off-stage and is presented in the manner of a second-hand report.I got the feeling that Twain had a good idea for a novel but no notion what to do with it. This happens with his novels, like \\"Pudd'nhead Wilson\\" and \\"The Gilded Age.\\" His best-known novel, \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" has a famously disjointed ending, though that wrapper is a regular prize compared to what he does here. It's one of the big \\"huh\\" moments in American literature, exceeded only by those critics who explain why it is so brilliant, because it satirizes the whole message of the rest of the novel or anticipates trench warfare or shows why suits of armor are a bad idea when worn in battle against an electrified fence. To me it's Twain clearly throwing up his arms and leaving his reader in a hole after being dragged around for over 300 pages.Twain knocks off some good one-liners, and does enough with the concept in the beginning that you wish his heart had stayed in the venture. It didn't, but fortunately for his legacy academia has been more than willing to make up for his lack of patience or effort."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up so now that I own a kindle I can reread and enjoy it all over again. Mark Twain is a master story teller. I enjoyed it again,40 years later."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This was a very entertaining and interesting book. I thought Twain did a great job incorporating the newer (of his time) technologies into the old mid evil times. Not only did I think he did this very well; he had a very interesting take at explaining the great achievements of knights that do not seem to be what we would consider real. Like when knights fought giants and things of that nature, and how magic was explained. I thought it was interesting how he explained that a lot of the knights did not really do a lot of the things that they said, like kill ogres and giants, they only said they did because no one was around, and no one ever questioned the adventures that the knights told of. Another cool thing was how he incorporated newer technologies, like gunpowder, into how he did his \\"magic\\" and made people believe that he was a great sorcerer. This was a very good and interesting book, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I purchased this edition of Life on the Mississippi because I know that Library of America books are the highest quality and most definitive editions available of the works they publish.This edition includes an introduction written by Jonathan Rabin, a British travel writer and novelist (Passage to Juneau,Bad Land: An American Romance(winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award),Old Glory: A Voyage Down the Mississippi, andSurveillance). It also includes an 8 page chronology of Twain's life, notes on the text used in the book, and footnotes.The book is a paperback but larger format than most - essentially identical in size to the Library of America hardcover editions - and as all other LOA editions it is printed on very high quality paper (acid free).In his introduction, Rabin states that \\"Later in life, Twain would claim Life on the Mississippi as his own favorite among his books\\", and articles originally appearing in the Atlantic Monthly in 1875 served as the starting point.This is nonfiction from Mark Twain, reporting his recollections of experiences he gained beginning in about April, 1857, when he became a cub pilot on the Mississippi, and culminating in May 1861, when he made his last trip on the river as a pilot (at age 25). Being nonfiction it is unlike his novels Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, but it is every bit as enjoyable to read.This Library of America printing is a fine edition to purchase if you want a high quality book for your library, and you care that the text of the book is the most accurate available (see below), and it is very reasonably priced. There are many different and cheaper printings available, but not to these standards. This is the version I will always recommend to anyone wanting to add this to their collection or give to someone as a gift.For those who are interested in the specifics of why this edition is different from ANY other presently available (other than LOA's own hardcover), I offer the following, from the Library of America website (this came from their explanation for the hardcover LOA bookMark Twain : Mississippi Writings : Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi, Huckleberry Finn, Pudd'nhead Wilsonwhich in addition to Life on the Mississippi, includes the three mentioned other novels by Twain. I have edited this to retain only the comments relevant to Life on the Mississippi:---------------\\"The book reprinted in this volume is presented in the best text now available. As early as January, 1866, Clemens had contemplated writing a travel book about the Mississippi River. Five years later, he told his wife that he proposed to spend two months on the river and take notes, but the actual beginning of \\"the Mississippi book\\" did not come until William Dean Howells, editor of the Atlantic Monthly, pressed Clemens for a contribution to follow \\"A True Story\\" (November, 1874). Clemens wrote twice to Howells on October 24, 1874, first to say \\"my head won't 'go,' \\" next to propose a topic. While walking in the woods with his friend and pastor, Joseph Twichell, he explained, he \\"got to telling him about old Mississippi days of steamboating glory & grandeur\\" as he had seen them from the pilot house. Twichell exclaimed, \\"What a virgin subject to hurl into a magazine!\\" The work that resulted went into seven issues of the Atlantic, January through August, 1875, omitting July.The contribution to the Atlantic was not nearly enough to make a subscription book, however, and only after a series of efforts to persuade Howells or some other friend to accompany him on a note-taking visit to the Mississippi did Clemens at last undertake the journey in 1882. By the terms of his contract for the book with James R. Osgood, Clemens became in effect his own publisher, Osgood--who had no experience in the publishing of subscription books--his agent.Clemens redivided chapters, revised chapter titles, added \\"The Record of Some Famous Trips\\" (334-36), made perhaps forty-five other changes, and the Atlantic material became chapters IV through XVII of the book. In composing the additional forty-six chapters--a wearying task--Clemens made voluminous use of his own travel notes and padded the work with previously written but unpublished tales, such as \\"The Professor's Yarn\\" (chapter XXXVI). He also borrowed perhaps 11,000 words from other writers. Most interestingly, he took the \\"raft passage\\" from his manuscript for what later became Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and incorporated it in \\"Frescoes from the Past\\" (chapter III). Indeed, he crowded so many pages into his manuscript that some became superfluous; he was able to omit some 13,000 to 15,000 words and to move other material to appendices.The first American edition (1883) is reprinted here. Ultimately, the methodically prepared text of the future will involve a comparison of the first American edition and the holograph manuscript held since 1909 by the J. Pierpont Morgan Library. The manuscript contains matter not in the book, and the book, matter not in the manuscript. Except for a few pages that Clemens called \\"the eighth batch\\" and--because of the illness of his typist--sent to Osgood in holograph form, the first American edition was set from a typescript made from the Morgan manuscript. Only a few pages of the typescript survive (at the Morgan Library and at the Houghton Library, Harvard). Clemens revised both the typescript and printer's proofs. That collating the manuscript with the first American edition will reveal errors in the book text has been shown by Willis Wager in \\"A Critical Edition of the Morgan Manuscript of Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi,\\" a dissertation submitted at New York University, Washington Square College, 1942. A few original manuscript readings are given in the notes that follow at 233.3, 380.14, 451.32, and 516.27-28.The standards for American English continue to fluctuate and in some ways were different in earlier periods from what they are now. In nineteenth-century writings, for example, a word might be spelled in more than one way, even in the same work. Commas could be used expressively to suggest the movements of voice, and capitals sometimes gave significances to a word beyond those it might have in its lower-case form. Since modernization would remove these effects, this volume has preserved the spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and wording of the editions reprinted here.The present edition is concerned only with presenting the texts of these editions; it does not attempt to reproduce features of the typographic design--such as the display capitalization of chapter openings. Footnotes within the text are those supplied by Clemens. Open contractions are retained if they appeared in the original edition. Typographical errors in the other editions used here have also been corrected.\\"---------------"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I found this book to be an excellent work.

The story starts out talking about a young man named Hank Morgan, who was somehow transported back to the 6th century in England. He started out thinking that he arrived in an asylum, where everybody thought they were in the time of King Arthur. He later proved himself that he was in the 6th century by witnessing a total solar eclipse which he knew it was going to occur on the twenty-first of June A.D. 528 at 3 minutes after noon. After that event, he was given place in the government, and continuously used his cleverness and knowledge he learned in the 19th century to improve and prefect the country he was living in, during the 6th century. He used his knowledge in the field of science and performed what the people in the medieval times, called magic; and as time progressed he became the country&iexcl;s most powerful advisor. During this period of time, he kept a journal, which is what most of this book is.Unlike most of the other stories, the plot of this story was consisted of two time periods, the modern 19th century and the medieval 6th century. The main character, Hank Morgan, was mysteriously sent back and became someone like Jesus because he knew what was happening and what is going to happened already in the history lessons when he was still in the 19th century. A literary device Mark Twain used in this book that made this book very amusing was all the satires Hank used to mock the people in King Arthur&iexcl;s court. For example, when a page was introducing himself to Mark, Mark said, &iexcl;Go &iexcl;long, you ain&iexcl;t more than a paragraph.&iexcl;I recommend this book for people who want something light and less serious, because this book will give you a good laugh."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court gives the reader a feel for how someone must adapt to a new surrounding they are put into. Mark Twain shows that in the Yankee, as he gets more involved in the community as the novel goes on. The book starts in an upbeat comical mood. Jokes are being thrown, and people are having fun times. Thenn the mood of the book starts to get darker. The flaws of Camelot and the King start to come out. Twain does a great job using detail in the story, setting, and characters. He must have done some research while writing. The beginning of the book will hook you in to keep reading. I couldn't wait for the next adventure or squabble to pop up."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The main character, Hank Morgan, gets hit on the head in the 19th century and goes back in time to the year 528 in King Arthur's court. Using modern technology, he becomes more famous than evil Merlin the Magician. Hank, titled the Boss, meets humble friends like Clarence and Sandy who help him get accustomed to the Medieval Period. Hank travels around the English countryside with a down-to-earth man, King Arthur. I liked the story because it was interesting and unique. I found the story to be interesting because the 19th century meets the 6th century. Hank brings electricity, personal hygiene methods, and other modern conveniences with him to the Medieval community. It is interesting how the Middle Ages people get acquainted with these technological advances. The book also gives you insight and a new point-of-view on famous Medieval legends. King Arthur dresses up as a peasant, his sister Morgan Le Fay overturns hanging sentences, and Merlin becomes a deceiving, unfriendly magician, all as a result of Hank's magical powers and his influence on them. There are a few very intense and suspenseful events that make you wonder the fate of Medieval myths. The book has a complicated plot. There can be parts where there is little or no eventful action for a long time. However, when there is an action, it is intense and happens quickly. If you like fantasy and/or myths, you will definitely love A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. It is a mature, insightful book. Twain maintains his reputation as a master storyteller with this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A very amusing, political satire. Many interesting points were brought up and even when Twain addressed serious issues of class and self and society, his humor shined thru. It is nineteenth century technological reliances meeting sixth century codes of chivalry. Of course it is all very anachronistic, but instead of hurting the work it helps Twain prove his points. I don't agree with those who consider it chaotic, although I do see that some may find it so since Twain attempts so much. He tries to tell an interseting tale, question society and mankind, and be humorous all at once which IS difficult, if not impossible."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I hear the word boring used quite often these days. We have more and more things to entertain us, yet feel more bored than ever. As I looked over some of the reviews of the classic books including this one, I noticed how often the word boring was used when describing a book. I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used the overused word."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain's satiric fantasy &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot; sets up the premise of a 19th Century American being transported (via the application of a crowbar to his skull) to the legendary Camelot, where he initially suffers culture shock in the extreme. The novel's immediately obvious flaw (and I assume Mark Twain was aware of it but simply ignored it) is the 19th Century hero's ability to communicate with Britons of the 6th Century. They, of course, would have been speaking an English similar to that in &quot;Beowulf&quot;; the book has them talking like characters in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The opening chapters are comic in mood, complete with limp jokes. (When one character introduces himself as a page, the Yankee replies: &quot;Go 'long, you ain't more than a paragraph.&quot; Oh, Lord.) However, the story quickly becomes dark and then increasingly darker. The degraded condition of the masses (which the modern hero compares to 18th Century France) culminates in a tour (with King Arthur disguised as a peasant) of a oountryside corrupted by monarchy and the Church, both of which were loathed by Mark Twain. Feminists should be warned that the author's misogyny is given free rein here: all the ladies of the court are thoughtless twits, and Morgan Le Fay is a shrew who habitually and casually kills her servants. The heroine Alisande (who, of course, becomes Sandy) is a tiresome chatterbox, whom the hero abruptly marries as a sort of social condescension. But his attitude towards women is merely a part of his general misanthropy, leading him to write at one point: &quot;Well, there are times when one would like to hang the whole human race and finish the farce.&quot; Once the protagonist has established himself as Arthur's right-hand man (he's called &quot;The Boss&quot;), he exercises his Yankee ingenuity to industrialize the realm. With the genius of Gutenberg, Morse and Bell at his disposal, he sets up a newspaper and introduces the telegraph and the telephone to the Middle Ages. (Just how he devises the technology to accomplish this is not made too clear.) At any rate, The Boss is considered a great wizard, and Merlin (or Brer Merlin, as the Yankee calls him) is treated like a fraudulent fool. Motivating all this is a somewhat smug sense of 19th Century superiority. Actually, the Yankee goes beyond his own century and into the 1900's. When Guenever's treason causes the civil war which divides Britain, The Boss drills a group of cadets (his West Pointers, he calls them) that he leads off to battle against the anti-Arthurian knighthood. The result is a blood bath presciently and repulsively similar to the trench warfare of 1914-1918. (The novel was published in 1889.) If this is meant to be an indication of future efficiency, it's an extremely pessimistic vision. But then, the whole story is Mark Twain's gloomy statement on Mankind's uneasy place in a dysfunctional world, be it the Dark Ages or the somber present."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Every time I look at a river, I think of Mark Twain and his adventures on the Mississippi. His writing, always funny and warm, tells us first of the history and stories of his beloved river, and then of his experiences learning the steamboat trade. I found his description of being a steamboat student very similar to being a medical student: two-hundred years later and in completely different trades, route memorization and gradual responsibility for people's lives still have much in common. This book made me want to travel the Mississippi, not as it stands today but as it appeared to Twain in his youth. I feel the same way about Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his Magdalena river. I think it is amazing how these inspired authors can make me love a river I have never seen."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Few books exist that speak thru the ages by examining themes and situations that confront people of all time. This is one of those books. Unlike Twain's other classics, the focus of this piece is not America, or topics from American history (i.e. slavery), but more general themes such as industrialization, freedom, religion and religious dogma, government control, the meaning of progress, and individual aspirations versus peer pressure.In short, this book focuses on the adventures of Hank Morgan, a Connecticut Yankee who falls asleep one day, and wakes up in England during the reign of King Arthur. This world of knights, damsels, poor hygiene, and overbearing Christian dogma seems ripe for change for our protaganist. Hank proceeds to introduce \\"progress\\" to this new (old) world in the form of practices, knowledge, and inventions he is familiar with from his time; post Civil War USA. He does this in the name of bettering the lives of those around him, both physically, and emotionally. The result is utter chaos, the destruction of the existing social order, and lessons in colonialism, nation-building, and culture shock that all missionaries, soldiers, politicians and businessmen should heed.Along the way, the book brought both tears and laughter to this reader. One of Twain's strengths is his ability to bring emotion to commonday events by portraying them from various viewpoints. This trait is on display here in its most tragi-comedic form. Overall, a great book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"There is no denying that Mark Twain is one of the best American authors. His wit and caustic style is just one of a kind, and his novels, with the in depth plot and yet witty and sardonic characters and the episodes that are at times comic and serious, is what defines that man and author that you either love or hate. In \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\\" it may leave some ambiguous. First of all, the idea is clever: making a man from the 19th century go into another time and era in 6th century Britain so he can critique, satarize, and change the lifestyle of it, therefore creating a \\"frame\\" that helps us to view how synonymous the time era back then somewhat reflects the 19th century. However, the main problem is that it's not consistent. Diving in the first few chapters is just fine, but then the story goes along a bit too slow and becomes too difficult to digest. In other words, it doesn't get to the point, and quite frankly it gets kind of dull. At times i would read one chapter and stop, feeling as if i read over 100 pages in half an hour, exhausted. I can understand why many would enjoy this novel, but it personally didnt do anything for me. If there was more action, movement, and a more firm plot (at times i didn't really understand what stance Mark Twain was trying to make, he seemed to try to make a satire on the society of the 6th century in England but it becomes ambiguous and lost throughout the story), perhaps i would give this book at least 3 stars. Apparently Mark Twain wasn't at his best when he wrote this book. Sure, the wit and humor is still there, but the excitement that drove the reader to keep on reading just isn't there. Not highly recommended, but if you are interested in it, go for it. Regardless, it's still a good story, just didn't work for me."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain is indisputably the greatest writer in history, and his wisecracking sense of humor reached its pinnacle in Connecticut Yankee. Far more than a simple time travel book, this book will keep you thinking. One minute the hero is trying to end knighthood once and for all by taping ads to suits of armor and the next minute he is trying to explain supply and demand to an ignorant farmer. The best part of this book is Hank Morgan's journey through the countryside with King Arthur. Though Twain uses his typical sarcastiic tone throughout the novel, it has a very serious, satyrical meaning. I would also like to show that some of us under the age of 18 can still appreciate great literature. Mark Twain was truly a genius, and being a fellow journalist, he is one of my heroes. It is truly a tragedy that other kids cannot recognize the significance of Twain and his works. The only book of his people seem to want to give credit to is Huck Finn because it dealt with racism. Nowadays people think a book can't have a serious meaning unless it involves the persecution of blacks, but Connecticut Yankee is simply a whole lot better than Huck Finn. Every American, every lover of literature should read this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In Life on the Mississippi the steamboat is depicted as the workhorse of Midwest expansion. Prior to the advent of the railroad efficient inland transportation was confined to waterways and the Mississippi river basin , with \\"about 1,250,000 square miles,\\" was the \\"Body of the Nation.\\" (Twain, preface) Mark Twain fulfills his boyhood dream of becoming a river boat pilot and, returning some twenty-one years later, writes of his youthful experiences and later observationsThe steamboat was a technological phenomena. The vehicle that evolved to meet the unique demands of this particular environment was a special design of river boat. In his own inimical style Mark Twain captures both the excitement of the riverboat's arrival and describes its essential components:\\"She is long and sharp and trim and pretty; she has two tall, fancy-topped chimneys, with a gilded device of some kind swung between them; a fanciful pilothouse, all glass and \\"gingerbread,\\" perched on top of the \\"texas\\" deck behind them; the paddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays above the boat's name; the boiler deck; the hurricane deck, and the texas deck are fenced and ornamented with clean white railings; there is a flag gallantly flying from the jack-staff; the furnace doors are open and the fires glaring bravely; the upper decks are black with passengers; the captain stands by the big bell calm, imposing, the envy of all; great volumes of the blackest smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the chimneys...the crew are grouped on the forecastle; the broad stage is run far out over the port bow, and an envied deck hand stands picturesquely on the end of it with a coil of rope in his hand; the pent steam is screaming through the gauge cocks; the captain lifts his hand, a bell rings, the wheels stop; then turn, back, churning the water to foam, and the steamer is at rest.\\" (27)Within a period of ten minutes the boat has been offloaded, loaded and departed. It is an efficiency of system and design ideally suited to its unique purposes, but as the Civil War looms its days are numbered. By then the steamboat had already evolved to it most advanced state and the steam locomotive has become the dominant form of transportationAs a literary piece by a \\"brilliant travel writer and incomparable humorist\\" (Kaplan, in Twain, xvii) Life on the Mississippi earned its accolades, but, as a window into a period of time, one can extract an eyewitnesses truth. In Life on the Mississippi, Mark Twain describes the latter period of the steamboat's heyday dramatically cut short. Wartime technology did not improve the riverboat other than to convert it into an instrument of war. What doomed the steamboat to oblivion was the advent of the steam locomotive and the railroads. The steamboat well served the purposes of river life in its time but was eclipsed by the railroad.That the steamboat was functional is indisputable, but if form determines function, it was a perfect adaptation of a water craft in conformity with purpose and contemporary technology. Combined with light weight and flexible wood construction the steamboat evolved into a shallow draft, wide beamed, low freeboard hull propelled by stern or side paddle wheels. The overall size of a steamboat was a compromise between maneuverability and economy. Power plant, fuel, cargo and passengers were accommodated within a superstructure rising above the hull. Bulk items, machinery, deck hands and low fare passengers were located on the main deck; superior public and private accommodations at higher fares were on the upper decks. Here travelers could enjoy incomparable luxury.High on top of all was the pilothouse. River pilots, by necessity of their position earned through their experience and knowledge of the river, had the best view. By status, they were the pinnacle of river hierarchy. Mark Twain, on his 1882 return to the river, quaintly asks of a fellow passenger he suspects of being a river pilot: \\"Have you ever traveled with a panorama.\\" The passenger responds, \\"I have formerly served in that capacity. [Twain's] suspicion was confirmed.\\" (315) Only higher than the pilothouse were the tall stacks made so for the purpose of disgorging noxious black smoke and dangerous smoldering ash to the wind.All components contributed to functionality, but perhaps the \\"stage\\" or ramp which bridged the gap between the boat and shore, contributed most to its versatility. It enabled the boat to be hailed from landings along the shore without the aid of a dock. As an apprentice, Mark Twain is left alone on the bridge for the first time by his mentor. His initial proud serenity is broken by a sudden awareness that the boat is heading for imminent impact with a \\"bluff reef.\\" His panicked reaction throws the ship into reverse, but he is saved by the return of the pilot who calmly restores order and chastises him. \\"When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap the big bell three times before you land, so the engineers can get ready.\\" (53) The \\"bluff reef\\" was actually a wind reef (from the effect of wind on the surface) and they sailed uneventfully through it.The romance of the steamboat era is tarnished by frequent tragedy. Mark Twain loses his brother Henry, a cabin boy on the Pennsylvania, who died when the ship's boilers explode in June 1858. The hazards of operating year round and during night and day, plus the varying river conditions contributed to mistakes of judgment and probably just bad luck too! The pilot may have been king, but he was still human and suffered from the human faults of vain glory, unrealistic confidence, ego, and infallibility.When he returns to the river in 1882 after an absence of twenty-one years, Mark Twain notes the changes that have occurred on the river. There are very few ships left in operation. Passenger travel is limited in frequency and destinations. The romance he once knew is gone, but a new one is beginning, the romance of the rails.Today we know that the railroad too would have its heyday and, in time, its romance would also wane. But has the romance of the steamboat and rail eras disappeared? Today you can take cruises on Mississippi riverboats and luxury train trips across the continent. The difference now is that trips are for novelty and not necessity. The romance only comes from the remembrance of a time past and not the needs of the present."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I know this book was boring and humorless to a lot of students and I can understand why. Things like the telegraph mean nothing to us now, but in Mark Twain's time it was hot technology like a rocket or the Internet are to us today.Mark Twain was saying, what if we took our modern technology back to a time when people believed in magic and faught with swords and armor. Whoever did this could probably convince these people that the technology was a superior magic and could use this knowledge to dominate them.This is what happens in the story, but only for awhile. Eventually, even the people in King Arthur's court adjust to having the new technology and no longer see it as magic. For example, the people running the telephone exchange don't care about the Connecticut Yankee's &quot;magic&quot; they just want to keep the lines of communication open with Camelot.This kind of story is called &quot;satire&quot;. It is basically a story that teaches us something by making fun of something else. In this story, Mark Twain makes fun of the kind of people who think they can accomplish anything with technology. The Yankee thinks that he can use technology to trick the nights of King Arthur's court and to manipulate them. At first he succeeds, but gradually they become so immersed in the technology that they don't care about magic and legends any more. Once their mental landscape changes, the Yankee has lost the context he needed to control them. The main argument here is that technology does not solve everything, it just produces new problems. And the kind of people who worship technology are bound to fail in one way or another.Hope this helps."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This is Twaine at his best. The book provokes thought, draws sympathy, and is downright hilarious. It also reads smoothly and at a brisk pace. It's a quick, fun read. I should also emphasize that while this is frequently labelled as children's literature, I find that label to be completely misleading. While it can no doubt be enjoyed by children at their level, there are a number of subtleties, particularly in the humor, that will be beyond the comprehension of most 13 year olds.The most pervasive feature of theme of the book is the ignorance of people in the sixth century. The Yankee is constantly dazzling both king and commoner with all manner of \\"miracles\\" (really just works of engineering or culture that he has as a result of his 19th century education). The people are the most easily duped idiots imaginable, and hold the most base conceptions and prejudices, and have no conception of justice. Twain believes these shortcomings are a product of their environment and education, rather than inherrent deficiencies (\\"training, all is training\\"). He also tackles slavery (an institution out of practice by the time of this book's writing), draws sympathy for slaves, and advocates the equality of all humanity. All pretty simple stuff. At a slightly deeper level, he tackles economic policy, namely protectionism vs. free trade, a debate that raged into his day and even into our own. He ridicules the views of the protectionists and their inability to understand the meaning of real vs. nominal wages, clearly a slap at certain arguments of his own day.Though the social commentary is interesting, if elementary, the satire is by far the best part of this book. Twain takes so many shots at so many targets that it's difficult even for the careful reader to notice them all. By far the funniest character is Alisande, a charicature of Arthurian women, who the yankee pejoritively nicknames \\"Sandy.\\" When she rambles on for hours to no apparent purpose \\"running her mill,\\" by whihc Twain pokes fun both of women in general and of their style of speech in Arthurian literature. A very funny scene is when Sandy relates a story from Thomas Mallory ver batim, with the Yankee constantly interjecting with suggestions to improve Mallory's arid writing style. \\"The Irish guy sounds like all the others, Sandy. You ought to give him a brogue, or at least have him say something like 'be jabbers' so that you'd know it's him speaking,\\" which of course is a suggestion Sandy takes.Another great piece of satire is Twain's commentary on the yankee himself. When he defeats opposing knights, he makes them sell all sorts of trinkets and products, from top hats to soap to stoves, as his way of spreading civilization. Of course these goods don't make a nation civilized, but that the yankee thinks they do is Twain's pejorative commentary as a westerner on eastern materialism. Twain's way of telling it is very funny stuff. There's much more excellent humor that can't be mentioned for the sake of space.The ending is another excellent commentary. The yankee's beautifully crafted civilization crashes down because of the irrascible prejudices of the people, which the church uses to its advantage. Twain's negative view of imperialism is here reflected, in how he depicts the folly of elevating a society by outside influences. A civilization must grow at its own pace, developing its views and values through a long process of trials. Attempts to import institutions from without are bound for failure. Though relevant in Twain's day, this is equally applicable in ours.So, if you want the whole package: a quick, easy read that also provides thought-proviking commentary and great humor, I'd recommend reading this. It would be hard to find a better book that has everything this one does."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Although I usually enjoy Twain's writing style, and his sense of wry humor, there was something about A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court that was less than satisfying.Some of the situations that the protagonist gets himself into are \\"classic\\" Twain. When the narrator is transported back to the time of Camelot, he begins to speculate about rituals, customs and general style of life. There is one part where the townspeople are convinced that he can perform great magical feats (he actually has Merlin as his rival), and when they corner him about performing one, he has to think of a way to please them or face punishment. He realizes that he can remember when an eclipse is going to come, and there is the way out of his situation. There are many adventures, where the narrator becomes critical of their ways, as a time warp will do. He is a fish out of water in many ways in this new world, not understanding, for instance, their need to have extravagant adventures: \\"Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving; and generally loaded with some tale about some princess or other wanting help to get her out of some faraway castle where she was being held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel...\\" Because of his ability to perform great acts, he becomes known as the Boss, and helps to free some poor peasants from terrible punishments.Maybe what made this less of a story was that it became too \\"preachy\\" and filled with social commentary. Although this is what usually makes Twain's novels, here it seemed to detract from the over all story. I was much more interested in hearing about the next adventure, but the narrator continued to rattle on and on about what he felt was wrong with this society. You get the feeling that Twain, not the narrator, is speaking after awhile. In the end, I guess it wasn't really the book I expected it to be. Still, it has its moments, and there are some parts that will have you chuckling to yourself as you read.I consider Twain to be one of my favorite authors, but this is one of his lesser achievements."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The title also happens to be the plot outline. Elements of the plot have been duplicated in countless books, TV shows and movies. Army of Darkness and MacGyver leap immediately to mind. The book is a fantasy, and if haters can set aside its numerous anachronisms (A man from 1900, for example, would never be able to understand the language of 6th century England), it's quite enjoyable.The novel is considerably more adversarial than one might expect. The main character is uncouth, obnoxious, and a jerk, even more so than is necessary given the immensely frustrating ignorance of the 6th century people. I suspect Twain plugged himself in to the Boss character, and had a good old time writing this one.The main character is out to get the established Church, not in a no-holds-barred, Philip Pullman way, but in a logical way that recognizes the value of faith while tearing down the humanistic and suppressive political and economic machinations of the Church.Twain also takes shots at England through the ages, at its historically oppressive caste system and at the English people's long-running love of hereditary nobility.Commentary on politics and on human nature abound, but A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is still a great adventure story. These two elements step on each other's toes sometimes, but Twain pulls it off.Clunky title.

The Modern Library's version is wonderful. I highly receommend it. Well made and bound for easy reading, this novel even feels good in the hand. All the original illustrations are here, with the text wrapped around them marvelously. A true pleasure to read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"**This review may contain spoilers.\\"Cursory reading of Twain's quasi-satirical \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" suggests that the author was simply interested in lampooning the blue whale-sized targets of Arthurian characters, chivalry, knightly ideals, tyranny, religious hypocrisy, ancestral elitism, and ignorant superstition. The novel does, but I believe Twain's satiric scope was much broader. \\"Connecticut Yankee\\"'s target is humanity and the human condition itself, with Hank Morgan as its ironic prism.Superficial readers of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" are wont to cheer for the protagonist Hank as a droll, unflappable champion of progressive economic, social, and cultural freedom. On the surface, he is. But Hank is subtly more sinister than that. All his improvements and ameliorative actions throughout the book only seem to benefit the British populace. Instead, everything he does is ultimately self-aggrandizing and self-serving, not to mention manipulative. He constantly and contemptously plays upon the British population's (from serf to King Arthur) fearful ignorance and superstition to achieve his paradoxical goal of conquest. His purported dream of converting Britain into a republic is undercut by his \\"hankering\\" to be its first president. Hank's subtle imperialism shows through the seams. Even Hank's name is ironic. His last name, Morgan, reminds you of King Arthur's malicious sorcerous half-sister Morgan Le Fay, who also had designs on Arthur's kingdom.Hank manages to lay a veneer of 19th century \\"civilization\\" upon 6th century England, but as the Catholic Church's interdict towards the end of the novel proves, that veneer is transient. I believe the prominent theme of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is that human betterment must be inherent and developed from within by honest and genuine moral means, not imposed adventitiously from the outside. Furthermore, younger, pliant minds not marinated in superstition are more likely to retain these lessons better than their mentally intransigent elders. That's why the former page Clarence and fifty or so young men remained loyal to Hank even after the rest of Britain plunged back into the Dark Ages after the interdict.However, Hank manipulates even these followers in a desperate attempt to preserve a vestige of his republic. Like a modern fortress, Hank and his followers protect themselves with moats, electric fences, and Gatling guns and exterminate all the opposing English forces. However, it is a Pyrrhic victory because the mound of putrefying knightly corpses threaten to asphyxiate them. Merlin, who is portrayed as a buffoonish charlatan throughout the novel, suddenly displays his true powers and puts Hank in a deep sleep in a cave, to awaken 1300 years later. Hank does wake up, but, perhaps remorseful over his deeds, pines away for the noble, romanticized England he dismissed at the beginning of the novel.Successful satires about the human condition have two primary characteristics: 1) Humans and humanity have many flaws, sins, and vices and 2) Humans and humanity very seldom correct those flaws, sins, and vices. By these standards, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is a largely successful satire. Ultimately, there is no one really worthy of admiration, not the conniving Merlin, not the noble but dunderheaded King Arthur, not even young Clarence (though he comes reasonably close), and not the devious Hank. Perhaps \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" was the harbinger of Twain's increasingly dark and cynical attitude towards humanity in general."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I bought the book for a trip I was taking down the Mississippi River during the summer of 2010.

What surprised me the most was that it was in the junior fiction section of my local library, and the more I read, the more surprised I was. I was an advanced reader when I was young, but I would have been hard pressed to understand or get much out of this book anytime before high school. That said, I was fairly riveted throughout the novel. Hank Morgan's character was amusing, resourceful, and altogether human. After reading so much about the \\"perfection\\" of Arthurian and Round Table society, it's nice to hear about what life would have been like even if King Arthur and his Round Table did exist. The ending was distinctly bittersweet, and I can honestly say that this has become one of my favorite classics."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I've seen all of the one-star reviews of this book and they all seemed to be done by fourteen year olds with no imagination, and no understanding that bad grammar is to be left at AIM.

If you like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it makes the book doubly interesting, because you can see how a person from the 1800's parodied medieval times versus a person from the 1960's. The only reason I gave this book four stars is because sometimes Twain did go on a little too long with the details.I really think you should read this book if you haven't had your mind melted by video games and graphic novels.

This mental exercise led me to the same conclusion and results as Hank.I perhaps disdain the collusion and alliance of the church and monarchs as much as Twain who is particularly acrimonious of these institutions. I therefore identified with Hank readily and enjoyed reading as he organized and recruited among the populace those who would be most loyal to his cause. Gradually with education, toil, leadership and a bit of luck he finds himself at the helm of new political and economic system buttressed by a technological revolution.A lesson here perhaps for our \\"modern\\" leaders?A great bedtime story for your children as well as a disguised critique on monarchy and theocracy."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I've been reading a lot of classic literature recently, and I also recently saw the Mississippi River for the first time...so this book seemed liked the perfect one for me to read right now.This is a \\"non-fictional\\" book by Mark Twain. (I guess that means based on some truth but embelished in various ways?) In it he recalls the years he spent during his youth as a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi River. Then he suddenly jumps forward many years in the book to when he is an older man. As an older man, he decides to go back and travel on the Mississippi River again. He finds the river much changed. The course of time (the Civil War has come and gone, the expansion of the railroad, and the forces of nature) have greatly changed life on the river. The once thriving steamboat trade has almost disapeared.Besides his personal recollections, he also includes other interesting stories,history,folklore, talltales, and such. It is written in typical Mark Twain style - his dry sense of humor will bring a smile to your face. I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This book was at first a huge disappointment. I went into to it expecting a humorous, light-hearted Mark Twain book. However, this was far from what I got. The story begins as a narration through the eyes of Hank Morgan, a 19th century factory manager. The plot starts when Hank is knocked out by an employee and wakes up in the 6th century. After dropping the idea that he is in a dream, he tries to make the best of the situation by improving the lives of the people. Using the knowledge he has of the future and his formal education, he wins the social rank known as &quot;The Boss&quot; and begins to educate a small group of people. His goal is to set up a republic and to destroy the overruling church officials. As time progresses, he sees the life of the people through their position (sees the life of a knight as a knight) and his desire to create an equal, yet effecient civilization increases. He tries to introduce the new ideas of his present time to them and the effect is something to read about. In the end, he learns that trying to change the atitude and customs of a large group of people is not as easy as he at first thought. The Yankee observed some very dark and distrubing facts about people. The book was not the most entertaining book, but the insight to humanity makes it well worth the read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A classic read, a man from the modern age is displaced in time winding up in Camelot.Mark Twain makes plenty of fun of chivalry and middle-age wizardry.The book first appeared in 1889, but it's an entertaining read today. The novel is filled with humor and at times takes an optimistic stance on technology and modern age versus middle age, but there're also some touching moments and more than meets the eye at a first stance.When considered at a deeper level, it can lead the reader to think about ancient times and their real connections to our current society. What was Mark Twain's perception of history, and what are the main influences on this perception?Anyway, it's not compulsory to ask such questions, and the novel is enjoyable from a purely &quot;entertainment&quot; perspective. The book is suited both for kids and adults."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This book was actually required reading for one of my college classes. I really like the parts of the book where Twain talks about the river and becoming a steamboat captain, but I thought the rest of the book sort of dragged - I ended up skimming those parts. Still, though, he does talk about the river for most of the book, and it is a classic, so its worth reading at least once. I reread certain sections now and then myself."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain really tears apart the Catholic church and nobility.

Morgan keeps a diary of the events and happenings of what goes on during his crazy adventure at King Arthur's kingdom. Using 19th century technological advancments, Morgan fools everyone into believing that he is a great magician. After he gains the respect of the kink and the people, he becomes known as &quot;The Boss&quot;. He goes on several adventures which result in a comical, exiting atmosphere for the book to take place in. I didn't particularly like this book for a couple of reasons. First off, none of the jokes are funny. This might be because it was writtern in the 19th century. The author (Mark Twain) was probably cracking jokes from the time it was written. Some times the jokes dept on repeating themselves. Morgan kept on using slang from the 19th century; of coarse none of the medieval characters were understood him. The book also got really boring, really fast. There was really no action in it. It seemed like the author was trying to make it funny, but couldn't. The characters were unrealistic; they would not be in the same mood for 5 minutes.

I felt that Twain often drug on certain topics or ideas. I think that I would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if Twain would have been more forward and to the point. I guess this book just wasn't for me, but others might find it interesting.But I do have a lot of respect for Twain for writing this.

I did not like the book at all because it was incredibly boring. Most of the book had nothing to do with the main climax. The whole book was filled with completly irelevant and confusing details. There were a lot of things that happened suddenly and were not sufficently explained-like when Hank got married. Overall there were to many details where they didn't need them and not enough details where they did need them. The book was also very unrealistic. If Hank knew all that he did in the book, he would have probably rivaled Einstien's IQ. There's no way one person could make telephones, gattling guns, revolvers, newspapers, and factories using 6th century tools.

He woke up in the Middle Ages and with his 19th century knowledge tried to help the citizens The ways he helped them were he created schools for the children, he made guns for the army and brought electricity from lightning to help everybody. The main characters were Merlin, King Arthur, Clarence and the main character Hank Morgan. I did not like this book. I think the book is very boring because it is hard to understand the complicated text. The way that the text was complicated was Mark Twain was writing how Middle Ages citizens would talk and one of his sentences went like this, &quot;Graddually as the time wore down one annoying fact still borne upon my understanding&quot;. Another reason I don't like this book is that it is to hard to know what is really going on and who is speaking in the book. At one point in this book I had a totaly different picture in my mind then what was happening in the book. I thought that Clarence and not Hank Morgan was going to get hanged and then burned.

Hank Morgan's intent to both dominate and liberate Arthurian England, and to \\"rescue\\" a supposedly benighted country so that it might become an image of the United States, foreshadows the American Exceptionalism that took us into Viet Nam and, later, into Iraq. When Arthurian England decides it does not want to be liberated, or to become like the United States, Hank in a fit of temper destroys a culture, using American technology to bring about its ruin.

I found this book very boring because it didn't have much action to keep my attention. The reason why it was so boring is because the guy just sits around all day feeling proud of his high status. The story also doesn't have many characters, which would have made it more interesting. The book was also hard to understand. Because it was set in the middle ages, the characters used old-fashioned words like &quot;Lo&quot; &quot;thou art&quot; etc. that i could not understand. Another reason why I would not reccomend this book to anyone is that it went off on differenbt subjects not pertaining to the story-line. Because it went off on weird subjects, I got confused easily and i would have to read parts of the story over-again. The only good thing about this book is that it taught me the differences between daily life today and how much different it was in the middle ages. Overall, i would not reccomend this book to anyone.

The man attempts to modernize everything. He makes people believe he is a powerful magician by performing simple acts that seem unreal to the people. For example, he blows up a tower by connecting gun powder to a lightning rod during a storm. Amazing....I think not. I thought this book was boring because there are to many unnecessary details. Who cares what each prison cell looks like? One whole chapter was on the prices of food and how they vary from town to town. Another reason I disliked this book is because it was hard to follow. All the different knights names are so hard to remember and its so slow paced that if you put the book down you can't remember what was going on and you're not interested enough to care. This was a boring 300 page book that could easily be made into an interesting 150 page book.

Needless to say, he goes on an excursion with King Arthur experiencing many events along the way. On the journey he learns lessons of how to be noble and be a knight. My opinion of this book is that it lacks something, something that is entertaining. I do not find it interesting or appealing. Mark Twain uses many details like most books he has written. The book went a bit overboard on them. Talking about how it feels to be in armor for a page doesn't entice me. Also Twain goes onto new events too fast by actually lacking in detail. He did not have a smooth entrance to the journey he that the king and him went on. Also, I didn't realize until a chapter or two after Sandy, a damsel going on the journey, was introduced that she was a woman. I thought she was a horse at first. He could have transferred details, meaning using less on particular items and more on entrances. Overall, this book did not appeal to me at all.

The book is both an adventure story and a social satire. It is in many ways baffling, and is a great attempt but not necessarily a great finished work of literature. The book is confused and ill-organized; attempting to do too many things at the same time. A parody of medieval chivalry and romance, an invective against social inequality and political injustice, an attack on human ignorance and superstition, it is at the same time written as if it were for children. Deadly serious and cynical, the novel is also saturated with lowbrow humor. Despite the disjointed nature of the book, there are many great parts in it, and it is certainly well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I read this recently after having kept a copy around for years; I now wish I had read it years ago. It is witty, observant, and a wonderful slice of American history; thenow-vanished steamboat culture comes alive like nowhereelse. However, the best part is the contrast between the author's confident early youthful years and the much later, postwar years of bittersweet reminiscence and regret for what has passed, never to return. A wonderful book - I simply cannot praise it highly enough."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"If you think Bing Crosby's 1949 movie was anything like Mark Twain's fantasy classic published in 1889...Forget It! Like the precursor novels,'Gulliver's Travels' written in 1726 by Jonathan Swift and 'Alice in Wonderland' written in 1865 by Lewis Carroll were made into movies that are barely representative of the original novels. The film starring Bing Crosby was a musical / comedy only touching on the very basic part of Twain's novel.Mark Twain's view of England's Lifestyle in 528 was very harsh pertaining to church and throne to say the least.On page 246, he says...\\" if one could but force it ( manhood ) out of its timid and suspicious privacy, to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it\\". The book has none of the film's niceties, instead it graphically tells of unjust hangings,stake burnings, murder, slavery, and an unfair caste system. This is a brilliant novel written 113 years after the Revolutionary War and 24 years after the Civil War. The contents truly reveal Mark Twain's political and social views, which I think are worthy of the study they have received. For further information on his thoughts see: 'Autobiography of Mark Twain: Volume 1, Reader's Edition (Mark Twain Papers)'.In the year 1879, Hank Morgan ( his name is only mentioned once ), an arms factory foreman, gets into a fight with a man named Hercules ( no, not him ) and wakes up under a tree in King Arthur's Camelot in the year 528! He is captured by the less then adequate knight, Sir Kay. At first Hank thinks he is in an insane asylum, but then as he is brought before The Knights of the Round Table to receive justice, he realizes that he really is in the sixth century. He is stripped naked and sent to the dungeon and sentenced to be burned at the stake the next day. The page, Clarence, visits Hank in the dungeon and is convinced by Hank that Hank's a super magician. Clarence becomes Hank's right hand man. Hank remembers that the next day will have a total eclipse of the sun. He warns King Arthur and Merlin the Magician that he will blot out the sun if they attempt to burn him at the stake. The next day they don't believe him and as they start the fire under Hank, the sun starts to go dark! The King wants Hank to stop it and become the second most powerful man in Camelot. Hank waits for the eclipse to pass and now becomes known as The Boss to the chagrin of Merlin, now a vowed enemy of The Boss.The Boss with the help of Clarence secretly starts many modern businesses, such as; a telephone system, a newspaper business, a railroad, army and naval academies, an arms factory, an electric company and an advertising company with the knights displaying the ads on their armour, just to mention a few of his enterprises. King Arthur requires The Boss to go on a quest with the damsel, Sandy, to save enslaved princesses from three ogres! It turns out to be a pig sty with three farmers. He returns to Camelot a hero with his now beloved Sandy. He then has many adventures in Camelot, such as; jousting tournaments with the knights armed with lances and The Boss with a pistol ( who do you think won? ), the blowing up of Merlin's Tower, the magical repair of the fount at the Valley of Holiness, and many more. At this point The Boss decides to go incognito with King Arthur into the realm of the peasants. They find many injustices and wrongs amongst the people, but before they can return to the castle, they are captured by a earl and sold into slavery. They are accused of murder and sentenced to hang. The Boss escapes and calls Clarence for help. The next day just before they are to be hanged, Lancelot and 500 knights arrive on bicycles to save the day!The ensuing years are good for The Boss, his wife Sandy and their daughter, Hello-Central ( that's right! ). Unbeknownst to The Boss, Merlin has made his family sick, so The Boss takes his family away from England and goes on a long cruise/ vacation to heal. That's when :The expression [the shit hits the fan] is related to, and may well derive from, an old joke. A man in a crowded bar needed to defecate but couldn't find a bathroom, so he went upstairs and used a hole in the floor. Returning, he found everyone had gone except the bartender, who was cowering behind the bar. When the man asked what had happened, the bartender replied, 'Where were you when the shit hit the fan?' [Hugh Rawson, \\"Wicked Words,\\" 1989] This is the best part of the book, the last 100 pages, or so. I never could have predicted the ending. The interesting thing about this book is that Mark Twain is the narrator! The book starts out with Twain on a tour of the Warwick Castle. He is approached by a old man seemingly knowledgeable about the castle and the knights. The old man starts to tell Twain his story from thirteen centuries ago, but grows weary at the Warwick Arms, and before retiring to his room, he hands Twain the manuscript to read. This was a great book and if you only read one classic this year...make it this one!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In this novel, Twain invented a common fantasy theme: a modern man travels to an ancient era and introduces modern technology and modern political ideas.I found the fantasy part somewhat lurching and disjointed. Major innovations such as the telegraph show up off-stage. Sometimes years pass between chapters with no obvious notice. The ending feels forced, too.The antagonists are a mixed lot. The knights and Merlin are just foils -- always wrong, always stupid. The King is more interesting -- he is invested with personal courage and dignity. Sandy, too, is maddeningly medieval one moment, and a co-conspirator with Boss the next.Mixed in with the scenes about 19th century technology in medieval England, Twain delivers several scenes about medieval justice, nobility, and slavery. He writes fine thunderous fusillades on the side of human dignity and human liberty. These are the best parts of the book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I really enjoyed this book; it was one of Mark Twain's best, in my opinion. Hank Morgan, a mechanic in a nineteenth century New England factory, is hit on the head during an argument. He wakes to find himself among knights and magicians in King Arthur's court. What follows is a work of satire, in which Twain celebrates ingenuity and democracy over the bumblings of monarchy. But he also asks whether such progress necessarily makes a better society. Gradually as Hank becomes more powerful, he also becomes more ruthless and less able to control events. On top of all that, it was a great story as well. I loved Twain's writing style; it wasn't too overwritten, and I enjoyed the way he alternated from modern style to medieval. Hank's narration is in a more modern style, but the other characters speak with prithees and thous and hasts. Also, the edition I have has wonderful ink illustrations to go with the chapters by Dan Beard.

Not terrible because it simply makes fun of those things, I could easily digest that, but because it seems to seriously attempt to make the legends seem to be groundless and made up, with none of their hidden meaning and mystery.

In practice, it would be totally impossible to invent all the stuff that Mr. Morgan invents. Materials just weren't available. But who cares! It's fun to imagine it anyway, and Twain does all kinds of creative stuff with the idea.The book is at turns funny and tragic. The Dark Ages are portrayed as brutal, savage, merciless times...which I'm sure they were. Makes you appreciate living in a modern democracy. Hmmm...what else to say...there's a few weird spots in the book where the story line takes a bit of a sudden jump. One gets the feeling that Twain got fed up with a few bits of it, and just kinda patched it together at those spots. Let's see...what else?

It's an interdisciplinarian's dream as Twain takes on economics, geography, politics, ancient and contemporary history, and folklore with equal ease. Mostly though, one appreciates his knack for exaggeration, the tall tale, and the outright lie. It's a triumph of tone, as he lets you in on his wild wit, his keen observation, and his penchant for bending the truth without losing his credibility as a guide.The book's structure is also modern: He recounts his days as a paddlewheel steam boat \\"cub,\\" piloting the hundreds of miles of the Mississippi before the Civil War, then, in Part 2, returns to retrace his paddleboat route. Although a few of his many digressions don't work (they sometimes sound formulaic or too detailed) most of the narrative is extremely entertaining. Twain seems caught between admiration and disdain for the \\"modern\\" age-but he also rejects over-sentimentality over the past. He writes with beauty and cynicism, verve and humor.

Well, now that you've reached adulthood, you should make time to read _Life on the Mississippi_. It's mandatory reading if you live in a state that borders the great river, anywhere from Minnesota down to Louisiana. It's mandatory reading if you have come to that point in life when you can suddenly appreciate American history and post-Civil War stories written by someone who lived through that time.Writing in the first half of the 1870s, Twain retraces the steps of his youth: the watery highway he knew when he trained to be a riverboat pilot nearly 20 years earlier. He speaks of how life _was_ along the river, and what life _became_. It's almost a \\"you can't go home again\\" experience for him, while the reader gets the benefit of discovering both time periods.I have two favorite parts that I share with others. Chapter IX includes a wonderful dissertation about how learning the navigational intricacies of the river caused Twain to lose the ability to see its natural beauty. And Chapter XLV includes an assessment of how the people of the North and the South reacted differently to the war experience. If I were a social studies teacher, I'd use that last passage in a unit on the reconstruction period. So put this title on your vacation reading list, and don't fret: the chapters are short and are many -- 60! -- but you can stop at any time, and the words go by fast. _Life on the Mississippi_ should make you forget all about any Twain trauma and report-writing you may have suffered as a teenager. [This reviewer was an Illinois resident when these comments were written.]"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This is the book that Mark Twain himself thought to be his greatest. It is basically a memoir in two parts of his life spent on the river with historical sketches, statistics, and other matters thrown in.The first part of the book tells of Twain's early years as a riverboat pilot. He talks about being a cub pilot, about learning about the intricacies of the river and the difficulties of navigating it, and about his mentor Horace Bixby. Twain's love of the river and his pride in \\"mastering\\" it are made obvious in these chapters.The second part recounts Twain's return to the river in 1882, mainly to \\"see it again\\" in preparation of writing this book. Starting in St. Louis, he first goes south through Baton Rouge to New Orleans. He spends a bit of time there and describes life as he sees it in the city (there's a funny chapter regarding the above-ground cemeteries and an argument about cremation). Then he heads north on the steamboat City of Baton Rouge, piloted by his old mentor Horace Bixby. He stops off in Hannibal for three days, just enough time to see how much the town and some old acquaintances have changed, and then continues all the way to St. Paul, Minnesota.Twain's humor, as he recounts conversations with people, sights seen, reminiscences dredged up, and a myriad of other matters that fill the book, is always evident. It's one of the great books on the mighty river, and whether you are a lover of the works of Mark Twain or interested in the Mississippi River during the time period just before and after the Civil War, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"What a great novel! Twain is wonderfully funny, yet his scathing social commentary concerning his own times are as serious as a heart attack.When a Connecticut Yankee gets sent back in time to King Arthur's Court, he decides his superior knowledge should be used to educate such an \\"ignorant race.\\" Of course, we all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and if I didn't know better, I would say that the person who coined the phrase did so after finishing this novel. The story's main character, Hank Morgan, is a likeable, if not laughable character, yet as most of us already know: absolute power corrupts absolutely. Once technology gets on a roll, the beast of civilization takes off running and Morgan cannot pull in the reigns. Total disaster ensues (incase you had not already guessed).This was a fun read and a look at a problem that is still very much alive today. Too much civilization can be like a disease, especially when those who are working to spread it find that they are doing it for reasons other than altruism.Also, do you remember the scene in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" when Indiana Jones whips out his gun to shoot the sword-wielding Sultan? That scene was surely lifted from this very book!Trust me, this is a novel for thought, but one that will not bore you. Twain was a master and this is perhaps my favorite of his novels. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"You might wonder what prompted Mark Twain to sidle from \\"straight\\" fiction into the realm of outright fantasy. Twain transports a Connecticut shop foreman twelve centuries into the past [and 5 000 kilometres!] to Camelot and Arthur's court. Initially confused and dismayed, Hank Morgan's Yankee practicality is quickly aroused and he becomes a major figure among the panopolied knights. With the title of The Boss, his rank equals The King or The Pope with its uniqueness. His elevation doesn't distract him from a more profound impulse, however. Hank's Yankee roots and wide experience evoke an ambition - nothing less than revolution. He wants to sweep away the monarchy and aristocracy and establish an American-style republic in Arthurian Britain.Mark Twain's scathing criticism of the sham of hereditary monarchy bolstered by an Established Church makes this among his choicest writings. He resents the condition of a Church which \\"turned a nation of men into a nation of worms.\\" A fervent believer in individual freedom, Twain uses Hank to voice his disdain of Britain's royalty. It's no more than might be expected of a man who boasted of but one ancestor - who sat on the jury that executed Charles I. Hank knows revolutions never succeed when implemented from above. Revolution be achieved only when the individual's attitude changes from meek acceptance toself assertion. Hank's method reaches people through clandestine schools and factories, publication of a newspaper and establishment of a telephone system. These new forms of manufacture and communication become the foundation by which Hank expects to abolish the ancient, mis-named, chivalric tradition. Does he change the course of history?Twain relocates the roots of American democracy from the heart of the frontier yeoman farmer to the brain of the urban industrial worker. Here the man of wide, practical experience shows how to survive compared to those with a formal education. Hank has a simple ambition - establishment of a republic - but utilizes a broad spectrum of ideas to bring it about. He would gladly replace the Established Church of Rome with his own Presbyterian ideals, but is aware that it would be swapping one evil for another. \\"Each man should select his own religion, or make one\\" he contends. Yet, finally, it is this dread force that impairs his desire for change. The final sequence stands as a peer to the biblical Armageddon, Twain wallowing in a frightful bloodletting unseen in any of his other works.Mark Twain contrasts the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution with the centuries of slavery, serfdom, and poverty that killed countless more people than that spasm of excising of aristocracy. What else spurred him to write of human rights with such passion? He had written of slavery before, but this book is especially wrathful in describing the \\"peculiar institution\\" eliminated in his homeland but a generation before. He forces the king to experience the slave's condition, a form of degradation he would have all aristocrats endure. Every feature of the human condition is examined in this timeless treasure. He challenges you to follow his gaze, considering whether today's societies, monarchical or not, will endure the scrutiny."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"As with all of Mark Twain's work this book works on two very different levels. The first of course is a simple adventure story the second is a bitingly satiric work that unmasks many of the hypocracies of \\"conventional wisdom\\".I have to believe that most of his readers of his time (and ours) did not understand his underlying messages regarding society and its institutions. For me, it was hard to miss the way he unmasked the church, the state and society as a whole. I had to laugh out loud at some of the ways he managed to expose the absurdities of government and religion.This book is a quick read and is immensely satisfying if the reader takes the time to follow Twain's logic to its natural conclusions."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In Life on the Mississippi, Twain recounts his river experiences from boyhood to riverboat captain and beyond. Encompassing the years surrounding the Civil War, this book is an excellent source of 19th-century Americana as well as an anthology of the mighty river itself. Replete with rascally rivermen, riparian hazards, deluge, catastrophe, and charm, Life on the Mississippi is another of Twain's stellar literary achievements.Wit and wisdom are expected from Twain and this book does not disappoint. It is equally valuable for it's period descriptions of the larger river cities (New Orleans, St. Louis, St. Paul), as well as the small town people and places ranging the length of America's imposing central watershed.The advent of railroads signalled the end of the Mississipi's grand age of riverboat traffic, but, never fear, Life on the Mississippi brings it back for the reader as only Samuel Clemens can. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Life on the Mississippi is by far one of the most wonderful books ever written about the post Civil War era in America. Mark Twain takes the reader on a melancholy look at this period of time in history as you journey into the Mississippi of his youth, adulthood, and the people and the communities he knew so well. He conveys a miraculous picture of this lively river giving it the grandeur and prominence it deserves. He defines the river very much like a living organism with a power and personality all its own. As the book unfolds, he begins in his days when he grew up along the river and became a steam boat pilot, ending that career with the advent of the Civil War. Later he returns to the river after some twenty years and takes a journey as a writer from around St. Louis to New Orleans and back up the river into what is present day Minnesota. You learn about the different cultures along the river, its tributaries, as well as the remarkable people who become part of the forgotten history of our nation. Twain's anecdotes are sheer brilliance, and he has an incredible way of choosing just the right story to illustrate a particular point transporting the reader back into time as if it was the present day and you are standing beside Twain observing what he is seeing. His reflections of his times along the river and his descriptions of the people and places make this a true masterpiece of literature and I highly recommend it. I found myself only able to read short portions at a time, as I personally found the sheer beauty of the entire book was a work to be savored and digested rather than rapidly consumed as you would with any other book. As I poured through the book, I felt often as if I was traveling with Mark Twain as a companion along his charming and magnificent journey during a wonderful period of history."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This is an excellent book. It is by far the best Twain I have read yet, and I give it four stars. In this novel, Mark Twain holds the glory and romance associated with Arthurian Legend up to the standards of 19th century society, and reveals defects in both the romantic ideal of King Arthur and the faith that Twain's generation holds in scientific and social &quot;progress.&quot; Both funny and thought-provoking, this book provides the reader with a new set of eyes with which to view the barbarism and injustice that Arthur and his knights so valiantly fought to preserve. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is the tale of Hank Morgan, a typical 19th century man who is transported back in time to the days of Merlin, Guinevere, and King Arthur. After becoming aware of his surroundings, and deciding to ignore his uncertainty about whether King Arthur actually existed, this man uses the common knowledge of his time period, his practicality, and some perfectly timed arrogance to acquire a position of great power in this land that he finds repulsive and in need of an enlightened leader. The ensuing story is the tale of what happens when the two utopias collide and this man abuses his power in an attempt to bring the &quot;great and beneficent&quot; miracles of the 19th century to the Age of Chivalry. I would recommend this book to any reader in 8th grade or above, but I would discourage people with passionate faith in the purity and glory of King Arthur from reading this book if they do not want to be forcefully presented with demonstrations of chivalry's inhumanities. A fairly well developed sense of humor will help the reader to enjoy Mark Twain's subtle ironies and satirical situations, and some basic knowledge of science helps in understanding some of the scenes, however this isn't vital to the book. The vocabulary is moderately advanced, the subject matter is somewhat mature at times, and the philosophical reasoning is probably beyond the reach of most Junior High students, yet I would encourage anyone who is interested to give this book a try. This novel is also great for the general public because A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court provides the reader with a main character with whom they may identify. The main character, Hank Morgan is presented with situations in which he must deal with being a stranger in a new atmosphere, being a social outcast due to his uncommon beliefs, he must avoid physical confrontation, and he is forced to use his intellectual abilities rather than brute strength to solve difficult situations. Many readers will have faced similar difficulties in their lives, and this ability to identify with the characters will definitely add to the overall enjoyment of the story. With this piece of work, Mark Twain displays his true talent for excellent writing and story telling. He incorporates enough adventurous and action filled scenarios to make the reader want to continue reading vigorously, yet he also manages to discuss very philosophical and thought-provoking topics during the lulls in the action. This book reads very quickly near the beginning and end. The action tapers off during the middle of the story, but not for long, and once it starts to pick up again, Twain demonstrates his true potential for greatly entertaining writing in the very climactic and cleverly ironic ending that brings this all-around great book to an even better close. This is definitely a book worth reading."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This is the fictional journal of a man who somehow got transported into the time of King Arthur. It is told from an interesting point of view because in the beginning of the story the man supposedly wanders into the house of the writer and gives the writer this journal of the events of his life in the 500s. The journal tells the story of how the man first found himself in King Arthur's time, was taken to prison, and was about to be killed when he remembered that there was to be an eclipse at noon. So, he makes the people believe that he is a great magician and that he made the eclipse happen, so if they don't release him and give him great power, he will never bring the sun back. They of course believe him and he comes to be known as the \\"Boss\\" because he is basically the boss of the king. He marries, has children, and then.... The story is captivating and realistic (except, of course, for how he got there), punctuated by witty humor and hilarious circumstances. A must-read classic for everyone!!!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Wow! What a book. I myself have only read one other book by Mark Twain and that was Tom Sawyer and I really didn't like it. But my compliments to Mr.Twain on this one. This is a book that I had a hard time putting down. The adventure, humor, and excitement came with every turn of the page. The book is about Hank Morgan who is a young man in Connecticut in the 19th century who is sent back to the 13th century. There he barely escapes death, and I mean barely and later serves an important position in King Author's Court. During his time there he introduces 19th Century technology to the people of the land of Camelot, making him an instant hit. Even though he barely escapes death he still makes rude and contreversial coments toward the king. To find out how the book ends you'll just have to read it. This was a really awsome book and I really enjoy it. I would recomend this to anyone who has an imagination and loves to read adventures with humor as well. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This book may seem like a perfectly innocent book that you would want your children to read. Mark Twain's a fabulous American author, right? Well, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" starts off innocent enough.... Hank Morgan, a factory owner in 19th century Connecticut is hit over the head with a crowbar by a rowdy employee. He is knocked out, and when he awakes he finds himself with Sir. Kay, one of the knights in King Arthur's Court, who brings him back to Camelot to be executed. The beginning of the book shows off Mark Twain's obvious distaste for 6th century society in Britain, but also has a few of its more humorous moments. We learn that the knights of the round table are nothing more than Vulgar Braggarts, we witness the destruction of Merlin (the yankee's enemy)'s tower, the cruelty of Queen Morgan LeFay, and the antics as Hank and Sandy go on a quest to find several captive princesses (who are nothing more than hogs!)Hank impresses everyone by institutionalizing modern conveniences back into that era (trains, telephones, guns, newspapers....) Anyway, the book takes a darker turn when King Arthur and Hank travel incognito as peasants and witness the downtrodden and oppressed peoples. One of the more touching moments of the book is when King Arthur carries a dying girl out of a hut to her mother, risking getting infected with smallpox. It gets even darker when Hank murders 10 knights with a pistol, then later when he and a handful of other men kill off 50,000 knights with high-voltage electric fences, land mines, and trenches with sharp spears sticking out on the bottom, only to almost die from the stench of the dead. This book is better for the mature reader because it deals with many issues of society, such as discrimination between social classes, and not accepting other cultures. I definetly wouldn't reccomend this for: SQUEAMISH PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH LIMITED READING SKILLS, AND PEOPLE WHO LACK MATURITY. Despite all of the defects of this novel, it sure is a classic!!!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In this book, It was easy to notice all the small detail such as the accents, rooms of the court's detail and the description of life in Camelot. All those were so detailed it made me think about all the work Mark Twain put into this. This book's detail alone blows any other King Arthur book out of the water. After just reading the first 200 pages, this book has hooked me as its favorite. The beginning was terriffic and will hook you into reading the rest in suspicion about what the Narrator's next adventure will be. The book has taught me (and will teach anyone who reads it) a lot about Camelot and what it would have been like to live there. If you love to read historical fiction books, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Imagine yourself thrown back fourteen hundred years to the kingdom of the legendary Arthur. Add some technical know-how, a touch of arrogance, and a taste for adventure, and you would be Hank Morgan. The successful head superintendent of an arms factory, Morgan is sent back in time by a nasty knock on the head, and finds himself a prisoner at the court of the once and future king. Through an incredible knowledge of astronomy, and mechanics, and his natural intelligence, he finds his way to the top of the Arthurian power structure, and becomes The Boss. Posing as a powerful magician, he impresses the people and the court with magnificent firework displays, stellar predictions, and other \\"tricks\\" that today are taken for granted. As he learns more about the social inequalities in the culture that he has no choice but to live in, he comes to the conclusion that he must free the masses from the oppression of the nobility. Morgan attempts to impose the ideals, governing system, and ways of thinking of the industrialized 19th century onto the primitive 6th century. Secretly, he develops a civilization of his own time inside Arthur's Kingdom, his eventual goal being to destroy every remnant of the old ways, and replace them with the new. Traveling the kingdom, Morgan spreads his influence and his beliefs. He encounters on his adventures both heartbreaking situations of cruelty, and heartwarming scenes of humanity. Throughout the whole kingdom, however, he always sees the need to destroy the feudal system. Twain teaches us something through Morgan's determination, and something else by the calamitous ending of the book. The good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur is probably the most accurate of all the king Arthur Legends, as far as describing the daily life, customs, and superstitions of the people of the period. It does not lionize the Knights of the Round Table, but at the same time it does not speak of them as savages, as some accounts do. Similarly, it makes the people out to be decent, simple, and yes, sheep, but not total fools. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur describes the time impartially, meticulously, and colorfully. There is not the element of glamorization just as there is not the element of degradation. Twain's use of the first-person narration makes the story more realistic; the people who are dying of small pox are horrifyingly well described, and the grandeur with the banners and shining armor at a joust is equally enticing. Most importantly, this book flows well: each event leads to the next, and it all fits together nicely. The twist that Twain puts on the end superbly concludes the story, and it makes you really think. The not-so-good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur does move slowly at times. Also, the main character, Hank Morgan, is excessively American. Twain really overuses the baseball metaphors, and Morgan's contempt for all forms of mysticism and non-scientific explanations of things damages the atmosphere of the book. His impatience with the people who do not understand his speech and ideas, and his general attitude of superiority make him slightly less likeable, and more difficult to pay attention to. It is sometimes hard to bear Hank Morgan's thoughtless destruction of 6th century culture, and his obsession with the wonder of technology. The sometimes absurdly long descriptions, vivid pictures of violence, and overall length of this book would make it difficult for people under about twelve or thirteen to enjoy. Mark Twain is sending several messages in writing this book. The first and perhaps most important is that attention should be paid to the way in which a culture develops. Hank ultimately destroys Arthurian England as it was know, because he advances only the parts of the culture that he personally believes to be important. Twain is saying that if we are not involved in our world, everything is out of our control, and we can only hope that the reins fall into the right hands. Morgan's downfall can be attributed to this and to the fact that he disbelieves all other powers besides science, and even more than disbelieves dismisses them. Another main point that this book incorporates is that no one power should be allowed to become too strong. Twain reinforces this point with the examples of the Church and of Hank Morgan. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur addresses issues that face Mark Twain's time and issues that face ours. It brings many ideas, messages, and themes together into a cohesive body. With Camelot as the backdrop, Morgan's story as the message and Twains engaging style as the messenger, this book is delightful."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A supervisor (Hank Morgan) in an arms factory in Connecticut is hit along the side of his head with a crowbar and wakes up to discover that he has traveled back in time to England when King Arthur ruled (the year given as 528). The Boss, as he is later known, saves himself from being executed by predicting a solar eclipse. He is made Arthur's minister and becomes an enemy of Merlin. He uses his knowledge of nineteenth-century technology to try and make life better in 6th-century England. But, when he attempts to improve the lot of the peasantry and to end the power of the Knights, he finds himself opposed by the aristocracy, Merlin, and the Church. This is a great satire and illustrates Twain's poor opinions of the aristocracy and of Kings and nobility (&quot;no ability&quot;). Interestingly, it is also the first time-traveling novel in which a character travels to a distant time. (In &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens (1843), the main character travels in time is limited to the periods in which he had actually lived.)

He travels back in time to the Middle Ages. He meets new people and pretends he is a magician since he knows so much about the future. He becomes a well known hero throughout the land. The book is pretty much about his successes and adventures as he learns about Medieval times. To me, I thought the book was more on the boring side, but I think someone older might enjoy it more since the book has more complicated events and words. I think it was too long and slow because it would use up pages and pages describing landscapes or how uncomfortable wearing armor is when all I really wanted to do was get to the real point of the story. Also, I don't think the characters were very exciting and interesting because they would never really act like a real person would act during a similar situation. Like how the main character, Hank Morgan, never really wondered how he got to be in the Middle Ages and how he never really missed the 1800's or thought about how he could go back. This all makes up why I don't like this book. So, if you're young and looking for some action or if you're old and looking for some adventure, I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I have always loved Mark Twain since reading Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer as a kid. At one point I had even memorized \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" as a seventh-grader in Catholic school. Twain has always held a sentimental place close to my heart, so when our book club chose to read and discuss A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, I was all for it.I had heard vaguely of Twain's atheist mindset and his antagonism toward religion in general. But until I read Connecticut Yankee, I had no idea how much irrational and unfounded antipathy Twain had for the Catholic Church in particular. The pervasive theme in Connecticut Yankee is that our modern enlightened world is far superior to that which went before and that the \\"bad old days\\" of slavery and oppression were almost completely the fault of the Catholic Church. This anti-Catholic sentiment can hardly be denied as Twain himself urged reviewers not to mention it when the book first came out. \\"Please don't let on that there are any slurs at the Church,\\" he told a sympathetic reviewer in the Boston Herald. \\"I want to catch the reader unawares, and modify his views if I can.\\"So Twain engaged in what we know today as the \\"last acceptable prejudice.\\" By way of a simple comparison, let us imagine that, instead of Catholics, Twain had chosen Jews, Mormons, or Evangelicals as the villains of Connecticut Yankee. Would it still occupy the exalted position it does as an American classic? Or would it be relegated to those dusty shelves where reside other scurrilous works or racist manifestos to be studied as a historical curiosity of a meaner age?For me, the most annoying aspect of Connecticut Yankee was Twain's almost total ignorance of history--or, perhaps more accurately, his decision to turn history on its head to better fit his polemical aims of blaming all the ills of society on the Catholic Church. This is a classic example of what happens, I suppose, when a journalist with a wide breadth of knowledge but no depth attempts to novelize about a historical subject. To address some of Twain's errors:1.) Slavery in antiquity was in no way the fault of the Church. That pernicious institution long predated Christianity and was endemic to classical pagan societies. Indeed, the Church has a long history of making the lot of slaves more tolerable and being among the premier abolitionist institutions in the world.2.) The idea that the Church suppresses intellectual freedom is a fable made up during the Protestant rebellion, though it is heartily embraced by Twain. Far more erudite scholars than I have examined this fallacy in detail, so rather than address this topic in detail here, I would point the reader to Tom Woods's excellent book,How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization.3.) Twain writes naively of democracy, putting in Hank Morgan's mouth the notion that \\"Where every man in a state has a vote, brutal laws are impossible.\\" One wonders what Twain would have made of our modern America, where not only every man, but every woman has a vote, and yet the ghastly practice of abortion is not only legal, but enshrined as a human right. Democracy of itself does not ensure enlightened government. Without the temper of religion, democracy is as likely to produce brutal and repulsive laws as the worst monarchy. De Tocqueville understood this. It's a wonder that Twain did not.There are many more, but this review is already more prolix that I had intended.As always, Twain's writing sparkles in Connecticut Yankee and his lampooning of the style of Mallory is very funny. His characters, however, viewed 120 years later, are crudely drawn. Hank Morgan is an Alger-esque self-made man whose compendious knowledge of all subjects is just a little too convenient. The legendary Arthurians are all soulless pawns that Twain moves around to further his polemic. No insight is offered into their characters at all. They are all cruel and completely self-serving--as they must be in Twain's mind because they belong to the aristocracy. The story ends on a bizarrely depressing note for a tale that was predominantly a humorous satire for the first seven-eighths of its length.In short, this is not a book I will be reading to my kids as a bedtime story. For me, it is to be considered a shameful period piece, written at a time when it was acceptable and even laudatory to be a Know-Nothing and make up slanders about the Catholic Church. That it is a cleverly-written slander is only another mark against it. Amusing slanders are pleasing to read but have the potential to do real harm both to the target and the reader."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Here is my review.You would have to be mentally ill to pay $12.00 for a book you can download for free.This book would have to be capable of doing my taxes for the asking price."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain, like Will Rogers is an American icon.

The ISBN number is 978-1613823774, and you can purchase it for around ten dollars online.This book is one of Mark Twain's easier reads, and is even an easy read despite being written by Twain. It is also one of the most intriguing books I have ever read.Hilarious does not even begin to describe this book. Mark Twain did an excellent job portraying the life of a Yankee being sent to live in the 12th century. The clothing and culture differences, and the large contrast between his modern innovation knowledge and the medieval world make for great laughs. Throughout the book the Yankee is criticizing the people he meets, while they're doing the same to him. He comments on their clothes, hair, dialect, and even the way the walk.Mark Twain made me think hard in this book with anecdotes and his sarcasm. It all made sense later in the book when he acknowledged and explained what he meant. Most authors would never do that, which makes the book easy to understand.I would recommend this book because it has hard facts, and is brilliantly written with a humorous tone."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Written by Mark Twain long after the age of steamboats, Life on the Mississippi paints a vivid picture of those wild days on the river.

The first half (or so) is autbiographical--about his learning to be a pilot before the Civil War. The second half is his return to the river in the early 1880s, with many observations about how it and the people who live on it have changed. Throughout, there are engaging anecdotes and stories, many of them mixing humor and horror, and these kept me going through the long stretches about how the river has changed its course through the decades. You can see how Vonnegut and Heller can be seen as Twain's descendents after reading the book--the occassionally morbid, satirical voice that seems to permiate American humor.All in all, a bit of a mixed bag, at least for me. Worth reading, but I wish I had skimmed more passages than I did!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This book is amusing in some of the same ways that Captain Stormfieldis amusing. A modern man of the time is placed in a different, strange,setting, and gets to make humorous observations about the natives,locals, functionaries and authority figures.Here, the device is time travel, plonking a 19th century American in the middle of a fantasy version of King Arthur's court."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Hank Morgan is a typical Connecticut resident living in the late eighteen-hundreds. He is a clever foreman and loves the technology of his time. One day while at work, Hank is hit with a crowbar and knocked out. When he is finally revived, he finds himself in Camelot in the year 528. Things seem pretty bleak for Hank, who is immediately taken prisoner by a knight and sentenced to die. He uses the knowledge that a solar eclipse is due in order to gain a reputation as a powerful magician, more powerful even than Merlin.Hank quickly adjusts to his position as adviser to King Arthur, and uses his expertise in the areas of science and engineering whenever he sees an opportunity. Soon all of Camelot is connected by telephones and telegraphs, trains are beginning to be built, and knights travel the countryside on bicycles. Hank introduces American systems of money and has plans to turn Camelot into a democracy after Arthur's death.But Hank has enemies, including Merlin and the church. These enemies are powerful and capitalize on the superstitions of the people living in Camelot.This was a very clever book, highlighting some of the weaknesses of a Medieval society, and the things a modern capitalist might do to improve them. Parts of it were slow, but it is a very old book, written in a different style than today's stories, so that is understandable."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I really liked this book very much.

It's amazing that Mark Twain did a time travel story in the 19th century that still mops the floor with nearly any time travel story since.Going into it, I expected something like Crichton's &#34;Timeline&#34;, but instead got something a lot closer to &#34;Dr. Who&#34;, less the back-and-forth control over the time traveling."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Premise is interesting but becomes tedious over the telling.

The battle in the closing chapters is spectacular. Gatling guns against a horde."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Who has not wondered what they would do if sent back centuries earlier armed with the knowledge of modern life? Mark Twain is perhaps the first writer (at least the first that I know of) who makes a serious effort (with much comedy thrown in) to consider this question.The main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the then modern age of the late 19th century into the land of Camelot, with King Arthur and his knights. Although the story is well known for the comedic stories within the book, less known is the author's serious statements about human frailties such as prejudice (this book is an outspoken criticism of slavery at a time when the Just Cause myth of the American south was getting its start), superstition, autocracy, blind reliance on tradition, etc. His severity against the Catholic church stings me because that is my faith, but when considering the history of the church and some of the atrocities committed by some church leaders, his denigration is not without some justification.There is much here for philosophical debate. Twain takes an anti-determinist view of what man is capable of accomplishing, but he is fatalistic about the ability of one person to make a lasting change. I think that he missed the point. Hank Morgan failed not so much because of the forces of custom or the clergy, but because he tried force cultural enlightenment. This is like expecting wisdom from ten year olds simply because they have the lessons of their elders available to them. Cultural improvement is a developmental process and comes from self awareness. The character would have also been improved if he had learned more of his own cultural shortcomings from involvement with this different society. Regardless, this is a highly enjoyable book that shows why it, and the author remains of interest over a century later.I disagree with the Editorial Review written by the School Library Journal that this book is recommended for as early as fifth grade. I believe that the subject matter would be better considered and discussed with those in later grades."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court written by Mark Twain is a superb work of literature. This Arthurian novel is different from others because the view point is not from anybody from the round table or that time. The protagonist, Hank Morgan is a blacksmith from 19th century Hartford, Connecticut when he gets hit on the head by a crowbar. Following the incident he is knocked unconscious and transported back in time in a fanciful, diluted dream. There he is taken to Camelot and imprisoned. During his death trial he tricks the court into thinking that he is a magician when he conjures an eclipse. In A Connecticut Yankee Hank rallies against feudalism and idle aristocracy. This novel has become one of my favorites, but I'd only recommend for the 14 or 15+ crowd for Twain's sense of humor and for the confusing Old English."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"\\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is one of those rarest literary treasures: a comedy that, for all it's hilarity, actually has both a heart and a brain. Not just a set of cheap laughs, as most comedy of any sort is, Mark Twain's classic novel enlightens as it entertains, throwing an unflinching spotlight on the darker elements of human nature both in the Utopian (to our eyes) Camelot and of modern capitalism and the American Dream.The plot is a familiar one in our age of sci-fi and fantasy, though it was innovative when Twain conceived it: Hank Morgan, an enterprising 19th-century engineer, is knocked unconscious and comes to in King Arthur's fabled Camelot. Bewildered but determined to make the best of the situation, Morgan uses his knowledge of history and mechanical skills to convince everyone he is a super-magician greater than even Merlin. Once ensconced as the King's right-hand man, Morgan sets about reforming the country into a republic, a sort of prototype America. Most of the book follows Morgan through a series of haphazard adventures which Twain uses to illuminate the great but often forgotten evils of the Dark Ages, including the abuses of the Catholic Church, the ignorant and useless ruling body that inevitably arises from a monarchy, and the pitiful working conditions of the medieval peasant or slave.Nor is Twain's critical eye trained only on the far-flung past. Though Morgan is essentially a sympathetic figure, he struggles to find anything the least bit admirable about the knights and nobles he must live with, and considers the chivalric code merely fit for derision. Meanwhile, Morgan's own capitalist code is in full effect, and he takes advantage of every opportunity to cash in his advanced education for the big bucks.Colorful and sublimely written, Twain's time-travel masterpiece is both a magical fantasy and a stinging dystopian satire. Don't be fooled by the several movie versions of this story, some of which are great fun in their own right. Yes, the novel is funny, often riotously so, but the humorous skin hides a deadly earnestness beneath, and the finale is far less optimistic than one who has first seen the film versions will doubtless expect. A deservedly immortal literary gem."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The book gives a humorous description of what would happen if a modern man was transported to the court of King Arthur. It had a realistic beginning. The part where he &quot;cloaks the sun&quot; to get out of being executed was done nicely also."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I'm only 14 years old, but I finished reading this book for my 8th grade English class about a week ago. The edition I have is 575 pages, but I went through it in about three weeks. It is an excellent, entertaining, very funny and thought-provoking book. I enjoyed it very much. If I had read the Canterbury Tales or some other book relating to the Middle Ages, it may have been pretty boring, but this, my first Mark Twain book and the longest I've ever read, was first-rate entertainment."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"If you are unacquainted with Twain's work, this is the ideal starting point. So much of his life was spent by and on the River that it has saturated into many of his greatest works such as Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. His years training as a riverboat pilot (when the pilot was in charge, not the captain) and, years later, his visit to the same towns and cities provide a stunning portrait of how the River played a major role in shaping America. No one has the wit, charm and command of language of Twain."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In this wonderful book, Mark Twain blends humor and suspense wonderfully. The main character, Hank Morgan, is knocked over the head with a crowbar and is somehow transported back to the sixth century during King Arthur's reign. Taking advantage of the superstitiousness of the people, he saves himself from death at the stake by predicting an eclipse. He earns a position secondary to the king and displays nineteenth century technology to the inhabitants. During his stay in Camelot, Hank learns that monarchy, the Established Church, and knight errantry must come to an end. To help create this wonderful work of literature, Twain gives the characters a definite personality to help describe them. The suspense certainly adds to the reader's interest. This is a book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I hear the word boring used quite often these days. We have more and more things to entertain us, yet feel more bored than ever. As I looked over some of the reviews of the classic books including this one, I noticed how often the word boring was used when describing a book. I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used to describe anything, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This novel by Mark Twain tells the story of a man who is swept back in time to the Dark Ages, the supposed period that Arthur and his round table existed. The story seems light hearted and fun throughout most of the text, but it was also written to make apparent the problems of medieval socity, specifically the form of government, which was feudalsim. Fuedalism's downfalls are thoroughly ecplored all throughout the novel by hank Morgan, the main character, as he thoughout the land trying to show the people of the time how wrong the way they live is. mark twain's writin style comes through very stronglyin thsi novel. Like many of his other books (Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn) CYKAC at first glance looks and reads like a children's story. but as further reading and closer study show this is not correct. Several times very graphic descriptions of death and fighting are used and many of the issues addressed by Twain take a knowledgeable mind to be comprehended. This style of writing is misleading at times, because of the way the author describes people and things in a light hearted an almost comical manner. He also labels characters throughout the story with odd names and titles. The light-hearted nature soon fades away when the author paints a picture of families being separated by slavery or the injustice of the Church to the people it is supposed to serve. Twain's writing style may be misleading, but it adds flavor and diversity to the text that is hard to find in other novels. The story That Twain writes is really a parody of the Arthurian legends we all know. Twain keeps the same names and positions of the characters, but completely changes their personalities from what we are used to. Many times when a character is into\\\\roduced it is shocking to think of them the way Twain wants us too. But what he really is doing is showing us realistically what King Arthur and his knights would be like if they had existed in medieval times. The author's perception of the characters real, more human selves was believable, but in contrast the exploits of hank Morgan were astronomicaly unbelievable. hank's adventures throughout the kingdom were entertaining, but were bogged down by the issues that the author wanted to bring across to the reader. more comic relief was needed to keep the reader from becoming depressed and to keep the story moving. Over all CYKAC was fun to read and well written, even though it could have done without some of the lectures and soul grabbing that the author throws at you. The ideas taht Hank comes up with are fascinating and totally unbelievalbe, but I still enjoyed them. The change in the characters personalities were a welcome change form the traditional &quot;knights in shining armor&quot; mold used in many other Arthur novels. It gave the story a new boost and helped separate it from the rest of the Arthurian legends. At times it may have been slow, but the freshness and diversity of the book kept me from putting it down, and I think you to will agree with me if you decide to read this novel"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The story of Hank Morgan, the plucky supervisor in a gun factory in the late 1800s, who is knocked out and wakes up under a tree in the times of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. He is promptly captured and condemned to death, but saves his neck through his knowledge of a solar eclipse in the 6th century, which happens to occur the following day. He plays this to his advantage along with his knowledge of 19th century technology and quickly gains a reputation as a magician more powerful than Merlin. He becomes known as \\"The Boss\\" and secures a place in the government of King Arthur and sets about secretly to change the primitive and savage ways of the people, even daring to challenge \\"the Church\\" (the Catholic Church) and trying to institute modern freedoms.The satire is classic Mark Twain, and the situations Hank finds himself in (and his responses to them) are often very humorous. The story, however, was obviously meant as a more serious criticism of the idea of monarchy and especially of the abuses of religion when there is no freedom to choose. While I have no complaint with his logic and reasoning, I found it tiresome to continually read his folksy diatribes on the concepts of noble birth or religion - especially when the same argument popped up so often. What started out as an amusing tale became rather boring when the story stopped for these editorials. In the end, it just wasn't a very endearing story; funny and interesting at times but not enough to warrant a full four stars - call it 3 and a half."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain (1835-1910) grew up along the banks of the Mississippi River, and he captures the feel of the mighty river during the steamboat era in this superb narrative and memoir. I particularly liked the earlier chapters, as Twain describes his youthful tutelage as an aspiring steamboat pilot in the years before the Civil War. Readers see what it was like guiding a steamboat over a river full of dangerous snags and sandbars - in clear daylight, through thick fog, and on moonless nights. The author then jumps ahead to his middle age - describing life along the river and in the South after the Civil War, and including politics, epidemics, and the supplanting of steamboats by railroads. The book's second half lacks a bit of the magic found earlier, but remains eminently readable and informative. This is a remarkable narrative by a great writer."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I read this book when I was young and going through a Mark Twain phase. I enjoyed it. I re-read it when I was in the Peace Corps serving overseas, and I was struck by two things: First, Samuel Clemens understood the world in such an extraordinary way that, at times, he must have felt like a voice in the wilderness (yet, he was willing to share himself with the world). Second, if you are going to go live in someone else's world, you must realize neither you nor those around you will ever be the same...growth, change, challenge can be incredibly beneficial, but you will lose some part of yourself and take something away from others.I'll be reading this again throughout my life. I can only imagine what else I will learn."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"It is not Twain's best book, and certainly not the same as something like Huckleberry Finn, however this is highly recommended reading. The satire is excellent, and although some people who may be a little too serious about Arthurian legends may not appreciate it, I certainly did. Based on this book I would guess that Mark Twain would've been the among the best, and definitely the funniest, science fiction writers of all time if he had decided to follow that path. This book is great for anyone who loves the humor of Mark Twain."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Wow! That is the one word I have for this book, Wow. Twain once again shows that he is utterly and purely a genius in disguise. Our character is carried from the 19th century all the way back to the 6th century by a blow in the head. A man used to telephones, cigars and newspapers he is completely and utterly suprised by the simpleness and ignorance of mankind in the 6th century.After escaping from a fiery death using his knowledge of eclipses, he emerges from King Arthurs castle hailed as the greatest and most powerful magician that ever lived, he sets out to try to \\"modernize\\" Camelot. With the help of Clarence, a trusty righthand man that he met while he was a prisoner he sets up a telephone system, introduces a newspaper, starts a line of advertising, tries to convince the populace to use soap, along with many other things. Our character also takes part in some very distructive things like trying to overthrow the Church and the King, he even thinks of becoming president one day.Not everyone becomes his friend however, there is one guy in particular who is not so keen on the idea of him becoming \\"The Boss\\". His name is Merlin and he used to be a wonderfully respected magician until our character came along. Now everyone has lost interest in him because they have mover on to bigger and better magicians. Merlin shows contemt and disdain several times throughout the book, trying to win back his title. He never suceeds which I found quite humorous.In conclusion I did like this book because it was witty and slightly far-fetched. The idea of a telephone system, a printing press or the King riding a bicycle is simply prepsterous and therefore humorous. To put it simply, I loved this book because I got a kick out of it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Almost all of the novel features the narration of Hank Morgan, a foreman at a weapons factory in Connecticut who in the year 1879 is hit on the forehead by a crowbar by one of his unruly workers. When Hank wakes up he finds himself in England in the Sixth Century where King Arthur reigns.He is captured by a knight, brought to Arthur's castle and it is determined that he should be executed for he seems to be some strange demon sorcerer, what with his 19th century clothes and speech. But he just happens to be in possesion of the knowledge that on that particular day on which he finds himself in the sixth century, a total eclipse is going to occur. Of course, 6th century England dosen't know anything about eclipses and thinks such natural occurances are the work of various demon sorcerors or signs of god's anger and so on. Hank threatens to use his powers of sorcery to cause the sun to be completely blotted if they go through with his execution. The eclipse occurs and the people in the court are thus flabbergasted. King Arthur makes Hank his Prime Minister and Hank uses his political powers over the next decade or decade and a half to use his elementary knowledge of late 19th century technology and institutions to reform Arthur's kingdom. He introduces telephones, telegraphs, grammar schools, military academies, newspapers. He tries to reduce the barbaric oppression of the serfs and slaves. He tries to introduce enlightenment ideals in the country. He successfully discredits Merlin, the charlatan court magician, in part by pretending to perform miracles, using his knowledge of electricity and construction of munititions. 6th century England, of course is completely ignorant of all these technologies and so takes Hank's use of them as evidence of his extraordinary supernatural powers. He blows up Merlin's castle. At one popular monestary, the monks and nuns are terrified because the water in their very large indoor pool has been reduced by a large amount. They think the reduction has happened because of God's displeasure with them for engaging in the decadent and self-gratifying act of bathing in the pool but Hank discovers that the water is leaking out the bottom of the pool where some bricks have loosened. He constructs a big scene to reveal his miracle, including fireworks which the people have never seen before and the loud sounds and explosive lights he explains are the evil spirit being expunged from the monastery that was allegedly restricting the water level in the lake. This alleged miracle gives Hank the credibility he needs to convince the monks that they could bathe without retribution from God.There is much critique in the narration from Hank on the social, economic and political conditions in Arthur's England. He reports on the conditon of the serfs. What little income such as from the produce that they create on their own plots, is stolen by taxes and as tribute by the nobility and the church. The feudal lords drive their serfs to starvation, disease and death so that they, the lords can live luxurious lives without working themselves. The lords execute or imprison serfs who get too uppity or refuse orders to have their daughters be sexually abused or often times for no reason at all. Hank works to try to release some of the prisoners, whose minds have all been deostroyed by their experience, in the castles of the nobles. The serfs and the slaves, the vast majority of England's population have been trained by centuries of oppression to be mentally docile. They think they deserve to be slaves and think their oppression is the way things should be. Hank notes in relation to this, how the world has traditionally recoiled at the execution of about 10,000 rich people during the French Revolution's \\"Reign of Terror.\\" But there was an incomparably greater terror which affected hundreds of millions of french peasants who suffered a reign of terror lasting many centuries as they were starved and robbed and worked to death by the aristocracy.Hank tries to introduce the elements of the Enlightenment. He tries slowly and subtly to spread the idea that the English nobility has illegitimate power and that the people deserve to control their own destiny. He tries in the same way to inculate a basic spirit of independent thinking, to undermine the spirit of submission to authority. Hank writes that in his opinion true patriotism is quite the opposite of submission to governmental institutions and the laws. Institutions and laws grow outdated, tyranical and ineffective and people who do not voice their opinion about the need to change such things are not true patriots. He succesfully undermines the barbaric and silly custom of knight errantry--he gradually converts the knights into travelling salesman for soap and the other things he is trying to encourage. He fights a bunch of the nights towards the end of the book while wearing gymnastic tights and using a gun and lasso.The end of the story brings a sort of twist and one fully understands the satire as it relates to Hank's vanity and overconfindence in his late 19th century intellect and technological know-how.This a good story, very well written, intelligent, amusing and every so often something comes up in it that makes you laugh out loud.There may be a few minor mechanical problems with the flow of the story, such as one or two actions not being fully accounted for. The last part of the episode where King Arthur and Hank get taken as slaves is kind of rushed through."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"'Connecticut Yankee' is an excellent political satire still relevant to today's world. Everyone's heard of it, and it's been spoofed many times in film. However, few people have read it and they're missing a treat. Mark Twain is one author whose works consistently remain applicable to modern society. 'Yankee' is funny, interesting and highly worth your time."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Summary:Hank Morgan is a fiery shop boss in the Colt Arms Factory in New England during the late 1800s when he is knocke unconscious by another worker who gets the better of him during a fight. When Hank wakes up, he finds himself in Britain during the 7th century C.E. in the time of King Arthur. As it just so happens, before Hank can be burned at the stake for threatening to blot out the sun, the solar eclipse he predicted takes place and everyone in King Arthur's royal court cowers at his command. Hank is given what was formerly Merlin the Magician's position as chief executive and renamed The Boss. The Boss then begins to reform ancient Britain, introducing dynamite, fireworks, bicycles, electricity, telephones, etc.But, as is only becoming of someone of his rank, he must inevitably go on a quest. It just so happens that a damsel in distress, Sandy, has come a-calling and has a mission for a knight. So, Hank embarks on a journey with Sandy and returns victoriously having saved a pen of pigs that used to be a queen and maidens but was mysteriously transformed, though only Sandy knows this.Hank continues with his plans of reforming Britain, but lets slip another plan to the King that he wants to secretly go among the peasants as a commoner himself. The King likes the idea and signs on. They embark on a series of adventures that end with both of them being sold into slavery and very nearly being hung.Due to a misheard comment several years earlier, Hank is forced to battle another knight who was offended by the remark. In an effort to crush the ancient norms of chivalry, Hank not only battles the knight (using a lasso), but challenges all of the knighthood of Britain. His challenge pays off when he pulls out his six-shooters and lays waste to ten of the knights, the rest breaking ranks and running.After this incident, three years of bounty follow during which Hank's reforms become common place - except in the Catholic Church. Ultimately Hank is deceived by the Church, King Arthur is betrayed by his son Mordred and the greatest knight of England, Lancelot, who has been in love with Guinevere for ages. When all of this comes to a head, both Mordred and Arthur are dead and the nation is without leadership except for the Church.Of course Hank can't let this situation stand. Gathering up his very best men, he destroys his wonderful factories and holes up in a cave. The last of the knights, totaling some thirty-thousand, come against him and 53 of his best men (52 and Clarence). Nearly all of the knights are destroyed. But what Hank and Clarence hadn't considered is what the decaying men's bodies would do to them seeing as how they can't leave the cave.In the end, Merlin, the magician that has plagued Hank since his arrival, sneaks into the cave disguised as a woman and casts a spell on Hank, causing him to sleep for 13 centuries or until his own time again. After the spell, Merlin is killed and the story ends.My Comments:There is no doubt in my mind that Samuel Clemens is one of the greatest writers of all time. This book is not only superbly written, but absolutely hilarious and remarkably insightful. Some of Clemens' insights into humanity are astonishing.The story itself is pretty good, though the ending is a little bit well, open. You aren't sure exactly what happened, though you have a pretty good idea. I would love to read something about 'the writing of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court', it likely draws upon Rip Van Winkle as well as numerous other writers and writings of the day.There is also a lot of commentary about the Catholic Church and its oppressive nature. Whether this is based in early American anti-Catholic sentiment or just plain anti-religious sentiment, I don't know (both are possibilities considering the time period). Perhaps the aforementioned book about this book, when written, will answer that question. I chose to look at it as anti-religious sentiment and thoroughly enjoyed it throughout.Overall, this book is a definite must read for everyone. I recall having read a children's shortened version when I was about ten, but reading in its original form is a treat. Read this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Although this book's concept is no longer novel - one may now even call it clich&eacute; - its \\"time travel\\" aspect was - at least in the sense that it is used in this novel - a fairly new concept in fiction at the time Twain wrote it. No less a science fiction authority than Robert A. Heinlein even goes so far to say that Twain \\"invented\\" the time travel story. Now, this is certainly stretching the truth a bit, but one can see how Heinlein was heavily influenced by Twain from reading this book. This novel's time travel aspect is not used for science fiction; no, it is a purely satirical vehicle. Twain transplants an \\"aw shucks\\", no nonsense American smack dab in the middle of The Dark Ages. By having his character attempt to transplant American ideas of technology, government, and morals into this staunch, backward (anyway, by our standards) British society, Twain is clearly forging an attack upon monarchy - which he once called \\"surely the grotesquest swindle ever invented by man.\\" That said, we see from the devastating ending (which surely no one who has read this book wasn't surprised by) that the book is as much a satire on American arrogance and idealism as it is on the British. One may not always agree with Twain's politics, but one must at least respect them. He also demonstrates in this book the oft-forgotten truism that one's tribal customs are not the laws of nature - and what business do we have trying to force ours upon anyone else's? A devastating satire all around."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is definately a departure from what one might consider &quot;normal&quot; literature, exploring the possibilities of a regular man going back in time to visit the grand kingdom of Camelot. The story starts with a man telling of a fight in a factory in which he was foreman, and how he was knocked out. Upon waking he was in the land of Camelot, though he didn't realize it. Being put up for burning, he used his knowledge of the past to save his skin, using an eclipse to bestow his &quot;magical powers.&quot;This display was extremely impressive for the people of the day, who that main character described as a childish race, always exaggerating tales for their own glory. After being given all the power in the land, next to the king of course, he set out on a quest to bring the land of camelot into the realm of the modern with such things as the telephone and telegraph, the railroad, and steamboats. All these monumental changes in the world were taking place without the general public's knowledge of it, and was gradually being mixed into the culture, in the main character's goal of removing chivalry from the cultural mix.After performing several &quot;miracles&quot; to his people, and going off on several grand adventures, the main character has the church turn on him, and try to bring the entire populous back to its simpler time, of swords, castles, damsels in distress, and the quest way of life. That is where I leave it up to you to find out the rest of the plot, if you really want to read it.In my overall opinion, the book seems to be rushed by Mark Twain, where he tries to mix his general opinions of humanity, his ideas for its future, and just a fun story line all in one, too quickly. The story unfolds hurridly and seems to lack direction at times, and needs a bit more development. A great read if for enjoyment, but don't use it for your overall future plan for humanity, as it is a bit lacking there.This book will likely appeal to school kids in the middle to high school range, because of its fair amount of depth and hidden meaning, but will also enjoy quite a good story, and a fair bit of insight as to what life was like back in the old days. It seems that Mark Twain had done a fair bit of research as to what life was in the age of Camelot before having gone out to write this book. Almost everybody will enjoy this, even if for no particular academic reason. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"&quot;Life On the Mississippi&quot; is Mark Twain's tribute to the Mississippi River, which surrounded the earlier part of his life. Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life. For those who are just getting interested in knowing about Mark Twain's writings, I would recommend reading &quot;Roughing It&quot;; as it is humurous throughout. &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; would be the second book I would recommend."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"What else can be said about Twain except great story. Imaginative work paralleling medieval England with Industrial America in the lat 19th century. Witty, adventurous and well written. I have yet to read a Twain book I disliked."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an intriguing novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. I am a freshman in high school, and I enjoyed many attributes of the plot and writing style. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize it's faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time were very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it be a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way which puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"You think that you would know what to expect from Twain after having read much of his fiction, but that just isn't the case. After having read this book, I am convinced that, had Twain put his mind to it, he could have written about two snails racing and it would have been funny, interesting, and enthralling. I just could not put this book down, as I realized that the only thing better than Mark Twain's fiction is wondering about how real his nonfiction is! Twain's humor never fails him. I have never encountered a book that is so mentally involving, yet so relaxing. I say \\"involving\\" because Twain seems to use just the right words and phrases to stimulate the imagination. My recommendation is to grab yourself a hammock, set it up next to a river or stream, and sip on lemonade while reading and chuckling. This book provided me with a few of my best spent hours on a summer's day that I could imagine. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"To me, this book seemed like several rather disjointed chunks of writing about Twain's Mississippi experience. I don't know what happened. Maybe he compiled all his scraps of material about this period and threw them together, not bothering with transitions or filling in gaps, or smoothing out the narrative flow.In any case, I found the writing delightful and in places laugh-aloud funny. I even typed out several large passages in a letter I was writing to my brother. The letter must have taken me an hour to write but I just had to share those passages with someone. That's how good Twain is. You want to share him with others who enjoy fine writing.I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say this is Twain's finest book. But it is well worth reading and it lays out in detail perhaps the cross section of Twain's life that he enjoyed most."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"My first copy of this absorbing work was a small, compact edition published by the Oxford University Press. I read it by candle-light and found myself borne into another world, transported. In the early chapters, Twain focuses on his introduction to steamboating - he wears his YOUTH on his sleeve, recounting his cub-piloting experiences with the delight of a child. In the latter chapters, set in the post Civil-War era, Twain focuses on his returning impressions - he wears his HEART on his sleeve, remembering the world of his youth, burdened by sweet nostalgia, and a sense of finality and loss. If you have ever been young, you will laugh, and if you have a heart, you will probably shed a tear. No other writer in American literature has so completely combined a genius for wit and humanity. This is one of those rare books that can be read more than once, and enjoyed even more the second time."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"He picks you up off the spot where you are sitting and places you standing on the deck of a Mississippi riverboat in pre-Civil War America. His writing craft is so vivid, detailed, and compelling that you feel as if you yourself have followed each bend and turn, avoided each logjam, and squinted over the bow each starlit night of a journey down the mighty Mississippi River. Additionally, he adds context to the voyage, in the form of digressions about the times, the way peole thought and acted, real items from newspapers of the era, and his own opinions and observations of human nature. It is not a novel. It is non-fiction, but it's writing style makes it as readable as a novel. It was pure pleasure"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Was Twain the greatest writer America ever produced? Certainly no other author has written so many genres so well. Life on the Mississippi is one of my favorites by Twain. What a storyteller! From his own personal experiences to explorers, psychics, the Civil War, slavery, geography, steamboat history etc. Twain gives us a glimpse into himself and his country.Twain is of course humorous in this book, but his lesser known quality--insight--is very keen in this book. Twain's style is at once sophisticated and simple. It is pure mastery.While this may not be up there with some of other Twain's writings, it is certainly worth the time and money. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"It was one of Arthur C. Clarke's laws that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Mark Twain predated Clarke by several decades, but he seemed well aware of the idea behind the law, as demonstrated by his novel, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.The title character is Hank Morgan, a late-19th-century New Englander who - by a blow to the head - is transported back to Camelot. This is no mere dream, however; it appears Morgan is actually there. He quickly learns that all is not nearly romantic as the tales of Arthur and chivalry might suggest; instead, this is a land of ignorance, violence and oppression.Morgan's technological and scientific know-how makes him appear to be a great wizard, much more respectable than the flim-flamming Merlin. First by taking advantage of a convenient solar eclipse, Morgan is soon elevated to being Arthur's prime minister, and starts a process of transforming Old England into New England. Paradoxes don't seem much of a concern.This novel - one of the earliest time travel stories - is an often clever satire with many targets, particularly slavery and caste systems, economics, religion (particularly Catholicism) and the idea of chivalry. Only the most basic framework of the Arthurian legends are \\"true\\" in this book. Where the book is a bit weak is when it gets too talky; there are also not many interesting characters outside of Hank himself. Overall, this is a good book, but it is not Twain's best."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"\\"Life on the Mississippi\\" by Mark Twain is no doubt a classic memoir from the Civil War generation. Although Twain was smart enough not to remain with the southern armies for more than a few weeks, his life is still very much part of that era. His most famous book, \\" The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" (which was inspired by the trip along the Mississippi river described in this book), is considered one of the first books which touches upon the racism of the south and its often backward traditions. Twain's work is unique because he is not a northerner like Harriet Beecher Stowe, heralding the inequities of southern life without really living in that region. Twain was from the border state of Missouri.He certainly embodied the divided feelings of his homeland in regards to the times. As witnessed in the book, there is much reverence and nostalgia for the old south along the river that Twain knew so well, but he is able to poke fun at its eccentricities with a wit that perhaps was Twains defining feature as a writer. The sense of personal conflict is a classic point of reference for most writers to the point of sounding clich&eacute;, but Twain's writing is the model from which the clich&eacute;s are derived.The main impetus behind Twain's journey is chronicled in his pages, which is his comparison of life before and after the war. Just as Huckleberry Finn was written twenty years after the war, this book could have only been composed after a considerable interval of time. It is both Twain's memoir of his life as a steamboat pilot and retrospective of the glory days on the river upon returning there in the early 1880's. The steamboat trade is a shadow of its former self as river commerce had been replaced by the railroads. In these shadows Twain writes of all sorts of tales and memories of each part of the river as he travels along it, often concealing his true identity for the sake of getting objective information. The reader can see right away that there is a fondness for tall tales and exaggerations amongst the river folk, as many romanticize the past. Twain's writing seems quite level headed throughout, as he is able to sort through the \\"river lore\\" and relate the important and practical aspects of river travel to the reader (but that is not to say that he is exempt from embellishing to keep the reader on his toes).One aspect of the writing that I thought interesting was Twain's focus upon the practical details of his early days as a steamboat pilot's apprentice. When many think of Mark Twain, romantic notions of travel and freedom are brought to mind, but Twain's first 100 pages is all about the skills of the trade in an ever changing river. The flawless memory needed for the job was quite impressive and no doubt fed his ability to recall his life's work later on. Many forget the man's practicality, which gave him unique insight into the social milieus that he often lampooned or mocked.The mix of personal memoir and river history is done seamlessly, as Twain's early memories are intertwined with certain portions of the river. Just as an aging man looks upon his youth with fondness, Twain recalls the exciting days on the steamboats, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a youth and culture that have passed into history."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"From what I've read, The Prince and the Pauper was Twain's first foray into historical fiction. He clearly reused one of the major themes from that book in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which was published seven years later - that of a royal who gets a chance to see how the other half lives. In the earlier book, the prince and a young beggar exchange clothes for fun. In this book, it probably isn't realistic to make a full-grown man exchange clothes with another for the fun of it, so Twain gives the somewhat flimsy excuse that the protagonist (who has become the king's right-hand man after traveling back in time) has decided to go see the kingdom in disguise, and the king has decided to go with him. There was almost no more discussion of it than that - I don't think Twain ever mentioned whether the rest of the king's court knew what he was doing. Certainly no search parties are ever sent for him, but it's strange that everyone would let him just go off with basically no protection.In any case, Twain's dislike of sixth-century England is very clear, although, he has ascribed many social behaviors to it that did not actually occur at that time. He even admits to this in a strange preface. At one point, he says, \\"Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement the one and only actually great man in that whole British world.\\" Now, I understand that the protagonist, being from 19th century England, has thirteen centuries of knowledge more than the \\"children\\" he references, but it's still pretty pompous to claim that much advantage over an entire kingdom.The protagonist finds the king extremely stupid and doesn't miss an opportunity to mention it. The protagonist himself does a number of stupid things, including getting himself and the king sold into slavery, but somehow those are just little mistakes; whereas the king's inability to pretend to be a commoner because he has really never had the opportunity or reason to study one, of course, proves that the king is an idiot. In The Prince and The Pauper, the prince returns to his throne with a greater knowledge of his people and rules that much better for it. In this book, the king returns to his throne and then Twain is a little too busy with creating a way for his protagonist to get back to the nineteenth century to really discuss what happens to the king after his escapades.This was fun to read but personally, I prefer The Prince and the Pauper."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The book A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain is told from the view of Hank Morgan, later on known as The Boss. Hank Morgan travels back in time from the 19th century to the 5th century, in King Arthur's Court. Hank learns from a man dress in a knight's armor that it is the 5th century, he doesn't believe that he traveled back in time, he thinks he is in an asylum. Suddenly Hank remembers that the day that he was told also happened to be the same day of the first recorded full Solar Eclipse. Hank finds that he has wandering into a place where they are hanging innocent people. Hank has some fun and tells the people that he will put the world into total darkness very soon, he hopes that if it truly is the 5th century, the people will believe him. Sure enough the eclipse does happen, all the people are in awe. For the rest of the book Hank is then on known as The Boss.Throughout the whole story, Hank gives King Arthur tips about how to be more successful. Hank goes on a venturous journey with King Arthur and he helps the King train Knights and create a large army. Hank gets a seat at the round table even though he is not a knight. Hank uses his knowledge to reinvent things that were a new invention from his time. After King Arthur dies, Hank must help the empire live on.I recommend this to people who are 13 or older and enjoy long, very detailed books. There are also some great pictures included in the book, from portraits of Mark Twain to pictures of King Arthur pulling the sword from the stone."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Language difficult for my 13 year old."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I thought this novel was a good book and anyone that has read about King Arthur and liked it would like this book.

Still it is worthwhile reading for any Twain fan."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I thought that the book, if taken at face value, was just another so-so medieval tale. I may have thought that Twain was simply trying to relate the way people were in medieval times to the typical 19th &quot;centurian.&quot; However, I realize that Twain must have been well studied in Medieval philosphy and life.

Outstanding!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This action adventure drama is a Mark Twain tale of a troubled man redirecting his life the fit the sixth century lifestyle. Written from his pen at the low point of his career, Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee was unorganized, and is unable to hold one's attention.After being forcefully struck on the head by a not so gentle tool, Hank Morgan awakes with the realization that he is not in Kansas any more, in fact he is not in Connecticut either. He opens his eyes as a distraught stranger who has collided with a new age of unworldly elements, known as the sixth century. Coming from nineteenth century America, he is only equipped with confusion and bewilderment. Although throughout his existence in his present setting he learns that he possesses the power of knowledge and experience that he has involuntarily drawn from the well of the future. Stealthily using this to his advantage he quickly works his way up Camelot's socioeconomic ladder he then takes a position among the sixth century's finest.Almost immediately after acquiring his coveted political stature Hank is questioned of his worth. He is challenged with a knightly quest. Adventure arouses when he nobily accepts this journey. On the way he partners with a disarranged, yet flamboyant, long-winded maiden who shares Hank's company, while ruining his silence throughout their quarry. All through Hank's entity in the sixth century he indirectly influences the people with his foreign knowledge, all the while going through life altering experiences that will be impressed upon his mind for the rest of his days.It is obviously shown that Mark Twain was in an unhappy stage of his life while composing this peace. Do not be disillusioned by past reputations. The strong and healthy characters, depthful plots, and striking adventure are absent in this book. The story gave a feeling of gloomy misery, and anger. The climax and conclusion were blunt and quite unsatisfying, leaving the reader not only needing more, but wanting a plot as well. Packed with interesting yet depressing insights to mankind, and the actuality of the often glorified Camelot, the story does leave one thinking. Although all the while giving the reader a stale and dismal reaction. Consistently questioning the reader's interest, this book is graced with an unconcluded and depressing response."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"&quot;A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court&quot; is about Hank Morgan, a man who goes back in time to Camelot, and takes over using his knowledge of the future, and science. I did not like this book at all. It had no description, and I could hardly understand it. It had no description at all. At one point, Hank-the main character-complains that no one ever uses any description. Here is a passage from the book. &quot;Sir Gewaine went a-journeying, and fell upon Sir Kay. He smote Sir Kay down, off his horse. He went farthe and fell upon Sir Galahad. Sir Galahad smote Sir Gewaine with his sword. Then Sir Galahad went further down the road and smote down Sir James.&quot; Everyone in the book talked in either Old English, using words like prithee, thoust, and other confusing words, or they talked in 1800's Yokel Tawk.

Throughout the years he invents things we have today, but they didn't have back then. He also educates and helps people of the kingdom and becomes a knight himself. I found the book to be time-consuming and dull because nothing ever eventful happened and the old English they used made it hard to comprehend. They did not have a lot of big events at all. All he did was talk, talk, and talk about what he was going to do. It would have been more stimulating if they described when he was fighting, exploring, or helping others. Another thing that made it boring was that they used old English. It baffled me when they would say &quot;thou are pithy&quot;.

He stereotypes shamelessly throughout this book. And despite the fact that both the narrator and people who read this book seem to assert that this tale is set in the 6th century it absolutely is not. You did not have castles, titled lords and ladies, a powerful Roman Catholic church, and French sounding names in 6th century Britain! Had Mr. Twain been more balanced in his writing and more historically factual I personally would have found this book a great deal more readable. A story about someone in the 19th century transported to a time and place where Britons and Anglo-Saxons were fighting for control of the land would have been even more fascinating.

And doesn't a pilot stand at the wheel and gently guides his craft down and back. Ha. Twain's description of the Mississippi River is a voluptuous exploration of his lifetime love, and of American history as well, and the complexity of it is astounding. There's a scene at the beginning where cub pilot Twain is being quizzed by his mentor on previous sightings on the river. Twain cannot remember a single piece of information. His mentor cusses him and asks why he thinks he was telling him them. Twain replies sheepishly that perhaps he was trying to entertain him.

I expected to like it. It's got many of my favorite ingredients - time travel, satire, Britain, but I kept finding it falling flat.Part of the reason is that there is no clear setting. I think this may have been on purpose, maybe to ingrain (or prop up) the author's desire to juxtapose the two societies, so that the reader can never be too sure that a comment is applicable to then or now. Another thing I disliked was the Boss. He is our main character, and he's supposed to be our link and guide to what is good and lacking between the two societies. Instead he's an unreliable narrator, more guilty of the crimes than the people he attacks.An added point, that I don't think is necessarily inherent in the novel, but one that kept occurring to me as I read, was the question of whether we are actually more intelligent now than in the past. it may seem that we are, because we have the accumulated knowledge of all those that went before us, but are we really smarter? Are we smarter than Twain? King Arthur? Oommgogutuktuk at the discovery of fire? And add to that the particular sharpened stick of hindsight? Would we fare better with our big brains and our racial memories at any time before us?

As it says in the introduction, this is a great 'hodgepodge' of a book,being statistical journelese one moment,then pure Twain the next,and its this pure Twain that keeps you on board reading even the appendices at the end!Its obvious Twain couldn't stand the twee 'Merry England' novels of Sir Walter Scott,which no doubt he deplored as a boy,but I think he's dragging us into one of his famous exagerations when he blames Scott, not only for the outdated chivelry nonsense that plagued the Southern sensibilities of his day,but also for being the fundamental cause of the civil war!! As I say, pure Twain!I guess if we went back to the days of 'sexist' literature-'Boy's' books and 'Girl's' books-'Life on...' would be a boys book,but it is also a fascinating piece of historical reading; Twain looking back on a bygone era whilst we today read his 130 year old account of things.And when looking back on historical times,who better to read than someone who was there? Who better to read than Mark Twain?"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This item arrived in excellent condition.

This novel is no exception as Twain strikes the balance between the two again here. The premise for this novel is perhaps Twain's most original idea (when did Tom Sawyer ever time travel?) and the story and characters satisify at every turn. While this isn't Twain's best work, I think that some of his funniest moments are in this novel. I recommend Tom Sawyer as the place to begin reading Twain, but if you are already a fan then this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I remember I loved reading Tom Sawyer when I was a kid and I continued reading him in college. So when I started reading this, I had high expectations - not disappointed. This story is waaaaay ahead of its time in terms of morality and the social order. There's also a subdued hilarity that sometimes isn't so subdued as the main character will voice criticism or state his views on a wide variety of subjects. Twain wrote this in 1899 but it sounds like something you would hear from someone a 100 years later. It could just be timeless.

The beginning of the book had a very interesting attention grabber. Hank Morgan, the main character, was at the colt factory where he worked when he got into a heated fight with a co-worker, Hercules. Hank then got hit in the head with a crowbar, passed out, and awoke to find himself in 6th century England. This introduction to the book made for a real page turner.I also liked the ways that Hank fooled everyone throughout the story with his \\"magic\\". Everyone thought he was a sourcerer because they thought he made the sky completely black, where as it was really a luner eclipse that he knew was going to happen from being from the future. He also said that he could blow up Merlins Tower by fire sent from the sky, but he really used explosives. He used his knowledge and newer inverntions to his advantage when he went back in time because they were things people from 6th century England never knew about.Mark Twain also used a lot of imagery in this book. I feel that it gave a better understanding of what was going on and it made the book exciting to read.One of the reason I only gave this book four stars is because I didn't like Hank and Merlins relationship. I think they should have gotten along instead of fighting and butting heads throughout the whole story. Mark Twain waited until the end of the story for them to get along whereas if he had done so sooner, the two of them would have gotten more accomplished throughout the story.The other thing i didn't like about the book was Hank and Sandie's kids name, \\"Hello-Central\\". To me there seemed to be an unclear meaning behind the name and i'm really not sure why that name was chosen. I think there could have been a better plot behind it or a better name could have been chosen.All in all, I think this is a wonderful book for anyone with an imagination to read and I would definatly recomend it to people in the future."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;, Hank Morgan is transported to the legendary times of King Arthur and Camelot. I thought that this novel was wonderfully put together. The way Hank instituted 19th century ideals into the 6th century was a perfect way to add pizazz to the novel. Although there were some parts in the novel that were slow and undeveloped, the best parts and the main parts over-shadow those. This novel is one you MUST-READ!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In this book, a man named Hank Morgan is transported from the 19th century to the Dark Ages. He lives there for about a decade living a full and exciting life. He gets by using his wits, courage, common sense and 19th century knowledge to survive. A war takes place, and England is left in ruins. Hank sees this as his oppurtunity to proclaim a republic and destroy feudalism once and for all, but he has some opposition...I really liked this book. It was very exciting and the characters were hilarious; there's King Arthur, who can't swallow his pride and will fight on suicidely. There's the maiden, Sandy, who, while accompanying Hank on a quest, drones on and on unstopably about the stupidest things! The only downside id the difficult vocabulary and the occasional archaic expressions. Words like &quot;obstetatiously&quot; and &quot;obstenuating&quot; or &quot;hence&quot; and &quot;smote&quot;.

If you don't like this book I feel sorry for you."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I read the book A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. It began quickly and I was easily intrigued by the author's usage of vocabulary and his extraordinary ideas. He began in such a way that one could not put the book down and I found myself staying up late in the night just to finish that one last chapter. Yet, as I continued reading, my mind began to wander from lack of interest. The book became a little redundant and it was hard to concentrate on reading. I fell behind in my reading schedule because I was unable to stay focused on what I considered to be boring text. Luckily, as I kept reading, the plot began to thicken once again. I was again caught up in the story. The last third of the book proved to be an interesting one. I kept reading even when I knew I had to do other things. My mind stayed with the book even when I wasn't reading. I believe that the character development was done extremely well. You get to know the characters and you know how they feel. Even before someone speaks, you know what their reaction to the situation will be. This is a sign of a very well written book. A book where one can feel the characters' feelings is one that is easy to read. Not in the sense that the text is easy, but it is easy to stay interested in the book. It is beautifully written as a whole. Yet, through the middle it becomes more of a technological book. The inventions created are thoroughly explained. I found that thoroughly boring. Although it was interesting to know what was being created, I wasn't interested in a step-by-step process as to how it was being made. I recommend this book to a more mature audience. Not because of any obscene situations, but because I believe it would be too hard to comprehend before the age of twelve at the youngest. Not only would it be hard to comprehend, but it may be quite boring to those under that age. Of course, it depends upon who the person is that is reading the book. Yet, generally I believe it would be most fitted for older teens to adults. Their ability to comprehend and appreciate the writings of Mark Twain would help to make this book an interesting one to read. All and all, I would generously recommend this book. It is a novel that not only interests you, but keeps you thinking as well. The plot, along with the style of writing, is well thought out and keeps you turning the page each time. Although at times it can become a little boring, for the most part one would find this novel enjoyable. One can probably find it at any local bookstore, any library, or even purchase it on the internet. If you are looking for a good book to read, then I would suggest that you pick this one up today."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, originally published in 1883, is part memoir, part paean to the Mississippi River and its culture, and part compilation of whatever miscellaneous anecdotes Twain thought were worth relating.Twain begins with a history of the Mississippi since it was discovered by de Soto in 1541.

This book clearly reflects that from the beginning to the end. Twain is a riverboat captain, and travels up and down on the Mississippi river, seeing cities such as New Orleans, Memphis, and St. Louis. He describes his experiences in very lively fashion to the extent that the reader can very well imagine what river travel was like in Twain's time. It should not be forgotten that river travel at that time was commercial and an essential way of getting back and forth. And Twain makes the reader feel that riverboat travel was lots of fun and very adventurous even at that time. The book is a valuable contribution to history in that Twain accurately describes what has happened and what the events mean for those who live in that time period. Personally, I feel that this is one of the best books I have ever read. Also, the last time I went on a trip aboard the steamer NATCHEZ in New Orleans, I heard the on-board announcer say that if Mark Twain were alive today, the NATCHEZ would be his home. Quite accurate!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"In A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain, a conecticut from the 19th centuries brings modernization into the 5-6th century and seems to change the world at that time.

They were completely under the spell of the Church: 'a united Church means death to human liberty, and paralysis to human thought ... in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms... she invented 'divine right of kings'; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice, non-resistance under opression and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies.'No wonder that the nobility, 'tyrannical, murderous, rapacious and morally rotten as they were, were deeply and enthusiastically religious.'In order to fight against the forces of darkness and to free mankind Hank Morgan creates teacher factories.But he is confronted with the problem of heridity and social conformism: 'There is no such thing as nature; it is merely heredity and training. All that is original in us can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the rest inherited from a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years.'His teacher schools liberate only a few dozens of pupils. With their help, he has to dynamite the whole British aristocracy in order to install his ideal of universal suffrage ('when every man in a State has a vote, brutal laws are impossible').This comical science fiction story is ultimately a very actual political diatribe against exploiting privilege, pure indoctrination and class (in)justice.A must read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"It is possible to understand what someone is doing, to sympathize with it, and yet not particularly enjoy it. The whole mode of this work, the fantasy, the bringing the Bridgeport foreman Hank Morgan back to medieval England and King Arthur's court as a way of discrediting inherited monarchy, the aristocratic institutions of the past means that the work is on a playing field and in a mode less 'real 'to me than that of 'Huckleberry Finn' 'Tom Sawyer' ' Life on the Mississippi'.Instead of the rich colloquial language of the American worlds Twain grew up in we have here a stilted formal language. True there is something of interest in seeing how the practical, technical, innovative 'modern Yankee' deals with the archaic reality he is presented with.But to my mind the book does not have the real Twain humor, and is more an excursion in 'ideas' than in real three- dimensional characters shaping their lives in the world."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"While a bit strange, _Yankee_ makes some interesting points about both medival and modern life. Twain makes some interesting commentary on technology, honor, and human nature with characters that cross a millenium."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading this book. I laughed outloud frequently as Twain poked fun at 6th century England and in turn, 19th century England. Beneath the thick sarcasm, though, were many profound issues such as freedom of religion vs. an established church, democracy vs. monarchy, and the corruption brought on by absolute power."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"It was an entertaining book, at least in parts, but left me cold compared to some of Twain's other books. One thing that bothered me was that it supposedly takes place in the sixth century, but the characters speak quasi-Elizabethan English; the language spoken then would have been nothing like English. Twain also maligns the Roman Catholic church (it causes the downfall of the nearly 19th-century world the Yankee has built up), but England was only beginning to be converted to Christianity, if that. These may be minor points, but I don't think a satire of England of old has much bearing on modern America. Can one expect the world of 13 centuries ago to be like the world of Twain's day or ours?"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"While the critique of the weaknesses of Arthurian society are obvious, this is a really remarkable book for its critique of Twain's (and perhaps our) America. The ending can be seen as a prophetic warning of the consequences for war of the adoption of modern technology. Even Twain's accounts of the problem of instantly democratizing a traditional society seem remarkably current to today's efforts to bring our political system to Eastern Europe, etc. This is no teenage science fiction novel, but as usual with Twain, a book with many meanings and insights."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This book is not a &quot;good&quot; book, in that it fails to achieve its supposed purpose (which is to deprecate chivalric romance). Yet the sheer fascination of this incredibly poigniant failure is enough to keep me returning! It nothing like the &quot;cute&quot; kids versions and movies that it has inspired. Prepare for a vitriolic horror-ride that seems to prove nothing but man's futility--i.e., welcome to Twaine's latter period. Mark Twain's work of psuedo-realistic phantasy is perhaps the most marked and fascinating failure in literature. In the novel Twain sets science and technology against chivalry and romance. Twaine attempts to overthrow a thousand years of fuedal and romantic tradition by means of scientific and economic efficiency. Yet (without revealing too much) in the end the Yankee must praise the romantic hero King Arthur; has used the very superstitions he disdains to dupe the people; come to love an archetype of the simple medieval personality he despises; and, amazingly, has threatened to destroy an entire civilization. In the end the only thing the Yankee proves is that modern man is far too arrogant for his own good, and that it is all too easy to become the villain you hate. So what was Twaine's point? Supposedly to prove the vast superiority of the modern age over the Chivalric Age. But did Twaine actually believe his utterly amazing ending carried out his task? I doubt it; I think the book is a classic example of Twain's disbelief of everything.

What can I say? The title of this review pretty much explains it all. Yet, odds are it could just be me. It is most likely that my complaints are based on opinion, as there is not too much fact within the topic of the quality of literature. The story, which is a clich&eacute;-spawner (more on this later), is about a \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" who is not properly named for most of the plot. In the preface, the Yankee, mostly referred to as \\"The Boss\\", is clonked on the head by a crowbar and miraculously wakes up over one thousand centuries prior. Medieval Times soon turns to be a harsh place for the Yankee, instantly reducing him to the status of a slave. By using his prior knowledge of the date of a solar eclipse, he convinces the higher powers of the land (and everyone else in those times), that he is of magical roots. It is here that we witness one of the biggest thematic sequences of the book. The Yankee is befuddled by the nave nature of the English population, and as an effect, continues to take advantage of this facet of medieval life. The Yankee himself is a very clever character, as we first see with his usage of the solar eclipse, and then again when he \\"MacGyver's\\" together a lightning rod and gunpowder to exterminate Merlin the Wizard's tower. Actions such as this could be easily compared to the antics of Twain's other character, Huckleberry Finn. The Yankee goes through several years with trying to conduct Industrial change years before any such events would have occurred. The push for change continues when The Yankee takes on a quest to help a woman by the name of Alisande, or Sally. On a quest to save a number of maidens, they happen upon two ordinary peasants. Eating breakfast with them, The Yankee questions them about the idea of a more modern democracy, planting the seed for rebellion. The climax of the novel comes when a Tournament with a knight ends with The Yankee displaying his future weaponry in the form of a revolver, in which he uses to shoot his opponent and 9 other knights dead. In turn, he reveals his underground 19th century movement upon the world. In efforts to not give away the ending, I'll stop there. In my opinion, the plot here is one of random events that all concur to the same centralized theme. While this sounds fine in theory, the actual execution of such a technique is hardly appropriate. I found novels such as Huckleberry Finn much more approachable and I was able to enjoy it more, as the plot was much more rich and fun. I would probably recommend this book to someone looking for a satire of history, more than someone looking for a story with a fantastic plot."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This novel tells the story of Hank Morgan, a 19th century engineer from Hartford, Connecticut who through a strange turn of events finds himself in the 66h century England of King Arthur. He is almost immediately captured by a knight upon his arrival in the 6th century and taken to Camelot where he learns he is to be executed in a couple days time. Using his superior modern wit to escape the situation, hank sets out on a grand process of introducing 19th century technology, know-how, education, and values to Arthur's realm.The novel is filled with many humorous moments as is apt with other fiction from Twain but there is also a distinct dark side to the story that becomes ever more apparent. The impact of the past with the present (at least at the time of writing) results in the dismantling of the romantic view of the past while simultaneously reveals the faults in the belief of scientific and social progress. The England of Arthur is depicted as one where the people, although not generally subjected to the institution of slavery, are for all purposes the equivalent of slaves. The \`freemen' of the day have no rights whatsoever and are subject to the whims of a nobility whose only entitlement to rule is blueness of their blood. The Church is similarly depicted as repressing force against the mass of humanity. The protagonist Hank struggles endlessly to awaken in the people a sense of social justice and outrage at being treated as dirt by their noble lords. He is constantly frustrated in his attempts though and concludes that the level of indoctrination is so deep in the people that only large structural changes and the rise of a new generation will provide the seeds for a revolution to overturn the existing order.Hank Methodically sets out to accomplish just such a revolution by starting clandestine centers of education and industry, all the while keeping an eye on the Church so as not to have his program disrupted. With the introduction of modern technology and education, \`progress' moves along at a steady pace. But with all the advances to society also comes the capacity to disrupt and destroy as much if not more. In seeking to replace the controlling ideology of the Church, Hank inadvertently sets up a rival ideology that demands the complete submission of the people as well.Twain's criticisms of the 19th century become all the more apparent when applied against the backdrop of an age unrecognizable to ours. It is rather amazing that the problems he confronts, free market capitalism, mechanization of war, political ideologies, confidence in a historical progression towards a better society, would all come to the fore in the 20th century as pressing questions confronting a world with the ever growing capacity to destroy itself. The novel stays true to Twain's pessimism concerning his day and the \`damned human race' ends with a truly terrifying scene. All good novels have to concern themselves with themes that go deeper than the mere story that they tell. Twain certainly does not disappoint with this effort."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"When Hank Morgan, the head superintendent of the great arms factory, receives a smack on the head given by a friend nicknamed Hercules, he wakes up under an oak tree. A young man tells Morgan is he is in Camelot in the year 528. Not believing the boy, Morgan insists it is the year 1879 in Hartford, Connecticut. Morgan's adventures are written in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, by Mark Twain. Sir Kay throws Morgan in prison after he finds the Yankee and scares him up a tree. Sentenced to death the next day, Morgan performs a \\"miracle\\" before he is hung and King Arthur, believing him to be a wizard, set him free. Slowly, Morgan works his way up to \\"The Boss\\" of King Arthur's court and brings all of his 19th century knowledge to the people of Camelot, such as the telephone and electric lights.Although I would recommend this book to advanced readers, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is over 400 pages and it was difficult for me to get into the story at first. Also, the language was hard to understand. For example, \\"Fair sir, will ye just?\\" and \\"Prithee do not let me.\\" Despite the length and the language, I enjoyed the way Twain used characters and stories from the Arthur legends and formed them into the plot.

Some consider this work &quot;chaotic,&quot; but I don't agree. Yes, he does attempt a lot in this work- humor, the relation of an exciting tale, and questioning mankind and society, but the book still has a flow. It contrasts the nineteenth century dependence on technology and efficiency with a pseudo sixth century that uses a caste system and rigidly follows codes of chivalry. The ending was not particularly insightful, as one would expect, but it still satisfied me. The book had me chuckling much of the time- I mean, can you just picture Sir Launcelot with a few hundred knights, in their armor, and riding bicycles?! Or a knight, in the lists at a tournament, being lassoed cowboy style?! It was also interesting to read because it gives you a sense of life in Twain's time, with a few references to the Civil War, or the dispute over currency...

It certainly doesn't have any of the silly plot devices of Finn, like reintroducing Tom Sawyer into the final part. And while literature professors talk of how radical Huck Finn was for its condemnation of slavery, I believe A Connecticut Yankee is equally radical for its condemnation of capitalism. They're both fine books, but I found A Connecticut Yankee more entertaining and finely crafted."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This is a detailed local history of a few years on the Missippi which can help genealogists as well as Riverboat fans and river enthusiasts. It provides insights into changes over a period of 30 years."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This is a wonderful story with clever twist all the way through it. Hank, the main character, manages to go back in time to the year 513. Hank then goes about the business of trying to modernize a soceity that seem to want to resist any improvement. Although the main objective of the story is Hank's attempt to modernize Britian, he has some pretty wacky adventures along the way. From resecuing damals turned into pig to duels with other knights Hank experiences what chiverally is in its true form. Although I really enjoyed this book and would read it again I do have some critisism on it. There were parts in this book that seemed to drag, There was just some chapters I had a hard time getting through such as the chapter called \\"Sixth-Century Political Economy.\\" In it Hank tries to explain to some peasents about what economy is but they don't get it. While reading his explanation I found that I quickly got bored and tried to hurry through that part. There were a few other chapters like this, but for the most part I thought the story fast paced and quite enjoyable. I would recommend this book to anybody who is a fan of Mark Twain, and who have time on their hands. This is harder reading and the book has 316 pages. This is definantly a classic that people ought to read if they get a chance."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential. As for this edition, it is essentially bare bones. Anyone wanting supplemental material will need to look elsewhere, but this will do well for most, as the text stands very well on its own."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, originally published in 1883, is part memoir, part paean to the Mississippi River and its culture, and part compilation of whatever miscellaneous anecdotes Twain thought were worth relating.Twain begins with a history of the Mississippi since it was discovered by de Soto in 1541.

Twain wrote such travel literature classics as\\"Innocents Abroad\\", \\"Following the Equator\\", \\"A Tramp Abroad and \\"Life on the Mississipi.\\"Life on the Mississippi was published in 1883 shortly before Twain's greatest novel \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" was unveiled to readers in 1885. In Life on the Mississipi\\" Twain sets out to travel down the long river. Twain (born Samuel L. Clemens) was born near Florida Missouri growing up in nearby Hannibal nestled next to the great river. As a boy he dreamed of becoming a steamboat pilot. As told in the autobiographical chapters of this book he did become one in the years prior to the Civil War. Twain was an apprentice pilot working under the expert tutelage of Horace Bixby. Twain had to learn every inch of the river from St. Louis to New Orleans and back. He left the river to join the Confederate Army. After a few weeks he left the army for the West where he began to write as a newspaper reporter gaining fame for his short humorous sketches.Nevertheless, Twain also wanted to see the river once again. In Life on the Missisippi he sketches the variious towns along the river such as St. Louis, New Orleans, St. Paul, Natchez, Vicksburg and Memphis. He tells tall tales about clever card sharks, grisly murders, Civil War battlesand American Indian legends. His brother was killed in a steamboat explosion and Twain recounts this sad tale. The highlight of the book is his return to Hannibal where he remembers his childhood and what has become of all the children he played with as a boy. There is even an excised chapter from Huckleberry Finn which Twain added to this book.Life on the Mississippi is will live as long as American literature. Mark Twain is the Lincoln of our Literature. The book is a joy to read of a distant day when the steamboat was king of the river!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I thought this was agreat book because it has time travel and all the stuff about King Arthur and Merlin. It was kind of cool because he tried to change how it was in midieval times by adding all this electric stuff like phones and lights and other modern stuff from his time, into the past. He tried to change them entirely to a new government and basically a new place. The ending was different from normal books because it didn't end well. It had a twist to the ending."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A fan of Mark Twain and a fond reader of Prince and the Pauper, I recommend this read for children's classics series. Though not for a supplement read in the classroom, undoubtedly the book is a great read as you meet the characters:Hank Morgan, the Connecticut YankeeClarence, a page who become Hank's right hand manMerlin, the King's magicianKing Arthur, King of EnglandKnights of the Round Table - Sir Launcelet, etc.King's wife, an evil queen Fay, an old abbot, etc.Having spent his boy hood in a town in Mississippi, Mark Twain is one of the America's greatest and most beloved writers. In this book, Hank Morgan wakes to find himself in King Arthur's England. The Yankee uses all his scientific knowledge to be a Chief Minister in the King's Court. He outwits the magician Merlin and gracefully win the kingdom. There are exciting chapters like the Ogre's Castle, The Yankee and the King sold as Slaves, Yankees fight with the knives, in merlin's cave. Was it a dream and did he get back to Connecticut - You got to read the book. Seriously, if there were no video games or the television shows, kids would have loved to read these classics or rathar listen to the adventure tales like these. A good read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable, easiest reads you will ever find, and yet it may also be the most intellectual of all American novels. That Twain has managed such a mix is further proof of his crowning genius.The story revolves around Hank Morgan, a modern American businessman who is transported back in time. He is shocked by the backwardness, ignorance, and poverty of Arthurian England and decides that the people there deserve a \\"new deal.\\" (This novel is where FDR picked up that phrase)The novel is mostly comic, occasionally tragic, and consistently compelling as it follows this quixotic scheme to its ultimate conclusion. The plot reveals Twain's brilliant insights on the nature of freedom; the trade-offs involved with economic development; America's role in world history; the interplay between capitalism, religion, and tradition; and the tragedies of history, without ever tipping his hand as to what Twain himself believes.And, of course, it is hilarious. The Yankee's misery while wearing armor, his bafflement at chivalric customs, and the bizarre contrasts between his modern innovations and the medievel world make for regular laughs. No other author could make his readers think so hard while laughing so hard.Recently, this book has gained an added resonance, as Twain's take on the Americanization of a traditional culture can be easily applied to our current projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. Twain ends his book with a violent insurgency against the Yankee intruder, and horrific bloody tragedy. Hopefully our project will not end in the same way."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The best work by Twain I've read to date. This combination history, memoir, travelogue, and collection of sketches is both humorous and entertaining. I have also learned a great deal about Twain, his time, and the history of steamboating and the Mississippi. Written later in his life, this work is mature in style as well as content in spite of its loose organization and focus. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Twain has a way of taking something that we commonly idealize and shooting holes all through it. Where Letters From Earth took aim at religious belief, this time its Camelot. This is a good satire although not as strong as Letters which is a five star multiple reading kind of book.In Connecicut Yankee, the author runs across Hank Morgan on a tour of Warwick Castle. They \\"fell together as modest people will in the tail of a herd being shown through\\". Morgan, however, has an uncommon familiarity with the objects shown and he eventually ends up relating the story of a Connecticut Yankee to Twain after a few hot Scotch whiskeys.Morgan, it seems, after a crack on the head, found himself transported back to King Arthur's time. After being captured by Sir Kay and being delivered to the Round Table as a trophy, Henry Morgan asserts himself as a master magician over Merlin and sets himself up as \\"The Boss\\". He then begins to secretly initiate improvements and reforms such as setting up a clandestine WestPoint, installing telephone lines, starting manufacturing centers and training journalists - all the while balancing the Church and the traditional castes of the country. A misheard comment lands him scheduled to duel Sir Sagramore but is postponed for Sagramore's crusading stint. In the meantime and in preparation for the undetermined date of the duel, Arthur assigns Morgan to the aid of a young girl who comes to the table claiming that a number of princesses are being held captive by ogres. From there he goes on to \\"magically\\" fix the Holy Fountains, a spring to which people pilgrimage but has stopped flowing and then, with King Arthur in tow, attempts to travel as a commoner and lands in a world of trouble after he and the King are taken as slaves. It is a fun story with a lot of humorous situations. This is why it is recommended to young readers, I suppose.However, Twain's biting sarcasm makes it a good book for adults too. His antecdotes are vehicles for pointing out the absurdity of the concept of nobility, the probability that the belief in ogres and magicians meant that the people of the time were largely ignorant and gullible. And in their ignorance, they are cruel. Time and again we come back to this theme. But, back to the sarcasm. For example, one of his methods of getting rid of knights is by turning them into traveling salespeople of various household sundries!Additional meanings, interpretations, etc. are explored in the afterword and, honestly, unless it had been pointed out I would not have caught it at all. I didn't see this as a treatise on the nature of man although, once explained, I saw that that was there.

Hank is a self-assured factory worker who knows how to make just about anything. The protagonist, is mysteriously transported back to the sixth century, when struck in the head by a crowbar.He uses his vast knowledge of explosives and metals to quickly become a leader in the monarchy. His democratic thoughts and ideas become his ambition as he strives to make Great Britain a republic. Twain's novel shows how much of a change society has gone through from the sixth century to the time of the writing of the novel. He also show's how little education anyone received in the sixth century, even the members of royalty are not very wise. Hank's mediocre education is far superior to anybody's in the whole monarchy, because of the advances in education to the present.Twain shows that the laws of the sixth century were made for the few against the many. At one point a woman is put to death for stealing just enough food to feed her baby. Hank tries, throughout the book, to get the royalty to realize how unfair their laws are to the common man.This book makes you feel angry at points about the horribleness of the monarchy, yet ashamed because similar acts still go on in the present. An example would be how the rich and privileged still get the best of everything, while the have-nots get the last and worst of everything, both now and then. Twain has a comic sense in the book, and yet he still shows a contrast between the comic and the serious. This book should be a classic for Twain's creative portrayal of the sixth century, yet also because it makes us think about our society today."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Twain's account of his years on the Mississippi is part travel book, part memoir, and part historical work, with a few sketches, stories, and tall tales tossed in for good measure. There is even an outtake from the not-yet-published \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors. This smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book, but much of it shows Mark Twain at his humorous and humanistic best.The kernel of the volume (and its best, most cohesive section) is in chapters 4 through 17; this material appeared in the Atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early 1850s. His adventures as a young man are fraught with danger, full of comedy, populated by a number of ornery, mischievous, and reckless characters, and occasionally embellished (although Twain is a bit obvious when he's fobbing off a yarn). As Twain later wrote in \\"Puddn'head Wilson, \\"if there was anything better in this world than steamboating, it was the glory to be got by telling about it.\\"After he published the series in the Atlantic, Twain added another 46 chapters; much of it an account of his homecoming (incognito--or so he'd hoped) to the Mississippi River in 1882, when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad. Many of these descriptions are unusually (for Twain) melancholy; he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous. His new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories--some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion.The material from other sources, unfortunately, tends to bog things down--and there are about 10,000 words of it commingled in the text and included as appendices. Twain gathered newspaper articles and historical documents; he also included travel writing from earlier visitors, primarily Europeans distracted by how Americans and their homes were horribly uncouth and dirty. (You almost get the feeling that Twain would have smacked \\"the once renowned and vigorously hated\\" Frances Trollope upside the head if he'd had the chance; she provides Twain with the most interesting, if snooty, descriptions of traveling along the Mississippi early in the century.)The material Twain wrote, however, more than compensates for the dryness of the extraneous stuff. As always, he is quotable, witty, amusing, and provocative. In spite of its excesses, nobody has done the Mississippi better."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Who hasn&#65533;t heard of King Arthur and the knights of his Round Table? Along with Robin Hood, the tales of King Arthur are the most exciting tales that British history has produced &#65533; tales of grand chivalry, as gallant knights in shining armour rescue damsels in distress, and fight for courage, truth and justice. But were the knights really so noble and courageous? Through the eyes of a nineteenth century Yankee (Hank Morgan) who goes back in time to King Arthur&#65533;s sixth century court, Mark Twain suggests that the sixth century wasn&#65533;t quite so glamorous. Here&#65533;s a taste of his delightful humour: &#65533;As a general thing &#65533; as far as I could make out &#65533; these murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were simple duels between strangers &#65533; duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other, and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever.&#65533; Twain compares it to boys going at it on the spot: &#65533;I had always imagined until now, that that sort of thing belonged to children only, and was a sign and mark of childhood; but here were these big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond. Yet there was something very engaging about these great simple-hearted creatures, something attractive and loveable. There did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait a fishhook with; but you didn&#65533;t seem to mind that, after a little, because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that, and, indeed would have marred it, spoiled its symmetry &#65533; perhaps rendered its existence impossible.&#65533; (p16) As for the quest for the Holy Grail? &#65533;The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail now and then. It was several years&#65533; cruise. They always put in the long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way, though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was, and I don&#65533;t think any of them actually expected to find it, or would have known what to do with it if he *had* run across it ... Every year expeditions went out holy grailing, and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for *them*.&#65533; (p54)Sound wickedly funny? Hank Morgan doesn&#65533;t stop there with his nineteenth century heroic arrogance. Using his superior knowledge of solar eclipses, blasting powder, reading and writing, and electronics, he soon becomes The Boss who single-handedly helps sixth century Britain take a short-cut to nineteenth century civilization. Chivalry becomes a thing of the past, and the knights of the Round Table are converted to more worthwhile endeavours as baseball-players and business men &#65533; some commissioned on more nineteenth century style quests as &#65533;missionaries&#65533; to advertise soap and toothbrushes on sandwich boards. It helps, of course, that the magician Merlin is a faker and con-artist, and that hero Hank can do much more impressive &#65533;miracles&#65533;, which are nothing less than elaborate scientific stunts with blasting powder and cement. Camelot soon finds itself with a functioning telephone system and newspaper. All is wonderful, until our hero is commissioned to go on a quest to rescue forty-five princesses locked in a castle by three ogres. He discovers that being a knight isn&#65533;t as glamorous as it&#65533;s made out to be, because you can&#65533;t even use your handkerchief, and you get dust in your nose. Along with the dim-witted King Arthur, Hank&#65533;s plan to walk around in disguise as a peasant backfires when they are nearly executed as rebellious slaves, rescued only when Launcelot and the boys arrive in the nick of time - on brand new bicycles.Twain&#65533;s irreverence in dealing with the beloved Arthurian traditions garnered him a great deal of criticism at the time of publication. Yet as the peels of laughter fade, it becomes clear that Twain is using his humor to make a very serious point. Is he merely critiquing the vices of medieval feudalism and warning against over-sentimentalising the past? If he is critical of King Arthur, surely it is not a criticism directed at the monarchy or the noble virtues that the knights of the Round Table pursued, but rather at the vices of an unbalanced class structure. Or is Twain using a comparison between the sixth and the nineteenth centuries to make an argument for or against the scientific machinist age of the nineteenth century? It is clear that the protagonist &#65533; the first person point of view used by Twain to embrace the reader in sharing his convictions &#65533; embodies one set of ideals and arrogantly looks down on King Arthur who embodies another set of ideals. The sixth century holds fast to the concept of greatness and position being attained by birth, whereas the nineteen century has little reverence for rank and file, replacing it by a respect attained by achievements alone (p46ff). Morgan is sharply critical of injustices created by the medieval class structure, where people are slaves to &#65533;King and Church and noble&#65533; (p74ff), and is especially negative towards orthodox Christianity (specifically the Catholic church), feeling it safer for power not to be concentrated in one single organization (p56,108). He also mocks the simplistic medieval beliefs in the supernatural, and his own scientific &#65533;miracles&#65533; appear to be a reflection of nineteenth century liberalism and atheistic philosophy, where beliefs in supernaturalism were exiled through the advance of scientific naturalism, and where the Christian God was dethroned and replaced by science. The failures of the faker Merlin appear to be symbolic of the failure of medieval supernaturalism, since it is Morgan&#65533;s scientific knowledge that can perform the true miracles. What Twain unconsciously shows is that faith in natural science is just as much a religion as faith in supernaturalism, because the protagonist doesn&#65533;t convert King Arthur&#65533;s court to naturalism. By projecting himself as a supernaturalist, and taking advantage of King Arthur&#65533;s court ignorantly attributing his scientific miracles to the supernatural, Morgan proves to be just as much a political manipulator as Merlin or the established Church.I cannot believe that Morgan is totally a mouth-piece of Twain, or that Twain uses this work to advocate Protestant America over against Britain, since Twain was in fact an opponent of American imperialism. It is true that eventually Morgan proclaims and defends a republic with electric fences, revolvers and dynamite, exterminating the whole chivalry of England and replacing it with American imperialism and technology. But in the end it proves to be a hollow victory, with Morgan on his death-bed having second-thoughts about his technological achievements, and speaking about medieval chivalry with emotional longing and passionate love. The nineteenth century symbols prove to have the same destiny as those of the sixth century &#65533; they are conquered and die. Is Morgan&#65533;s death a symbol of the fate of the Western machine age, and is Twain asserting that nineteenth century American arrogance over earlier civilizations is misplaced, because it will share their destiny? The final cynicism in which the novel ends can not be overlooked, and is a suggestion that society&#65533;s optimism and faith in technology and science are misplaced because these can never improve humanity. Twain&#65533;s disenchantment with technology and progress is a reflection of the failures experienced in his own life: science in the end is not mankind's god or saviourTo get maximum enjoyment and understanding of Twain&#65533;s humour, I highly recommend reading a version of the Arthurian legends before Twain&#65533;s parody. He occasionally quotes Malory&#65533;s fifteenth century classic &#65533;Morte d&#65533;Arthur&#65533; &#65533; deliberately assigning a very different context and meaning to what was originally intended. To appreciate the conventions and ideals he is mocking, a read of Malory is essential, such as the English rendition produced by Sir Frank Knowles.It&#65533;s a brilliant concept, and makes William Goldman&#65533;s farcical and popular &#65533;The Princess Bride&#65533; look like inferior literary fodder for kindergarten kids. Not only is it funny, but there&#65533;s a great deal of depth beneath the surface, which Twain uses to convey a great deal of seriousness. Yet even while critics argue about just what it is that Twain is being serious about, there is no doubt that this is thoroughly enjoyable and humorous work, just as enjoyable today at the end of the twentieth century as when it was written at the end of the nineteenth. It is not so much the dark and serious underlying tone that has made this work a classic but Twain&#65533;s brilliant humour, creativeness, and story-telling."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"The perfect counterpoint to Le Morte d'Arthur. The Arthurian legends are wonderful tales but they are mythic literary productions. Mark Twain gives them a good old-fashioned strapping out behind the outhouse. With the Connecticut Yankee as our guide, we have front row seats on everyday life in Arthurian Britain: White slavery, le droit de seigneur, confiscation of property in event of suicide, nonexistence of impartial justice, the (unintended) degrading influence of Catholicism on the masses, immense ignorance, superstition... And that's just day one. But Mark Twain will never leave you stranded in a dark hell hole. Oh no - brilliance, mirth, and devastating common sense are always surrounding you on any journey with Mark Twain. This book is classic Twain: Funny.A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is chock-full of brilliant Twainisms. My favorite is his observation that a conscience is a very uncomfortable thing to have, and the significant difference between a conscience and an anvil is that, if you had an anvil stuck inside you, it would be a lot less uncomfortable than having a conscience. And Twain clearly concurs with Tom Paine that the English nobility were \\"no-ability\\" - simply the latest in a perennial series of robbers making life miserable for everyone and doing all in their power to hang on to power. A fine modern treatment of this theme is Ken Follett'sThe Pillars of the Earth. Twain also mentions the beautiful mispronunciations of childhood, and how the bereaved parental ear listens in vain for them once the child has grown.You'll never look at castles the same again (and I suspect the Dark Ages will never know what hit them)."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain, the most globally recognised of the greatest American writers, comes closest to autobiography in this odd and fascinating book. This is the story of part of his life at least, and lays out much of his unique moral and political philosophy.As a book, Life on the Mississippi lacks a truly coherent story line after the half-way point; it tells the story of Twain's training as a Mississippi steamboat pilot, then, when he returns to the river years later as a successful writer, it drops off into anecdotes as Twain travels down the great river, and can be a deadly bore for some readers.But, oh, what a picture of Twain it draws! There are great tales of characters he meets along the river, told in his inimitably funny style, wonderful bits of his childhood - like the tale of his insomniac guilt and terror when the match he loans a drunk ends up causing the jail to burn down, killing the drunk - and insightful portraits of the towns and villages along the river.This is a characteristically American book, about progress and independence as well as the greatest American river, written by this most characteristically American writer. It is a true classic (a thing Twain despised! He said, &quot;Classics are books that everybody praises, but nobody reads.&quot;), a book that will remain a delight for the foreseeable future."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"&quot;Life On the Mississippi&quot; is Mark Twain's tribute to the Mississippi River, which surrounded the earlier part of his life. Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life. For those who are just getting interested in knowing about Mark Twain's writings, I would recommend reading &quot;Roughing It&quot;; as it is humurous throughout. &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; would be the second book I would recommend."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Had Twain stopped after the first section, in which he describes riverboat piloting and his exploits therein, I would have come away with a positive impression of the book. His piloting writings were entertaining and interesting, even though not particularly relevant in today's world.However the later chapters ruin the book. Twain documents his return to the Mississippi with a plethora of miscellaneous descriptions and loosely related anecdotes. These sections range from only mildly entertaining to just plain boring, as Twain doesn't even use his humor to save them.In the end the disappointment of the second half outweighs the enjoyment of the first half."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"Mark Twain is a great author, but not here. I liked his \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" and, I've a fine appreciation for the man's sheer wit. \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" is the best short story I had to read in High School. \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is an overblown rant against religion dressed in the trappings of novelization.I found the plot absurd. Twain's barbs against religion were witty, but so over-the-top they interfered with the actual story. I kept finding the novel stupid instead of funny, and pointless instead of witty, especially when 'technology/modern civilization' began dominating the court. The use of detail detracted from the story; extremely overwritten. The main character was an 'expert' on everything, and felt more like an author's mouthpiece than a real man, even a caricature of a man. If you aren't amused by old-style religious slanders, expect a plot, and have read modern time travel stories, you'll hate this so-called 'great' novel.Please feel free to discuss in the comments rather than giving me rage-unhelpfuls because you disagree with my opinion.

However, after a while this book sort of lags along. Twain's tale of his post-civil war trip down the river is not interesting enough to take up the space and detail that he devotes to it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I had to read this book for a college class, I thought it was one of Twain's worst, and that comes from someone who loves many of Twain's other works. In fact for my essay I compared this work to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Twain uses the dialect of the people in King Arthur's time, and sometimes it can get very confusing. I skipped over several paragraphs just because I couldn't make any sense of it. As long as Twain isn't using the dialect of that time the story line is very good. I found it annoying how Twain over played the stupidity of people of King Arthur's time."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"I read this book, expecting it to be similar to Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. However, I struggled through the old English monologues of some of the characters. While this is an amusing tale of a 19th century American attempting to modernize 6th century Britain, I wish I had applied my recreational reading time elsewhere.This paperback printing is difficult to read, too. The words run too close to the spine, requiring me to hold the book flat to read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"A Connecticut Yankee Takes A blast from the past. Yea right! this book is extremely long and rarely has any action to keep you awake if I were a book rater I would give this book a two out of ten thumps up . this story takes place in the 6th century and the only good part was when they were going to burn Hank Morgan and to top it off they didn't even burn him because brought his knowledge from current time and fooled King Author by saying if they don't let him go he will shut down the moon but it was acuity a solar eclipse so the moon slowly faded away so they let him free.

Hank Morgan ,the main character, gets cracked on the head with a crowbar while working in his colt-factory in Hartford, Connecticut. He gets put back in time and into King Authors Court were he has to figure out how to get out of being hung by the king for being an outsider.This adventures tale introduces how to never give up and make the best out of a bad situation. Although sounding interesting, parts of the novel are written in old English, therefore recommended from high school up. Personally, the book wasn't the best I had ever read. For a young reader, the book is hard to keep on track when reading the lengthful pages.Sounding interesting, Hank Morgan, the boss, struggles to go through 6th century life. Sounding like you'll get a blast from the past, I myself only give this book two stars. Although many very strong readers may like the novel, many people may get lost in the book by falling asleep on the pages."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","review":"This book A CONNECITICUT YANKEE AT KING ARTHUR'S COURT by Mark Twain is very boaring. It starts out with a fictional character in King Arthur's kingdom. It then creats a labyrinth of problems that the character solves using the technology of his time. It ends triumphantly with Hank (the main character) winning a huge battle for control of England. Although the book had moments where the suspension could be felt by the reader most of the time the descriptions and characters feelings filled the pages with unnecessary narritive. Because of this the racy plot with many intresting characteristics ends up taking a long time and being slowed down by the thoughts of the characters. Although this book is considered a classic its writing could be compared to the writing of Charles Dickens. The plot of the book is well written and thought out but, in an attempt to make the book seem more realistic both authors throw in space-fillers. Also as in GREAT EXPECTATIONS Mark Twain creates a connection between all characters that happens only within a few pages.Because of all the connections in the book the plot can become hard to follow and in order to fully understand the book it is better to glance over what you have just read. The plot at times is to amazing for any reader to believe, the author gives the main character the ability to make all inventions from his time and, at a glance creat new ones. He makes the character follow a heroes journey of sorts, where he must face entire leigons of soliders but wins by flipping a swich or shooting a gun. In a way, however, it is intresting to see how todays knowledge can be used in the past for conquest and for peace. The story the book gives made me think of what would happen if someone actually did go back in time. Because each new chapter in the book introduces a new character or a new problem it makes the reader carefully follow the plot. This creates the need to read every sentence and that is very demanding on the reader.I did not enjoy the book. It was too much to read for such a limited plot and the ideas were repititive. Because of all the different aspects of the book it was barely possible to keep on reading it. Overall I would not reccomend this book as a quick or fun read."},{"Title":"Where I lived & what I lived for,","review":"The other reviewer is right that this book contains limited material from Walden. But that's precisely what makes it so useful. If you're interested in the full Walden experiment, with lengthy narratives on bird-watching and ditch-digging and any number of other things, by all means read Walden. However, for those who are simply interested in the philosophy of simple living and want to read shorter essays that get at the heart of it, this is an excellent selection.

My grandson absolutely adores this book."},{"Title":"Winterking","review":"I think the other review here is unfair. Another thing that is unfair is that this book has only two reviews. In 1986 it was a runner-up for the World Fantasy Award; Hazel garnered accolades from many fantasy greats including Robin McKinley, Andre Norton, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Peter S. Beagle, Patricia McKillip, John Clute (the list could go on at least a few more names) before apparently falling off the face of the planet; being swallowed up by the void of obscurity; unjustly forgotten in this reviewer's confident opinion. What happened?I don't know. \\"Winterking\\" is a brilliant novel, a very opaque one it is true, but well worth reading. It continues the story of \\"Undersea\\", following the dogboy Wyck--now no longer such, but a mysterious figure that has lived through countless ages in a world hauntingly like ours but vastly different. This story begins in an alternate world, in New England, part of an America where the Revolution never took place; a world in which Wyck, now Wykeham, must fight a final battle with Duinn the god of death. There space and time play tricks, and crows talk, and houses hold the souls of suicides, and men and women suffer, though in that respect at least it is not so different from ours.This book is almost overwhelmingly sad in parts. The relationships between characters are very nuanced; in this respect \\"Winterking\\" does tend to segue into the style of Hazel's later (and last?) book, \\"The Wealdwife's Tale.\\" The view of sexual relationships is almost unremittingly bleak with a break at the end of the novel, a kind of catharsis--the kind that struggles to gasp out in \\"The Wealdwife's Tale\\" but just doesn't in that one. It's hard to explain to someone who hasn't read these things: and I wonder if it is an attractive vision to be putting forward when I want to get somebody to read them. I also wonder if maybe it's just an impression I got from the time I was reading the book, and not something that would hold true for all.The writing style is competent and in parts brilliant. There is a lucid poetry in the best parts that paints pictures in your head as you read. It's not all frippery and pointlessness inserted at the expense of real atmosphere, it is very powerful and well-done.The cover of my edition, indeed of all the Bantam Spectra versions of this trilogy, is quite fitting. My advice to these publishers is to reissue these books. But another part of me is quite perverse and wants them to remain obscure for a while longer, so I can enjoy my delicious enlightenment alone. The \\"Finnbranch\\" trilogy is a treat, a fantasy series for people with brains and good taste. They will find there audience someday without my help I think."},{"Title":"Winterking","review":"Im sorry but if you were expecting a thrilling conclusion to Yearwood and Undersea, Winterking is not it. Basically, Hazel abandons the celtic/fantastic genre for some modern story about some people in a house arguing about an inheritance. If there is subtle meaning to it, I didnt get it. Its almost like comparing Queen of the Damned to Interview with a Vampire and the Vampire Lestat (although this is much much worse -- not even related). Anyway, I could not even bring myself to go beyond page 10. Truly sad since I thought Yearwood was great and Undersea decent."},{"Title":"The White Panther","review":"I first read this at about the age of five, while I was growing up in the Jungles of Colombia. The description of the jungle was so realistic and vivid. I continued to read it about every few months for the next ten or twelve years. Then I lost it and didn't read it for ten years or so. I finally found it on e-bay had to shell out some cash to add it to my collection of childrens books. It is as good as I remembered. It only takes two hours or so to read, and I still pick it up and read it a few times a year. I don't know what more to say about it; it is just one of those special books with an indefinable something that makes it great. Of course, if it was not an integral part of your childhood, you may balk at dropping a hundred bucks on it. I was able to get mine on ebay for a good price, but that was just my luck that no one else bid."},{"Title":"The White Panther","review":"Ku-Ma is his name. He is an albino Panther and he is hungry. Ku-Ma is always hungry. Fortunately, he is also about twice the size of the other panthers, and they defer to his growl when he needs feeding. Ku-ma knowing how strong he is, sometimes gets into trouble - not realizing that the other animals in the jungle may not be as big, but they have other weapons. As such, this book has several humorous accounts of Ku-ma trying to feed himself with varying degrees of success.After his skills are honed however, it is Ku-Ma, and not the lion, that is the true king of the jungle. Of course, being on top always has a price. In this case, the hunters have heard of this mythical white panther and they are looking for him. Mighty Ku-Ma kills one man, and then the real hunt begins.Read this book if you can find it. The prose is written for the young reader, but the ideas and the imagery of the text are the kinds that can make a person weep.Thank You Mr. WaldeckRelic113"},{"Title":"The White Panther","review":"When I was 11 or 12 years old back in 1959-1960 I discovered this book in my school library. I checked it out over and over during those years and must have read it a dozen times until I had it practically memorized. I can still remember day dreaming about being a panther, about being Ku-Ma the great one. I liked the lessons learned by Ku-Ma such as having too much pride and underestimating his prey. He didn't win every time but he won more than he lost and grew in wisdom. I don't think he ever made the same mistake twice. A couple of years ago I located a very good copy of his book and I am reading it again very slowly letting a lot of the memories of the sixth and seventh grade drift back.

He had nowhere to hide. He was larger by far than other jaguars. But after the battle with the jaguar, he emerged bloody but unbowed, so that an unscarred black panther decided to give him his due. Nowadays it seems as if Waldeck were anthropomorphizing an animal, but I always believed that they were smarter than humans, anyway. I wish it were back in print so I could get it again.

The book is nicely laid out with annotations of various detail and worth along the outside edge of each page.

As a comparison, the covers of the Nostalgia Ventures Doc Savage series look much better than anything in this volume.

The second part focuses on his work at Street & Smith.

My only disappointment is that there are 4 Doc covers he did that wheren't included. And I would have liked to see them a bit larger.The third and final section is on his work at Popular Publications. Strangely, the only pulp hero cover he did for Popular was the first cover of The Spider.

For example, does anyone know that this is the Richard Howard translation? That would be valuable to know, but this virtual bookstore doesn't think that's important enough to tell you, so I'm telling you. (Then again, who knows where you are reading this?). This certainly is the first and most important thing any literate person buying an English edition of Baudelaire would want to know. Hence, this review.This - Richard Howard's translation, published by Godine - ISBN: 0879234628 - is the most meticulous and lyrical in English. Although it should go without saying, Les Fleurs du Mal is a book of poems. These are poems written in the 19th century. In France. In French. Not 21st century France. Not 21st century French. Certainly not English prose masquerading as verse. Something very specific. So, even before the reader can get to the fact that it's Baudelaire, he needs to be relocated, as it were, and not have to worry about the process. Put another way, getting from there to here requires a guide. No one is better qualified for that task than Richard Howard. And he has succeeded in ways that no previous English translation has managed. This is only possible because, in addition to being the present translator, Richard Howard is one of America's finest poets. As RH knows better than anyone, &quot;giving pleasure means taking pains.&quot; This translator has taken pains and given us a heady whiff of CB's &quot;sickly flowers.&quot;"},{"Title":"Les Fleurs Du Mal (French Texts)","review":"... This book does indeed include the original French version in its second half, and Richard Howard's breathtakingly vivid and vital English translation in its first half. This is the definitive English translation of Les Fleurs du Mal, and by far my favorite.As to the substance of this remarkable book of poetry, Baudelaire's work is one of such groundbreaking genius on so many levels that it may never be equaled. He has achieved Gustave Flaubert's great aim of \\"le seul mot juste\\" (the unique right word) with such consistency that one can only smile in amazement and wonder. The aural music created by this poetry intoxicates as the meaning of the words strikes deep into the heart of the reader, putting into words thoughts and feelings that he could never express. These alternate with shocking and horrifying images that bring to mind Kafka's \\"Metamorphosis.\\" Longing, irony, desolation, desire, betrayal, anger, melancholy, ecstasy, alienation, and more are Baudelaire's subjects, and his words are the arrows in his quiver that never miss their mark. A few of my favorites are: The Albatross, Elevation, Hymn to Beauty, The Head of Hair, The Cat, Spleen III, The Clock, and Hymn.As a look into the human heart and mind, I rank this work with Michel de Montaigne's \\"Essays.\\" It would also land on my list of universal, desert-island books."},{"Title":"Les Fleurs Du Mal (French Texts)","review":"Let me declare immediately that I agree with the other reader-reviews here: Richard Howard's translations of these poems are rich, sensual, potent, lurid renderings. His verse forgoes the shoehorn of obeying the foreign rhymes (a decision shared by Dante's best translators) and pursues instead a laden, incantatory English that is utterly full and alive--really alive and vital, almost writhing in his versions of Baudelaire's most charnel poems (like \\"Carrion,\\" \\"Against Her Levity,\\" and the grim crescendo of \\"To the Reader\\"), and with a nearly pungent eros in the coutless mistress poems. One need only read the French originals (included in the book's second half) to appreciate the alchemy of Howard's admixture of fidelity and music. They don't sound self-conscious like most translations, and I find myself reading them aloud.But as for the whole volume--well, despite Howard's introductory apologia and his Keats quip, we could use explanatory notes, even if they're just stashed inobtrusively in the back, as with the Oxford Press edition. Howard calls such notes an \\"overbearing gloss,\\" but we could always ignore them, if we wanted, so I don't see what the danger is. I find context valuable--after all, Baudelaire wrote within one. Howard's Baudelaire both stirs and harrows me, but it also awakens an earnest and respectful curiosity, the kind that must bring any translator to their authors in the first place, and ironically my proper curiosity makes this unannotated book incomplete.I appreciate Howard's stout chronolgy of Baudelaire's life and work, but we could use an account of Baudelaire's aims, of symbolist poetry, of his sources and his impact. Howard's introduction offers four pages of detailed translator's defense and thanks to his supporters; surely Baudelaire and his work deserve at least as much attention! Baudelaire wrote \\"The Living Torch,\\" for instance, in response to Poe's \\"To Helen\\": why not reprint Poe's little poem for us, with clarifying remarks about the history between the two writers? Baudelaire dedicates other poems to Hugo--but how come, and how are they fitting responses to Hugo? Such background would allow this volume to be a definitive Baudelaire experience, not just a definitive English rendering. Every other edition I've seen offers such helps, though I'm sure many others don't. And as I said, a book can include notes and you can choose to ignore them.Anyway, Howard still gives us a bravura, rousing, chilling English Baudelaire. That is, obviously, the most essential thing about a book of foreign poetry, and it is what I celebrate and recommend about Howard's volume."},{"Title":"Les Fleurs Du Mal (French Texts)","review":"As both poet and critic, Baudelaire stands in relation to French and European poetry as Gustave Flaubert and Edouard Manet do to fiction and painting; as a crucial link between Romanticism and modernism and as a supreme example, in both his life and work, of what it means to be a modern artist. His catalytic influence was recognized in the nineteenth century by Rimbaud, Verlaine, Mallarm&eacute; and Swinburne and, in the twentieth century by Val&egrave;ry, Rilke and T.S. Eliot.Baudelaire's poetic masterpiece, the 1861 edition of Les Fleurs du mal (Flowers of Evil) consists of 126 poems arranged in six sections of varying length. Baudelaire always insisted that the collection was not a &quot;simple album&quot; but had &quot;a beginning and an end,&quot; each poem revealing its full meaning only when read in relation to the others within the &quot;singular framework&quot; in which it is placed. A prefatory poem makes it clear that Baudelaire's concern is with the general human predicament of which his own is representative. The collection may best be read in the light of the concluding poem, Le Voyage, as a journey through self and society in search of some impossible satisfaction that forever eludes the traveler.The first section, entitled Spleen et id&eacute;al, opens with a series of poems that dramatize contrasting views of art, beauty and the artist, who is depicted alternately as martyr, visionary, performer, pariah and fool.The focus then shifts to sexual and romantic love, with the first-person narrator of the poems oscillating between extremes of ecstasy (id&egrave;al) and anguish (spleen) as he attempts to find fulfillment through a succession of women whom it is possible, if simplistic, to identify with Jeanne Duval, Apollonie Sabatier and Marie Daubrun.Each set of love poems describes an erotic cycle that leads from intoxication through conflict and revulsion to an eventual ambivalent tranquility born of memory and the transmutation of suffering into art. Yet the attempt to find plentitude through love comes in the end to nothing, and Spleen et id&egrave;al ends with a sequence of anguished poems, several of them entitled Spleen, in which the self is shown imprisoned within itself with only the certainty of suffering and death before it.The second section, Tableaux parisiens, was added to the 1861 edition and describes a 24-hour cycle in the life of the city of Paris through which the Baudelairean traveler, now metamorphosed into a flaneru, moves in quest of deliverance from the miseries of self, only to find, at every twist and turn, images of suffering and isolation that remind him all too pertinently of his own. This section includes some of Baudelaire's greatest poems, most notably Le Cygne, where the memory of a swan stranded in total dereliction near the Louvre becomes a symbol of an existential condition of loss and exile transcending time and space.Having gone through the city forever meeting himself, the traveler turns, in the much shorter sections that follow, successively to drink (Le Vin), sexual depravity (Fleurs du mal), and satanism (R&egrave;volt&egrave;) in quest of the elusive ideal. His quest is predictably to no avail for, as the final section, entitled La Mort, reveals, his journey is an everlasting, open-ended odyssey that, continuing beyond death, will take him into the depths of the unknown, always in pursuit of the new, which, by definition, must forever elude him.In pursuit of an &quot;evocative magic&quot; of images and sounds, his blending of intellect and feeling, irony and lyricism, and his deliberate eschewal of rhetoric utterance, Baudelaire moved decisively away from the Romantic poetry of statement and emotion to the modern poetry of symbol and suggestion. He was, said his disciple Jules Laforgue, the first poet to write of Paris as one condemned to live day to day in the city, his greatest originality being, as Verlaine wrote as early as 1865, to &quot;represent powerfully and essentially modern man&quot; in all his physical, psychological and moral complexity. Baudelaire is a pivotal figure in European literature and thought, and his influence on modern poetry has been immense."},{"Title":"Les Fleurs Du Mal (French Texts)","review":"I've lived with these poems, in the original French, for forty years; when Howard's English translation came out twenty years ago, I read it through, but never felt that it was even worth reviewing. It doesn't rhyme, it doesn't scan, it changes the meaning of the original. Yecch, to put it bluntly.The whole idea behind Baudelaire's verse is that it is exquisitely classical metre and rhyme, but contains feelings and images that are so advanced that we haven't really caught up with them, even 100 years later. It's the contrast between strictness of form and wildness of content that makes Baudelaire's poetry so incredible.Enter Howard. His versification is so vague and unfocused, and his words and meaning so far from the original, that I can't recognize Baudelaire at all in this book. It's more like a riff or a sampling of the real thing, and just doesn't work - for me - either as poetry or as translation. I guess you could say that I'm deaf to Howard's music. Even if that is true, I'd stake my reputation that Howard is deaf to Baudelaire's music."},{"Title":"Les Fleurs Du Mal (French Texts)","review":"I bought this book because I love baudelaire. I used to own an edition of the complete works of Baudelaire in France (La pleiade). Baudelaire is a must read. Les Fleurs du mal are a masterpiece and I have been reading it for years.However, this digital version is disappointing. The navigation is quite good but the special french letters are not shown. I dont know if the problem comes from the conversion or directly from an inability of the Kindle 2 to show other letters. For example when there is \\"coeur\\" (heart) in a poem, you will see cur instead.If you already know Les fleurs du mal as I do, it isnt too disturbing. But for a first reading and for non- native french readers it really must be annoying.I give it 3 stars because baudelaire deserves a 5 but transforming his words is a 1."},{"Title":"Les Fleurs Du Mal (French Texts)","review":"I'd get this book for the quality of the paper and type (at least that of the version I bought back in the early 90s) and the great presentation of the French originals. People with even a high-school knowledge of French can appreciate Baudelaire's ideas and musicality. It's impossible to translate the latter into English, so why even try?The best thing about the ideas in the poems is that they are expressed in very simple language. I would have prefered a similarly simple, immediate English translation without resorting to stuffy \\"poetic\\" language (as well as over-interpretation--many images sneak into the English that are just not there, or only suggested, in the French). The only way to really appreciate the intricately constructed meter and rhyme is to read the originals.I know this is probably a matter of taste in translation, but reading the English translations in this volume really brings me down sometimes!"},{"Title":"Les Fleurs Du Mal (French Texts)","review":"I am not a writer, nor a critic. I am a mere reader who appreciates good works. This is one of my staple books, which I often reread and recommend to people who I feel might have the mind to appreciate genius. This is the best translation I know of and as a necessary feature of translated poetry, it includes the original French text, as well. Baudelaire reveals the beauty within darkness and exposes the darkness within light. Brilliance has always been rare, but I would say now it is more rare than ever within the literary field. This may very well be due to books like this going unread by the majority of the population. This is a wonderful book to enhance a person's writing depth, and their understanding of the world.

Howard makes no attempt to adhere to Baudelaire's rhyme schemes, which is fine by me. I want the literal sense in a translation of a poem, since there's no way to preserve the sonic elements in a translation (despite Howard's many failings, I think it's rather uncharitable to charge him with eliminating Baudelaire's \\"musicality\\"). However, the literal sense of the poems is precisely what Howard fails to supply. In almost every line, he alters Baudelaire's diction, syntax, and imagery to the point where he profoundly disrupts the sense of the originals. To help you forget the fact that you're reading nineteenth-century poetry, Howard suppresses all but the most obvious Classical and literary allusions and eliminates any Latin tags. This is a fairly venial sin compared to many of his alterations; in certain cases it almost seems as if he has given us new poems vaguely inspired by Baudelaire's originals (a good example is \\"The Muse for Hire,\\" which absolutely butchers \\"La Muse v&eacute;nale\\"). Anywhere that Baudelaire's syntax is the slightest bit involved, Howard entirely rewrites the lines with an eye to readability rather than the meaning of the originals. While pretentious readers may claim that Howard is interested in preserving Baudelaire's aesthetic rather than the literal sense of his poems, this isn't the case either. Baudelaire may not be the most formal poet in French, but he never sounds chatty like Howard. It's as if Howard is trying to give us Baudelaire reincarnated as a valley girl. The rules governing English syntax are much laxer than those governing French, but that's no excuse to use Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell as models for how to rearrange the structure of Baudelaire's sentences. The cold, crystalline lucidity of Baudelaire's imagery is entirely destroyed--Howard reworks all of Baudelaire's figurative language to make it much more conventional and plain, obscuring the images in a fog of the blandest, least specific words he can find in order to avoid sounding overly \\"literary.\\" Sometimes he breaks several of Baudelaire's images down into their component parts, which he then recombines into a sort of Frankenstein's monster that bears little resemblance to the originals that were plundered to create it. Sometimes he simply omits one of Baudelaire's images for no discernible reason, or substitutes one of his own. In many cases Baudelaire uses words that can be precisely replaced by their English cognates, but Howard invariably picks a word that he thinks sounds good rather than a word that replicates Baudelaire's own diction. To add insult to injury, despite Howard's obvious efforts to make Baudelaire palatable to a modern audience, he tones down the sexuality of Baudelaire's verse wherever he can and defangs some of Baudelaire's attacks on Christianity. If you want to know what Baudelaire actually says in Les Fleurs du Mal, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Les Fleurs Du Mal (French Texts)","review":"Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal/Flowers of Evil (1861) is known around the world as one of the most important collections of modern poetry. Influenced by Romanticism, Baudelaire (1821-1867) is not only an exquisite poet, but also one of the founders of modernism and the philosopher of modernity. Les Fleurs du Mal simultaneously evokes classic beauty and urban sensibility; true love and decadence; youth and decay; idealism and cynicism: all this and much more in one intoxicating bouquet of poems.As contemporary as some these themes may be in the openness of our culture, Baudelaire's Fleurs du Mal can also seem daunting and distant to American students who may have little background in nineteenth-century French culture or may need some help decoding the nuances of Baudelaire's rich vocabulary.Professor Edward K. Kaplan's new and exciting edition of Baudelaire's poems bridges the temporal and linguistic gap between American students today and nineteenth-century France. His European Masterpieces Edition of Les Fleurs du Mal (Newwark, Delaware: Lingua Text, Ltd., 2010) includes a biographical and cultural introduction to Baudelaire and his times; translations of terms that American students are not likely to know, supplemented by a French-English glossary that offers more helpful translations of key terms.

Ordinary conventions are turned up and down completely when the Frenchman uses oximorons and other tools to exhibit the beauty of &quot;mal&quot; (evil or bad - not even the title can really be translated).

In this one he just sits and broods, smoking a hookah.Richard Howard reduces Baudelaire to a pleasant middle-voice from which he speaks with only occasional eloquence. The translator here is a poet who is sensitive to the meaning of each poem, but he hasn't focused his energy enough on crafting his translations to contribute much that is better than the translations already done.His introduction reveals that he is concerned more with \\"articulating a sustained structure\\" (in which he succeeds) than with giving any poem its \\"individual varnish\\" (in which he fails). The result, of course, is that few of these poems are brilliantly presented IN THEMSELVES, and we can appreciate this translation only if we read all the poems in sequence, thinking about their relationships.Translation of Baudelaire demands a focus on every word, every line, every cadence. This translation has an agenda; it tries to capture only a fraction of the poet.Most of these translations do not rhyme; and yet they are not literal translations either. The popularity of this book is that Howard makes everything sound plain and sensible. It is only when you look at the French that you realize how uncanny the original poems are. This book does not convey Baudelaire's lyric intensity, mainly because it abandons the music of the original. Howard is so bent on making everything plain English that he utterly misses the thundering rhythms of a poem like \\"Le Vampire\\". He translates \\"Toi qui, comme un coup de couteau / Dans mon coeur plaintif es entree\\" as \\"Sudden as a knife you thrust / Into my sorry heart.\\" Bleh! What a lazy translation! Of course you CAN translate it that way, but it destroys the music of the poem, which severely weakens the reading of Baudelaire.N.B. It's awkward to review a whole book of translations, since certain attempts will obviously be more successful than others. Howard is quite sensitive to the poetry of the original (he never misinterprets) and certain lines in these translations are indeed wonderful moments of poetic understanding: such poems include \\"Sorrows of the Moon\\", \\"I spent the night...\\" and \\"L'Heautontimoroumenos\\" in which he writes \\"I am the vampire at my own veins.\\" Such recasting of Baudelaire's phrases are the most significant contributions of this book. Unfortunately, they're the exceptions, and other translators have written stunning translations, full of Baudelaire's dark music, which are far more memorable and accomplished than the typical translation here."},{"Title":"Les Fleurs Du Mal (French Texts)","review":"This book, these words, this particular translation takes me there.

My first time hearing Baudelaire's name was from the lead singer of my favorite band, he even has a song that refers to Baudelaire's work and it's complexity. So when I saw it on my friend's shelf I had to read it.These poems are so different from what I'm use to reading, there is a very specific sort of style to it. He takes gritty and dark things and turns them into something poetic, and as a reader it really puts you in a different place. Instead of reading about some beautiful woman of comfortable means you see his affection being given to the more promiscuous of woman, instead of speaking in flowering details about how gorgeous something is he weaves words around things that would repulse most. He does speak of things that are innocent and beautiful but he puts them next to things that could be considered seedy and distasteful. It's that complex juxtaposition that really drew me in and the reason I kept reading the poems like I \`needed' them it's so different.I would say that Baudelaire is definitely not for everyone because some of the imagery was a bit \`wince' worthy at times, and he's not someone who is shy about sex. In fact everything in this is written with such passion that he's almost celebrating everything for the beauty of what it is.

Baudelaire has still to be caught up to by the world, that should read Flowers of Evil still were all else destroyed. Baudelaire represents himself as an erotic Gothic Swedenborgian dandy, prostrating himself in his temple of spirituality before the cult of sensibility and personality. His language--always silent--tells of intense self-overcoming refining itself into the purity of vision, of the existential pursuit of a personally determined means for an authentic and better perfected life.The attractions of novelties, rarities, curiosities or oddities line most of his store, but only to better light the strange awareness Baudelaire brought to his life. The Flowers of Evil are martyrs sacrificing themselves in their swamps of matter incensing the skies of the ideal. The poems, the same as all of Baudelaire's work, are sad prophecies of Baudelaire's own neglected and misunderstood demise.

I look at these 2 books as my springing-off point -- incorporating her principles by looking for new recipes on the Internet etc. I know I am saving money and once I get used to this, I'll refine it further but I would have been knocked out if I had to spend 2 hours a day cooking with homeschooling. For those reviewers who were not very understanding about her shakes and such, Jonni herself said in Miserly Moms she didn't want to live like a pauper but enjoy things at a lower cost, not feeling cheap. If you are going from eating Steak & Elaborate Desserts to Miserly Cooking you are going to feel deprived without a few nice recipes that add variety. One of the biggest challenges I have found as a busy homeschooling Mom is finding good-tasting, lowfat recipes that are quick. Jonni has you do much of the prep in advance that saves you money (mixes etc) and then you kind of throw things together - not a ton of steps. I do like the book and if you are overwhelmed and want someone to just \\"spell it out for you\\" go with Jonni. If you are a seasoned bargain shopper and meal preparer, you might want something more advanced."},{"Title":"Miserly Meals: Healthy, Tasty Recipes Under 75 per Serving","review":"I am a fan of Jonni McCoy's other two books - \\"Frugal Families\\" and \\"Miserly Moms\\", so I purchased her book \\"Miserly Meals\\". I have to say that we have tried a week's worth of meals (including lunches) and we are sorely disappointed. These may be inexpensive and healthy, but they are not all that tasty. Some don't even work right. Last night, I made Mock Pizza in the slow cooker and it called for uncooked egg noodles. There apparently wasn't enough liquid in the recipe because the bottom noodles were cooked, but the top ones were still crunchy. I kept adding liquid, but then it was plain old mush. Yuck. Several other recipes are bland and boring.I did like the meatball recipe, however, and even tripled it for my freezer. Some of the other basic recipes were also good, such as the taco sauce and spaghetti sauce. But we were very disappointed in many of the meals.One other concern I had was that the yield of the recipes were not consistent. Some served four, some six, some eight. I would have appreciated a little more consistency there. We have a family of six, though, and even recipes that said they served six weren't enough for us.I did like the kitchen tips and the nutritional breakdown of each meal. I wish the index was a little more comprehensive so that I could find a recipe when I wanted to use tomatoes, for example.Overall, we were simply disappointed."},{"Title":"Miserly Meals: Healthy, Tasty Recipes Under 75 per Serving","review":"I think the author's list of \\"pantry basics\\" for the \\"miserly kitchen\\" is great. I can match 80-90% of what I have on the shelves with the foods she lists. But I'm doubtful that I would come up with the same results from the same ingredients.For instance, why do so many recipes in this book call for Tobasco sauce? And sorry but I can't foresee my family would ever accept ground turkey, or anything containing tofu or lentils. And we LIKE butter!And what's this innovative stuff called \\"broth powder\\"? What happened to the good old fashioned (and cheap) method of simply saving the water you cooked the meat in?The book opens with a chapter of beverages, but I can't help but wonder how they can be called \\"miserly\\"? Wouldn't drinking plain water be a whole lot cheaper than some concoction from the blender?Good points about this book: The desserts look delicious. And each recipe in the book is followed by a helpful \\"kitchen tip.\\" The tips themselves make pretty good reading.However, instead of this book, I would recommend an older (and harder to find) book, called _ Good Recipes for Hard Times_ by Louise Newton."},{"Title":"Miserly Meals: Healthy, Tasty Recipes Under 75 per Serving","review":"I was not satisfied with this book. I agree with the other reviewers who pointed out that it is very basic - I think it might be helpful to someone who doesn't have much cooking experience, but if you do it won't help you much. I doubt I will make anything from this book, and I have to say nothing really sounded that great. One of my main problems with this book it that every chicken recipe called for boneless, skinless breasts - how un-frugal can you get?? That is absolutly the most expensive way to buy chicken, and don't tell me it is the only healthy option - it won't kill your family to eat chicken legs once it a while. Give me a break! If you are new to both cooking and frugality, you might get something out of it, but otherwise, take my word for it - you already know everything the author has to say."},{"Title":"Miserly Meals: Healthy, Tasty Recipes Under 75 per Serving","review":"I have owned this book for a couple of years and tried many of the recipies in it.

Which is the cheapest way. Or use tofu. It really doesn't matter.But she offers a nice array of meals from soup to nuts to offer your family.

Might be better to invest your money in a more all purpose type cookbook--UNLESS you have no concept of how to determine which recipes are frugal and which are not. Generally, think less meat, and more beans/grains/veggies.

The format of each character giving his or her view of events was interesting. And most of all the stunning turn of events, all the while keeping you sympathetic to the book's main character."},{"Title":"Harbor Lights","review":"I don't know where to begin with my praise and appreciation of this book. Right off the bat I loved the atmosphere, the harbor and the lobstering, the lapping sea and creaking boats--and, in the midst of these atmospherics, the lobsterman's inner life.The author's ability to enter the minds and sensibilities of these four people is wonderful. We see how differing perceptions take their toll. I was especially impressed with his ability to fathom and render the many layers of the women. I'm definitely going to check out Mr. Weesner's other works. The writing is at once elegant and unpretentious. The people are likeable and complicated. The story casts a spell. I loved it."},{"Title":"Harbor Lights","review":"Mr. Weesner is a master at capturing what can only be felt by the written word. Harbor Lights is a perfect example of the author's craft. The story is a bittersweet portrayal of one man's attempt at reconciliation with his estranged wife. The alternating points-of-view caused me to identify with all of the characters in some way (although i was mostly drawn to the main character's daughter who seemed to be at the core of the family turmoil). I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to slow down a bit and ponder life's simple pleasures like baseball and the smell of the sea."},{"Title":"Harbor Lights","review":"i spotted this book with its beautiful cover and i wanted to escape my cold city for the afternoon. so i started reading in my car and i finished this novel at home the same night. wow! i was blown away by the way this writer took me into the lives of several characters and into a part of the country i've never been. it may be sad, but the insides are as beautiful as the cover. i found myself sympathizing with characters you might expect to dislike and inside a story that somehow became own of my own. read this one--"},{"Title":"Harbor Lights","review":"This is a superb book, written by one of my favorite authors. (Pick up The Car Thief and Novemberfest and see why.) Harbor Lights deals with many complex issues, and renders them clearly. What I thought was going to be a novel about love and marriage turned into much more -- quite a surprise... Couldn't put it down. Great writing and a great plot."},{"Title":"Harbor Lights","review":"The Author describes a morning of harvesting lobster, and depicts the water where they live as fields, and how a female is released on her back so that the eggs she is laden with are less likely to pull away as she settles back through the water. With that piece of writing you know you have picked a winning work.I had never read the work of Mr. Weesner before, but with that start, my hopes were quickly raised and I was never disappointed. I was however totally unprepared.When Warren Hudson learns he has one of the fastest spreading cancers a person can contract, he simultaneously reviews his life, his regrets, and most importantly how he will leave his life. The manner by which he contemplates what may lie beyond life here leads him to a startling series of decisions.This is a fairly brief work so it is difficult to say very much without giving away the plot. The story is related almost exclusively through 4 characters, with quite minor roles played by approximately 4 more.The story is about emotions at there most severe ranges, and the finest of lines that separate them, and finally how little it may take to breach that thin barrier. There was only one part that I didn't feel comfortable with, but to say more would be to spoil the read. Mr. Weesner creates memorable characters that are as extreme as the emotions and passions they are made of. The work is taut, powerful, and extremely well constructed.Enjoy Mr. Weesner's bit of New England."},{"Title":"Harbor Lights","review":"I'm definitely in the minority here, but I just wasn't crazy about this book. I thought it was written very well, but the story itself was slow, and extremely repetitive. I just couldn't grasp the fact that these two people who were in a sham of a marriage would stay together for as long as they did. Even living in the same house together, though they had their own rooms, and rarely spoke to one another.I never really liked any of the characters...Warren was spineless (till the end of course), and had this very off-putting 'woe is me' attitude, but he had no one to blame but himself...you know your wife's been openly cheating on you...LEAVE HER. Don't stay in a crappy situation, then complain about how miserable you are! Beatrice (Warren's cheating wife) was a very unlikable women, and her lover Virgil, and daughter Marion weren't much better.In the end, while I was impressed with the writing style, I just wasn't taken with the story. I really wanted to like this book, but it just didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"Harbor Lights","review":"Harbor Lights sheds light on feelings harbored too long that need to be expressed before the filiment gets too hot and something has to blow. Mr. Weesner characters are well drawn and we come to know them or can find poeple we lknow just like them. Revealing parts in the book occur when Warren's wife, Beatrice, laughs and then becomes ill when her lover, Virgil, wonders if Warren will rename his fishing boat &quot;Cuckold,&quot; and Virgil reliving a time in high school when he lifted money from the pocket of a boy who had an older brother that beat Virgil up becuase of Virgil's inability to face up to his actions.The beauty of the story is Marian, daughter of Warren and Beatrice who collects the lights that her parents neglected and relaizes she must leave her shallow husband before she too runs out of choices and chances.A nagging moment that needed more revelation was Warren's insistance in meeting Beatrice in a public place to part as friends before his cancer consumed him, and her insistance that they meet in private. The inability of their agreement seemingly led to the tragic, yet not unexpected ending.One of the few books that stays with you after putting it down."},{"Title":"Harbor Lights","review":"I was intrigued at first by the four person viewpoint similar to the Japanese classic Rashomon. Although I finished it, the story began to lose me (I'll try and do this without giving anything away) when Beatrice responds as she does to Warrren. Nothing given to us about his character up to that point would seem to cause her doubts. Not to mention that what finally happens between them seems to evolve not out of the normal flow of their lives but more in the way of an author's attempt to write a potential movie. It had so many possibilities in the beginning but dwindled, at least for me, to hokey contrivances."},{"Title":"New Practical Chinese Reader Textbook Vol.1--BOOK+DVD","review":"I recently ordered New Practical Chinese Reader from Need2 Learn Chinese.

The best supplement, even (or particularly) if they are not required, are the audio CDs, such as the 4 CD set for Textbook 1. A grammar book and some form of a vocabulary or a dictionary are highly recommended supplements in my opinion.I got the workbook and its 2 CDs, and the instructor's manual and 1 CD (turns out to be based in Chinese characters as if the reader already use them) but if material from these are not assigned, it is easy (or best?) to avoid using them.Prices vary significantly from college bookstores, US retail online bookstores, and sites that ship directly from China.In China without shipping, they cost in CHY or Yuan what they cost in US Dollars, even though 7 CHY equals about 1 USD.

I appreciated the instruction on gardening beginnings such as constructing a bean pole and what tools a novice needs.

If you really are a dummy, you might like that kind of thing, but there are much better choices available. I recommend The Vegetable Gardener's Bible instead for two reasons:#1: It's blasphemous.And #2: The author distils 30+ years of experimentation and trial and error (lots of error) into a compendium of useful and accessible knowledge. It has everything THIS book has and tons of stuff it doesn't, like the importance of deep soil and the disadvantages of roto-tillnig, and lots of functional, useful advice on compost etc. etc.Anyway I don't recommend buying this book. Try the library if you're curious."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"I'll admit at the outset that I've not read anything by Jack London since high school days, until this book was recently recommended. I was astonished by the high quality of the concepts explored, clear prose, wonderful character development, and the unfolding tragedy of the plot. I was also amazed at how Jack London weaves the philosophical currents of the time with a frank appraisal of the realities of class divisions of East Bay (Oakland, California) society, together with their intellectual limitations, which clearly echoed those more often associated with the eastern United States.One should know, fairly early on, where this novel is ultimately headed. But what holds our interest is the deeply insightful study of the consciousness of this aspiring intellect, aesthete, and writer in the process of becoming inspired, going through the darkness, ultimately finding empty triumph, paired exactly with his choice of an end.While reading this book I thought a good deal of other works that explore the consciousness of writers and societal studies, such as those of more highly touted contemporaries in Joyce's Ulysses and Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, and even the often derided Henry Miller, who was a later master of the genre. I would imagine Miller was influenced by Martin Eden, but I have no evidence of that.This book is well worth reading for anyone who wants to experience a young American novelist at the height of his powers. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"Although many of Jack London's books incorporate facts from his life, this is by far the most intimate. It tells the tale of a man struggling to shape himself into a man worthy of the woman he loves. It is a beautifully written story that captures the essence of defining ones identity, and the price of changing it. It is a book everyone should be able to relate to."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"This book is an autobiography of Jack London. He starts out poor with no education and awful grammer and ends up having spectacular grammer and being very intelligent. It is full surprises.

If you're looking for a classic Jack London adventure story, skip this one."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"Martin Eden is perhaps one of the greatest critiques of modern society of our time. Not only does this maligned genius tell the story of his ascent to the top of the literary ladder, he also manages to involve the reader in the political dogmas he struggled with every day of his enlightened life. A definite must read, for anybody attracted to great works of literature."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"One of the great things about older, established literature is its ability to remind you that there's nothing new under the sun. Even though technology changes, human nature reamins the same. Martin Eden certainly reminds a modern reader of this fact. This is a cautionary tale of \\"be careful what you wish for\\" as well as a commentary about class envy in America. This is such a well-known novel that you can certainly find a concise synopsis elsewhere, so I'll just add this: in Martin Eden, London reminds us that success...and fame, in particular, looks great from the outside, but often leads to disillusionment for those that attain them. It's not a new theme, but his take on it is very engaging. He also makes a devastataing indictment of the American upper class by pointing out the hypocricy of their \\"learned\\" status, in which they learn many facts but are intelectually lazy, unable to construct their own original insights or posess true cuirosity about the way the world works. Martin's life is forever changed when he realizes that everything he's nobly struggled for -- education, social poise, recognition -- is simply a grand illusion."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"A wonderful book!

Then imagine again a mind obssessed with knowledge, a body hungry for love and a soul agonized from the vice of humanity-that is the plight and tragedy of Martin Eden.Reading this book was a life altering read that I will always cherish, for every artistic mind will inherently and passionately understand every syllable uttered by Jack London's genuis-buy this book and read it and reread it indefinitely!"},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"I read this book while living in Montreal back in '88. By sheer coincidence, I was a struggling writer, working to earn my daily bread in a dry cleaning shop. The book had been given to me as a gift by the father of a friend before I headed off for Montreal to pursue my dreams.So, maybe it was the fact that I had steam blowing in my face at the cleaner's (much like Eden in the book), maybe it was the fact that I wasn't eating very much those days (much like Eden in the book), or maybe it was because of the fact that this book got right under my skin - but it's the book that convinced me that writing is hard work.As a work of fiction, I admit that it has its flaws, but I'm still giving it five stars for London's absolute courage in shifting gears in his career as a writer and putting out a book he believed in and that is absolutely believable. The reader could have done without the political aspsects of London's philosophy, but then again - maybe not."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"While living for a year in the former Soviet Union, I was often told that a favorite professor's or respected friend's most-admired author was -- Jack London. When I responded that he was known only vaguely by my generation as an adventurer and a ruffian, my Soviet friends gently shook their heads and regarded me as an ignoramus.My spotty education aside, I did recall London only carelessly through some snaggly-toothed wolf in a novel of his, read in junior high and not afterwards. Nearly a year after I'd returned to the states, I still hadn't re-read London, and had left my comrades' advice somewhere to rot in a long mental list of &quot;Authors I Must Some Day Read.&quot;On my birthday, then, I was strolling through book-store aisles with my boyfriend, trying helplessly to choose just one tome for a special gift. Hillman? Oh, no. I'll buy that myself, regardless. Nietzshce's &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra?&quot; As a birthday gift? Too silly.London's name cropped up into my mind, only half-so, and I dug vigorously through the L's until I came up with his &quot;Martin Eden.&quot;&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is a beautiful book -- not granted its proper throne in history.I'm not sure if London was pre-judged as an adventurer, if readers really didn't challenge themselves to dip below his surface - I'm no literary historian - or if, perhaps, if his politics played a role...it's silly to speculate.Regardless, &quot;Eden&quot; is a daring - if not entirely successful - critique of modern philosophy's most potent force: Nietzshce. It's also a historical novel, a coming-of-age, and a wealth of human insight. His big finish is, yes, overstated. Perhaps because he didsn't ultimately triumph over Nietzsche. But he gives a good right hook and a terrific read.Editor's note: Enough to rouse a former student and former reader back to a voracious love affair with words.Here's to Jack London! Cast aside by my generation, may his wild socialist self rise again!"},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"I was forced into reading this book for a research paper, but now I am so glad that I got the chance to experience such a timeless classic."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"Everyone should read this book.

It's about a sailor from the working class in San Francisco at the turnof the century who becomes exposed to the way of life of wealthy, educated, upper class people and decideshe wants to be like them. He falls in love with the daughter of awealthy man and decides he wants to become a famous writer, partly to impress her.Martin Eden suffers a lot in the book. All of his literary efforts are rejected by publishers and fail to impressthe woman he loves. He becomes very disillusioned and very poor. The account of how difficult it is to becomea great writer as opposed to a popular, published author rings true. I enjoyed London's writing style. There's a lot in the bookabout individualism versus socialism that didn't interest me. Overall, I would say it is a very worthwhile book with a lot of depth. Martin Eden does achieve success as a writer finally. Many readers will find the ending disappointing. I didn't really care what happened to the character at that point. I was mainly interested in the journey to becoming a great author. I was disappointed thathis literary success occurs so late in the book"},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"I usally like all Jack London books but martin Eden was so boring I couldn't read it.

It doesn't rise to the realm of high art, although the writing is splendid in parts. The philosophy displayed through most of the novel comes across as sophomoric and meretricious. As autobiography it is dubious at best, as anyone who has read a biography of London knows. On all these accunts, London's other semi-autobiographical work, John Barleycorn, is much better and well-grounded......And yet, any one who has ever been in love or thirsted for beauty and knowledge, or has had ambition thwarted, or had it fulfilled and found that its reward led to emptiness can not help saying that this is the stuff of life.The book has Nietzsche's influence written all over it. Indeed, the closing lines of Chapter XXVIII are directly lifted from Nietzsche. This influence doesn't, to my mind, detract from the novel though. Quite to the contrary, it's what holds the book thematically and artistically together.The best part of the book by far is the ending, wherein London remains artistically and thematically true to himself and to his readers, and thereby renders the book unpalatable for mass consumption. As Nietzsche puts it, &quot;I love him who is abashed when the dice fall to make his fortune, and asks, 'Am I then a crooked gambler?' For he wants to perish&quot; There is also the influence and theme of that most anomolous of the books of The Bible, Ecclesiastes, which is, again, more overtly evident in London's John Barleycorn: &quot;Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?&quot;This book has its faults, but indiffence to the very pulse of life and to the vagaries of the human condition is not one of them. I can't imagine any lover of and struggler with words and life coming away from Martin Eden unmoved."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"There is always that one book in your life that you read and all of a sudden you realize that a book is more than just a story. This was that book for me. I still can't necessarily pinpoint why. But it did for me what I think a great book should do, that is make me think. Think about life, think about love and think about people. I can't say that this book answered any questions, but the important part was that it made me ask myself questions."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"Jack London called MARTIN EDEN his greatest book. That's right: MARTIN EDEN, not THE CALL OF THE WILD or THE SEA-WOLF. He also said that THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS gave him the greatest satisfaction as an artist and THE IRON HEEL was his \\"gift to socialism.\\"Hm... that's not what we are taught in school, is it? Why has MATIN EDEN been so slow to emerge as a great American classic? There are two reason for this: one literary and the other historic.When first confronted by the character of Martin Eden, most readers are overwhelmed by his mental and physical strength, by his monumental drive to succeed as a writer and in so doing capture the woman of his dreams: Ruth Morse. Martin's meteoric rise comes across as not only heroic but downright inhuman, something that could only happen in the wildest of novels. But therein lies the trap. It really isn't a piece of fiction. For all intents and purposes Martin Eden is Jack London and the wraith-like Ruth Morse is Mabel Applegarth, the young woman he loved and aspired to marry and mate with.Contrary to popular opinion, the book is not the glorification of the individual but just the opposite: a warning of what can happen to the strongest of men when he foregoes societal consciousness. Martin's ultimate suicide is proof-positive that human beings are first and foremost societal creatures, that we need each other's love and affection in order to have complete and happy lives. In a word, Jack London and Ayn Rand would not have gotten along.Then there's the historic angle to MATIN EDEN. Unlike his great predecessor Herman Melville, Jack London is never given much credit for spending his artistic capital. But oddly the facts of his life show just the opposite. We must remember that London was writing at a time when the\\"robber barons\\" reigned supreme and the American worker had no protection whatsoever. There was no forty-hour work week, no child-labor laws, no workmen's compensation, no pension plans, no social security, and no safe working conditions. American workers were cogs in the great machine called the factory system. And as a child Jack London was one of those very cogs. He therefore detested the injustice he saw everywhere, especially the way the rich exploited the poor. THE IRON HEEL, his brilliant and direct assault on capitalism, was justifiably dubbed \\"the first negative Utopia.\\" But it was much more than that. It was a critique on the entire economic and social fabric of the day and was viciously and unfairly panned by the press. Nor did the criticism end there. London's next book - yes, you guessed it MARTIN EDEN - was panned too. London took his lumps and never wrote another great novel.So how do I end all this? Perhaps on a personal note. In 1962 my father said to me, \\"You know, son, Jack London is not properly understood in the United States. To my mind MARTIN EDEN was his best effort and it might do you some good to read it.\\" I took Dad's advice and did so. It blew me away. Then, at age forty, I said to myself: \\"I bet MARTIN EDEN does not pack the punch it had twenty-two years ago.\\" I was wrong. It hit me stronger than before. Now, at age sixty-six, I plan to read it a third and final time. Only this time I know it was not disappoint. Of that I am certain. Just like the last two times it will spin its magic and make me a better human being."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"This is Jack London's fictionalized story, a Paul Bunyonesque tale of the power and strength of the spirit. More than anything, this book is about individualism: a man's life-and-death attempt to overcome his working class background and launch himself into what he thinks will be the culture and rationality of the upper class. Martin Eden wants to write so as to impress the dainty, middle-class girl of his dreams: her of the frail and conformist nature. In this quest, no barrier is to large, no pain too great, but in the end, as he triumphs as a writer, he finds the results empty and barren, the people he meets at the top, as shallow and vacant as those he sought to escape. &quot;Where are all the great giants?&quot; he asks himself. Together with London's hard-hitting and powerful prose, the book is a masterpiece for the ages: the bold, fearless individual pursuing the inner vision of a different life. Although set around the turn of the century, the message of this book is as relevant today as it was the day it was published."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"In reward for an act of good samaritanism, Martin Eden, an uneducated working-class sailor, is invited to dinner at the home of the bourgeois Morse family. Upon first sight of lovely young Ruth Morse, he immediately falls in love with her. Over the course of the evening, Martin becomes enamored with the family's luxurious home, refined lifestyle, and cultured education, and aspires to raise himself to their level. With the intention of transforming himself into a man worthy of marrying Ruth, he sets upon a rigorous course of self-education. Soon he develops a passion for writing, and resolves to make his fortune as a man of letters.What follows is the long, arduous journey of Martin's ascent. His struggles as an aspiring writer are totally captivating; one can't help but rejoice in his successes and agonize over his failures. The portions of the book devoted to his literary exploits are so engrossing, the romance between Martin and Ruth often seems a cumbersome distraction. Though a realist and radical in his political and philosophical writings, London was often a hopeless romantic and downright puritanical in his depictions of male/female relations. In his works women are often set on pedestals, and no one gets a higher pedestal than Ruth Morse. Even so, as Mr. and Mrs. Morse deliberate over whether Martin is worthy of their daughter, the reader finds himself wondering whether Ruth is really worthy of Martin. Thankfully, as the book progresses and the characters gain a little maturity, the relationship between Martin and Ruth becomes less idyllic and much more firmly grounded in reality. As Martin's superheroic quest for self-transformation lurches toward fruition, he comes to realize that the result of his metamorphosis is not the paradise he envisioned.Whether you come to admire Martin or abhor him, this is an exceptionally thought-provoking novel that calls into question the inherent value of social status and intellectual achievement. What begins as a simple boy-meets-girl, rags-to-riches tale gradually progresses into a profound investigation into the complex conflicts of man vs. society, class vs. intellect, artistic integrity vs. exploitation, individualism vs. conformity, and ambition vs. complacency. This semi-autobiographical novel was Jack London's greatest attempt to break free from the ghetto of adventure fiction to which he was so often undeservedly confined, and to write the sort of philosophical literary novel one might expect from a Dickens or a Balzac. To this end he was extremely successful. Martin Eden is a life-changing read that deserves a place on any bookshelf alongside the great classics of literature."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"Say Jack London and most literate persons would ring up \\"Snow, Dog Stories and nature tooth and nail set in the context of gold rush Alaska of the 1890s. Ironically, Jack London was a San Francisco native in which he sets his 1909 novel \\"Martin Eden\\" which is his fictional autobiography.Martin Eden is a young, virile bright sailor who resuces a middle class man from thugs. He is invited to the man's home where he meets his sister Ruth. Martin and Ruth fall in love. Ruth and her family seek to help Martin obtain a good job but he insists on becoming a published author. Years pass and his work is rejected. Martin takes such jobs as working in a laundry and going to sea as he ekes out a living on a near starvation diet. Martin is a voracious reader of fiction, essays and novels. He is influenced by Darwinian social evolutionsim and becomes a disciple of Herbert Spencer. Martin also subscribes to the Nietzchian concept of a superman who is above the herd of ordinary people. Martin is a lonely soul who is befriended by the moribund poet Brissende an alcoholic. Both of these writers have soured on life. Martin has moved from Eden to Hell in his thinking and prospects for the future.Martin eventually becomes rich through his writings but it is too late for him to have a good life. He grows to despise Ruth and her smug suburban middle class family. He hates businessmen and philistinism and pretence in society and the literary community. He befriends a former girlfriend but his autodidadic education and fame have separated him forever from his working class pals.Martin rejects a plea for love from Ruth and sails away from the dull life of middle class respectability and conformity.The novel is bitter and brutal in its depiction of the American dream turned into a nightmarish vision of a man sickened with life. The Horatio Alger rags to riches tale is given a wry twist by Jack London. The novel failed to win applause upon its publication. Since then the novel has grown in readership and literary stature. It is a fine book but not one to peruse if you want to be cheered up! London's survival of the fittestis not a philosophy this reviewer finds appealing,"},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"When looking for leisure reading material, I would definitely recommend Jack London's, Martin Eden. If you are not used to London's word usage, you might be caught off guard. Despite his word usage the reader can still get the main points of the story. This story is one that touches on many topics such as self discovery, tragedy, trust, and the evolution of one's being. As you read Martin Eden you cannot help but identify with the main character in some way. By connnecting with the main character you will find yourself suppporting him in every way. You will celebrate his achievements and console him in his many failures. All of which make for an engaging novel. Those individuals that wish to cheer for Jack London's \\"Rocky\\" should read this novel.Once you start this novel you will not want to put it down until you have completed it."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"Martin's demeanor towards the guests of the bourgeois dinner table/parties had me laughing. The punk! I wish I could tell those people off half as eloquently as he did, but why waste my breath? The 'society' of republicans, lawyers, industrialists, bankers, etc. still freaking exists, and still aim to suppress, dismiss, and scoff at any ideas that are not yet validated by the status quo. Trying to change them, relate with them, or even addressing them on any human level will prove futile, in my experience. Essentially, don't go pullin a Martin Eden over what a pen of swine agree upon.And his speech to the socialists at the rally - lol!This was in 1908?

After I got out of the Army, I went to grad school on G.I. bill and for 37 years taught literature in college, including Jack London's fiction.I've often thought that the overall plot of MARTIN EDEN was VERY similar to that of Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY--both books are about a man who puts a woman on a pedestal and becomes a huge financial success in order to impress and win that woman--and then he finds out that she is not really the person he'd built her up to be in his mind--and so he has nothing to live for.SPOILER ALERT: Instead of being able to \\"grow up\\" or at least \\"suck it up\\" and move on, both men are destroyed when they are disillusioned about the object of their adolescent romantic fantasies.Read both of these novels and see for yourself. Maybe they will also help you to learn some things about the pitfalls of adolescent fantasies that often can give folks a false idea of love and a thousand other things.Then, for an encore, you might try reading Flaubert's MADAME BOVARY or Tolstoy's ANNA KARENINA."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"This book affected me more than any book I've ever read except the Bible. I read it at 17 and didn't notice the flaws, but then read it again at 33 and saw how bad some of the sections were. I haven't looked up how old Jack was when he wrote this, but I assume he was still a kid. Some of the sections really made me dislike him personally because I assume that the hot-headed behavior and ignorance of the main character was really how the author himself felt and acted.However, Jack London did make it clear what life and existence would really be about if there was no God. The main character begins by having never really thought about life. Then he begins to get to the bottom of things and sees that we are animals and nothing more, and that everything is meaningless. I believe the Bible, but Jack is the is the only author I've ever read, or person I've ever heard that was a real atheist and didn't try to hide himself from the implications of that belief. I respect that. He doesn't paint a rosy picture and he doesn't try to keep from seeing the horrible truth of a universe without meaning; he looks directly at it. He did this a little bit in \\"The Sea Wolf\\" but his best expression occurred here in \\"Martin Eden.\\""},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"It has taken me thirty years to realize what this novel is really about. I believe, like every talented wordsmith, Jack London instinctively went for the most natural ending for his book. You see, the way I look at it, Martin Eden's only goal in life was to become a writer. And he did it. He achieved his only goal. And then what? In a way, his life cycle was finished after that: been there, done it, nothing else to look forward to. That's the mechanism behind his depression I think. I'm sorry if it sounds as if I'm rambling and I'm not sure if I can explain it, but in a way, this book shows the danger of going for one's dream. Once the dream comes true - that's it, end of story, there's nothing else worth living for. Had Martin found a new profound goal for himself, he could have overcome his depression. But he didn't. I was never happy with the ending: Martin helps everyone by making everybody else's dreams come true and still can't help himself. But his life was over because he replaced living with striving for one goal. Once he achieved it, life lost all meaning. I love this book and I thought I knew every word in it but I never thought it was this deep and realistic."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"I have read several of Jack London's works and I consider this as my favourite. The struggle of the main charater (Martin) to get an education and become a writer is narrated so well by the author that I really had a hard time putting this book down. The plot is very simple: Martin Eden is a sailor who lives in Oakland California at the end of the ninteenth century. When he meet Ruth through her brother, he falls in love with her at once, eventhough she is a rich university student while he is an uneducated orphan that lives with his step sister and her husband. Martin deciedes to get an education so that he can get closer to Ruth. He starts to study grammar and to read heaps of books. eventually he decides to become a writer. The story of Martin striving to make it as a writer is very similar to that of London himself.

Period."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"I'm fairly new to Jack London's work, first hearing of him through his science fiction contributions. After reading his excellent novella &quot;The Scarlet Plague&quot;, I then read some of his short stories about the Alaskan wilderness before coming across &quot;Martin Eden&quot;.This is an autobiographical novel describing a young man, Martin Eden, and his long struggle to improve his standing in society. At the beginning of the story Martin is inarticulate, rough around the edges, and awkward in the presence of those he initially believes to be socially superior. When he meets Ruth Morse, a young lady of elegance and education, Martin's life changes. Impressed by Ruth's knowledge and apparent wisdom, Martin decides he wants to &quot;make good&quot;. It turns out Martin has a hard road to hoe.This is an inspiring novel of a man who, while experiencing intellectual growth, endures poverty, hunger, rejection, and all manner of hardship in his efforts to succeed as a writer. Fame and fortune seem a long way off. Because we know the story is based on Jack London's life, we can be certain that Martin's persistence will eventually be rewarded. But what comes after success? And what's it all worth?&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is a long journey of hope, bitterness and triumph. This is about a man who doesn't give in to adversity or yield to the conventions that society imposes on us. That makes Martin something rare. Most of us do get forced into that traditional pattern of drudgery and routine, of being slotted into a safe, sensible job with a comfortable salary, because that's what society expects of us. The pressure is hard to resist. It will be a long time before any of this changes. I think this book also says something about society's shallowness.&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is a fine novel. I may be stating the obvious, but stories about people who started with nothing are much more interesting than stories about heirs to a fortune."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"Anyone who has written a novel and wants to see it in print should read this novel. Seriously. Poor Martin pinches pennies for postage money, types up his manuscripts, dispatches them in the mail and waits. When he inevitably gets them back, he mails them off to the next publisher on his list. Martin Eden is the perfect example of what it means to write for the public today. This tenancious, and realistic, routine eventually pays off, but the ordeal, as well as some difficulties in his love-life, has taken its toll. Martin becomes one of the bitterest cynics in all literature. The story moves at a fast clip and culminates in a shocking and heart breaking end. Unlike many of London's superb novels, this one will appeal mostly to adults--not that it is particularly racy; it just deals with adult problems and situations. Word has it that this is the most autobiographical of all London's novels."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"In recent months, I've been reading the works of Jack London.

All of these titles are offered as free Kindle books on Amazon. By far, \\"Martin Eden\\" seems to be London's masterpiece, although I certainly haven't read all of his works. Various others here have given a description of the story but I'm glad that I didn't read those too closely prior to opening the pages. I wanted the story to be fresh and just as I don't want to watch new movie trailers, I don't want to know the plot of a book beforehand. I had never heard of this book so wasn't sure what I'd be reading only that it was highly rated by other Amazon customers. Now that I've read the book, I happily returned to this page to see what others before me had to say and to add my 5 stars.Spoiler alert: Please stop reading now if you'd also like to read this book with no preconceived notions.I'm glad this wasn't the first of Jack London's works that I read because I was able to see autobiographical parallels of the real Jack London to the fictionalized Martin Eden as the story went on. Certainly some of the very works I read by him in recent months had to have been snapped up for publication, just as Martin Eden's works were, regardless of their merit. Certainly threads of his other tales and life story overlap in this book. I would have been more disappointed by some of the other works I read by him after this powerful piece, too. His depiction of Martin's struggles to better himself to become worthy of his love interest, but which developed into a crazed study and work schedule with only 4 hours of nightly sleep; later deepening into anger and serious depression just when his dreams were finally coming to fruition; and finally an unpremeditated suicide wish, seem to lay out symptoms of a young man developing manic-depression (bipolar disorder). At the start, I never imagined that it would veer off into such a dark and tragic ending. I ached for him to find peace and happiness from the start of this tale to the finish! This was a very engaging work that one can probably not help to think deeply and long about well after the final page has been read.I'm glad that Amazon offers many classics for free on the Kindle as I probably would have hesitated to break the spine of this book if I chanced an old volume on my shelves. Also, I'm thankful that my Kindle is loaded with 2 dictionaries as I found frequent need to consult them when happening upon somewhat archaic vocabulary I was unfamiliar with.

Jack London incorporates a lot of his incredible life story into this book.-Ian Holzhauer"},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"Jack London, a writer, journalist, adventurer; a tough man and a hopeless romantic. Although he is primarily known for his stories of adventure dealing with the Gold Rush, the Wild West and North, and of course for his marvelous novels with animals rather than people at the center of attention - he was also a great writer in many other respects, his &quot;Martin Eden&quot; being the best example. Slightly autobiographical, &quot;Martin Eden&quot; remains the single grand achievement of Jack London, one of the saddest books ever written, which made me notice that although most books end well, it's not always the case. How I wished the ending was different! And then I realized that some stories simply cannot end well, just like in real life events are more apt to destroy us rather than strengthen us, not to mention the fact that happy ends seem as real as fairies. Many people read books to escape from reality, to find that one place in the world where things turn out how we wish them to turn out. While I cannot deny this inherent human need, and I myself am not free from such wishful thinking, I seem to need brutal realism as much as I need consolation, among other things. &quot;Martin Eden&quot; shook me terribly when I was just a young moose, and since then I have read this novel several times, including the original English version, and it firmly remains among my favorites.Realistic this novel is, as are many books dating from that period, where the XIX century trends were still firmly instituted in the imagination of the turn-of-the-century generation, despite numerous efforts to revolutionize literature undertaken at about that time. Published in 1909, &quot;Martin Eden&quot; offers a wide array of topics and themes, all convoluted in a compelling, classical narrative. Firmly set in the aforementioned realism, depicting the society with brutal, unforgiving eye of the commentator, at the same time the novel is an apotheosis of idealism, as romantic, naive and detached as any other idealism out there. A young man serves at the sea, and at one point he meets a young lady from the &quot;upper middle class&quot;. In time, their relationship deteriorates from brute force attraction based on instinct, from cheerfulness and spontaneity to a grave series of misunderstandings based on the divergence of expectations one holds with respect to another, the more they know each other, the more so, to finally loathe in their lover what attracted them in the first place. &quot;Martin Eden&quot; is one of the most beautiful and touching love stories ever written, the more so because of its frankness which never borders on postmodern exhibitionism which plagued literature of the XX century.&quot;Martin Eden&quot; served London as a tool of social commentary, and thusly he expressed his disappointment and disapproval for the social class divisions, and as many before and after him, painted the bourgeois black with a fervor worth of any young radical. Nevertheless, as much as this sensitive socialism dated since then, it's a pleasure to read compared to what goes for literature almost a hundred years later, the journalistic socrealism of ideologues who imagine that they are writers. More generally, it's a sad fact that the XIX century essentially ended in 1914 with the outburst of the World War I, in all dimensions, including literature. &quot;Martin Eden&quot; thus may be considered as the last breath of the good old times that are never going to return."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"While living for a year in the former Soviet Union, I was often told that a favorite professor's or respected friend's most-admired author was -- Jack London. When I responded that he was known only vaguely by my generation as an adventurer and a ruffian, my Soviet friends gently shook their heads and regarded me as an ignoramus.My spotty education aside, I did recall London only carelessly through some snaggly-toothed wolf in a novel of his, read in junior high and not afterwards. Nearly a year after I'd returned to the states, I still hadn't re-read London, and had left my comrades' advice somewhere to rot in a long mental list of &quot;Authors I Must Some Day Read.&quot;On my birthday, then, I was strolling through book-store aisles with my boyfriend, trying helplessly to choose just one tome for a special gift. Hillman? Oh, no. I'll buy that myself, regardless. Nietzshce's &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra?&quot; As a birthday gift? Too silly.London's name cropped up into my mind, only half-so, and I dug vigorously through the L's until I came up with his &quot;Martin Eden.&quot;&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is a beautiful book -- not granted its proper throne in history.I'm not sure if London was pre-judged as an adventurer, if readers really didn't challenge themselves to dip below his surface - I'm no literary historian - or if, perhaps, if his politics played a role...it's silly to speculate.Regardless, &quot;Eden&quot; is a daring - if not entirely successful - critique of modern philosophy's most potent force: Nietzshce. It's also a historical novel, a coming-of-age, and a wealth of human insight. His big finish is, yes, overstated. Perhaps because he didsn't ultimately triumph over Nietzsche. But he gives a good right hook and a terrific read.Editor's note: Enough to rouse a former student and former reader back to a voracious love affair with words.Here's to Jack London! Cast aside by my generation, may his wild socialist self rise again!"},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"I loved \\"sea wolf\\" but didn't really understand why until I read Martin Eden a few weeks later; then instantly, at the unwanted ending of Martin Eden, I saw the dying of Wolf Larsen as the necessary end of a life of transformation. I can't think of this book without seeing the enforced slavery and punitive changes in the \\"second critic of America\\" on the sealing ship as an allegory for Jack London's own painful and wilful revolution into an author, and so as a variant of Martin Eden.As Larsen and his first mate struggle for life on the deck of the derelict Ghost, it is a foregone conclusion that the writer and critic will triumph, since Wolf is really trying to kill himself and cannot, even after passing the best of himself and his knowledge and experience into these alien hands.In \\"sea wolf\\" Jack London triumphs as a writer only by destroying his primitive self and uniting with a female alter ego. In Martin Eden, Jack shows that he really is only Wolf Larsen at heart, and cannot under any circumstances break away from his past without destroying himself.Ah, some things are not worth their price.Read these two books together, in any order, and preferrably in several orders to discover America and yourself, if you had to give up anything to grow up ..."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"I picked this up out of curiosity after a male co-worker raved about it being one of his favorite books in high school. The love story is extremely moving, as is Martin's determination to succeed, however at times London seems a little self-absorbed (the image of Cher slapping Nicolas Cage in &quot;Moonstruck&quot; comes to mind: SNAP OUT OF IT!!!); this did get a bit tiresome toward the end. It is definitely NOT the same Jack London I remember from school (Call of the Wild, etc), and that in itself makes it well worth the read."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"In MARTIN EDEN Jack London used his own life as as plot and cast about for its wider significance. Jack London died by overdose of morphine in 1916. He had suicidal impulses. MARTIN EDEN was Jack London's attempt to deal seriously and vigorously with important ideas. The forward notes that the novel is realistic but the metaphysics of the book are predominantly naturalistic.Martin Eden thought of himself as a wild man-- a wild man brought home to dinner. He had defended Ruth Morse's brother from bullies. He borrowed Swinburne and Browning from Ruth to read. Ruth felt that Swinburne was not quite correct. He lived with his sister and brother-in-law. He thought the man, Bernard Higginbotham, a brute. The many books he read served to whet his unrest. He felt an enormous distance separated him from Ruth Morse.He had always led a secret life in his thoughts. Martin saw Ruth at the theater. In his reading he was baffled by a lack of preparation. He attempted to read books that were beyond him. When he returned the books, Ruth noticed his pants were pressed and he seemed less rough. She wondered how to help him. His speech was uncouth.In compliance with her desires he studied grammar and etiquette. His swift development was a source of surprise and interest. The remodelling of Martin's life became a passion with her. Then he shipped out and read Shakespeare and did not even contact her right away when he came back into port.Martin planned to write. He wrote three thousand words a day and at the end of the week contacted Ruth. He bought a bicycle to accompany her on excursions. He heard Herbert Spencer quoted several times by orators and philosophers at City Hall Park and commenced to read his books. Martin was surprised that Spencer was very little read.He came to see his rejected manuscripts as pitiable children and hired on to work at a laundry in a resort. The description of the work in the laundry is admirable. Martin returned and began work again on his writing. Ruth's mother considered him an inappropriate beau.Ruth thought Martin's poverty was Lincolnesque. His landlady, Maria Silva, poor herself, knew better. Ruth appeared at the Silva house. He had been reckless enough to write to her to tell her that he had pawned his suit. Ruth saw the sordid face of poverty.Martin began to have some small sucess. He still suffered and starved and his behavior at a gathering at Ruth's house reflected his state of overwork and under-nourishment. He lost Ruth. His family did not support him. Eventually he had great success and Ruth came back to him, but he said it was too late. He said he was the same person her family had disliked. He left for the South Seas.Reading Jack London is akin to reading good science fiction. He portrays an entire separate parallel universe."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"This is an autobiography, as Martin Eden's initials M.E. clearly indicate. It's about the artistic work ethic, and all true artists should read it."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"As an individual ages from adolesence to retirement age, Martin Eden and other works of Jack London, though unchanged from the original printing, bring different meaning and worth to the individual. Jack London and other great authors of the period such as Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, share unparalleled triumph in their individual genre and a shared tragic consequence of death. As a teenager, Martin Eden served as that triumphant underdog that nestles in many teenagers of some 50 years ago. Yet those teenagers, many of who grew up before, during and after World War II, have come to know personal tragedy. The tragedy of Martin Eden (autobiographically speaking)takes on more of reality to those past generations than perhaps the present generation. Nevertheless, the story is timeless albeit bittersweet. Martin Eden could well serve as a primer for those individuals who have yet to read his more classical tales of Sea Witch and Call of the Wild. Those were raw boned and sometimes brutal times he described. A reader may be surprised at the reality in the novels but should accept there is more fact than fiction as Jack London did indeed experience or witness much of these tales"},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"And being an angry young man is not a completely bad thing.

London captures the paradoxical pursuit of human life and happiness with Eden's story."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"MARTIN EDEN follows the rise and fall of a young sailor who by sheer force of will educates himself and succeeds in becoming a famous writer (this is London's autobiographical novel, published in 1909, when he was thirty-three and the most popular living writer in the world). Few readers liked it then, they found it dark and depressing after a certain point; they wanted the entertainment they were used to from London (&quot;Come on, Jack, give us another story with dogs and snow in it!&quot;). Not as many read it now as should, and London himself disdained the fact that it inspired many young writers without talent to follow Martin Eden's example. But it is also a valuable story about a young man maturing in his conception of love as regards the opposite sex:\\"Ambition soared on mad wings, and he saw himself climbing the heights with her, pleasuring in beautiful and noble things with her. It was a soul-possession he dreamed, refined beyond any grossness, a free comradeship of spirit that he could not put into definite thought.\\" -- The youth becomes a man.London's prose is straightforward and vibrant, much like the author at his best. Martin Eden falls victim to the vicissitudes of his fame and fortune, much like the author at his worst (too much hard living is often given as the reason for London's death at forty). London spends a lot of time in this book criticizing American materialism in the way that materialism ought to be criticized. He also displays a certain kind of American work ethic (five hours of sleep a night, perseverance through failure, etc.) that sometimes doesn't know what to do with itself once it achieves success. We should all have that problem--just hope that we deal with it better than young Martin Eden does. A very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"\\"Martin Eden\\" is my fifth foray into the works of Jack London. Although I don't find the excitement within that was apparent in \\"Sea Wolf,\\" the passion is certainly evident. I have read that \\"Martin Eden\\" inspired more bad writers to sequester themselves with paper and pencil in unheated attics than any other book, and it is easy to determine why. Eden's obsession with learning and then creating the immortal printed word -- after falling for a woman above his class in society/socialist-conscious San Francisco -- is a powerful force that London expounds convincingly. Then, without warning, the sage advice \\"be careful what you wish for, it may come true,\\" rears its ugly head. London also includes a line about ghosts that should be a classic, but isn't, and his description of a suicide ranks as the best of its kind. A WORD OF WARNING: Do not read the foreward until after. It tells too much of the story and robs some of the author's intended suprises. This is unforgivable. May the publisher rot in hell."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"If you are looking for pleasant summer reading, pass this one by. It ain't pretty and it ain't pleasant, but it ranks as one of the Great American novels of all time. Was it autobiographical? You betcha. More so than most airbrushed autobiographies of our time. Jack London was the first author to awaken in me the love of the printed word. I was 9 years old. The title that awakened me was Call of the Wild. I, like Marcia and everyone else, thought that Jack London was just an aborigine, wandering around in the vast metropolis and utterly lost. Years later I read The Sea Wolf, and my opinion changed.I no longer thought of Jack as an aborigine, but as a refined young man, rudely abducted from the civilized world and forced to accept the law of the strongest. Later still, I read Martin Eden, and I was devastated by the tortured visions of that same young man who was tranfigured by that experience and who was no longer acceptable as a member of civilized society. There's a whole lot of bitterness in Martin Eden, folks! And, the more I read of Jack's life, the more I am convinced that it is autobiographical. The fact is that Jack became a monster. At the same time, he became the most successul novelist of his time. In terms of money, we can only gasp at the financial success he enjoyed. He turned out novel after novel, and each of them was gobbled up by a hungry public. In the end, the SAME PEOPLE who had rejected him because of his crude mannerisms and calloused knuckles sought him out because of his MONEY. Do you really want the brutal truth about Jack London? And are you really prepared to weep for one of America's great sons? If so, then read Martin Eden. Otherwise, pass it by."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"In Martin Eden, Jack London provides the portrait of a young man who thirsts for knowledge, for self-improvement, to join the upper ranks of the intelligent and cultured within his society. We seem to be setting off in a \\"Jude the Obscure\\" direction. Martin loves a young woman from this society, and strives to make himself worthy. His chosen vehicle from his class and station to hers is self-education, and then the writing of serious and important work. Along the way, Martain has to swallow the unpleasant truth that those he believed to be so intelligent were actually entirely superficial in understanding. Pieces of London from other novels come through. London's belief in the \\"superman\\" comes through, as well as his disdain for the oligarchs, for example. What is most striking, however, is the dead-on skewering of celebrity worship. \\"Where were you when I needed you\\" might be Martin's refrain. The same people who ignored and derided him suddenly can't get enough of him. Why? He was the same person he was before. It was simply because other people told them so. They all just want a piece of the celebirty, to be associated with him somehow. While in real life London of course courted celebrity, the stupidity of this is blindingly apparent and even more important nearly a century later. London readers may miss the absence of the \\"Charmian\\" strong female counterpart in this book (unlike in the Sea Wolf or The Abysmal Brute or Mutiny on the Elsinore, for example). The \\"classy\\" love interest doesn't measure up in terms of independent intelligence or strength of will, and her last appearance is particularly troubling. Lizzie, from the lower socioeconomic classes, has the spark but is too held back by her upbringing. This is truly an important book."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"This definitely isn't the type of a book I would expect from Jack London but in my opinion should be regarded higher in achievement of his work, even more than &quot;Call of The Wild.&quot; While &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; is just concerned with the Spencerian and Darwinian 'Survival Of The Fittest' side of Jack London; &quot;Martin Eden&quot; represents the many sides of London: The poet, lover, seaman, self-willed individualist, philosopher, socialist and tormented writer. After reading &quot;Martin Eden,&quot; all I can say I am angered that this book isn't considered an American classic. I would say it is in rival with Eugene O'Neill's finest moments.I do not want to dwell so much on the plot because I do admit the plot is nothing new but it is the writing that counts. Simply put it, it is about a seaman who gets turned onto the world of class and literature and rigorously fights for mastering both worlds by spending all hours of the day and being frugal with money to achieve his dreams. As we later see, Martin Eden realizes the falsehoods of The American Dream and Individualism. While the back of the book claims that this book is an attack on Individualism, that is very curious because Jack London himself aside from being a Socialist, was an individualist and adapted the Nietzchean idea of Will to Power. This book was written around the time of &quot;The Iron Heel&quot; so I suspect London was going through his socialist days. This is such great writing that I would never consider myself an individualist but I felt myself throughout the book inspired of Martin Eden's will power and ambition. As a writer, I wanted to send my work to magazines after reading &quot;Martin Eden.&quot;&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is truly an American masterpiece of Literature and should be more widely read. Anyone who still thinks Jack London is a writer for kids and Darwinists must read &quot;Martin Eden&quot; and you shall see that his was an indispensable writer in all regards."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"This is the American version of \\"Hunger\\" - an author striving to succeed despite background and social status. There is desolation within this text, a longing fraught with energy unbound. The pulse of desires roars here. Eden is the near-transparent mask of the young Jack London himself. Reading it, the educated reader will be reminded of the philosophies of Nietzsche, Herbert Spencer and Schopenhauer. Social Darwinism, the Will-to-Live, the Will-to-Power all resonate here.But in the long run, the philosophies are just part and parcel of the story. \\"White Fang\\" and \\"Call of the Wild\\" are excellent books, easily accessible. London, in my mind, is the Great American Author because his writing doesn't exclude readers, young and old can enjoy him. As for this work, \\"Martin Eden\\", it is a dark horse compared to his earlier works, perhaps prophetic of Jack London's later life.If anything, this novel is about success, its consequences, and what we sacrifice to achieve it. It also concerns the inner madness of attaining a goal, how nothing else seems important. Books will come go, but this book continually moves with me, a perennial home on my library shelf."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (The Fitzroy edition of the works of Jack London)","review":"I think that every book falls into one of a few different catagories. It either sucks, is entertaining, or changes your perspective. &quot;Martin Eden&quot; ranks in the highest of all posible catagories for changing my perspective. I tried to read Jack London on a number of occasions and just couldn't get into him. His stories would rate as entertaining at best. I don't know why I picked up Martin Eden, but will forever be grateful to the forgotten soul who recommended it. Martin Eden is different because of what is barely under the surface. In my opinion, it's less a story than a philosophy. After I read it for the first time, I was struck by the parallel to Plato's &quot;Allegory of the Cave.&quot; In it, Plato warns of the price of enlightenment. Once you have seen the light, you can never go back to seeing things the was you did before. You will isolate yourself from everyone. Plato seems to say that ignorance is bliss, and London seems to agree. In the novel, Martin is stricken with the desire to ascend in class stature after meeting a high-class, late 19th Century San Fransisco family. He is enamored with the ease with which they debate social politics and wants to attain what he first sees as their level of intelligence. His vehicle for attaining their acceptance is to become a writer. To enrich his meager knowledge of these subjects he becomes an arduous reader of everything that he can get his hands on. In the process, he comes to realize that he has gained a true understanding of liturature and social philosophy, whereas everyone else merely talks with a false air of understanding. At one point he realizes that, in his quest to become an intellectual equal, he has surpassed them. It is after his meteoric climb in intellect that he realizes that he is alone. He also realizes that the people he so eagerly sought to emmulate did not shun him because of his lack of intellect (for their own intellect was merely a thin veneer), but because of his lack of money. In his separate but related quest to become a successful writer, he is frustrated by every publisher's inability to &quot;get&quot; his ideas. His inability to publish, despite his hard work, leads his love interest, high-born and condescending, to abandon him. She has no faith in his ability to achieve fame as a writer and he has no disire to settle down into a 9 to 5 job to placate her socialite parents. After some time apart, he does succeed in getting published, and not unlike the breaking of a dam, fame and fortume follow soon after. Upon learning of his fame, she comes running back, ready to make him the centerpiece for conversation at her family's socialite dinner parties. He rejects her and tries to return to the companionship of his earlier days as a sailor. Like in Plato's story, he finds that he cannot rekindle the bond that he once had with old friends, and is alone.While the story is an interesting case study into the nature of intellect and society, it is also a looking glass into the social scene in a major city during the turn of the century. The reader learns that the beat poets were around long before Kerouac and Ginsburg. This story is full of information -- social, political, historical, and intellectual.

Everytime I recommend this book to a friend, they ask, \\"Who's it by?\\" \\"Jack London.\\" \\"Jack London! The author of call of the wild?\\"Well, yes. He's the one, but wait!, this book is like nothing else Jack London has ever written, and bears scant semblance to his Sea Wolf or Call of the Wild. In short, this is serious literature (advance apologies to Call of the Wild and Sea Wolf fans), and it's worth reading.This book reminded me a lot of Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome (another wonderful book). Both begin with hope, engage in change, and end in pathos. Martin Eden is a self-educated, self-made man (see why I say it should be in the American canon?) who attempts to garner the love of a young college student who pushes him out of what she sees to be his stifling chrysalis and become more like her and her fellow intelligentsia. The plot thickens when he does not only this, but surpasses them all in erudition with a passionate, eager mind, a more eager heart, and lots of hard work, all in the name of love. And then in the book's climax, he decides to ... oh, I can't tell you that. You'll hate me, and I'll ruin the book for you.What I can tell you, however, is that if you go to a bookstore, and pay full price for this book, you'll love it and feel that you've gotten a good bang for your buck.

Here London shows that he is equally adept at setting a story in an urban landscape by chronicling a landed sailor's attempt to become a self-taught writer, no easy task for a man who has lived the rough and vulgar life of a sailor. But Martin is extremely persistent in spite of all the obstacles he faces. Everyone including his friends, family, and classy girlfriend question his ability to make such a transformation from a nobody to a somebody. It's hard to imagine anyone being as devoted as Martin is to improving himself, and it's a bit intimidating seeing how much devotion it can take to achieve your dreams. Knowing that London used his own life story as a strong inspiration for Martin Eden, you expect that Martin will someday be successful, yet the results of all his work are still unexpected. With enough reading, learning, and life experiences, do we all eventually take Martin Eden's point of view? That's a question this book still has me thinking about months later."},{"Title":"Madame Curie,: A biography","review":"This is a book I recall reading as a school girl about another girl in far away Poland who aspired to study at University in Paris.

Back when few women were scientists, she won the Nobel prize in both chemistry and physics. As a native Pole living in the oppressive Russian Empire, she and other Polish students were only able to study their native language in secret. Fortunately she was able to complete her education and training in France. This biography, written by her daughter, is full of love and admiration for her remarkable mother. It is amazing to think that Marie Curie had to first learn how to separate the radioactive element Radium from its native ore in order to study its radioactive properties--hence the reason why she won the Nobel prize in chemistry as well as in physics. In those days scientists had to develop so much more of their techniques and equipment by hand, and did not have all the grad students and assistants that prominent scientists have today. Marie Curie did so much of this work with dangerous radioactive material that she eventually died from exposure to radiation. She named the radioactive element Polonium in honor of her native country--noting that \\"Polon\\" is the name for Poland in French.I actually read this biography in French when I was a high school student over 40 years ago.

Born in Poland, she has a very tough childhood and adolescence in which both her oldest sister and mother die. Her father, M. Sklodovski is left alone to raise her and her three siblings.

Marie Curie was the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in France, the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and the first person to receive two Nobel prizes. The work she accomplished under the most difficult situations for a scientist is truly inspiring. When asked why she and her husband, Pierre Curie did not patent the procedure for extraction and purification of radium, something which would have made them very wealthy, she said &quot;No, It would be contrary to the scientific spirit.&quot; How refreshing, since in today's world the first thought of scientists is patenting their discoveries."},{"Title":"Madame Curie,: A biography","review":"This is one of the books that will remain closest to me...the kind of book I would definitely have on my own children's bookshelf. I unfortunately had to stop reading the book midway because the library wanted it back, and I was also going to be out of town. Three months later, I still felt compelled to go back to the library and finish off the remaining two or three chapters.The book is a detailed account of Marie Curie's personal and professional life. And who better to tell this story than Eve, her own daughter. The genius in Mme. Curie was a direct result of her dedication to hard work and an amazing work ethic. From a peasant Polish family, she faced many challenges and postponed her own education and worked for a wealthy family to help pay for her older sister's education. Such was Marie's spirit and selflessness - which extended to her research and her work in science.Her creation, radium, was the ultimate criminal that led to her untimely death, when she felt she still had a lot to accomplish.

Some books embed themselves in my mind, and this is one of those books. Decades after my last reading of it, I discovered that I still knew some of its sentences by heart.Who was Marya Sklowdowska? The baby of a Polish intellectual couple's family, born into a nation occupied and oppressed, who was taught to love freedom. A devoted sibling who worked as a governess to help support her older sister, Bronya, so the latter could study medicine in faraway Paris, even though it meant putting off her own journey there to study physics - the subject that fascinated her. A dedicated student who became an equally dedicated scientist, and then the wife and working partner of another scientist: Pierre Curie.The co-discoverers of both polonium (named for Marie Curie's always fiercely loved native land) and radium worked as a team, and became Nobel laureates as a team. Early widowhood devastated Marie, but it did not stop her from carrying on that work. She accomplished incredible things during a lifetime shortened by her discovery's then largely unknown dangers, and she spent that lifetime holding true to the ideals she had shared with Pierre.I have read other biographies of Madame Curie, including a recent one that drew on materials even her daughter could not use. This remains the most readable and the most moving. First published in 1937, it remains in print well into the 21st Century for good reason.--Reviewed by Nina M.

This book is one that will make you want to be the best you can be. It opened my eyes and made me realize that anything is possible.

The senior Linton is killed by a jealous \\"unknown\\" lover and the mother takes her own life. Before passing, senior Linton had somehow instilled the belief of an \\"eye for an eye\\" into his son. Therefore, Lord Linton spends his adult years planning the confession and downfall of the woman who took his father's life and caused his mother's suicide.Lord Linton hires Miss Sarah Armistead, a wellborn-lady-actress-by-necessity, to help recreate events and circumstances leading to his father's death. Although Linton is rather dark and cold, we see an occasional flicker of good. Sarah seeks to reach him and free his soul from misguided revenge.There are some implausible situations (of course) and Lord Linton's vulnerabilities might have been better developed along with the story's resolution but, as far as Regencies go, this one was not bad or great; the writing flowed well and it kept my interest. 3 1/2 stars"},{"Title":"A Passionate Performance (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I'm afraid the performance is neither interesting nor passionate.

Camilleri's books were translated into English by Stephen Sartarelli and provide abundant footnotes explaining Italian culture.I would highly recommend both series."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"To be brutally honest: as a mystery novel, this is sub-par. It flounders around for almost two hundred pages where nothing much happens to advance the plot. As a glimpse into the mindset of Venetians, it was excellent. This is no gleaming Disney fantasy of sunken palazzos and romantic singing gondoliers - workaday Venice is a cold, gray, cynical place.Brunetti is struggling to do an honest job as a police investigator despite incompetence and corruption. His world is dominated by a public distrustful of the government, divided by classism, jaded by endless greed and collusion, and surprisingly, with a social stigma toward people with disabilities.No doubt these books aren't very popular with American readers - there is no Scooby Doo moment at the end where everything is tied up in a neat little bow. More time is spent on socio-political dissatisfaction than the mystery - however, as a lover of Italy, I look forward to reading more by this author."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"Via Amazon - Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditionas described, packaged well.Would use again."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"This fine novel succeeds in enlightening the reader as to Commissario Brunetti's ongoing internal struggles to be true to himself while doing his job to the utmost of his ability. We glimpse his angst when a boy of his own son's age, a cadet at a prestigious military school, is found dead in what appears to be a suicide. As usual, local politics rears its ugly head almost immediately, and eventually Brunetti is emotionally wrung by the anguish of the boy's parents as they struggle to come to terms with their grief. The writing is as usual elegant and sometimes hauntingly beautiful."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"Donna Leon tries something new in Uniform Justice. Typically she doesn't leave a lot of loose threads hanging. However, in this book, the ending is troubling and causes the reader to think a lot about what justice could have been applied in this case. This book will be with you long after you put it down.The book centers around the apparent suicide of a prominent public figure's son at an exclusive military academy. The closed world of the academy serves Leon as a metaphor for the closed, corrupt nature of much of Italy, and leon uses the metaphor extensively. Her books almost always have just as much social commentary as it does police work. In this book, she delivers the best social critique of the whole series.And it's a good story. I thought Leon did a terrific job of describing life in the academy, and the smug sense of entitlement that many of the cadets feel. Of course, we also have all the usual hallmarks of a Donna Leon novel: near travelogue descriptions of the sights and sounds of Venice; comfy views of Brunetti family life, especially around the dining table; and the byzantine workings of the Questura where Brunetti works. These are all handled well.Recommended strongly."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"A middling Donna Leon mystery is better than just about anyone else's best, but I must say that \\"Uniform Justice\\" left me quite disappointed. The actual whodunit side of her novels has never been Leon's strong suit; instead she excels at creating atmosphere, and her characterizations are marvelous. (Brunetti and Signorina Elettra are two of my favorite mystery characters ever.) In \\"Uniform Justice,\\" however, the mystery is perfunctory at best. We all know that the young Moro didn't kill himself, and by mid-book we pretty much know why (if not by whom) he was killed. When we do find out, it's not that much of a suprise, nor is much done about it. Perhaps this is an aspect of the Leon mysteries that is beginning to wear thin for me: the Italian judicial system is so rife with corruption that rarely are the killers brought to justice. All her books seem end the same way, with no-one being punished, nothing being accomplished by Brunetti's investigation. So what's the point? Part of the satisfaction of crime novels is the pleasure of seeing the wicked punished. When they never are, it leaves me, as a reader, feeling that the whole enterprise was something of a waste of time. With each new Leon novel, I resign myself to the fact that no matter whodunit, it won't really matter. So from page one my expectations are low. I would love to experience, just once, the \\"wow\\" I feel at the end of a Michael Connelly or Magdalen Nabb mystery. Leon seems to be in a formulaic rut. I suppose it's proven successful for her -- but not necessarily for me."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"I bought all the Brunetti books through The Girl of His Dreams at one time (having just discovered the novels) and from Uniform Justice on, they get progressively worse. Leon has become wildly anti-American to the point of absurdity, pulling out every sterotype imaginable. Plus she focuses on the environment to the extent of forgetting what sort of book she is writing. Once, for a theme, is fine; time after time is just distracting. But most of all, from this novel on, she forgets that books must have an ending. From Uniform Justice through the next six books I read, she has no sense of justice and the books essentially end with the rich and powerful literally getting away with murder. Once, like in Uniform Justice, okay, but enough is enough. No matter how much Brunetti is a compelling character, his wife has turned into a nutter and the books are depressing. Read the series through Wilful Behavior, then stop."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"When you read a 260 page book (or at least when I do) you don't expect to be excited by every page. But, you shouldn't have to wade through the first two hundred before things start to get interesting. Up until then all we have is a questionable suicide and a mysterious shooting.The suicide happens at a military academy where many of the children are the offspring of military families. Some of these families are also related to industries that manufacture military material. The suicide is the son of an ex-MP who had written a 'white paper' on the health industry and was supposedly working on one on the military.Just after the MP made it known as to his new 'white paper', his wife is shot in a 'hunting accident'. It appears that the accident happened but that she was the intended prey. After her recovery, the wife separates from the MP, his daughter is sent to school out of the country, and he decides to resign from politics. His wife doesn't believe that the son killed himself, while the father seems to have given up on life.With the help of Signorina Elettra and her able computer, Brunetti finds a financial web that ties military procurement officers to military purchases and stock transfers. But when Brunetti finally is able to break the military wall of silence he hits a stone wall with the 'confession' of the probable murderer. Once again, the ugly head of the Italian bureaucracy and the interwoven triad of nobility, military and government are able to frustrate justice and Brunetti.There is way to much complaining about the corruption of Italy, both the government and the military; and the way that most Italians just shrug their shoulders and turn away. Leon spends way to much time banging our heads against a wall where we all know there is no solution to the problem as long as the Italian constitution isn't revised.Zeb Kantrowitzzbestblogaround.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"Uniform Justice doesn't match up very well to the excellent Wilful Behaviour that precedes it in this fine series. In the best books in the series, you find a great deal of layering where one character's life and reading provide dimensions to the meaning of the other characters' lives. That layering is mostly missing in this story, and Brunetti's investigation seems more ham-handed than necessary. The resolution will please few readers, as well.A hung-over student in a military academy fears he's seeing an oversized bat in the bathroom where he goes for relief from his thirst. Upon closer examination, the \\"bat\\" turns out to be a dead cadet who is dead by strangulation. Is it suicide? All indications point that way except the words of his aunt. Naturally, Commissario Guido Brunetti begins to investigate as though it's a murder. Undoubtedly, having the dead youth be similar in age to his son has something to do with that decision.But it's not such a serious investigation. The father refuses to talk to him, and he doesn't dig into the background of the family or of the military academy very seriously. Vice-Questore Patta is friendly with the head of the school which makes matters somewhat more difficult.But due to the connections of Signorina Elettra, the outlines of an alternative theory begin to develop. With that theory in hand, however, Brunetti blunders more than once.The story's other problem is that the scheme that Brunetti ends up investigating doesn't seem all that probable in some of its more extreme dimensions. The family's reaction to the plot also seems more than a little unlikely. As a result, I found it hard to take the story seriously. It just didn't ring true.Be careful of the enemies you make."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"Another Italian mystery with unexpected twists and turns for Brunetti to follow.

At the end the question in you mind was: 'That's it? That's all there is to this?'This one was different. It is one of those books that keeps you up at night because you want to read a few more pages before turning out the lights. But then you reach the end and you are appalled. I won't give away the ending but it will offend your sense of justice.Donna Leon's books have two parts. One part is the mystery. That is fiction. The second part is about Italy. Because of her extensive experience there, that is fact. The picture of the venality and corruption she paints in her books has taken some of the shine off the impression I got from a three-week tour in 2012.I wanted to go back but now I'm not so sure I will."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"I did not like the ending.

Leon always complies. In her books you learn as much about Italy and its love/ hate relationship with tourism as you do about the characters and the book's plot. In this novel you also learn about troubled family relationships, corruption on a regional and local scale (always a recurring theme in the Brunetti mysteries) and the difficulties all families face in protecting their children from the hate that seems ever present in today's world. Add to this the satisfying glimpses of Italian culture, food, and day-to-day life and it's as though you've been there with Brunetti as he unravels yet another puzzle. But the answer to the mystery is never the solution to the problem in Leon's novels and so it proves again--a bittersweet ending of the kind we have come to expect from Leon and her thoughtful and conflicted Brunetti."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"Donna Leon's twelfth Commissario Guido Brunetti novel does not begin with a bang; instead, it begins with an apparent suicide, a hanging.For all intents and purposes, the death of a young cadet at an exclusive Venetian military school certainly must be a suicide.

And so good. ..."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"I've happily read all the Donna Leon mysteries, and enjoyed them from the beginning, although less and less lately. I recognize the author's right, to a point, to push her views through her characters, but the books have become so \\"anti-\\" that I have trouble enjoying them. Death of Faith was little more than a bitter anti-Catholic rant. And Uniform Justice does the same for the military, painting all military members of all countries as ultra conservative, brainless, immoral, borderline (or worse) facists. The many anti-American and anti-tourist comments (a true but over used cliche) are also harder and harder to get past pleasantly.The series has degenerated into little more than bitter ranting, and left character development and intricate plot twists behind. Donna Leon seems to have had five or six good stories to tell, and is now just filling paper and lining her pockets with her reputation.I'll miss these books, the first five or six were so pleasant, witty, and fun."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"The military, and political corruption are the targets in Commissario Brunetti's twelfth outing. Once again there is the lovely backdrop of Venice - that city of contradictions, yet it seems with each Brunetti novel Venice as a character is fading more and more. I wish Leon would bring it back to prominence. Although the 'whodunit' here is not difficult to guess, the ending still comes as a surprise. One of the pleasures of the Brunetti novels is in watching the workings of his mind, and how he deals with moral ambiguities, and those ambiguities are at the heart of this novel. Another pleasure is seeing the role his family plays as he solves the puzzle. His wife Paola is as integral to these books as Brunetti himself. The Brunetti novels are way above what one finds in other mysteries these days, and is highly recommended. However, I could have done without the presence of the author's subtle and not so subtle jibes at politics in the United States."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"I was told once that the difference between Europeans and Americans was perspective. Americans are optimists ; while Europeans are realists. I submit this novel as evidence.In this police procedural, a student is discovered dangling from the ceiling in the dormitory shower at an &quot;elite&quot; military school in Venice. All signs point to suicide, but Commissario Brunetti's innate instincts give him reason to question that diagnosis. Thus, author Donna Leon follows Brunetti and his colleagues as they piece together evidence of murder and conspiracy.Author Leon is acclaimed and well-respected in Europe, having received the Silver Dagger award for fiction in the United Kingdom. She writes well, to say the least. Her main character Brunetti has a heart of gold and a deep cynicism toward Venetian politics and military. His love and other Venetians' love for family is played here against a backdrop of dark hatred and a lust for power that permeates the perpetrators of a young man's murder.Brunetti despises the military and Italian politicos. He describes a history of government by bribery and power brokers. He shows its toll on everyday Venetians and the deterioration of Venetian society. He holds out little hope for correction of this morass. And in the end, this morass prevents the kind of satisfactory ending that marks most American mysteries. Evil defeats good.There are some great characters in this book: a police secretary who has the access to information and the ability to analyze it that will make any librarian proud ; a lovable teddy bear of a detective who turns to a beast at the right moment ; a stubborn, highly-principled and grief-stricken father of the victim ; and Brunetti's long-suffering and supportive wife who provides a moral foundation for this novel.But the humanity of the characters cannot outweigh the fatalistic realism that looms over this novel. Readers of European fiction who do not need a happy ending will enjoy this book for its quality. But American readers accustomed to justice being served will be terribly disappointed."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"I was rather disappointed by this book. The mystery starts off as rather interesting, but one sees the solution quite early on. What gets very tiresome is the continuous political preaching. Ms Leon is entitled to her opinions, and I do not mind their being mentioned occasionally under the guise of a character's beliefs. But this was really too much: it is supposed to be a mystery, not a political platform."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"Donna Leon has done it again. Yet another masterpiece. Few writers are so adept at describing the uniqueness of the locations where their stories are set. Moreover, she writes well about corruption endemic in Italian politics. We can see how a person such as Silvio Berlusconi can become Prime Minister in spite of his his many \\"crimes\\"."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"This has been a summer of unusual reading, and the latest book I am reviewing here, \\"Uniform Justice,\\" reflects my recent fascination with all things mystery and thriller. Prior to this summer, this genre is not something I would usually consider. However, I have discovered a lot of great writing so far, and this book is a good example.Leon's book, \\"Uniform Justice,\\" is part of a series based on Comissario Guido Brunetti. However, when I read the book, I wasn't even aware of that fact, so it's clear that the book stands alone, to be enjoyed without any previous encounters with Leon's work. This story centers on the supposed suicide of a young cadet at a military academy in Venice. The academy resents any interference from outsiders, particularly those of the Venice Police and Brunetti. The story enlarges once the boy's family becomes involved in the investigation.While there is plenty to enjoy on a good mystery storytelling basis, the book's real pleasures can be found on many other levels as well: first, it is a love song to the city of Venice, its buildings, people, and food. Second, the story closely follows the life of investigating Commissario Guido Brunetti and his own family life (he has a son the same age as the victim); particularly interesting are the accompanying office politics of his job. Finally, the story is an examination of the Italian way of doing things (manners, politics, bribery, and corruption).This is a very interesting book, even for readers who don't consider themselves mystery fans. For setting alone, the book is worth reading, but I think, like me, you will find yourself on the lookout for other Comissario Brunetti tales once you finish this one."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"If you like international detective stories and don't know Donna Leon's series starring Commisario Guido Brunetti then you're in for a treat.

It was a distinct pleasure to listen to the narration by Anna Fields, who unfortunately passed away at a young age in 2006. Subsequent stories are being read by David Colacci, who is a fine reader, but has ruined these stories for me. Of course he can't read 'the same' as Anna Fields, but whoever's producing these new audiobooks should have at least told him not to drastically alter the characters. For instance: This book is set in Italy, and obviously everyone speaks Italian. Anna Fields read Brunetti & almost all the other charcaters without accent, only giving Brunetti an \\"Italian accent\\" when he would use a phrase in English. Then, it was appropriate that he have an accent as he was not speaking his native tongue. David Colacci reads EVERYONE with an Italian accent. Brunetti now sounds like an Italian gangster.It's very tiresome to listen to an entire book read by an American imitating an Italian accent for every character. And Patta's title, Vice-Questore, was read as Vi-chay Questore by the first reader, and now is read as Vice (English pronounciation) Questore (Italian word & proununciation.

I consider this assessment a plus rather than a minus. Apparently we have become so accustomed to seeing everything as a half-hour sit-com (with time for commercials), that we can no longer deal with any situation that is not presented to us as a neatly tied up package. I am glad that author Leon has not bowed to this commercial pressure and has instead created a novel that reflects current, not TV reality. Also, I find it refreshing that the main character is a decent, thoughtful man who has a strong, loving bond with his wife and kids instead of the formulaic rogue cop/PI/ex-cop who drinks too much/recovered alcoholic and who is estranged from his kids &amp; wife &amp; or/ex-girlfriends and is too emotionally damaged to sustain his current/past marriages/relationships. It IS disheartening to see corruption prevail and criminals go unpunished (why don't people get this upset about Enron?). But, eventhough evil seems to prevail, there are people who still retain their integrity and do what they can, families still treat each other with affection and respect and, as Brunetti's wife, Paolo, says, \\"love trumps everything.\\""},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"Donna Leon's twelfth novel is a real murder mystery. And for a reader who dearly loves her earlier books, that is not necessarily a good thing. In UNIFORM JUSTICE, the gloom of winter, a young man's sinister death, a mean-spirited military academy, and the desperation of an honest man in a corrupt system all mix to form the general air of despair that pervades the book. In earlier Brunetti books there are many little rays of sunshine, comforting antidotes to crime and corruption. Yes, Guido Brunetti is always busy solving a nasty murder, but the romance and beauty of Venice; tidbits of Italian culture,art and history; the warmth of the Brunetti's family life; and, how could I forget, the delicious descriptions of Paola Brunetti's Italian cooking offer reminders that life is beautiful.Not that I'll quit reading Leon! I am waiting in line for the next book(s)! But armchair travelers, beware. This book strays into darker and darker territory. You can still use your map of Venice to figure out where Brunetti is and what he sees,and you can still enjoy Paola's food, but it won't be quite as much fun."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"A mystery equal to if not better than Simenon's Inspector Maigret series, UNIFORM JUSTICE lives up to the author's well deserved reputation. Set in modern Venice, it is replete with translatable Italian (telefonino, Carabinieri, Signora, si), well rounded characters and a plot that moves, though a little slowly, with riveting intricacy.Commissario Brunetti becomes involved with a young cadet's suicide and he finds himself up against a military obstinacy equal to Jack Nicholson's character in A FEW GOOD MEN. This mystery brings the reader into the Italian home, takes you to lunch (yum!) and lets you suffer the frustrations of a modern police officer in a very political world. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"Donna Leon, originally from New Jersey, has lived in Venice, Italy, for twenty years, as lecturer, professor, and finally mystery writer/student of Baroque music(and she actually motivated me to buy a CD of excerpts from Handel's operas). As of 2006, she's written 16 Commissario Guido Brunetti mysteries, all set in or around Venice.First thing to be said is, she knows the place: its geography, weather, people, houses, jobs, transportation, politics, smells,feel, food, and death, and no, not in that \\"Death in Venice\\" (by Thomas Mann) way. Her Venice has little in common with the beautiful, ethereal city celebrated so frequently in song, story, and movie, and so fondly remembered by multitudes of tourists. Her Venice is where Venetians live and work.Commissario Brunetti is a melancholy and cynical man, made tired by endless infighting in the top-heavy Italian police bureacracy; and by many disappointments in dealing with what he sees as the self-serving corruption of the Italian power elites. Only the domestic warmth of his family: wife Paola, a hereditary contessa born to one of Venice's oldest families, who chooses to teach, cook, and to espouse left-wing causes (that often sound as if her creator might also support them); his children Raffi and Chiara, and many good meals, enables Brunetti to stay centered and to continue fighting the good fight.Many people feel that Leon relies too heavily on stereotypes. Her view of Italy as a whole reflects the country that certain liberal bohemias love to hate. She sometimes slows the action of her books to express her political views. \\"Uniform Justice,\\" particularly, can be viewed as being a bit too full of political digressions. Leon may also be accused of choosing the subject matter of her books for political reasons; of painting all southern Italians as dumb and dishonest, all Venetians as intelligent and honest, all American tourists as fat and crude, and all women under 35 as beautiful. There's some truth to all these criticisms.In \\"Uniform Justice\\" Brunetti is sent to the upper-crust \\"San Martino Military Academy,\\" where Cadet Ernesto Moro has been found hanged in the boys' lavatory. The school, man and boy, prefers to think Moro a suicide, and whispers various nasty habits of his. They close ranks against Brunetti, as they do against all outsiders, particularly the low-born. However, Brunetti doesn't think the cadet's death is suicide, and digs doggedly until he can prove the cadet's death is murder. Furthermore, the death is directly attributable to the self-interest and corruption of the Italian elites, and to the weakness of any countervailing powers, such as the boy's own family, that might have saved him. But does Brunetti imagine he has liberated Italy from this kind of business? No, sorry, no can do.It's a really sad story, and I particularly liked the fact that Leon doesn't ever forget that murder, violent death, is tragic, and in the case of a young person, doubly so. If you don't mind a gritty Venice, one where the gondoliers don't sing night and day, this book, and this series, may be for you."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"In \\"Uniform Justice\\" a seventeen-year-old cadet apparently commits suicide at an exclusive Venetian military academy. Donna Leon's incorruptible Commissario Brunetti, our favorite Venice sleuth, is called in. The boy's father and mother are dodgy and scared. Some of the cadets are uncooperative and arrogant. You get the feeling early on that some of the boy's academy mates are up to no good. Brunetti is again joined in the story by his loving wife Paola who displays her disdain for the military and insists the boy wasn't a suicide (as does the boy's mother). Brunetti has a son, Raffi, about the same age as the dead boy.\\"Brunetti realized that not much he had seen could persuade him that the military, either Italian or foreign, was much different from the Mafia: dominated by men and unfriendly to women; incapable of honor or even simple honesty beyond its own ranks; dedicated to the acquisition of power; contemptuous of civil society; violent and cowardly at the same time. No, there was little to distinguish one organization from the other, save that some wore easily recognized uniforms while others leaned toward Armani and Brioni.\\"Leon, as usual, takes her time telling her story with long interviews that seem to go off on a tangent. Brunetti is a patient dogged investigator, and the reader should be patient too because it will pay off. The ending will surprise you.Brunetti learns in this book, as he does in others in the series, justice doesn't often triumph, if by justice we mean bringing the perpetrators before the courts, getting a guilty verdict, and seeing them punished. The corrupt and evildoers often go free while thumbing their noses at their pursuers. Brunetti's professional life is often thankless and fruitless while his personal life is gratifying and deeply meaningful. Leon is not afraid to deal with the cruel ironies of life.As usual Brunetti has to put up with his superior, the corruptible and unprincipled Patta, and his \\"headlong pursuit of power.\\" Patta, as is often the situation, chastises Brunetti and tries to pull him off the case, but Brunetti outwits him. \\"The ethical Patta was an eel.\\"The omniscient, computer-savvy police secretary Signorina Elettra is always there with answers, and her many discoveries seem barely credible. The plot involving retired military officers gets Byzantine, but this is a satisfying investigative journey with many insights into the human condition."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"Donna Leon is a first-rate mystery writer. Fans of the canned mystery novel, where nothing but the villains' names change need not apply. Commissario Brunetti is a fully realized protagonist -- full of idiosyncracies, strengths, weaknesses, etc. Her vivid depictions of supporting characters is also a refreshing development in a genre full of hacks.Most of all, her Venice is enthralling -- beautiful, mysterious, but also flawed and corrupt at the same time. Uniform Justice is a real treat -- really looking forward to getting into this series!"},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"I did not feel this book was as good as others. However, this is still one of the best series I've read in a long time. The writing has reminded consistently good, unlike the Anne Perry series in which the writing deminished to such a level that I can no longer read her booksAlso, has anyone noticed that the books seem to get more and more cynical as the series moves forward -- Patta gets dumber and Venice and Italy more corrupt?S"},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"This is the first book by Donna Leon I ever read. I feel involved with the subject for a few reasons: I am Italian, I have lived in Venice and, moreover, I am an alumnus of Collegio Navale Francesco Morosini, which is grossly portraied in the book as the San Martino Academy.I enjoyed the literary skill of Donna Leon, but this is all.I read that, although she has chosen to live in Italy, she shuns publicity and refuses to have her books published in the country. No wonder: she obviously settles for what she has achieved. She has concocted a successful formula for making money by providing international public with an exotic, yet realistic setting for her police stories, stuffed with wholesale and one-sided criticism leveled at the Italian society. Although she lives in Italy, which certainly shows through from her topographic accuracy, she appears to be a total alien to the country. Her book is also overflowing with hostility against anything military and displays an understanding of the environment next to nil and charged with prejudice. One of the features of my school was that, in spite of being tough and selective, it contained a cross section of the Italian society, not just the top of the establishment. Furthermore, whoever knows the Italian Navy, who runs the school, will agree that it can hardly be accused of social preferences."},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"Donna Leon's latest Commissario Brunetti case is one of her best!From the opening pages, which quickly sets the tone, \\"Uniform Justice\\" is fast-paced,extremely exciting, and quite gripping. It is difficult to find an author today who is better!A young cadet at an exclusive Venetian military prep school has been found hanged in hisdormitory. The school quickly has it proclaimed a suicide, but Brunetti knows otherwise.He and his team of loyal members of Venice's police department quickly begintheir investigation--an investigation that, once more, leads us into the power structures of\\"the Pearl of the Adriatic.\\"Leon is never slow to touch up socially significant issues and she plows into this one atgale force. \\"Corruption in Things Italian\\" seems to be her middle name and she pulls nopunches. One would imagine that the Italian military and even some of its other \\"sacred\\"institutions will not view this book (nor her others!) in pleased frames of mind. Still, Leonis one of the most popular American novelists read abroad today (in fact, even her recenthard-bound copies are NOT published in the US for some really strange reason!).Again,\\"Uniform Justice\\" is Leon at her best and Brunetti doing what he does best--solvingmurders. An excellent read!"},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"For whatever reason, Donna Leon has become almost hysterically anti-American with every book. Some of her asides about the United States are becoming both tiresome and unneccessary. If she wished to write political commentary books, then do so. But the obvious left-leaning rhetoric is become a bit of a bore as our Brit friends would say. As for the offer for her latest, &quot;No, thanks.&quot;"},{"Title":"Uniform Justice","review":"This book was so disappointing. Leon writes fairly well but she yearns to write a political commentary more then a murder mystery. In her anti-american/anti-military bias she makes her chararcters look ignorant and provencial.

Although this book is a made-up novel & has a plot involving terrorists, it really gives a lot of good information about what most agents deal with on the border.

I discovered and benefited tremendously from this book while trying to understand and intend to follow a path for purification of soul. It helped me introduce to Frithjof Schuon's writings in simple language and also brought to me metaphysical discipline in a straight forward vocabulary. Although, this book is written with a Christian reader in mind, I (a Muslim) still benefited by relating most of the discussion while keeping Islamic and Sufi symbolism in mind.Dr. Cutsinger approached this book by addressing several fundamental questions that one can expect from a curious mind (who has received the blessing to start to hear the Call) and he did a good justice in answering these throughout the book. He also kept various audiences (e.g., skeptic, serious seeker) in mind while explaining metaphysical view-points very clearly.I am looking forward to read his next book on Prayer (based again on Frithjof Schuon's writings). I felt a test of writings of Seyyed Hossein Nasr (who has also written several books on similar topics but more from Sufi and Islamic view-point) while reading this book."},{"Title":"Advice to the Serious Seeker: Meditations on the Teaching of Frithjof Schuon","review":"I do not have anything to add to the card catalogue description of the book, available above. I only want to say that for those friends of mine who have read the book a few times, they have all been helped on a deep level to think more clearly about the nature of faith and religion. Truly it is above all a relationship with a living person (or three!).I would also recommend &quot;Every Branch In Me&quot;, which bulids upon the same themes found in this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Advice to the Serious Seeker: Meditations on the Teaching of Frithjof Schuon","review":"I have read Cutsinger's book and found it a truely heart-opening, spiritual experience. Cutsinger, an Orthodox Christian, is also a metaphysician who understands the reality of things. His book thus speaks perennial truth beytond any particular tradition or school of thought. I, as a Muslim, found the book to exude truth in every page.Cutsinger provides a comprehensive summary of the metaphysical teachings of Frithjof Schuon. Schuon's works are, to the uninitiated, dense and difficult to read. Cutsinger provides a good introduction to Schuon. The book will loosen many mental knots and open the mind to new realities which can make reading Schuon's works more profitable. Think of this book as a commentary on the teachings of Schuon-written by a scholar who guides you step by a step in what is a very personal journey (reading this book felt this way to me).Cutsinger writes beautifully. His book fills an extremely important need in the modern world where the writings of Schuon are likely to be shunned by readers used to reading junk material for quick consumption. Buy the book, it will be a treasure to pass on well after you depart. A wonderful primer to the beauty that is the sophia perennnis."},{"Title":"Advice to the Serious Seeker: Meditations on the Teaching of Frithjof Schuon","review":"A wonderful introduction to Schuon's teachings.

Trust me, it is not! But if you didn't know that, you would probably miss most questions involving prime numbers. So if you like loosing points because your prep book was full of errors, go ahead and buy this book, nobody will stop you.Besides that, the practice exercises, and again I'm referring to the quantitative section, are too easy and don't reflect the level of the real GRE with regard to difficulty and timing.Finally, the CD-ROM contains about the same information as in the book, so don't expect too much of it.If you are serious about studying for the GRE I would recommend that you use Barron's &quot;How to Prepare for the GRE test&quot; which is terrific, and of course you want to practice on official tests published by ETS."},{"Title":"Arco Master the GRE CAT 2003 (with CD-ROM)","review":"I've been spending the past few weeks studying for the GRE.

I mean, men and women all go through many of the same trials and triumphs during recovery, but as I say, we woman are just built differently. That is not to say that all women will experience all of the moments considered in this book, but in my opinion, there were so many aspects of recovery detailed in this book that many of us will be able to relate to. In early recovery, it is so good when we learn that we are not unique in our madness. We aren't the only ones who did incredibly stupid, mortifying to remember things. It is so refreshing when we can hear someone else say something to which our reply can be,\\"ME TOO.\\" \\"I can't believe someone else felt that way!\\" This book should help women to realize that they are not alone and their feelings, WHATEVER they are, on any given day are OKAY!

Many different types of people are depicted: soldiers, clergymen, nuns, noblewomen, peasants, etc. The plates of military dress are particularly interesting; in addition to showing knights' armor and other clothing, the illustrations also show many different weapons. Horses in regalia are shown in addition to human figures. Also depicted are musical instruments.The pictures include both individual figures and scenes depicting costumed figures in social interaction. Some famous people, like Elizabeth I of England, are depicted. There are some really colorful and ornate items, like elaborate ladies' headdresses.

Actually, the movie does a reasonably good job of following the book, although it leaves a lot out and makes quite a few changes. A master carpenter named Anthony, whom everyone calls Maestro Cherry, comes across a piece of magic wood. He gives it to his friend Geppetto, a puppeteer who fashions a puppet whom he names Pinocchio. The puppet immediately runs off. Geppetto chases him and is put in jail when he tries to punish his wayward puppet. When Pinocchio returns home, the Talking Cricket tries to warn him about the error of his ways, but he kills it with a hammer, though it reappears two or three times later as a ghost.Geppetto gets out of jail, but instead of going to school Pinocchio wanders off again to see a puppet show and is taken by the puppeteer Swallowfire who eventually releases him and sends him back to Geppetto with five coins. However, Pinocchio meets the Fox and the Cat, who talk him into going to the Field of Miracles in the land of Boobies where they tell him he can plant his five coins and they will grow into thousands. The two swindle him out of one coin for dinner and then leave him at an inn. When Pinocchio goes out to find them, they disguise themselves, try to rob him, and eventually hang him. He is saved by a little girl who turns out to be \\"the fairy with the blue hair.\\" She invites him to live with her and even sends for Geppetto, but he follows the Fox and Cat again and loses his coins to them. Later, after several other adventures, he returns to find that the little girl has died and shortly after that learns that Geppetto went to sea in search of him and was lost, perhaps swallowed by the great shark (not Monstro the whale) swimming in that area. He even ends up with his friend Candle-Wick in \\"The Land of Toys\\" and turns into a donkey. Will Pinocchio ever make it home? Will he find his Papa? Will he see the Blue Fairy again?It appears that Collodi, penname for Carlo Lorenzini, originally had not intended the novel as children's literature. However, the first fifteen chapters, at the unhappy ending of which Pinocchio dies a gruesome death by hanging, were serialized in a children's magazine between 1881 and 1883. At the request of his editor, Collodi added chapters 16-36, in which the Fairy rescues Pinocchio and eventually transforms him into a real boy. The entire story then was published as a book for children in February, 1883. Thus, it allegorically deals with some serious themes but in the end Pinocchio acquires a deeper understanding of himself, making the story suitable for children. The original English translation was made in 1892 by Mary E. Murray and is used in the Penguin Classics edition (2002). The Puffin Classics edition (1996) uses a translation by E. Harden. New York Review Books published a new translation in 2008 by Geoffrey Brock. The Oxford University Press edition that I bought has \\"an authoritative new translation\\" by Ann Lawson Lucas. I suppose that Lucas's translation is all right, but instead of leaving Gepetto's name as it is, she translates it as \\"Old Joe.\\" Personally, I think that I would have rather read Murray's translation. All in all, I enjoyed reading the book. Though a little grim at times, it does teach some important lessons."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","review":"This is a classic and deserves to be on everyone's book shelf, young and old. Carlo Collodi wrote the Pinnochio story in 1881 and in book form in 1883. Over the 127 years since then there have been many versions published with several different illustrators but to me the best is the original, illustrated by Attilo Mussino. His 300 color illustrations are wonderful depictions of Italy of that time. He goes beyond mere illustrations. It's art! The Adventures of Pinnochio was published in the U.S. in 1925. There have been several reissues since. I missed out on a 1928 copy of this book at an auction but was so impressed with the contents I looked for it on Amazon and was fortunate to find a seller offering a 1989 hardcover at a good price and in like new condition!

Murray and illustrated by Fritz Kredel, and published by Grosset and Dunlap. Since Amazon elects to combine the reviews of several different versions of 'Pinocchio' under each of the product pages, it is sometimes difficult to tell exactly which version goes with which review. To the best of my knowledge, this version is not abridged nor edited, and was first published in 1946.Well, here's another read-aloud-before-bedtime book, though truth be told, it didn't rise to the same level as some of our other attempts. I enjoyed reading it, with its variety of characters, which gives me an opportunity to indulge in some limited stagecraft, but I think my daughter was only semi-enthusiastic. She seemed to respond well to some passages, though some others were surely a little beyond her.(She's almost nine)'Pinocchio', as translated here, should not glibly be assumed to be suitable for all ages - some children may be bothered by its images, such as when Pinnocchio is hanged by the Fox and Cat, or when the puppets friend, Candlewick, after being transformed into a donkey, is literally worked to death. Other times, the writing is geared more toward an adult's understanding, and the humor is a trifle more complex than what I would assume most young children are capable of - several scenes were clearly over my daughter's head. I don't want to scare anyone away - I never thought there was anything inappropriate in the book for us, but everyone has different opinions on that matter. If you feel your children are especially sensitive, you may want to preview beforehand, and then make your own judgment.Still, 'Pinocchio' has many things going for it. The movie follows the high points of storyline fairly well - if you've seen it then you know the basic plot here as well - but the difference is how it reflects its times as opposed to the sanitized film sixty years later. Carlo Collodi's version may be a little too gritty for some parents - unless they are ready to explore more textured worlds with their kids - but it still toes a moral line. And I believe the exposure to the oddness of Pinocchio's world - which would have been fantastic, but not odd in Collodi's time - is enriching in our too-homogeneous world.Well worthwhile, but like many classics, it is a product of its time. Some respond better than others to that - for my daughter, it ended up as an 'I like it' rather than 'I love it'.A quick note on the edition: This is a very nice book for a youngster, sturdy, and with slightly larger print than usual. That last fact is also nice for an oldster like me. The illustrations by Kredel are mostly black-and-white, studded throughout the text, with a few full color plates taking up an entire page. Without other translations to compare it to, I can only say that I didn't notice anything that sounded too peculiar, other than a decision to translate the puppet theater owner's name from Mangiafuoco to the literal Fire Eater. Altogether an attractive addition for a child's bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","review":"Pinocchio is one of the most beloved and recognizable of all children stories characters. The story of Pinocchio, written by Carol Collodi and originally published in 1881, has been published, republished, retold, and adapted countless times over the last 130 years. However, most people today are probably primarily familiar with the adaptation (and the depiction) of Pinocchio from Disney's movie. It is nonetheless always instructive and worthwhile to go to the original story because, in my opinion, most attempts to \\"improve\\" any given story inevitably end up subtracting rather than adding to its value.This is an inexpensive, short and very readable edition of the Pinocchio story. It is an excellent opportunity for anyone to get reacquainted with this talking marionette, and an even better chance for all those who have never read or seen the story in the first place. The original story is much more colorful, but also darker, than the more recent adaptations. Pinocchio, Geppetto and other characters often get into physical confrontations. For the most part these incidents are amusing, but they oftentimes quite literary result in a loss of life or limb. Reading the original story also brings forth the fact that \\"Adventures of Pinocchio\\" was very consciously written as a morality tale. Its aim is to teach children (and especially boys) some of the basic character-building lessons: it's important to obey your parents or other authority figures, it's important to study and work hard, chasing after easy life and cheap thrills inevitably ends in a disaster. The forcefulness of such admonitions may seem a bit quaint today, but I for one think that they have a place even in the modern world.Overall, this is a very fun little book that people of all ages will enjoy reading."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","review":"Pinocchio is one of the most beloved and recognizable of all children stories characters.

This is the French fairytale that I read first, the book that was handed down to me from my Grandparents and given as a gift to them by a family friend; the illustrator Charles Mozley- who knew my Grandparents intimately. The personal description from (as my mother called him \`Uncle Charles') was touching, and the stunning hand drawn illustrations, add that real special element that makes this book so unique.*unlike the first edition that is listed on Amazon, the copy that I own is the first one made and hand-illustrated by the artist before being put into print*The tale is about love, friendship, loyalty and honesty and which certainly is memorable as to remain with you throughout childhood and into adulthood with its clear message. Heartwarming, affecting and so powerful this emotive narrative will have you in tears, as you experience such a rollercoaster of events within this compelling read. The love between flesh and blood, father and son is quite remarkable and like most family's it is something that can never be quite equaled to. Nor is the value of knowing right from wrong and understanding the importance of selflessness, thoughtfulness and how in life one should put others first. At times this book I found scary as a young child (around 5 yrs old when my mother first read it to me at bedtime), especially when the young boys who were corrupted were transformed into Donkey's! It is a journey of a lifetime, a character-driven tale with some distinctive characters (i.e. Cricket), dramatic and full of intensity that has you glued to the pages - this is something truly astonishing and heartwarming.Pinocchio is a young boy and whose egotistical mannerisms and lying, has the most severe consequences; such as being turned into wood and his nose growing longer and longer... His father loves his son so much and only wishes that he could become flesh and blood again, but for this to transpire Pinocchio must learn to be a good boy. As he leaves home and embarks on the most extraordinary, horrendous and unexpected of adventures where he almost looses his life this young boy takes note of the depths of his father's kind heart and the power of love.This particular edition, 1959, is so special and which is something that shall remain within my family for generations to come. Complete with such stunning illustrations by an artist who was a close friend of my Grandparents (who were also well-known artists themselves), this is something to treasure and which one cannot compare to the printed, contemporary editions of today. The story is something quite unforgettable and outstanding, that which is loved by generations both young and old and which reminds all of us the important things in life. I would recommend this as a first book to read to your children, to your nieces and nephews and for your own personal pleasure...For when you wish upon a star, dreams really DO come true!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","review":"No other Pinocchio would do for my six year-old grandson, who hung on the conclusion of each chapter like his life depended on it. I bought him a paperback edition to take home with him until I could order this version, illustrated by Roberto Innocenti, so he could have his own copy of the one I was reading to him.My grandson agonized over Pinocchio's conflicts between his sincere desire to be good and his stray impulses. Whoknew the tale of a little woodenhead becoming a real boy could be such a cliffhanger! Innocenti's illustrations are outstanding."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","review":"Pinocchio is a classic story, and a very different one than the saccharine Disney version most Americans are familiar with. Carlo Collodi's 1882 book lays out the story of a wooden puppet come to awkward life, who proceeds to act out on every selfish, crude and obnoxious impulse ever known to childhood. Each bad decision brings sorrow to his \\"father\\" Gepetto and his \\"mother\\" the Blue Fairy, and brings a terrifying consequence to the puppet -- in the course of the book his feet are burned off, he nearly starves, he is attacked by robbers, he is sent to prison, he's nearly fried as a fish, and he's transformed into a donkey to be sold for money.With each consequence, his penitence for foolish behavior is more real. At the beginning of the book he's the kind of child who sells his schoolbook, purchased by his father's sacrifice of his winter coat, to go to a marionette show. By the end of the story, Pinocchio is the kind of boy who leaps into the sea, risking his life to save his father from a monstrous fish. This gradual transformation culminates in Pinocchio dreaming one night that the Blue Fairy comes to him saying,In return for your good heart, I forgive you all your past misdeeds. Children who love their parents, and help them when they are sick and poor, are worthy of praise and love, even if they are not models of obedience and good behavior. Be good in future, and you will be happy.He wakes in the morning to find that he has become a real boy, with the old wooden puppet limp in the corner.This wasn't originally a children's story, but it is a story about childhood and the taming of childish, reckless impulses. It's a deeply moral tale, often reiterating the importance of working hard, being responsible, and telling the truth. It may open up a discussion about what it means to be a slave to sinful impulses (Romans 6:16-18; Romans 7:21-24), and it confirms the Biblical teaching that \\"folly is bound up in the heart of a child\\" (Proverbs 22:15).It isn't, however, a Christian story, and it lacks the Christian quality of grace which transforms undeserving sinners. The moralism is sometimes quite heavy-handed, and penalties for disobedience are often gruesome. Pinocchio's redemption ultimately comes, not from a power outside himself, but from his own resolve to change when he sees the consequences of his behavior for himself and others. Because of this moral self-reliance, this story may not be a good match for children who are prone to self-righteousness.If you do decide to go with Pinocchio, please avoid the many uninteresting illustrated versions available, and check out Roberto Innocenti's rendition. His surreal, dramatic, and often funny pictures perfectly complement Collodi's vivid style."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","review":"I had this same book as a child and am so happy to have my childhood memories back again. A few pages were damaged but I replaced them by finding a download of each page of this classic online. This is the real deal Pinocchio, not Walt Disney's version. It's worth every penny spent, to me. The illustrations are priceless!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","review":"First off, to clear things up, this page contains a few reviews of other editions of Pinocchio, which should be seperated out by their proper ISBN numbers. This review refers to the 2005 hardcover from Creative Editions. This is a revised version, first published in 1998, this edition features a new translation of the full, unabridged text, more lyrical than some older translations, and quite faithful to the original Italian text. Also, this edition has several additional illustrations, and has been handsomely re-designed. Altogether, I find this to be my absolute favorite edition of Pinnocchio, and I even bought it again, to replace my much-loved earlier edition. I prefer the new translation to the older translation used before, and the addition of more illustrations and the re-design make this a superior edition.I first found this book in a thrift store, and the inscription indicated it was a misguided gift to a young child from his grand-parents... Don't make this mistake, this version of Pinocchio is definitely not intended for young children. Parents may want to look elsewhere if they are expecting a tame children's book. This is a sophisticated and somewhat graphically illustrated edition, and it is not the Disney-fied version of Pinocchio that many people expect. If you are unfamiliar with the differences between the original story, and the popular sanitized versions, you might be shocked at first. The story is actually very dark, brutal, & surreal, and the illustrations of, say, Pinocchio getting hung in a tree, are really too dark for very young children.That being said, I still whole-heartedly recommend this edition for older readers wanting an artistic and unexpurgated version of this incredible tale. This is one of the best modern translations of the text I've read, so I would recommend it to literature students and people interested in Italian folklore over most of the other versions available.The artwork is what drew me to this book when I first saw it. You simply must see these illustrations to appreciate them. The detailed, large-scale, and subtlely colored drawings are a moody and perfect accompaniment to this version of the text. I pick this book up often, just to look at the amazing pictures and re-read some of my favorite parts.Overall, I am thrilled with this revised edition of a book I already considered a classic among illustrated books. I recommend it to scholars of folklore, lovers of sophisticated illustrated books, and curious readers looking for a dark, surreal and wondrous book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","review":"I grew up in Italy and this is the real Macoy. Every Italian grows up reading Collodi's masterpiece while looking at Attilio Mussino's illustrations. This is the Pinocchio we imagine. When I first saw Disney's Pinocchio, I was shocked! So cute and kind... there is nothing to learn from the Disney video. Collodi's Pinocchio, on the other hand, is a child who lacks every sense of altruism, who needs to be educated. Collodi wrote various children's books, always with a pedagogical intent.This is a book for parents to read with their children. It helps remind parents that an apple needn't be peeled, and it helps kids eat the apple with the peel. If you're having problems with your first grader, this is a pedagogical and fun book for all the family."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","review":"I own several copies of Pinocchio both English and Italian texts, and this is one of my favorite translations as Ms. Lucas takes great care with conveying the original intent of Collodi's story and characters -- (even down to the translated names used for the characters). I'm not sure what the previous reviewer was referencing, (it may be the review from the library school journal--which may have been an abridgement for grade-schoolers, no longer in print)(???). If you find a copy of this book, I'd recommend buying it. It has the full 36 chapters, the original illustrations by Mazzanti, and extensive notes at the end. A lot of care went into this project, better than most other unabridged translations currnently available."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","review":"Carolo Colloid is the pseudonym of Carlo Lorenzini (1826-1890), an Italian journalist whose translations of French fairy tales in the late 1870s became so popular that he wrote his own, \\"Le Avventure di Pinocchio\\" (The Adventures of Pinocchio) in 1881 which went on to become a children's classic around the world and in 1940 was the basis for the animated film by Walt Disney. Now a new edition of this magnificent and imaginative fairy tale has been superbly illustrated by Roberto Innocenti with intricate artwork of museum gallery quality. This is the original story that includes all of Pinocchio's travels including getting ambushed by vile assassins, strung up in a tree, drowned in the sea, nursed back to health by a beautiful blue-haired fairy, slaying a large serpent through laughter, chained up as a dog to catch thieving weasels, arrested for fighting with classmates, almost eaten by a ravenous fisherman, saving a great mastiff and being saved by the mastiff in return, morphing into a performing donkey, flying on the back of a pigeon, getting swallowed by a gigantic shark, saving Geppetto's life, and so much more that most readers will be completely unaware of if the only contact they've had with this sophisticated story is the Disney movie and the abbreviated children's picture book versions. This simply outstanding and enthusiastically recommended edition of The Adventures Of Pinocchio does full and complete justice to the wonder and storytelling skills that originally made the life and travails of a wooden puppet brought to life so universally beloved."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","review":"My children and I have just completed this book, with beautiful illustrations by Innocenti, as a read-aloud. I have never been acquainted with any Pinocchio other than the anemic, sanitized Disney versions reflected also in the Little Golden Books. The cautions by others to be careful with young children are worthy of consideration, for this book has terrors aplenty, both in words and illustrations, but I find both words and illustrations to be marvelous.I am beginning to \\"open the door\\" to the difficult realities of the world for my children, and find beautiful allegorical literature to be just the ticket. The illustrations are beautifully rendered, but some are also quite scarey. Frequently, a following page will have a small cameo of a detail from the full illustration of a preceding page which draws the attention to that moral heart of a complex picture. I prefer this introduction to the reality of wickedness in the world (in words and illustrations) to the soul-numbing introductions to wickedness rampant in television and movies which give no time for concern for reflection.Some of my favorite themes are emphasized also - the redeeming power of love and forgiveness, the association of both forgiveness AND repentance prior to the resolution of relationship, the surpassing value of wisdom and the often difficult trials that must come before the heart is ready to embrace it.I am especially struck by Pinocchio's occasional recounting of his adventures as the tale unfolds. In the beginning of the tale, his recounting is filled with blaring examples of falsehood and complete lack of self-examination or evaluation. Everything that happens to him is someone else's fault and there is little association of cause and event. As the tale unfolds, however, Pinocchio's self-examination increases in accuracy, and his self-examination also becomes more accurate.I think this allegorical tale has much value for young children, as does Hinds' Feet on High Places and The Pilgrim's Progress."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","review":"Collodi knew how mischievous children can be.He was one himself when he went to school in Flroence.In his later years,he was a school reforms official,and wrote many textbooks.He believed the best way to teach is by entertaining as well.This certainly shows in Pinocchio.The little Blockhead gets into all kinds of scrapes because he rushes into things with little consideration.Pinocchio is tricked by the Fox&amp;Cat, advised by the Talking-Cricket,helped by the Fairy with Blue Hair-and ultimately realizes that if he wants to become a real boy,his inner self must be transformed first.The final chapter is a true indication of how Pinocchio has fully become a son to Gepetto.Collodi's story has many film-television-stage versions,but the original is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","review":"!!WOW!! Was that book great! !!WOW!! It deserves 5+ stars! !!WOW!!Most of the story took place in the woods. It was also on different islands. A little bit was in Pinnochio's house. There was a little bit in a fairy's house too.The main characters were Pinnochio, Geppeto, a beautiful fairy (who becomes Pinnochio's mother,) and Jimmeny Cricket. In the middle of the story there was an evil Cat and an evil Fox.The climax of this story is when Pinnochio saw a grave for the beautiful Fairy. Later Pinnochio found out that the fairy was still alive.If you want to find out what else happened, and the end, you must read the book. It's a real page turner. You'll love it.Reviewed by: Zachary Robert Albertini"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","review":"I understand that for people who only see the Disney's movie this book can seem dangerous, but this is the REAL STORY of Pinocchio.For me (I live in Italy) the story is familiar and I remember to have read it when I was 6 or 7, without any danger of my \\"child psicology\\".Unfortunately, English speaking people haven't seen the wonderful Italian film of Pinocchio of the 70s (directed for the Italian TV by Comencini with Nino Manfredi, Gina Lollobrigida, Franco Franchi, Ciccio Ingrassia and others), that could help people who haven'e read the original book to have another perspective of the story..."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio","review":"I read this book 20 years ago. I can still remember how convoluted the whole thing seemed to me when I was a child. This is the original Pinnochio story, upon which Disney based it's movie. In the book, Jimminy doesn't get past Chapter 3 as anything other than a ghost. The stories of Pinnochio turning into a donkey were very dark, and still leave me wondering about all the symbolism. If you think the story of Pinnochio can be summed up into a morality story about the perils of lying, you only know Disney.

We took it home, read it every night for 2 weeks and he didn't want to take it back. The day we returned it, we went to the book store and got our own copy. When my daughter came along, I ordered a copy from Amazon, as she also fell in love with the story. The Wedding Procession is a lovely go-to-sleep book, telling the story of the sweet Rag Doll who was loved by all, but who chose to marry the Broom Handle. We each have our favorite group from the procession. My son loves the musical soup eaters, my daughter adores the easy ticklers. And my favorites, after the clean ears, are of course the sleepyheads. Children will want you to read this to them nearly every night.

I was delighted to find that this, and other Carl Sandburg stories, are still in print. His clever use of language and image puts him in a rather elite group of writers. Sandburg helped me to develop an abiding love and respect for words and a feeling of expectant wonder every time I open a new book.There are a few children's books that I recommend without qualification.

I like the Appollites!\\"Add to that an ending that makes you roll your eyes, and well, this seems like a half hearted effort. Ms. Kenyon could you PLEASE stop giving us Dark Hunter's who A: actually have a soul and are too dumb to walk out in the sunlight to test it (like Zarek) and B: get a chance to take revenge on the people who wronged them, and yet the forgo it(Like, well, all of the nancy boys)? Talk about wimps!I'll definitely be reading her were-hunter story but when the next DH novel comes out with Valerius, I will be very wary, you should be too."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"After Dance with the Devil I guess it is only right to get one not quite as good. That is my all time favorite. This is a good even great read. Anything by Kenyon is going to be very readable. My only problem with this one is Wulf's obsession with his descendant Chris. I loved the &quot;unanswered &quot; yet intriging questions about Ash, Stryker, and Esspecially Katra. My dislike and even disgust with Artemis and Apollo are growing exponentially with every book. However, I wouldn't miss a one. This world seems to expand so much with each adventure. All of our favorites from other books make a wonderful short stop to visit in this adventure. The humanity and compassion make this one of the must read books in the saga. Kenyon makes us care for people we had come to feel were unlovable. I felt the solution to Wulf and Cassie's problem was a little to easy. But we are left with another great cast member in Urian. A thousand stories I want to know. Guess we'll just have to wait for one at a time. ARRRRRRGH!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"As a new reader to this series, I have enjoyed the series thus far.

Hurry up Amazon and SK!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I had read \\"Fantasy Lover\\" and \\"Night Pleasures\\" and loved both of them so much that I decided to try \\"Kiss of the Night\\" this time. While all of Kenyon's books are a bit absurd dealing with devastatingly handsome, yet troubled men who amazingly can't find anyone to love them except rather plain average women.... they were still hot smoldering romances with a fun plot thrown in for good measure. When I read the premise behind \\"kiss of the night\\" I thought that it would be a bit more of them same perhaps. Not so. Kenyon really got caught up in her world with this one and while I found some of the new information about Apollites and Daimons interesting, I also found the romance in the book suffering because of it. There were just too many lenghty gaps between Wulf and Cassandra's meetings that were filled with tedious information. I am also not into vampires per se. I enjoyed Buffy the Vampire Slayer but am not someone that finds bloodsucking erotic or sexy. I find it disgusting and was disappointed that there was so much of it in this book. While \\"Night Pleasures\\" had been about Daimons and Dark Hunters it never had descriptive scenes of bloodsucking. When the main characters finally resort to it in this book, I thought that I was going to be sick. Rather than a fun, humourous story filled with smartmouthed characters and moments that touch you. This book took itself way too seriously for my taste and quenched any heat or romance that I had received from previous books. This is not going to be a keeper for me."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Not my favorite at all.The characters were good and the details about the Damons and Apollites were interesting, but I guess I was expecting more from the book. I don't have kids, so the whole having-wild-sex-while-pregnant is a little bit disturbing, at least for me. Consider yourself warned."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Wulf and Cassandra are fantastic together! Great twist to this book. Its a must read, it explains alot of things Ms. Kenyon has another winner!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"This is the first and may end up being only book I've read by Kenyon. There are GREAT parts of this book that I did enjoy. Plus, there are little winks, such as one character reading a book written by one of Kenyon's other pen names. There is also some good action in the book.So I don't think the book was a total failure, but if you like to consider the feeling of the whole vs. parts, it's... okay. When I got done with it all, I didn't feel any closer to understanding the mythology she was trying to build. The ending seemed hokey, and overall, despite some fantastic parts of the story, I had a general feeling of dissatisfaction with it all.If you like Kenyon, I'm sure this review won't sway you, but if you're new to her and think you *might* like her, I'd suggest starting with a different book."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I have read all of the Dark-Hunter Novels by Sherrilyn Kenyon and every last book has been an exciting adventure, impossible to put the book down. Kiss of the Night makes you believe that LOVE can conquor all. When I'm fresh out of new books I re-read this one over and over until a new Dark Hunter book is written."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"In this latest of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series, we meet again Wulf Tryggvason, whom we encountered very briefly in Talon's story - in fact, we have the same phone conversation again, only this time from Wulf's point of view. A tiny bit repetitive, but I can live with that. Wulf is a Viking, tricked into becoming a Dark-Hunter twelve centuries ago, and one who carries one additional curse: no-one who is not a Dark-Hunter or an Apollite or of his own family can remember him five minutes after they leave him.Then he meets Cassandra Peters - who does remember him. They share several highly erotic dreams - and then he discovers that she's half-Apollite. An Apollite, who is destined to die on her 27th birthday, unless she decides to become a Daimon. And she's already 26...If she becomes Daimon, Wulf will have to hunt her down and kill her. If she doesn't, then she'll die. And, as if those aren't difficult enough things to contend with, two more problems get thrown into the mix: Cassandra is the last living heir of Apollo, and if she dies, or dies without leaving an heir, the world will end. And then Acheron informs Wulf that Cassandra is pregnant - and he's the father.The fascinating thing about Kiss of the Night is the insight we get - as does Wulf - into the Daimons. Thus far, the equation has been simple: Daimons are demons. Killer vampires who must be eliminated for the safety of humankind. But what makes an Apollite turn Daimon? Well, could it possibly be the thought of dying a long and painful death at the age of 27? And are all Daimons evil? Well, we meet one who isn't - and that's a story I sense hasn't finished yet.Of course, there's also more Acheron, and yet more intriguing hints about who he is, the kind of powers he has and the real power-balance between him and Artemis. In previous books, he's had to dance to Artemis's tune rather more than the other way around, but here he's more forceful than he has been. I have the sneaking suspicion that Kenyon intends to wait as long as possible before giving us Acheron's own story, though.Good book - not a five-star like Zarek's story, but very readable.wmr-uk"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"It didn't take me long to finish reading KISS OF THE NIGHT by Sherrilyn Kenyon, which is the fourth Dark-Hunters novel (not counting the prologue FANTASY LOVER). It was entertaining and action-packed, and included appearances from favorite characters like Zarek, Julian, and (yummy!) Acheron.The plot of KISS OF THE NIGHT revolves around the Viking Wulf Tryggvasen, whom nobody can remember five minutes after meeting him. Wulf, a Dark-Hunter, saves Cassandra Peters from a Daimon attack, only to discover that Cassandra is a Apollite - one of a race that Wulf hunts and kills to protect humanity from is evilness. Not only is she the enemy, but she is also the last direct descendant of the Greek God Apollo, so if she dies, the whole world will die with her. As if that's not enough, Wulf and Cassandra become lovers - with some interesting results.As a Dark-Hunter novel, it wasn't one of my favorites. While it made the Daimons more interesting in that it \\"humanized\\" them through Cassandra's point of view, I felt the overall story was rushed. I also would have appreciated more background and detail about other characters that played important roles in the story, such as Kat, Urian, and Stryker. Kat was a big enigma to me, especially since Acheron didn't know who she was (I also was curious about the identity of her father). Speaking of Acheron, I read this book with the express purpose of seeing him, so I was disappointed that he only played a small role in the end.Also, going back to the background issue ... Kenyon played up the hero's backgrounds big time in her last 4(5) books, letting us \\"see\\" how they lived, who they loved, how they died, etc. Wulf's past wasn't brought up much. I wish it had been, since he was tricked into giving up his soul by the Norse god, Loki. I'm a big fan of Norse mythology, so I would have LOVED to have seen Loki play a role in the story. After all, he owns Wulf's soul. But he never appeared. Not once. That surprises me, since Kenyon loves to write about the gods.Anyway, if you are a Dark-Hunter fan, you'll find this book fascinating just for the detail it gives you about the Daimons. If you've never read a Dark-Hunter novel, DON'T start with this one, for you will be confused. It' best you read the books in order, beginning with FANTASY LOVER, NIGHT PLEASURES, NIGHT EMBRACE, DANCE WITH THE DEVIL (the best one, in my opinion), and KISS OF THE NIGHT."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"After several books in a successful series, you sometimes fear that the books will fall into a predictable formula, but this book proves that Sherrilyn Kenyon continues to be an original! First, let me tell you that I have every one of her Dark-Hunter books and I LOVE them. But Kiss of the Night was the first of the series to make me cry! (and as a life-long reader, that doesn't happen very often at all). I laughed, sniffed and cheered the entire time. The moving story of Wulf and Cassandra shred my heart and put all the pieces back together, but I loved every minute of it. All of the previous books are fantastic, but this book goes beyond the surface story and deals with the darker emotions of despair and anguish that exist below the surface of the world of the Hunter. This is the first of the stories that took me on a roller coaster ride with the book in one hand, and a box of tissues in the other - keeping me enchanted every single minute! This time Kenyon raises the stakes even higher, teasing us with a glimpse into new background characters and stories, and shows her readers that we have only just begun to explore the world of the Hunter Legends! The journey has only just begun!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Super plotting, dialogue, characters... It's a great series, and I swear this is the best yet. Intense. We finally get a chance to get up close and personal with the Apollites and Daimons, the prey of the DARK HUNTERS, and learn new and fascinating information about them. Very cool.The bare bones, the Dark Hunter Wulf must keep the Apollite Cassandra safe from the many factions who want her dead. She is the last in a bloodline that must survive or the world as we know it will perish. She is fast approaching final birthday, and the dark choice of dying in agony or becoming a Daimon is hard upon her. For Wulf and Cassandra, love between them is a bittersweet wonder. Even if they can keep Cassandra safe from assassins and vengeful gods, time itself will claim her.New characters, lots of interaction with ones we've already met. New mysteries added to the wealth of intrigue already built up in previous books. This stands alone as a suspenseful drama, with heated romance, but it also is a part of a larger story arc with the other novels that slowly build up a gripping backstory and create a brand new mythic soap opera of ancient gods caught up in passions of love and hate.My eyes are recovering from crying buckets from the 'grab you by the heart and squeeze' drama that was so well worded ... really gorgeous dialogue, thumps hard in a good way.Good stuff!!! Way good stuff!!! Lots and lots of new characters to purr over and hope get their own novels soon. Strong, potent read on every level. All the others have been really good, but this is Dark Hunter novel kicks it up a notch.I read it straight through. It's almost 4am my time, and I'm getting my review in now while it's fresh. I'm so pleased with this read.&gt;^,,^&lt;"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I agree that this story is the best one yet of the dark hunter series.

So many new insights into various species (is that the right word for these people) that encompass this series.I can't say it better than lunafelis did, so read her review, she did an outstanding job of saying exactly what I would say about this book!!!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Half Apolloite Cassandra is with her friends and her bodyguard when the Daimons arrive. They recognize her and go after the kill because they believe that her death will free them from the curse that has forced them to either die or become vampires. However, Wulf a dark hunter arrives and kills the Daimons. Afterward he and Cassandra kiss, but he leaves because his curse is that no one except his blood remembers him five minutes after he leaves.Cassandra forgets Wulf until she shares exotic dreams with him. She begins to remember the dark hunter who saved her life and the advice of her deceased mother to avoid that deadly species. To his chagrin the first person outside his nephew and his peers who remembers him is from a species he has pledged to kill. Making it worse is that this duo falls in love sharing not only their respective species, but the gods of several Pantheons.Sherrilyn Kenyon's latest Dark Hunter tales is a superb romantic fantasy that has the extra twist of the hero's plight that is great for one night stands, but very lonely. The story line is the ultimate star-crossed lovers theme as a warm loving relationship between the lead couple will probably result in the wrath of Gods. The support cast, especially his nephew and his New Orleans based peer and her Amazonian bodyguard, add depth to a fine story. Those sub-genre readers tasting their first Dark Hunter novel will seek the previous winners.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Before I start this review let me just state for the record that this is the first ever DH story I've read so a lot of my confusion may come from the fact that I jumped into the series late. I'm waiting for Amazon to send me the other books now so I can get a more complete picture.However, I've been a fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon for a while now due to her many helpful books for writers, including \\"The Writer's Digest Character Naming Sourcebook\\" and \\"A Writer's Guide to Everyday Life in the Middle Ages\\". Both of which I use religiously. So when I was browsing Amazon one day and found out she actually wrote vampire romances (my favorite) I couldn't resist!That said, I decided to start with \\"Kiss of the Night\\" because it won me over as soon as I read the synopsis. What a great idea for a dark romance! A gorgeous, brooding (they're always brooding haha), immortal Viking warrior named Wulf Tryggvason (still can't figure out how to pronounce the last name LOL) no one can remember five minutes after he leaves the room ends up saving an Apollite princess, Cassandra Peters, from a gang of soul-sucking vampire thugs (it took a while for me to realize what Daimons actually were LOL). The thing that blew me away is that Cassandra, being an Apollite, is destined to die on her 27th birthday like the rest of her accursed race. The problem with that is since she is a direct descendant of the God Apollo himself if she dies without heirs so does the Sun and obviously the rest of the world.OK, now that I had the basic stuff down I dived into the book with relish. Unfortunately the first few pages did more to confuse me than anything else. I have to admit I am a mythology buff and some of the back-story Sherri reveals about the gods and how the curse came about could have used a bit more detail. I actually had to reread it several times before I got it all straight; partly because I kept comparing it to other myths I've read. Granted they didn't make much sense either (most myths never do) but let me assure you if you're still confused after a few rereads then just go on with the rest of the book. Like me, you'll eventually pick up enough to catch on.**WARNING: SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD**The writing style also threw me off at first. It's so in your face today -- with modern slang and references included -- that it honestly took a minute for me to get use to but once I did I found it very refreshing and fun. The fight scenes were good too. Very Matrix/Buffy/Angel style. Especially the drag down, knock out fight between Acheron and Stryker. Talk about edge of your seat action! I've become an instant Ash fan! Which also leads to one of my complaints. Ash seems way too convenient to have in this series. Especially when he helps Cassandra at the very end. It felt more like a cheat to me than a true happy ending. Not to mention, I really didn't feel it made much sense but maybe that's because I'm unclear on exactly what Cassandra becomes. Because, as far as I know, once the lips turn blue a body's dead. If that happens the system shuts down and having babies for the undead womb is literally impossible. However, it seems to me Ash has the power to grant a lot of things. I'm starting to wonder if he's some form of Death incarnate or a God himself, which would really explain his scenes with Artemis and the whole Simi thing. The problem is it breaks the rules Sherri sets for the series in my opinion. If Ash can just set things right whenever they go wrong then all the struggling and angst Wulf and Cassandra went through seems rather pointless to me, if not downright unkind. However, she did do a very good job exploring their angst at losing each other and Cassandra's fear of dying. I shed a tear a few times.**END OF SMALL SPOILERS**The only other complaints I have are the Dark-Hunter.com web site name dropping every five minutes (which seemed more like shameless self-promotion to me and got annoying after a while) and the sex scenes. I know -- what? I hate to say this but I'm afraid they just didn't turn me on much at all and that's bad for a romance novel. Honestly the sex always felt kind of dumped in there between the main plot and the rest of the story. Of course, the dream sequences were part of the main plot but even they left me high and dry. I never got to focus on them long enough to get involved. There was no lingering, teasing passion building to a climax. Basically, it never felt like they were making love. It always felt like they just... I dunno... f@#$ked. In fact, I actually found myself skimming sex a few times just to get back to the main story which, now that I look back, is a bit disappointing. A romance novel is supposed to make you hot and I have a few novels I've read in the past that had no problem turning my crank so to speak. This one just... didn't.I'm still very excited about the series and can't wait for the other books to arrive. I have a feeling they'll become my favorite in vampire romance. This book is a light, fun read but BUYER BEWARE -- this is not Anne Rice so if you're a Rice fan and looking for the next Queen of Darkness you'll probably do better elsewhere. However, if you love Buffy and Angel then this series will definitely do something for you. I, personally, can't wait to find out what Ash is!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"This is the 5th book in the Dark-Hunter series.Boy, does Kenyon ever believe in torturing her heroes! And she's very inventive at it, too. Dark-Hunter Wulf Tyrggvason has an unusual problem--nobody who's not of his blood, or a Dark-Hunter or Daimon can remember him 5 minutes after they leave him. And there's only one of his descendants left: Chris, who works as his squire.There's some wonderful stuff there between Wulf and Chris. Wulf is seriously overprotective, because if something happens to Chris, there'll be nobody who remembers him--Dark-Hunters can't be together because they drain each others' powers, and Daimons are the enemy. He's also constantly nagging Chris to procreate--a problem when the college-age young man drives a Hummer and has bodyguards, making prospective dates think he's a drug dealer.Then Wulf saves a young woman, coincidentally a classmate of Chris's, from some Daimons, and she can remember him. Turns out Cassandra is an Apollite. Not only that, but she's a 26-year-old Apollite. (Apollites die on their 27th birthdays unless they steal a human's soul by drinking their blood and becoming a Daimon.) And she's also the last direct descendant of Apollo himself. As such, if she dies without procreating, so does the sun, destroying the world.There's also some wonderful stuff between Cassandra and her father, who had to watch his wife and older daughter die and knows Cassandra is next. There's very much a family theme going on here, especially when Cassandra gets pregnant and has to face knowing she'll die not long after the baby's born.And the Apollites... well, that's just hideous. We've known about them from the beginning of the series, but, as with Wulf and the other Dark-Hunters, we just didn't think about them very much until they became Daimons, in which case, they were evil and had to be killed. The concept of dooming an entire race to being forced to make a choice between becoming an evil killer or dying an agonizing death at such a young age... all because of some quarrel between gods... made me seriously angry. I'm avoiding a rant about people with power destroying regular people's lives without a second thought, but only just.It's a decent story, heart-wrenching as I'm learning this series tends to be, but I'm thinking maybe there's just a little too much going on in this one. All the explanations about the history got very confusing, and I'm not sure whether it's because it wasn't written very clearly or if it's that there was just so much of it.And then there was the back-and-forth between Wulf and Cassandra. I always hate that in romances. They argue, seemingly come to an agreement, then in the next chapter they're having the identical argument. Her pregnancy solves the problems of both of them needing heirs, but I was angry that she refused all suggestions of ways she could live. On the one hand, I could understand needing to feel at peace with imminent death, but to me it felt more like we had to veto all these suggestions so the magical solution at the end would be necesary.The self-sacrifice theme irritated me a lot, too, as it always does. I think it's because I am not one for self-sacrifice, and this whole town full of noble people who willingly spend 24 hours in agony rather than taking a quick slit of the wrists or something because they think it's what the god wants... just makes me want to puke. I have a really hard time believing that it's only a small minority who's angry about this.Unfortunately, I think this is the last Dark-Hunter book in my TBR pile. It's not making me eager to search out the next ones, especially given the size of my TBR pile and the plethora of great paranormal romances out there."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"At this point I am undecided about this whole series. Once I get over the poor writing style, the overused cliches and simpleton dialogue, I can usually get through her books. Usually her ideas are phenomenal, but the execution tends to be mediocre. It is so frustrating-think of what a good writer could do with these story lines! This book is no different. The idea is awesome-a Dark Hunter falls in love and impregnates a half Appollite who is destined to die. But once again, the execution of this idea sucks! And it doesn't even make sense half the time. For example, Wulf is squeamish about drinking Cassandra's blood and initially refuses. Even though it would save her life! And Cassandra accepts this. Come on, give me a break. Plus the \\"out\\" that Ash gives them in the end is way too convenient. I will try a couple more books in the series because I did like Night Pleasures and Dance with the Devil, but if they are anything like this I'm done."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"this item was very nice and they were great to do business with, and they were very quick with the shipping"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"What can I say?

They are entertaining. They all have essentially the same characters and plot. Sometimes, the dialogue seems to be lifted from one book and pasted into another with just the names changed. It's great reading for those minutes before you drift into sleep. Nothing in them is going to cause your mind to start to crank and keep you awake. I do not remember what this one was about, though I read it just a few days ago. There was a guy. He suffered. He's immortal. He was really really gorgeous. There was a woman. She was gorgeous. They had sex. She cured whatever was bothering him, even though it was horrific and lasted for thousands or tens of thousands of years. They did a lot of fighting to keep from being killed by other creatures who have amazing (evil) powers. They won. They live happily ever after. Apply this plot to every single book, with a few notable exceptions (Acheron is the only one that comes immmediately to mind, but I think there may have been another one or two, but I can't honestly remember). Voila.If this is what you want (did I mention sex? there's always sex, sometimes more, sometimes less, but some, anyhow), then you'll like it. If you keep your expectations in line with Kenyon's books which are much more predictable than the weather or even the plots of Law and Order, you will enjoy them. If you are expecting anything more, you will be disappointed.

Those of you that love the earlier Sookie Stackhouse novels know what I mean. The quality of the early novels is so good and then there's that rapid decline in the quality of the stories. This is book 5 in the series and those thoughts have started creeping around in my mind. This book put my mind at ease. It's easily my favorite of the series so far. What a unique story putting a Dark Hunter and an Apolite as your main characters. It works so well. The chemistry between the two, especially at the beginning of the book, is just stellar. The story as a whole is fantastic. A Dark Hunter who no one can remember after 5 minutes and an Apolite princess who's life or death will destroy earth. Come on people! Read this book! It's awesome!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"This is Book 5 of the \\"Dark-Hunter\\" series.

It seems Cassie is the last of her royal bloodline and must breed before she turns 27 or the world will end. Of course the nasty god Stryker is involved to make things difficult. Lots going on in this novel, and I don't want to post any spoilers.I can say I love how each novel in this series gives us another clue about Ash's awesome powers and his relationship with Simi. I just adore Ash and think he is probably my very fav of the Dark-Hunters. It was also nice to learn more about Stryker's son Urian in this novel.

Wulf Tryggvasen, fierce Viking warrior and Dark Hunter lives this life everyday where amnesia affects all those he meets. The only person who remembers him are his DH buddies and Chris, his only blood relative.But when Cassandra Peters recalls him after the stunt he pulled in a club, Wulf is intrigued by her. Their relationship starts off smoking hot in a bed surrounded by mirrors, but it's more than just sex between Wulf and Cassandra. As half Apollite, Cassandra is cursed to die and this is a problem because she is the last remaining person of the Apollo line.Though I liked Wulf and Cassandra together, I can't say that there were my favorite couple of the series. But that is not to say that their story is not filled with heart or the usual action-packed scenes that Kenyon always provides her readers. All that is in this book and more.I really enjoyed the side characters in this book, particularly Urien and Phoebe. I thought they had great presence and nice little love story themselves in this book. I wished we could have read more about them.Acheron has some great moments in this book. A lot of the most memorable lines came from him and it was nice (but also heartbreaking) to read about him. I just adore Acheron!Speaking of the other DH guys, we see a bit of them in this book. All the previous guys who have their stories told already appear in this book to fight full force against the bad guys. Kenyon also does a great job of intertwining this book with Talon's, where both stories are occurring at the same time. I just love it when authors do this!Overall, I enjoyed this book.

I can't really put my finger on it. I guess it was the abruptness of wulf addmitting his love for Cassandra. It was like. Hey, your an appolitte, but I love you anyway lets's have a lot of sex. That just dosen't do it for me. The reason I gave it four stars was becase I loved the secondary character storys, and of course the contunied of Ash, (which by the way unless your completly blind you know who Ash is) I loved that we finally got to meet the scary all-powerful Destroyer. if your a fan of this serious you know your going to buy it just for that reason, but if this is your first dont. Start with Night pleasres or my personal fav Dance with the devil."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Kiss of the Night is a great addition to the Dark-Hunter series. I've been a fan of the books from the first and this latest offering did not disappoint. Each book in the series has been different from the previous so that I don't feel that I'm reading the same story re-hashed.Clear cut impressions of good and bad from earlier works take on new meanings and the lines between right and wrong begin to blur. But what I loved the most was that the book added to the myth of the dark-hunter/daimon/appolite world.Wulf and Cassandra are perfect. They are placed in the situation of having to overcome tremendous obstacles tohave a relationship. Favorite characters from earlier Dark-Hunter books re-appeared and added alot of humor and fun.Highly recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"&quot;Dark-Hunters are immortal protectors who save human beings from the vampires who prey on them.&quot; -Sherrilyn KenyonIn KISS OF THE NIGHT, the fifth of the Dark-Hunter books, readers are introduced to Cassandra Peters and Wulf Tryggvasen. Cassandra is a descendant of mythical Greek bloodlines that has their roots in the city of Atlantis from hundreds of years ago. Cassandra carries the future of her race if she can make it past her 27th birthday. There is another race, the evil Daimons who would like to see Cassandra dead. Daimons are vampires that have been banished to the darkness by a curse that Cassandra's death would reverse. However, her death would also mean the end of the world. Wulf is a Dark-Hunter. He is an immortal Viking warrior that has hunted and killed the likes of Cassandra's race and Daimons for many years. A chance meeting in a club of questionable reputation puts all three adversaries together at once. What emerges after the melee is a love story that starts out as a kiss and a dream, but transcends all evil and unites Wulf and Cassandra together in a fight for their lives.KISS OF THE NIGHT is an action-packed thriller that incorporates some steamy sex, a little tinkering from the gods, a dash of mystery and a hefty dose of evil vampires with powers that are out of this world. Sherrilyn Kenyon has put together enough drama to make you want to hold onto the seat of your pants for this rather bumpy and thrilling ride. As with all of the Dark-Hunter books, this one is a stand-alone and I was able to pick up on the action and keep up. Although the story surrounding the hero and heroine was a little unbelievable at times, it was the depth and stories of the supporting characters that held my interest and kept me in this one. A fascinating read.Reviewed by Brenda M.

I found the constant &quot;I'm dying&quot; tiresome.I loved her other books and yes, I'll buy her next one. But I can't give this one but 3 stars. I felt it needed more action and more insight into the characters."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"....... could SK ever out-do her most triumphant novel \\"dance with the devil\\"?No, I'm afraid not .... now don't think that I'm 'dissing' SK here! This is a really great book BUT it doesn't out-do \\"dancewith the devil\\" (in my estimation the best of the Dark Hunter series yet)!Kiss of the night is the fast paced, suspenseful, sexy story of Wulf and Cassandra but I feel it lacks the emotional intensity SK portrayed in \\"dance with the devil\\" .... I want to say, at this point, that doesn't mean it is a bad story only that it is different! Wulf and Cassandra's story is more upbeat and less intense .... it made me laugh out loud at times, but never made me feel so emotionally attached to either Cassandra or Wulf that I wanted to cry at any point ... some people may find this more appealing than an emotionally intense story - I dare you to read both ... you won't be disappointed in either but you will understand what I mean about the books been totally incomparable!How could I possibly give SK's books anything less than a 4+? It's not a possibility, so I gave this baby a 5! I think if you've enjoyed SK's books to date, you'll enjoy this one too ..... if this is your first SK novel then just know that it's not her best in this series (eg it is a must that you read \\"dance with the devil\\")."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Sherrilyn Kenyon's Kiss of the Night opens with a fascinating tale of Atlanteans and the evolution of the Apollites - and how the jealousy of goddess Apolloymi propels Apollo to curse the Apollites, condemning them to a life expectancy of 27 years. The last descendant of Apollo, 26-year old Cassandra Peters prepares herself for death until she meets Dark Hunter Wulf Tryggvason - who leads a solitary existence with his squire Chris. Wulf is her destined soul mate and when Cassandra becomes impregnated during a \\"dream mating\\", she is struggling to stay alive for her child as the evil Daimons and Destroyer Stryker hunts them down. Ms. Kenyon's fantasy world is blooming with imagination - and enriched with textured characters. Secondary characters like Talon, guardian Kat and even villains like Stryker and his son Urian are larger than life. Ms. Kenyon sculpts the characters with honesty and emotions, bringing to life a beautiful series that speaks volumes about love and redemption. The best thing is, Ms. Kenyon refuses to wax schmaltz upon readers even though some sex scenes may be over-indulgent. The dialogue, full of \\"Sex and the City\\" spunk and wry humour accelerates the pacing of the story to a frenetic one, faster than we can say - \\"More, please.\\" Kiss of the Night is one hell of a ride with its breakneck speed."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"The passion and intrigue of the Dark-Hunter series was just enhanced with the release of \\"Kiss of the Night\\". Suspenseful, Enthralling, Riveting are just a few words to describe the latest contribution from Ms. Kenyon. She continues to spin an incredible tale of an amazing Dark-Hunter world, all the while adding explanations of the Apollite/Daimon/Dark-Hunter relationship in addition to weaving further mysteries to keep us enticed. This book will not disappoint as Cassandra and Wulf must decide right from wrong and that the correct decision is not always so clear cut. The processes both characters must undergo to arrive at their decision is so heart wrenching and was painted so expertly by Ms. Kenyon, it felt as though the reader was the one, who was actually wrestling with the dilemma.New enticing characters are introduced, but tempting old friends make an appearance to round out the intrigue and contribute humor and amusement. This action-packed, enthralling drama with passionate romance can stand alone, as well as it paints additional mystery to a captivating back-story of a mythical world.Kiss of the Night will captivate and will leave you desiring more stories in addition to wishing the time to move much more quickly till the next Dark-Hunter release date.Highly Recommended!! A Must Read!!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Kenyon is a real \\"hit and miss\\" author. I have decided her books fall into 3 categories - \\"Buy,\\" \\"Borrow\\" and \\"Don't Bother.\\" This books falls between \\"Borrow\\" and \\"Don't Bother\\" book in the Dark Hunter series. The one good thing going for it, is that is gives the other side's (Daimons'/Apollites') point of view.The reason for the 2 stars instead of 1 star rating, is because I just finished reading the first book in the Dream Hunter series which had to be rated 1 star since you cannot assign a zero value!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I liked this one. Mainly because of Wolf & Cassie. I think that they have great chemistry. I felt how much they truly care for one another. I was so happy they got their HEA and had their son with another little one on the way. The ending of this book IMO was great. I wasn't quite sure how they would be able to stay together. Cassie being allowed to live etc.. It was so obvious how it would happen once it was revealed, that I couldn't believe I had not figured it out before. So Ms. Kenyon did pretty good on that front. Now the villians in this was weak to me. I didn't truly understand the whole Urian and his Dad thing. I didn't really care to be honest, but I did feel so bad for Urian. What he lost in the process but I was so happy for him when he realized what he gained. I love Chris and he and Wolf's interactions. @ times they were really funny. Other times I felt like the \\"funny scenes\\" were not so funny. It felt as though Kenyon was trying too hard in some of those areas and it just came off as kinda lame.But @ the end of the day this was an interesting read. So I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"If your a Kenyon fan this book is a must have.

I got confused. Apollites are supposed to die when they are 27. Cassandra's mom and sisters where blown up on the night the oldest sister had a fight with mom about college? Did her mom have kids when she was ten? Outside of that timeline dilema, I loved the humor and the characters, both new and old. Ms. Kenyon writes some entertaining books.Ruby Cichocki"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Kiss of the Night, the latest installment in the Dark Hunter Series, delivers what loyal readers have come to expect. She spun a mythological world that grows increasingly complex with each book. This world, filled with vampires, were-animals, and lots of immortal gods, is a fresh and fascinating setting for a romance novel. Unfortunately, while the background story gets more and more imaginative, the love stories remain bogged down in repetition.It seems that the time pressures placed on Ms. Kenyon have forced her to be lax on editing. The vocabulary used is limited and repetitive. The heroine smells like roses and powder. (A point that is reiterated throughout the novel, without cease.) The unhappy and feral Alpha male hero is indistinguishable from her other unhappy and feral Alpha male heroes. Kenyon's heroines also seem to be cut from the same cloth.If you have enjoyed Kenyon's other novels, Kiss of the Night fits right in. While the series storyline is developing through more complicated mythology and backstory, the love stories seem unfortunately similar. If, however, you were hoping for a departure from the Kenyon formula...you won't find it here."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"With with newest installment of the Dark-Hunter series, Kenyon keeps building up the series and adding more complexity and backdrop to the Hunter world she has created.The characters, Cassandra (a Half-Apollite) and Wulf (a Dark-Hunter) are both well played off in this book. Cassandra is strong, humorous and more than able to fend for herself, you are synphatetic to her character. Wulf is good also, but after a while you get tired of the &quot;leather-clad&quot; heroes all the time.The storyline, pace and dialogue we well done, however, there were many unanswered questions in this book, not so much with secondary characters, they obviously will be back in other books but questions about the main characters themselves. How did Wulf lose his soul? Who possesses it in the end? How were they exchanged? This is why I gave it 4 stars.But all in all, a good read. The series continues strong."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Kiss of the Night is an excellent book. Both Hero &amp; Heroine have a lot to overcome. Their conflicts are twofold coming from external forces as well as their own inner predjuces. Sherilyn Kenyon keeps the heat on through out the story.

I always anticipate the release of a new book! I have absolutely loved the first three installments to the dark-hunter series. This one, however, was a major disappointment. It really didn't deliver on character or story development. There were just these unnecessary and frequent references to her other books and the website. That was difficult to overlook!I agree with the other reviewer who holds out hope for Valerius' story. I am still anxious about how these characters develop. Particularly Acheron's tale. Please don't bring in the Fabulous Four Hunks from the first books just for a meaningless appearance. That seemed so contived; and, it detracted form my &quot;vision&quot; of these Magnificent Men."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I would have to agree with those who say that this story just isn't up to the level of Kenyon's other dark hunter novels. After reading each of those books I immediately turned back to the beginning and started the book all over again. There was a depth to both the male and female lead characters that just isn't in this one. I found myself more interested in Vane and Bride (brief excerpt from upcoming book contained at the end of this story) I didn't particularly care about either Wulf or Cassandra and was happy when Talon, Zarek and Julian were brought back for brief moments. One possible problem may be the numerous side characters and the excess of detail about the relationship between the gods, appolites, daimons, etc. I wouldn't say don't read this book, but I would caution you not judge the entire series by this one book - the other stories are phenomenal!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I love all of the dark hunter books. However, I didn't &quot;feel&quot; or enjoy this book as much as I have the others because I was trying to absorb the clues and details. Each book is beginning to feel more like a piece of a puzzle than a book. A little frustrating, but still worth it to read. I recommend reading the other books first or this book will be confusing. Since I think this book is a lead into another, I can't wait for the next one. I just hope the next book has more feeling and depth like the others."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"The hero and the heroine make love in their dreams. Then he finds out that she's a member of a race that he is sworn to destroy (sort of -- if she ever starts killing people -- a distinction that he doesn't really make in his self-pitying musings). He immediately accuses her of manipulating him and rejects her. She claims that she still sees tenderness in him, but I don't! For the longest time, he is focused on his problems (granted, they are large problems), and ignores her issues, including the fact that she's going to die in 8 months.Suddenly, he decides he loves her and feels really bad that she's going to die. He says that he's going to prevent it -- but you don't see him doing much about it. She is finally saved (somewhat deus ex machina) -- mostly by Acheron. Granted the hero must overcome prejudices of his own, but it's over very quickly.It's never that clear why he loves HER as opposed to any woman who wouldn't forget him. (In fact, he repeatedly thinks -- &quot;oh, I should have started sleeping with a woman like her a long time ago. Oh, no, it must be her specifically.&quot; His delivery just isn't that believable.)The development of the mythology of this alternate universe is interesting, but somewhat confused and drawn-out. (Granted, that may be intentional to hide Acheron's true identity -- which we have a good idea about at this point.)Though this is an interesting series, this entry did not reach the heights of past books -- perhaps because it was more ambitious in terms of the development of the mythology and had farther to fall."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Every girl should have a Dark-Hunter of her own."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Taken into a world that will mystify you to the last, readers will be shocked to find out that they really did not know a great deal about Diamons and Apollites and they are much more complex than the Dark-hunters were ever allowed to believe. Wulf Tryggvasen, a Viking warrior which no one remembers five minutes after they met him, which seems to be fine with him because he always has the best one night stands and no complicated relationships. However, that was before he met Cassandra Peters, a princess who has the destruction of the earth on her conscience; if she dies the rest of the world dies with her. I thought that it was an awe inspiring book with quite a few surprises set in between the pages!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"In this installment of the Dark Hunter series, we meet Wulf, a nordic warrior turned DH and Cassandra, a half-Appollite who holds the fate of the world in her hands.This wasn't my least favorite DH, but it was close. It took me a long time to figure out what bothered me about this couple. It was the age difference. Yes, I know it's silly to think about ages when dealing with heros that are centuries old, but in this case we have Wulf's heir - who is a classmate of Cassandra's. It's just a bit freakish to have the man dating a woman the same age as his (for all intents and purposes) son.The story has other problems as well. This one is weak in plot compared to the others, even though a wealth of information is given to the reader about the Appollite and Daimon races.It is also set concurrent with Talon's story, so I often wondered how all hell could be breaking loose in New Orleans while the same thing happened in Minnesota. It didn't seem reasonable that the crafty Daimons would split their forces in such a way.But it's not a bad read by any means, and fans of the series will appreciate the further insights into the universe that Kenyon has created. If you are planning on reading the entire series, then it makes sense to read Kiss of the Night.If you're looking for a great, stand-alone paranormal romance, you'll be better off looking elsewhere. I can wholeheartedly recommend Dance With the Devil and Fantasy Lover."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I had waited for this book a long time and while some areas of the novel were turned out in Kenyon's usual dynamic style, the remainder seemed predictable. Even in a series where the supernatural is the norm, parts of Kenyon's tale remain too unbelievable. Even for her. The relationship between the Heroine and the Hunter sends Kenyon into long narratives about tolerance. The relationship, at the most basic level, undermines the whole Dark Hunter existence. Kenyon even stretches the fantastic by impregnating the heroine in a dream and saving her by sharing blood with the immortal Hunter. Strange and unpleasant.In addition Ms Kenyon leaves many threads untied and where her usual penchant for foreshadowing of books to come, left me only irritated and confused.Buy it, read it and hang in for the next installment in August. I certainly hope Ms Kenyon has not rushed these into print for her eager fans...for they certainly will wait for the quality of her previous award winning attempts."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Wonderful series! I'm always wondering from one book to the next, who will be the hero... I loved the flip flop from all Daimens are bad guys to not all Daimens are bad guys. I also love the underlying mystery of Ash and his ties to Artemis. The auther gives Artie human traits that make you want to root for her as the next heroine. I'm dying to know Ash's true feelings for her... does he hate her and tolerate her or is there an underlying love. Artie is always stirring up trouble, and notice that Ash always cleans up her mess? She's jealous that Ash has love for Simi, but not for her... Maybe all the trouble is her way of keeping Ash by her side to &quot;make&quot; him love her.By the way, who is Kat? The Abadonna? At first, I wondered if she wasn't Artemis in disguise. The author does a great job of suspensful, wait for the next sequel, writing."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Can you say, bad? Okay not really horrible but I was disapointed in this book. It rides on the cliche of Baby saves the world. the book drags in places and i really didn't like that.I like Wulf but Ithink his storywas one of the most typical romance novel out of all the Dark hunter books.I just have difficulty with this story, i don't think it was written as well as the other books, but read because of Ash and the others that show up in it, and also because of future books in the series."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I love the DH series, but I read them more for the sci-fi elements than the love stories. I think SK does a great job of making men who could start seeming quite identical, unique and quirky. I've never been a huge romance novel reader, so perhaps that is why I'm more forgiving of some of the issues other readers had with this book. It's pretty obvious at this point that there will be a DH who's closed off and then he'll meet his 'savior' and they'll live happily ever after. Now I just read for the backstory aka what the heck is Ash?That being said, I was kinda hoping for a different ending. (QUASI SPOILER) I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't read it yet, but I like that element of not knowing everything will turn out great (I'm a fan of Anita Blake if that's a clue). This would have been the perfect opportunity to have a DH lose his love, but he carries on anyway because he has to. Again, since these are marketed as romance novels, I'll get over it as things typically turn out great in this genre."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I'm kind of in a minority too-while I did read this entire book in a quick day/night combo, it was not as totally exciting as the others. I agree that the best part is Simi returning as a baby and the 3 &quot;gunslingers&quot; from the other books showing up as reinforcements. I found it extremely complicated and actually the most confusing of the series-I was tempted to stop and take notes and do a timeline/family tree thing to keep everyone straight. I did enjoy the history/differences in the Daimons/ and the underground city was interesting but I wasn't really engaged as I have been in the last books. And where in the world did Phoebe and Urian come from???? seemed way too contrived for me. Zarek's book was more emotionally gripping for me but I assume this one needed to be here to move towards the next stories. I certainly don't have any hope of understanding for someone who hasn't read the other books in the series!!!! I, too, will wait for the next book in August. (The epilogue was cute-the swing set bit really made me chuckle!)"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"And I cannot believe that D Merlot thinks this is an un-important and poor example of the series. The author is finally beginning to tie in Acheron's ancestry and how and why the Appolites, Spathi, and Skoti are. If you go to Ms Kenyon's webite you will see through reading the profiles and beginnings that this all has to tie in somehow and world building cannot be just about hot sex with it going absolutely nowhere.Merlot also missed an important clue about this particular Dark Hunter. SPOLIERS Wulf was tricked into giving up his soul and never actually died like the other Dark Hunters. Even Zarek died but he maintained his soul because Artemis was loathe to touch him.Though I enjoyed these stories, I never sensed for certain that they were going any place. Although they could stand on their own there did seem to be some greater purpose in mind. Kenyon took her time building this Mythology based world slowly. The first book imo was horrid and if I had read it first, I may never have continued with the series. I am very happy that I did and I recommended it to many other readers in hopes that eventually Kenyon would begin to tie all the facets of this paranormal world together. And she does begin in KOTN, indeed, this is the most serious of the books so far and gives us the most clues as to Acheron's identity as well as the relationship between Apollymi, Artemis , Kat and Acheron.Sadly, when I see that a reader like Merlot missed the full importance of this book in the series I grow concerned. Will she be one of those that runs back to KOTN, many books later, wondering if there was something there she should have been looking for, besides hot sex and the killing of Daimons? Sure this is a fun part of the book and everybody would miss it, if it suddenly dissapeared. I do not see that happening, however. Also, Merlot should remember that the Dark Hunters NEVER EVER kill Apollites. It is forbidden and that is who Kenyon wanted us to sympathize with. If my speculations about this series come to be, I fear our dissapointed reader will be horrified when she learns of Acheron's grander than humble origins.Well, hopefully there will be enough sex and slaying to keep her happy and if not she can always read a Kinley McGregor gratuitous medieval. For me, give me a solid based world building and a series that titlilates the mind and I am happy."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"This is the first book that I've ever read by Ms. Kenyn, and now I own the whole series.. her charicterization was amazing, the pacing and plot ideas are absolutely brilliant..

I thought she'd never be abll to out do Dance with the Devil for characterization, but I was wrong. By expanding the scope of the story to encompass an awareness on the Hunter's part of how his actions effect people in the larger world, she took the series into a wonderful new dimension. I made the mistake of reading this book at a writer's conference right before I had to give a workshop. I went to that workshop with red rimmed eyes from the tears I'd shed on behalf of more than one character. Ms. Kenyon's talent is such that I had no choice to not only connect with her characters, but to be dragged into the conflicts consuming their lives, laughing and crying with them as they struggled with the choices before them. I loved this book. I couldn't put it down once I'd begun, and anyone who likes intense, multifaceted books with in depth characterization and complex, well drawn plots would do well to to add Kiss of the Night to their must read pile.

I am a total DH addict, and I am not lookin for a cure.The premise of the story is that Wulf the latest of her DH's is cursed with the fact that nobody remembers him after he leaves. Only people of his bloodline do so. There are moments of extreme hilarity involving his sole descendent by the name of Chris. Poor guy has been pushed towards women by Wulf. He calls him the jewish mother of DH's. Wulf himself and his heroine, Cassandra are made for each other, even though they should be sworn enemies. There is lots of action both physical and sexual, so be forewarned.Sheri shows more of the Daimon's life in this book, making it harder to just hate them and root for the hunters. But just like in life, there are no black and white's just shades of gray.Pick up this wonderful book and have a rollicking good read.

Wulf is a warrior who has spent centuries killing Daimons...but he begins to doubt if he would be strong enough to kill Cassandra, no matter what. But he'll never have to make that decision because Cassandra doesn't plan to become Daimon. She'll meet her fate. Unfortunately, the gods have other plans...Kenyon's built a world that seems straight forward...good vs evil, light vs dark. But with each new story, she adds more shades of grey and complexities. The result is each book just gets better and better. Kiss of the Night will keep you turning pages."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I love vampire novels and this one was wonderful. I had never read any of the dark hunter novels but after this one I have been buying everyone of ms kenyons dark hunter novels. I'm a big fan now!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"KOTN is a great read. It's a remarkable tale of love and redemption. The hero and heroine manage to overcome vast obstacles between their worlds to come together for a happily ever after. In addition, the author explores the gray area between good and bad in the Apollite world. Kenyon has created a rich and diverse universe that is entertaining and exciting. This book is a definite compliment to the Dark Hunter series which is filled with vibrant characters and exceptional storytelling."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I have read and re-read all the DH series and totally, absolutely loved them -- until this one. Ugh!SK has gone to so much trouble to set up a wonderful universe --complete with identifyable rules -- then efficiently broke all her rules in one fell swoop. Dark Hunters can't have children -- so the heroine gets pregnant in a dream???? So, now you want us to have empathy for the defined antagonist???? No -- not gonna work.Besides that, I felt there was no actual romance -- just a marriage of convenience because she got pregnant. I read these types of books to escape from things like that.Your clever imagination doesn't give you license to stretch it so far that you break the universe you've presented into shreds -- you can't do that and expect your audience to follow along.Please SK Please -- you have too much talent -- and a delightful imagination. Don't let them push you into writing so fast that your readers don't get what they expect when they pay for it. We don't want filler books -- we want your best every time."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I've read (I believe) all of Kenyon's works up to this point. Her last novel, Dance With the Devil, I particularly enjoyed. That said, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. The only reason I'm giving it one star is because Amazon won't let you give it zero.One thing you have to give Kenyon credit for, she has a mythology. Most of the time it's interesting, but this particular novel is crushed by the dead weight of the universe she has created. I swear, you need a flow chart to be able to keep up with all the different gods, goddesses, Apollites, Dark-Hunters, Daimons and the twenty-five different sub-sects to each. Not to mention, she goes to all the trouble of creating these various caste systems and then doesn't use them! The heroes of her last two novels were both ostensibly Dark-Hunters, but not really ... When you already have twenty different confirmed castes, races, species, can't you just pick one and use it? Why go to all the trouble of creating this overly tedious universe and then not use it? Not to mention her particular end around in this novel that she used to get Wulf out of his Dark-Hunter vow left me completely confused.The interaction of the two main characters in this novel ... aside from all the mythology BS she uses .. was okay. It wasn't great and I think she's done far better in other novels. Her attempts to make Wulf deep didn't work. Mostly she just made him a contradiction in terms, and not in an interesting way. Cassandra was largely forgettable. The idea that a young mother who is desperate to stay with her child and an immortal hunter who has finally found love and a family are going to allow this to be undone because they're freaked out by the idea of drinking blood? Ugh. What a lame plot device. And then for them to succeed, only to be undone by the gods, and then undone again by another mystical intervention ... it gets old very, very quickly.I have no problem with a story that twists and turns, but Kenyon doesn't know how to execute it. It's annoying enough in books like LKH's Anita Blake series to have a Scooby Doo ending. But at least there, it's first person narration and you can sort of buy that the heroine was shocked. But Kenyon uses a third person omniscient POV, so her twists and turns are particularly difficult to swallow and her explanation for them later leave me feeling like I'm being treated like a moron. And a final niggling problem I have with this series is her continual use of pop culture references. Yes, I like the modern feel of the novels, but she's intentionally giving herself a shelf-life of about two years. I just don't get it.In conclusion, Kenyon has a lot of potential. It's just not utilized in this book. Skip it."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"One customer said the author keeps adding more shades of grey in each book. I guess there's just gotten to be too many shades of grey for me. My brain synapses are getting all twisted up. I guess I really like this author's \\"were hunter stories\\" better, although there are only a few. I wish she'd write more of those in the same vein. They focus more on the romance less on murder and mayhem. The murder and mayhem are more in the background. The \\"were hunter stories\\" are more fun. This book actually became depressing, because they dwelt so much on the heroine expecting to die and how sad it was that the people of her race had to die so young."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I bought this book on a limb, wasn't for sure if I would like it or not. Once I read it I was hooked, I am now ordering the rest of the set. This book had it all: PASSION, STRENGTH, ANGER, EVEN RAGE, SEXUAL TENSION AND MOST OF LOVE. I would definately buy this book if I were you. This book made me hot and it also made me sad and even made me laugh out loud. But you know that a book is good when it makes you seem like you are in it yourself.For Sherrilyn Kenyon, I thought I would let you know, just incase you check on these, that you are a great author, you are now my 2nd fav author. My first is Laurell K. Hamilton ( Merry series) and Anita Blake series ) keep your dark hunter novels coming. I am now waiting on the others to be released so I can read them."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"The Dark-Hunters are back! These kickass immortal warriors hunt the Daimons who stalk Mankind. Assembled by the Greek goddess Artemis and led by the baddest warrior of all, Acheron Parthenopaeus, each Dark-Hunter began his path to immortality by swearing his soul to Artemis or bartering it in exchange for an Act of Vengeance. This is true for all Dark-Hunters save one...Wulf Tryggvason.Wulf never asked to be a Dark-Hunter. After all, life as a marauding Viking had been exciting enough with all the pillaging and plundering. That all changed, however, when his brother Erik was killed in battle far from their homeland. Seeking comfort for his sorrow, Wulf was seduced by a woman named Morginne. Unfortunately, Morginne wasn't just any woman. She was a servant of Artemis and somehow during their night together, Morginne managed to switch her soul with Wulf's before escaping to join the god Loki. Adding insult to injury, Morginne also laid a terrible curse on Wulf. Except for those who share his bloodline, no human can remember Wulf.So, apart from the fact that he's now forced into eternal servitude to a goddess with permanent PMS, he's watched everyone he loves die through the centuries, and that nobody can ever remember him, life hasn't been too bad for Wulf. His goals are simple enough: get his last living blood relative -- his many times removed grandnephew Chris -- married off and producing more rugrats who can remember Uncle Wulf, and, of course, kill all Daimons. Easy and uncomplicated until the night he finds Cassandra Peters being attacked by a group of Daimons.Although she is half-human, Cassandra Peters is also an Apollite -- a race cursed by the god Apollo to die on their 27th birthday unless they kill a human and steal their soul, thus becoming a Daimon. Cassandra is fast approaching her 27th birthday. If that isn't bad enough, she also happens to be the very last of Apollo's own descendants and Daimons believe that if Cassandra dies, they will be cured. The truth, however, is far, far worse. For if Cassandra dies, so will the sun. Get the picture?After rescuing Cassandra from the Daimons, Wulf figures she will soon forget him and decides to steal a kiss. Sure enough, Cassandra does forget until they both begin to share vivid, lifelike dreams where they forge a unique intimacy. When he is ordered to protect Cassandra against Daimon assassins, Wulf is forced to rethink all he's ever known about his sworn enemies.Just when I think I've got a handle on Sherrilyn Kenyon's fantasy world, she throws a curveball! KISS OF THE NIGHT focuses heavily on the Apollite race, and we witness their hopes and fears, their joys and sorrows, and nothing will ever be the same again. How could it? Wulf and Cassandra are a great match -- think Romeo and Juliet with a heavy dose of Armageddon. Both Wulf and Cassandra are forced to face and change their preconceptions about the other, all the while knowing their time is slipping away. The twists and turns of their tale will leave readers hooked to the very end.Thoughtful and provocative, readers will be forced to rethink what is right and what is wrong in the Dark-Hunter universe. Long live the Dark-Hunters!TheSchemer"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"To agree with someone's review earlier, out of all of the Dark-Hunter books, this was my least favourite. It was because of the hero and heroine not for the plot or events which would have been AMAZING had Wulf or Cassandra appealed to me at all. Yes, Cassandra can kick-arse physically but these days seeing as so many TV or book heroines are described as arse-kicking, it didn't really impress me or give an added depth to her just because she had this one skill. Her personality also was irritating and boringly repetitive, showing none of the sass and surprises and hidden conflicts that Sherri every other time has mastered in her heroines. Wulf was slightly better and his resentment of his father was simple, clear and concise, yet still needling the heart. The frustration and hurt of no-one ever remembering him was good too. My problem with him was not too big, just that he didn't jump off the page as much as the other Dark-Hunters, but to be fair, that's more a matter of comparison and maybe expecting too much than just reviewing him on his own.Now to the good parts! As always, the supporting characters are PHENOMENAL and more often than not more intriguing than the mains! Chris as the prickly but shy over-protected nephew is truly a welcome relief, and evasive as Kat is and as huge as all the questions are that she poses, makes her way more deserving to be the heroine. Urian and Phoebe are a much more compelling couple due to his status and what they are, and it's like an old friend has returned when previous Dark-Hunter heroes join the fray, even for a few pages. For all those who worry, Simi's not even annoying in this one! Ash returns of course, and again leaves us ripping out our hair with the questions he doesn't answer, but hey, what else have we come to expect?!For all those looking for the love scenes, they are short and I find not as steamy as the ones Sherri can usually roll out, more of the action revolves around Cassandra's impending deadline(!) and why they shouldn't be together, blah, blah, blah. Unfortunately, things happen TO them, not because of them, which I believe is the reason why Night Pleasures, Night Embrace and Dance with the Devil work so, so very well!Two stars lost because of Cassandra and Wulf's banality, three stars because the plot is so deliciously conflicting and the UNREAL supporting characters! Can't wait for Night Play!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I've been waiting for Wulf's story since Night Pleasures and I am pleased to say Kenyon did him justice in the newest installment of the Dark Hunter saga.Wulf is a Viking who came into being a Dark Hunter by trickery rather than voluntarily. As such, he's different from most Dark Hunters and part of his curse is that most people, all humans except for those of his blood, cannot remember him five minutes after they meet him. Of course this makes him incredibly lonely and overprotective of his last living relative and squire Chris. There's some great stuff there between Wulf and Chris and I hope that we can hear more about the Squires as the books go forward.In walks Cassandra, a 26 year old Appolite who will die a horrible painful death on her 27th birthday like all other cursed Appolites if she doesn't choose to become a soul sucking Daimon instead.Bingo, they meet when he saves her life (did I mention that she's the last of her bloodline and if she dies the world ends so the Spathi Demons are trying to kill her and bring on armageddon?) and she remembers him. Hot sex dreams ensue and they fall in love (and a bunch of other stuff that would be spoilers so I'll refrain).A strong leading female character is so nice to see in a romance book. Smart, tough and yet very soft and a nice foil for the uber tough barbarian Wulf. Great sexy chemistry makes them a good couple.I enjoyed hearing more of the backstory of how the Appolites and the Daimons came into existence and as always, it's a pleasure to read anything featuring Ash. I also enjoyed a more complete portrayal of the Appolites and Daimons, creating a more complex view, rather than Dark Hunters good and Daimons bad. Loads of hanging story threads for future books too.All in all, quite enjoyable, although I must admit to not seeing a single \\"matrix style\\" fight scene as is described in one review."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"All of Kenyon's books are mind tingling interesting, so Kiss of the Night is also. Wulf, a DH who never died (and therefore isn't bound by the same rules) falls for a half human, half Apollite, Cassandra, who is going to die in a few months. She is the last in a long line of very important Apollites, and if she dies, the sun dies too. You know who would love to see that happen. Wulf must protect her, especially since she carries his child. Wulf learns that not all Apollites are bad (and Daimons, for that matter) You will fall in love with both characters and a lot of the mysteries surrounding Ash, the Dark-Hunters, and Apollites are uncovered...but, then again, many more mysteries are introduced. Also, many of our loved heros from past books make a few intros. This was probably the best Dark-Hunter novel yet."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"The hits just keep coming for this author. I loved every minute of this book. Cassandra has to have a child to keep the world from ending and Wulf is the one that turns her on. And oh, by the way, did I mention the immortal warriors that are out to kill her?It's so much more complicated than that, but you have to read this book. If you are a fan of the Dark Hunters, this is required reading!!!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Ok, I really loved this book!!! I haven't been so absorbed in a book since her last book! Cassandra is a half human, half Appolite and last direct decendant of Appolo. Because of a long standing curse, if she dies, the world ends. Enter Dark-Hunter Wulf, the man assigned to help protect her. I don't want to add any spoilers for those who haven't read it, but there are lots of twists and turns in this book that keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. One of the reasons I loved this book is that Sherrilyn shows us that contrary to what her readers thought, Appolites (Daimons) are not the faceless killers we all assumed they were. It was very eye opening and touching. My one and only complaint was that the prolauge had soooo much info it was hard to follow and absorb it all. I really love how all of Sherrilyn's books have different &quot;feel's&quot; to them. If you haven't read her other books, get them. Then get this one!!!!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Were it not for the trademark writing \\"style\\" (i.e. overused cliches, flat characters, boring dialogue, filler chapters) I would have suspected that this novel was written by someone other then Kenyon - someone unfamiliar with the previous works. This book takes all the previous rules developed in the first four novels and basically throws them out the window. The reader is left feeling dizzy after this ride.Each time that I almost became interested, some weird twist in \\"plot\\" or dialogue would occur that would quite literally have me laughing at the absurdity of it all.How a woman could be ravaged (albeit in her sleep) and still have no idea of it in the morning is beyond my comprehension. Is she that ignorant of her own body? Oh, perhaps the idea that the gods cleaned her up before she awoke was implied . . . .The idea that Wulf suddenly falls in love with Cassandra BECAUSE she is carrying his baby plays like an after-school special. \\"Boy falls in love with girl from wrong side of the tracks. They get pregnant (with the baby that will save the world), get married, and despite all odds live happily ever after.\\"The addition of dozens of characters and castes is convoluted. It muddies the story, competes with readers' interest of the hero and heroine, and (at least in these books) adds nothing to the plot. If SK insists on having all these non-entities, she ought to at least provide a flow-chart of characters and how/why they are related. Perhaps the information is there, but the story is wrought with cliches, campy dialogue and flat characters that I find my mind drifting off topic quite often.As my title suggests, this novel is a painful read, but I keep trying to find something redeemable in SK's writing. I am mystified at the over-rating of her books.Again, sadly a very poor attempt at an otherwise interesting idea."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I love Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series, but after the emotional whirlwind that was Dance with the Devil, this entry was a bit of a let down. Wulf just did not capture me the way previous Dark-Hunters have, despite his predicament (no one remembers him once he leaves the room). Still, this book had a lot going fo it, especially in the expanded world-building. Daemons come about when Apollites refuse to die as they are cursed to do on their 27th birthdays. They start eating human souls to stay alive, and Dark-Hunters must stop them. When Wulf falls for Cassandra, an Apollite who is also destined to die, it creates a moral dilemma and a more tragic obstacle to the romance. But, this IS romance, so they will get their HEA thanks to some clever plot twists from the author.Overall, though this didn't suck me in like the books before, it was still a worthwhile read and a solid entry to the series."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Kiss of the Night has been my least favorite Dark-Hunter novel thus far. It left the reader with a lot to be desired. The previous books gave detailed accounts of the Dark-Hunter prior to the change, however it was very vague in this case. Unless I missed it, an explanation was not given as to how Wulf was tricked into trading souls nor what he did in order to become cursed.I also felt the romance was lacking and rubbed me the wrong way. For some reason, some of the descriptions kind of turned me off. For example one time when Wulf 'passionately' kisses Cassandra, he is left with the taste of lemon. He comments on it to Cassandra who replied that she remembered she had lemon on her fish for dinner. I was saying to myself, \\"Ew, who wants to kiss someone with fish breath?\\" Granted, some people may not care, but I like sexy and pleasant smells, not the others. I know I would want to kiss my husband if he hadn't brushed his teeth after eating something the pugnant.I will say that I so enjoy the background information that is given about daimons and the Apollytes. The back ground information alone is why I rated it a 3 out of 5.:::Possible Spoilers:::Questions I had1) Who and what was/is Kat? They never explained whom she was reallyworking for.2) What becomes of Wulf's soul? Is he still soulless since it belongs to Loki?3) What does Cassandra become? Is she immortal?4) If both parents are immortal, then what are the children?I hope as I read further into the series some questions are answered."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I have to say this was the weakest dark hunter novel to date. Storyline way to conjested and complicated. Sometimes I had a hard time rembering the hero and heroines names so many new characters were introduced in this novel. And whats so bad about it is that all the external characters were more entertaining than the hero and heroine. The Phoebe/Urian romance was hotter than the main characters. Will chalk this one up to everyone has a bad moment, and its easy to do since all her other work was so great. I will just focus on next time and hope for better days."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"This book belong to one of my all time favorite series. Great writing and story. All her books have sad things in them, tempered by humor and great things. But this one, in particular, was very sad. It's a look into the daimon world and how they are fated to die in a horrible way for things that their ancestors did a very long time ago. I cared for all the characters in the book and my heart bleeds for their culture. Which makes it very difficult to continue to read. Because it can't be fixed. If it is fixed for this culture then the books can't continue because there won't be a bad guy. At least I dont think it can change so they have longer lives. I hope they do eventually in the series."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Wulf Tryggvason is an ancient Viking warrior who is now a Dark Hunter.

When he finally meets Cassandra, the one woman who can remember him, she turns out to be the princess of the cursed race he's sworn to hunt-and forbidden to him. The two of them must face ancient curses, prophecies, and the direct meddling of the Greek gods to find true happiness at last.Of all of the books in the series to date, this story is the most steeped in Greek and Roman mythology. It provides a perfect window into the behaviors of the deities, their narcissisms and selfishness. Wulf and Cassandra cannot deny their attraction but find themselves in the middle of conflicts they had nothing to do with, didn't start and almost powerless to stop. There is quite a bit of action to accompany the romance and things get complicated so you have to pay attention.I think this is an excellent edition to the series and I'm looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"~Dark Hunter Series~~Kiss of the Night~~book 5~~Wulf is an ancient Viking warrior with a useful but extremely aggravating power-amnesia.

But I did Feel Really Sorry for him (Urian) for what he lost in the process (Phoebe) but was so happy for him when he realized what he gained. I like Chris and he and Wulf's interactions. at times they were hilarious, (wulf can be alittle over baring and annoying at times wulf just needs to Chill out and relax some where chris is concerned) you can tell Wulf cares what happens to him.I thought it was a Great READ! and I Would Recommend Reading this book!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Wulf is an ancient Viking warrior who has been cursed so that no human can remember him within 5 minutes of him leaving. Luckily, the Dark Hunters and most of the other immortals can remember him, as well as anyone in his direct bloodline. Unfortunately for him, there is only 1 member of his blood line left and he is extremely over protective of him. When he meets Cassandra, a woman who can actually remember him, he starts to have some rather erotic dreams about her. Cassandra is having the same dreams and they are feeling a little too real for her. Wulf wonders if these dreams could be happening for real in an alternate dream realty and finds himself very intrigued with Cassandra. As he soon finds out, she turns out to be the heiress to a cursed race. This race is destined to die at the age of 27 unless they kill and take in human souls to remain alive as Daimons. The Dark Hunters were born to hunt Daimons and this makes their situation a touchy one. If she becomes a Daimon, it will be Wulf's job to hunt her down and kill her, but if she doesn't she will die a very painful death on her next birthday. Just to mix things up a little, there is of course lots of interference from the gods too.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The inner struggles with Wulf and Cassandra were intense and definitely gave us a deeper look into the lives of the Apollites and Daimons. So far, we've thought that all Daimons were bad, but as it turns out it's not quite so cut and dry. As usual we got more information to piece together about Acheron. I really can't wait for his book, that is one mysterious and intriguing man (and I use the term man very loosely). With so many Dark Hunter books, I was afraid when I started that they would all blend together but that surely has not been the case. Sherrilyn Kenyon continues to find unique stories to take each of these Dark Hunters on. I like that we get some reoccurring characters from book to book as well. I really liked Wulf but there were a lot of new characters in this book that we hadn't met before that I really liked too. I'll be intrigued to see where Ms. Kenyon takes us in the next book when we see a little more into the Were-hunters too."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"lol, this whole series was amazing.

She has a bodyguard who follows her every move and protects her from potential threats of daimons. Though this doesn't ease the fear of slowly decaying in a few short months. She has a chance meeting with Wulf one night when he saves her from daimons who were sent to kill her. Turns out the world is going to come to an end and Cassandra has been bestowed with a very important task she must fulfill, otherwise the world will end.Aside from all that, Wulf realizes Cassandra can remember him, although this phenomenon isn't explained to the reader. The leader of the dark-hunters, Acheron, has assigned Wulf with protecting Cassandra but doesn't explain why to Wulf. Wulf and Cassandra eventually find out why the two of them have been brought together to save the world - this I can't explain because it would spoil the plot.Kiss of the Night is a good dark-hunter novel, though there isn't as much fighting in this book. It's much more romantic and emotional than the previous books. Wulf is a typical dark-hunter but shows a much softer side throughout the book as his concern for Cassandra grows. Cassandra goes through a particularly hard struggle as she nears her birthday and fears of death over come her.I have not been disappointed in a dark-hunter novel yet and this one is no different. Though I wish there has been a little more action, this book was satisfying but in a different way. If you haven't read a dark-hunter novel, give them a try. Read them in order, starting with Fantasy Lover.Erin Kernauthor of Looking for Trouble"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"The StoryWulf was tricked into being a Dark Hunter.

They are relatable, likeable and amusing. They are perfect for each other, they both fall fast and hard in love. I liked all the supporting characters as well. We learn more of atlantis, strykerius and the destroyer. I liked the aspect of the baby in the picture. its rare to follow a pregnancy from start to finish in a book, but it really worked for this book. We learn more of the Apolloites as well, things aren't always black and white. The pace in this book is fast pace and enchanting/captivating. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Wow, Kenyon just keeps it rockin'! I can't get enough of these books, and I swear they just keep getting better and better.Let's start with the hero and his gal. Wulf is an awesome character. I read in one review where the reviewer mentioned that Wulf has a giant chip on his shoulder, but I don't think that states it right. Kenyon wrote his problem perfectly. It is something that bothers him, deeply, but it doesn't make him all angry and deeply moody like some of her characters have been. I think that his anger is written at just the right amount. It is not overdone.Cassandra is also an amazing character. Her problems would be frightening to anyone, and they would leave many unable to even function and yet she does soldier on, in a very dignified way. Towards the end she gets a bit whiny, but not without reason. I feel that both Cassandra and Wulf progressed in a logical way, and became so well rounded it is hard to think that they are not two real people out there somewhere trying to make it work.As always the secondary characters are engaging and real. I like to tell people that the secondary characters are so important and that reading this series in order is probably the best thing I have ever done reading related. And that comment leads into my feelings about the plot.I enjoy, so much, how the plot twists, and turns, and differs from book to book. Obviously these are romances, and there is a happily ever after at the end. Unlike so many other romance series though, they don't get to the HEA in the same way every time. There's a difference, there's something new and fresh to overcome. I love that about these books. I think, other than the awesome characters it's what really keeps me hooked.As always, I loved this book and I highly recommend it. At this point, I even recommend it to those who are not into romance or into paranormals. These are just awesome books overall and I can not wait to continue."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"i love learning about all of the dark hunters. well i am addicted. enough said. i love wulf and cassandra. they were sooo meant to be together. the whole story was great. i like learning about the dark hunters and their enemies. awesome series. definitely would recommend it!!!!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Love Sherrilyn Kenyons' work. Looking forward to reading all of the Dark Hunter and Dream Hunter series."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Once again, Sherilynn Kenyon grabs your interest from page 1 and holds on to it all the way to the final page and then you just want more! Each new Dark Hunter captures your heart and you know that you've made a friend for eternity. I'll re-read this many times."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"SK has a wonderful concept with the Dark Hunter series, but this is not one of better reads. I enjoyed Dance with the Devil so much more. I couldn't fully immerse myself in the attraction between Wulf and Cassandra and struggled with it throughout the story. The physical attraction is hot, but I couldn't understand how sworn enemies could become soul mates. This book has some emotional parts and some good secondary characters are introduced. There is a reunion of sorts between Wulf, Ash, and the four previous Dark Hunters. Simi also returns for a brief appearance.This book is important to the series; however, because it explains more about the different Daimons, Apollites, and other creatures in the realm."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"one of my top 3 series I am reading currently - if you love vampire books this is a great series."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"Good book and very emotional one as well. The things we do for love"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"story is good.once you start reading you do not want to stop."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I loved this book! There wasn't as much sex and a lot more plot! Wulf and Cassandra were great characters. No human remembers Wulf five minutes after meeting him except for Cassandra and that made for some very funny situations. I loved the humor in this book. Chris, Wulf's squire, was an extremely intertaining character and I enjoyed all the interactions with him. I like the way Sherrilyn Kenyon brings in past characters from other books. We get to see Kyrian, Julian, Thalon, Zarek and most of all my favorite, Ash. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and favored this one over the others in the series so far."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"i found this book... well boring.... after reading all of her books, i thought that this would be the same as the other. like how the male characters have a painful, dark past. i read half way then left it for a while. there were something missing in the book. there is no \\"magic\\" feel whenever you read her other books. i thought it was too fast. the only good thing about this book is that there was zarek. =]"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"My sister got me into this series with the promise that it was good, sexy, and a fast read. After reading \\"Kiss of the Night\\", I have to agree with her!Anyone looking for a strong, tall, tortured, dark, handsome hero should pick up this series. As I'm trying to read them in order, that's what I've noticed most - the books do tend to follow a certain pattern, most typically that Dark-Hunter meets girl, protects/falls in love with girl, almost loses girl, and gets the girl plus a little something from Acheron to boot. But there are times when predictable is good, and this is one of those times. You can count on a description of the hero that will make your mouth water. You can count on the tortured bit for sure. And you can definitely count on some very hot love scenes, some of which have made me blush! Finally, you can count on falling for the DH hero of each story and find yourself rooting for him to find a happy ending.I can't wait until Acheron gets his own story, which I understand is coming sometime in the next year or two. I find him to be the most intriguing of the DHs, probably since so little is revealed about him. Luckily, I've also heard that his story will not be the end of the series - very good news indeed!"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I just love this series--i especially liked wulf's story"},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I was dissapointed in this book, so much that I had to push myself to finish it. After the caliber of &quot;Dance With The Devil&quot; (I read it 4 times in 2 weeks) I had looked forward to this book. It jumped around to much at the beginning for the story took place at the same time as Night Embrace, that I felt that this book should've came out before Night Embrace. I am looking forward to reading Vanes story next."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I just couldn't get into this story. Great imagery, I love the vikings, vampires too are pretty sexy when viewed from a romantic light. For some reason, I found myself skipping to the \\"good stuff\\". There was so much fighting, and brawling, I wondered if it really was a romance novel. Maybe I'm crazy. I picked it up from the library because of the cover and felt embarassed actually. Kinda feel like laughing now that I've \\"read\\" it.I reccomend some better reading if you're into some more sex imagery that comes with a romance novel, AND tough sexy vikings. . . Believe In Me by Josie Litton. Dream Of Me wasn't bad either. But better than Kiss of the Night."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"The first two books were great. The rest are severly over hyped. Each book seems like its only purpose is to set you up to buy the next one. You expect super bad heroes but they are all crying babies. The heroines are awful too. Please stop the train and try something else."},{"Title":"Kiss of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 5)","review":"I pick this one up as soon as it was available. I enjoyed the story and liked the prologue that added to the history of Sherrilyn's world. I didn't like the over lapped of the last two books. I will continue to read the dark-hunter series because I enjoy the character interactions."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},S={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],H={key:0},D={key:1};function W(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",S,[(e(!0),t(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),y(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",D,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",H,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const j=d(B,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-25e3c58f"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/57.md","filePath":"library/57.md"}'),E={name:"library/57.md"},N=Object.assign(E,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(j)]))}});export{L as __pageData,N as default};
