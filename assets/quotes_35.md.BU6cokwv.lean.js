Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book. There are many other books I would recommend (Petzold's book, Professional C# Programming, etc..., just about anything) over this one. I would have given my rating at 1 star, to try and compensate for the 5 stars already provided, but I believe this one deserves some credit, so I gave 2 stars.My complaints (superficial, wasted space, mundane examples, lack of content); Examples of my concerns follow, several pages and graphics are devoted to how to insert common dialog controls (font picker, date/time picker, color dialog) in a project ... these are pretty simplistic controls, they give hardly any explanation about how to use the return values or methods but waste several pages showing what the form looks like with an inserted control (not real advanced stuff!). I also hold the editor at fault; for almost every code example they include the ENTIRE SOURCE CODE (including usings, Form designer generated code, etc...) and they show the relevant stuff for that topic in bold text. Give me a break, they could have saved hundreds of pages by providing a CD with the code on it and taking this mundane stuff out of the text (who the heck is going to type in all that stuff from the book ... huh??). They again waste space on providing all of the overloaded declarations for methods (especially graphics stuff), Visual Studio provides ample coverage of methods, show us HOW TO USE the methods, not just what they are. And finally, the sample applications are so boring. They include applications that print trigonometric tables, calculate loan amortization, and draw bar and pie charts. Who really would write a C# program to do these items when you would typically fire-up Excel to do this simple stuff. This book was a real let-down for me, especially considering what [$$] can get you from better C# offerings on this site."},{"Title":"C# for Windows Programming","review":"This book contains extremely little useful information. If you want all the source code generated by the IDE for a one-line code example, then all the source code generated by the IDE after changing 1 minor thing, and . . . repeat. Fills up a lot of space with very little information.Also they describe a number of event handlers - I think they cut and pasted, just changing the object name and the event name. They repeat over and over the syntax for an event handler.They demonstrate such good naming techniques as x1, x2, x3, and textbox1, textbox2.Shame on you."},{"Title":"C# for Windows Programming","review":"Sometimes you win, sometimes you loose.I bought Petzold, &quot;Programming Windows with C#&quot; and Pappas &amp; Murray, &quot;C# for Windows Programming&quot; at roughly the same time. Petzold's book is long and thorough. It took me about 6 days of working through the book, but when I was done (in April), I had what I needed to write a small (~10000 lines, 1/2 of it GUI code out of the Visual Studio .NET GUI editor) commercial application that just hit the shelves two weeks ago (in July). In addition to a thorough introduction to Windows Forms programming, the book introduced readers to a variety of other .NET framework classes that I actually ended up using. Information was accurate (with a few exceptions due to changes between the betas and the final .NET code) and well organized. Petzold was careful to warn readers about techniques that might look appealing but would cause trouble later, and explained why they might cause trouble.So now that I can breath again, I thought I'd work through the Pappas &amp; Murray book. What a joke. These guys must have been working under an unrealistic deadline, because I've never seen a book padded with so much fluff and so little usable content. At least two of the examples won't work as published, the descriptions of the event handlers are 23 pages of repetitive cut and paste that could have been cut down to 5 pages with a little thought, enumeration values for three or four MessageBox parameters were munged together in one table so that you couldn't tell which values to use with which parameters, and so on and so on. Code was sloppy - techniques they used that worked for their small examples would be dangerous if used generally in larger programs. This book is worse than just &quot;beginner&quot;, it will lead beginners wrong.I won with Petzold's book, and lost with Pappas &amp; Murry's. Fortunately I read Petzold's when it counted."},{"Title":"C# for Windows Programming","review":"Although I agree with the reviewer who gave one star on the repeated code and terrible naming I still recommend this to any new Windows programmer.

As my hobby is historical re-creation, I have found that many books about medieval women are very textbookish in style, and frequently BORING!!! Medieval Women is written in a very easy to read, conversational style. This book had short, simple chapters with rich documentation of everything that the author said. This book also has some great illustrations from the period which enrich the text and make this short piece quite a page-turner."},{"Title":"Medieval women","review":"As an Historian, I found Ms. Power's book to be enlightening. She has managed to capture the true day-to-day existence of women in this time period, without falling into the mire of Courtly Love. Her use of records is inovative as are the truths she draws from the records. All in all one of the better books written on the subject."},{"Title":"Medieval women","review":"\\"Medieval Women\\" contains a useful but sometimes agonizingly basic overview of half the European population, focusing in its five sections on attitudes toward women, aristocratic women, working women, education, and nuns. The texts--lectures that economic historian Eileen Power had delivered, revised, and fine-tuned for two decades--were among her papers when she died in 1940, and M. M. Postan, her husband (and a famous historian in his own rate), prepared them for this collection.The resulting book is neither as comprehensive nor as grand as the title might lead you to believe. But in the 1920s and 30s (much less in 1975, when this collection was published), there was little on the topic for general audiences. Previous to its publication, most (male) scholars had focused on the hagiography of saints and abbesses, the biographies of well-known royal women, or the portrayal of women in literature. In other words, with few exceptions, what historians understood of women was gathered largely through the idealized filter of fiction. Power does not ignore these sources, but her lectures instead exhibit an additional familiarity with the types of documents that later scholars would dig into to reveal the lives of women in more factual detail: statutes, court records, wills, and letters.To those who have read other books in the field, Power's book will inevitably seem cursory and lean. Still, what's surprising is the continuing relevance (and overall accuracy) of her impressionistic survey. Furthermore, because these were originally delivered as lectures, the five chapters are easy to read, and they are nicely supplemented by several dozen illustrations. Even though it was never intended to be a book, this collection of Power's lectures is much better than the lamentable \\"Women in the Middle Ages,\\" by Joseph and Frances Gies, and it remains a good introduction for students and general readers who are not quite ready to dig in to more elaborate textbooks and monographs."},{"Title":"Medieval women","review":"Illustrations in this book are great.

From the discovery of the different components of blood (in which he bravely sheds a different light on the popular urban legend of the death of African-American scientist Dr. Drew), to how greed and pride brought about the HIV tainted blood crisis, Starr weaves a very readable science tale."},{"Title":"Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce","review":"Lots of words on the subject of blood. Pretty good. Never finished it, too long."},{"Title":"Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce","review":"Although I defer to Mr.Haschka's expertise in the field of blood, I must take issue with his snippy comment about Mr.Starr's affinity for bad news. I found Blood to be well-balanced-- he labors mightily to present good news and noble accomplishments alongside the tales of negligence, ignorance, and good old-fashioned greed. Yes, he does report on the tainted blood in great depth but let's face it-- mistakes advance science as much as, or even more than, successes, and should be accorded the appropriate amount of space. As far as repetition is concerned, I admit that I haven't read Mr.Shilts' tome, but Blood is perfect for those of us who are interested in the HIV crisis in the larger context of the industry as a whole, and in light of earlier discoveries. The book lost me a bit in its lengthy discussion of the business complex, but the information is important in order to understand how the impact of new discoveries (and mistakes) are felt worldwide. The history of blood is nothing less than riveting, how mysticism and individual hubris has given way to science-- and how they have simultaneously coexisted and been at loggerheads ever since. A formidable subject, nicely covered in a single volume."},{"Title":"Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce","review":"This book makes the history of medicine, especially blood, interesting, and accessible to anyone. It also exposes the blood industry, GOOD and BAD, with names and dates of the people who moved it along: the medics in World Wars who risked their lives, the brilliant and tempermental researchers, and the greedy. Starr gives you well-documented facts and lets the reader decide, as a good writer should, who is the bad guy. This book doesn't tug as much at your heartstrings as Bad Blood: Crisis in the American Red Cross by Judith Reitman, but that's by far an advantage. She would have you believe that just because people died (of AIDS, and Hepatitis), there must be someone in the blood industry at fault. There certainly is some fault to go around, but this book helps you decide who and why there is fault, and tells both sides of the story without leaving Reitman's huge empty gaps in the evidence."},{"Title":"Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce","review":"I've worked in the blood industry for almost 30 years, in the front trenches (hospital blood banks/transfusion services) and in the rear support areas (community blood centers, research institutions, and pharmaceutical/medical device manufacturers) in technical, sales, marketing and production management positions. For me, Starr's admirable volume works best during the first half, when the historical evolution of blood and blood product therapy from the 17th century up to the end of World War II is described. After that, it becomes repetitive of the excellent work previously authored by Randy Shilts, \\"And the Band Played On\\". The hepatitis and AIDS crises of the late 20th century have certainly revealed the various international and national elements of the blood industry to be conservative, cantankerous, shortsighted, jingoistic, sometimes lacking in social conscience, occasionally unethical, often self-serving to the point of greed, and with leaders of monumental egos. Sounds like any other human group endeavor to me. What else is new? Maybe an industry that provides wire clothes hangers might be more idealistic, but I doubt it. The bulk of the later chapters is \\"bad news\\". But then, to the author, who is a former newspaper reporter, the only news worth telling would naturally be bad news.In any case, Starr has clearly done a mountain of research. I would highly recommend this book to anyone outside of the blood industry who wishes to understand the broad mechanics of collecting, preserving and distributing blood and blood products. I would also recommend it to a person such as myself, immersed in the day-to-day technology of getting blood to the patient, who has never been exposed to the history of the art. Personally, I don't view the book as a \\"thriller\\", though it has been so described by other reviewers. It's a solid, informative description of an industry in constant change. Some might say turmoil. As an example of the latter (not mentioned by Starr), many agencies concerned with the blood supply are adopting a stance promoting \\"universal leukoreduction\\", i.e. the practice of depleting cellular blood products (both Red Blood Cells and Platelets) of white cells, or leukocytes. Contaminating leukocytes are known to cause immune suppression, CMV virus transmission, and refractoriness to platelet transfusions. This universal leukoreduction is being promoted by national professional and regulatory agencies (which got burned by the AIDS scandal) for political reasons, by the blood filter vendors for obviously commercial reasons, and more or less by practicing physicians in the field. There is the counter view that universal leukoreduction will cost the patient-consumer, or his insurance company, too much, especially since it's not been proven that all patient populations requiring transfusion need leukoreduced blood. Thus the current brouhaha, yet to be resolved to everyone's satisfaction. Maybe Starr can write a second epilog."},{"Title":"Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce","review":"From to animal-human blood transfusions to the mobilizations of donated blood for Normandy to the battle for blood-as-commodity, this riveting, epic history of medicine and commerce promises to keep you reading all day and night. You will gain a new respect for the Red Cross and for modern medicine, and you will most likely rush out to donate blood after cringing through the pages describing the problems in the Blood Services Complex. Incredibly well-researched, fascinating and enlightening."},{"Title":"Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce","review":"I borrowed this book from the library to help me with a lengthy article that I am writing on the history of blood banking. If I wasn't doing in-depth research, like combing through medical journals and scientific papers, I would have given this book 5 stars. However, Starr makes many omissions and skips vital facts, and I fail to understand why. For example, he credits Richard Lewisohn with discovering the use of sodium citrate, to keep blood from coagulating. However, nowhere does he mention that Lewisohn was not the first to use it in a successful transfusion. Two doctors published results right before he did, and another one gave a talk to the Nationl Acaademy of Sciences a month before Lewisohn published his results. Lewisohn is credited with finding the perfect formulation, and that is where credit is due. But Starr makes it seem that Lewisohn was the only one doing this research.He completely leaves out the work of Rous and Turner, who first used glucose to expand the life of red blood cells--a necessity in blood banking. He also completely omitted WW I--amazing! That's when the very first blood depot was set up and stored blood was used for the first time.I've found that he has embellished some personalities and downplayed others. He made it sound like no one was doing blood transfusions until Carrel's fateful night when he saved the baby, but in fact, they were being performed.Anyway, this is a good book and I am surprised to find these glaring flaws in it. I found it useful as a background for my research, but I don't understand why he chose to write it this way."},{"Title":"Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce","review":"The author takes an incredible journey through the history of blood. You will be amazed at how key experiments throughout the years have forever changed out feelings towards the tissue we call blood. You will root &quot;for the good guys&quot; as they pioneer medical research! But then you will cry when you see what modern business do once they got a hold of blood as a &quot;product.&quot; You will see how greed,jealosy, and denial killed thousands and ruined the lives of many others. All because companies and some doctors would not listen to reason. Truly heartbreaking indeed.The author composes a beautiful symphony of history which is very easy to read and very difficult to put down. This book has certainly changed the way I think about business and medicine."},{"Title":"Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce","review":"Who knew that a book about transfusions and blood in medical history would turn out to be such a fascinating read? Starr works from the 17th century (with occasional visits to even earlier times) forward to the current environment of blood as monetary commodity.Scintillating, thought-provoking, disturbing, and even amusing, the storytelling does justice to the story. Brilliant people discovered amazing things about this liquid that keeps us alive, and Starr encapsulates the many discoveries extremely well.If you enjoy social history writing at all, you will likely appreciate BLOOD: AN EPIC HISTORY OF MEDICINE AND COMMERCE."},{"Title":"Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce","review":"I originally took this book out of my local library to do a research project for my final exam in History. Since the culmination of my research, I have rented this book three more times in to read it for my own enjoyment. The topic of blood is purely fascinating. Starr has brilliantly written a book that informs the reader of important issues, as well as being entertaining and thought provoking. The reader gets a profound understanding of the importance of blood that spans from the 17th century, though World Wars, and through current problems with AIDS in the world's blood supply. I have never read a nonfiction book that has kept my attention as acutely as this one. This book is truly one that you'll want to keep."},{"Title":"Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce","review":"Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down.

While the setting is in the south, Mitford could be small town anywhere, U.S.A. The characters are so real I thought I was reading about people from the small town I grew up in. These books made me laugh and cry, sometimes both at the same time! I often pass my paperbacks on to others to read when I am finished. These books will not leave my home. I truly hope that Jan Karon will write more!"},{"Title":"The Mitford Years, Books 1-3: At Home in Mitford / A Light in the Window / These High, Green Hills","review":"What lovely, heart warming stories. Well written -- these books swallow you up and make you feel like you are really there. It doesn't matter what your religion is, there is something for everyone -- even a little bit of mystery and sleuth. The sense of friends and family in a small town is especially poignant during the holiday season. These books are probably more for women than men.

We meet Father Tim in his twilight years as he works in this Southern community chock full of country \\"characters\\" that will make you smile. Along the way, he adopts a cantankerous young boy, finds romance and helps friends with problems.Karon is from Lenoir, NC, so I find the town and its folk quite familiar. Mitford is tucked in the mountains of NC and the cities of Asheville, Winston-Salem and Charlotte are all mentioned.These books are heartwarming and the town of Mitford is a refreshing retreat. I recommend reading them chronologically. I like to read one as a respite after a particularly heavy or disturbing novel for balance. It's definitely a Christian series, and although Father Tim is Episcopalian, you'll find the books uplifting and familiar no matter which branch of Christianity you cling to.The Mitford series is followed by a Father Tim series and there is also a byproduct children's book series, as Father Tim's wife is a children's book author of a series about her cat Violet.For more of my book reviews and musings on Southern living, visit my blog at [...]"},{"Title":"The Mitford Years, Books 1-3: At Home in Mitford / A Light in the Window / These High, Green Hills","review":"I read all of Jan Karon's MItford Books, but started with book number 8 of the 9 book series. I had picked it up to read at Christmas last year since it had a Christmas theme. In the year that has passed, I have read all of the other eight books. I have laughed, cried, contemplated and prayed with these deep and rich characters. A sixty year-old Episcopal priest works to comfort his flock and serve his little town he has lived in for twelve years. He encounters people with all kinds of needs: little children who have been horribly abused by their drunken, drug addict parents; a man who was rejected by his father and has dealt with it through the bottle; a woman who desire a husband and one who grieves a divorce from a philandering husband who left her childless; a criminal who wants to change his life; a man who gave up wealth and drunkeness for poverty and sobriety. Father Tim is a wonderful presentation of how men of God dedicate their whole life to serving their flock. The author shows his struggles with tenderness and insight. He has fears, weaknesses, emotional baggage and need of forgiveness as do all of us. His great, loving heart and his lack of guile, as Jesus said of the apostle Andrew, comes out in every scene. The wonders of the little town of Mitford unfold and the characters become your friends as you read these books. The high morale values displayed by Father Tim and his future bride remind us that God considers marriage sacred and eternal. The books are not preachy but display what all Christians understand. This world needs love and forgiveness which we can display in our relationships with others just as Jesus displayed toward us.I particularly enjoyed the presentation of the rituals and beliefs of the Episcopal Church of which I am unfamiliar. For those who are Christians, this book presents beautiful incantations and vows of faith, hymns and recitations. I loved rereading them for their beauty and style. They are presented in a natural manner so that the not particularly spiritual reader will not be slowed down.I plan to read the Father Tim series which Karon has written to follow up. How can the reader give up on these wonderful characters? They cannot."},{"Title":"The Mitford Years, Books 1-3: At Home in Mitford / A Light in the Window / These High, Green Hills","review":"I enjoyed wandering through Mitford, an invisible visitor, meeting the characters and seeing them through the author's eyes, getting to know them. The books made me yearn to be Cynthia, to snuggle with the fluffy cat, to have the man I love call me by my last name. Their lives were a struggle at times, but that made the book all the more lifelike. I could relate to the problems and concerns. Everyone can learn a better way to live, just by reading Mitford. I hated to finish the book, longing instead to further my relationship with the characters. They were so diverse and colorful. Each had their own appeal. I have had &quot;Out to Cannon&quot; for months, and avoid starting it, knowing full well when I finish, there are no others!."},{"Title":"The Mitford Years, Books 1-3: At Home in Mitford / A Light in the Window / These High, Green Hills","review":"I'm so glad someone decided to put the first three books of Jan Karon's &quot;gentle fiction&quot; Mitford Series in one neat, tidy, wonderful package. I will be ordering this for Christmas gifts.The Mitford Series is filled with interesting souls, each one an integral part of Mitford's crazy quilt of characters. Father Tim is the perfect choice for a modern hero. Tom Cruise, he's not, but he has so much warmth, humor and humaness, that the gentle reader can forgive him for not being young, sleek and in gym-perfect shape. I also loved Fr. Tim's highly opinionated secretary and his newly found lady love.I strongly recommend reading The Mitford Series in the order they were published. By reading the books as they were written, the gentle reader comes to know each highly crafted character deeply.I am waiting for the sequel to Out To Canaan.

While \\"settling into\\" Jan Karon's cozy town of Mitford, I have found myself laughing out loud, crying, and generally experiencing that warm, fuzzy feeling whenever I treat myself to a couple of pages. Karon's writing has you believing the people of this town DO exist somewhere and you wish you could sit down and enjoy a cup of coffee with any one of them.I know folks who, after dealing with an especially difficult day, will announce with book in hand, \\"I'm going away to Mitford!\\" I recommend the same."},{"Title":"The Mitford Years, Books 1-3: At Home in Mitford / A Light in the Window / These High, Green Hills","review":"I have read, and am now rereading, the Mitford series...Love them all!

Karon deals with real-life problems like children with no caregivers and terminal illness in a positive, uplifting way that's true to life. Father Tim's thought processes are normal responses instead of picture-perfect \\"priestly\\" rhetoric. The dialogue of characters like Dooley and Puny is funny and rings delightfully true.

At last, it is such a pleasure to read a series of books dedicated to mature love with decency and something left to one's imagaination. I cannot thank Ms. Karon enough for bravely showing the timeliness and gentleness of what the gift of patience brings to those whose choose to wait on God and to wait for the other person to learn about themselves so that they may into share that knowledge in learning to love someone to include them in their life in marriage!The literary world has been in need of such a refreshing style and gentleness of touch.

They are the greatest fiction I have read in ages. I read one, then another, then the third and fourth, and then went back and read all four a second time. Now for a busy person like me -- that really says something. I was totally absorbed, enthralled, uplifted, taken away gently to a gentler place and time where my most cherished values were brought to life in real people. Mitford was on my reading table for about a year! I hesitate to call this &quot;Christian fiction&quot; because it is not &quot;religious&quot; or &quot;preachy&quot; -- yet it illustrated great Judao-Christian values in slices of real life among a bevy of character any of whom could be a book in him/herself. Just imagine a schitzophrenic lady who directs traffic at the town square in her father's Civil War uniform... who has a husband who loves her with a warm humor and humility -- that's characterization at its best in American literature! Imagine a 60-year-old Episcopalean priest who has never married -- who falls in love! These books have characters, drama, pathos, humor, romance, everything! Buy and read 'em all!"},{"Title":"The Mitford Years, Books 1-3: At Home in Mitford / A Light in the Window / These High, Green Hills","review":"I discovered &quot;The Mitford Years&quot; when the series was given to my mother, who has cancer. As she was too sick to read, I picked up the first book, &quot;At Home In Mitford&quot; looking for a small escape. I was immediately hooked, and finished the four books in under three weeks. I couldn't put them down.Karon has created a place where it feels safe to be. It's a small town where the residents are characters complete with warts and conflicts, but they all seem to hang in there and work to make their world a better place. Karon's sense of humor shines through as she portrays people we recognize as ourselves, our neighbors, our friends and our enemies. Their predicaments remind me of the adventures of the folks at Garrison Keillor's Lake Woebegone.I enjoyed her books immensely, and wish there were a dozen more. I've bought the first book for my mother-in law, who is 73, my daughter, who is 15, my husband and his two sisters.

It is wonderful the way she weaves in prayers and trust in God, but doesn't force this issue--it seems to fit in reall well. I found all of her books delightful and a change of pace from many of the other fictional books offered today."},{"Title":"The Mitford Years, Books 1-3: At Home in Mitford / A Light in the Window / These High, Green Hills","review":"I recently discovered this author & just loved this set. Okay, I admit, I AM a little late coming to the party, but they are wonderful none the less.I did find the series to be a little typical in one regard... each book is just a bit less of a page-turner than the last. I suppose it could be easy for an author to run out of steam after the second or third book, but even so, these are better than just about anything else in this genre & truly enjoyable from beginning to end!I can't wait to get to the remaining books in this series.

The characters are those we wish to have for our very own neighbors; the town itself is small-town America at its best. Karon manages to bring to life the characters of Timothy Kavanaugh, the priest of the Episcopal church; his neighbor, Cynthia; his housekeeper, Puny; and other charming locals such as the mayor, the newspaper editor, and storekeepers.

I love this book!This book is the most complete book on the topic that I've seen so far. I've read a dozen books on script writing and story development and another half dozen on film making. Sheridan has created a one-stop resource. (I realize my previous study may have prepped me to \\"get\\" everything in this book.)You can use this book to create any kind of film, be it \\"real action\\" shot with a dv camera, or animation or any combination of the two.The book is divided into three parts, and each part has several chapters. As each chapter addresses a topic, there are \\"exercises\\" and \\"projects\\" to help you learn the topic lessons and develop your first film as you go through the book.Part I is \\"Digital Storytelling.\\" She starts out by covering how to come up with ideas for a film story. Her exercises will take you through brainstorming and writing to come up with several story ideas. Then she goes in depth with original characters, themes and metaphors, including all of the elements that make a good character, how to develop a character \\"arc.\\" She explains what a theme in a film is and how to develop visual metaphors that define characters. Part I ends with a great section on plot points and how to add twists, turns and surprise to your plot to keep it interesting.In Part II, she shows you how to use the three-act structure, create scenes and write a script. The CD-ROM includes a demo copy of Movie Magic Screenwriter that is fully functional and doesn't expire for producing short (40-pages or less). If you follow her steps, you will end up with a script.Once you have your script, she tells you how to shoot it, how to make your shot choices, frame shots, and get the eye to go where you want it in a scene. I was really impressed with the section on how to design the color palette for your film to create the mood you want.The book winds up with editing, making the editing choices, adding in special effects, sound effects, titles, etc. The CD-ROM also includes demo versions of Adobe After Effects (see my review on page 7) and Sonic Fire Pro. You can use the latter to add music to your film. After going through this book, I wanted to be like the kids in the old 40s movies - \\"Hey, kids, lets make a movie!\\""},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"\\"Developing Digital Short Films\\" is filled with ideas, examples, and detailed exercises. I have been teaching students how to make digital films for a number of years, and I think this book is remarkable in its breadth-it is everything that I have always wanted wrapped into one volume. It can be used with young filmmakers in school as well as adults in workshops, and because it has so much material and some flexible options, you can choose from among the vast number of examples and exercises when teaching. The depth and structure of the book allow filmmakers to fully explore an idea, to deepen the examination of character and plot points, to spend extensive time on shot visualization, to ensure enough time in pre-production, and to use 2D and 3D effects to enhance their films. Every filmmaker and teacher knows that anyone can start a film or write a script-but creating one that effectively includes all of the necessary elements is difficult. \\"Developing Digital Short Films\\" is an answer to that problem."},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"I felt compelled to add my two bits on the quality of the illustrations in this book. Another reviewer found them to be of poor quality and felt that they detracted from the book. My opinion is quite the opposite. The point made from these illustrations is you don't have to be a superb artist to get your ideas down on paper. These are illustrations that can be accomplished by most people. The book does a great job of encouraging you to use drawings, no matter how unrefined, to get your ideas solidified.I've not read much of the book yet, but quite enjoy it. I have seen no other book with this type of information combined. It helps with most aspects of pre-production in a thorough manner. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"If you are making any kind of film, or telling any sort of story, the information in this book will make it better and deeper. There is a ton of information on how to tell a VISUAL STORY, which none of the other film books I've read cover in so much depth. The sections on how to use visual metaphors and symbols really helped me to understand how films tell stories using pictures and actions. I've never seen a book with so much useful information packed onto each page. There are 100's of lists of ideas for the reader to choose from in a great step-by-step preproduction process. The digital parts on storytelling are revolutionary and really helped me see where I could use some simple techniques to make my film more hip and original. Essential reading for any independent filmmaker working in features, documentary or shorts. I just love this book! Buy it - it will change the way you think about making films on a micro budget."},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"This book is unbelievable in the amount of information it contains and the sheer number of new ideas it inspires! I have just started making digital films and have been following along with the project exercises in \\"Developing Digital Short Films\\" for two months now. Happy to report the step-by-step process in these pages works great!The parts on narrative sound design are really cutting edge and have changed the way I approach creating soundtracks. Everything I ever wanted to know about writing a script, planning shots and making a film that is original and cheap is covered in this book!Highly recomended for anyone making a film of any kind!"},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"This book has more ideas on ways to make a film than any book I have ever seen! The project exercises really help keep the preproduction process on track. Great for taking a rough idea and turning it into a film you are proud to show. Reading this book for me, was the difference between making a bad first film and making a deep work of art. If you are making any film, you need this book!"},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"A friend told me to get this book when I told him I was having problems nailing my film idea down. The section called &quot;40 Plot Points For Feature Films&quot; saved my deadline on script. I was able to use many of the classic narrative techniques listed in this book to construct a much tighter story visually. Great book for anyone who has an idea for a film but does not quite know how to present it shot by shot. Lots of valuable information on how to get the audience involved in your film emotionally. The tone of this book is little too touchy feely for me, but you do really get the sense that Sherri cares about her readers making a successful film.I'm using Final Cut to edit my film and found the digital storytelling sections useful for how to give my film an original look, that was fast and did not cost a bunch of cash. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"I disagree with the last reviewer. This book has all sorts of useful information on how to make a film. I'm doing a documentary right now and am using several ideas straight from the project exercises in this book. I never realized there were so many different ways to communicate with an audience. Most people seem to overlook the planning stages of filmmmaking because they do not know where to begin. I have been following along with the exercises in this book and have gathered enough ideas for making 10 films! The drawings are suppose to be rough as the author explains, since they are just ideas at this stage. Great book for students or people making films who need help thinking up original ideas. I'm getting a lot out of this book and would recommend it to anyone thinking about making a film! It will save you lots of money too!"},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"This book focuses on the most important aspects of filmmaking...character and story development... Without a strong original story and characters nobody will care about your particle system and fancy renders... I like this quote by Syd Mead &quot;And finally, don't assume that technique alone will save your ass. It still is the idea that wins...every time. Remember that elaborate technique and dumb story produces a demo reel, not a narrative.&quot;Sherri Sheridan takes apart the traditional narrative structure of successful films and allows you to put them back together again using your original characters and plotlines. There is a ton of material on scriptwriting and storyboarding, preproduction is the most important phase of making a film and this book is filled with preproduction information. This is must have material! If you are planning to make your own short or feature film buy this book! Trust me you won't be sorry! I could go on and on but I have to work on my film! Good luck!"},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"I would definately recommend this book to EVERYONE! It is so in-depth about every aspect of digital filmmaking. It has projects and things to think about on every single page. I would have paid $50 bucks for it! In my opinion, it is very cheap for its quality. Also, there are pictures on every page that deponstrate every topic. The pictures really help to open up new ideas in your head. I know they have for me!Buy it now!"},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"It seemed like there was double the actual pages there was in the book. Everypage has tons of information about everything there is in making short films. I wish the book went into each aspect with more depth because reading this book seemed like a club of information just kept pounding me over the head. It jumps from each technique and tip so fast that it made me want either more examples or more explanation.With that said, this is definitely for anyone who is interested in making films, even for those who think they know it all. I thought I knew a lot about making films until I read this."},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"If you know any teenagers who are dying to learn how to make films, get them this book. While it is pretty scant on information (most of it being recycled from giants like Murch and McKee), it is motivational and has lots of fun exercises...and the graphic design is first rate.Recommended for beginners only."},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"Purchased this book to polish a 24-minute short screenplay. The story structure and content are solid now, and the characters believable. The lists are an AWESOME source of inspiration. Ready to shoot this Spring. Look forward to the DVD series. BTW, haven't made it through the second half of the book yet, but it looks great."},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"Sherri Sheridan takes you in her book Developing Digital Short Films through a very spectacular trip in the most interesting design topics which is about films and animation production industry.While moving through this interesting educational trip, you will find Sherri stands out with her tips, proverbs of famous people and exercises, which is the only way to fully digest the content of the book.This practice opens your eyes widely to see your favorite movies with a new vision. Every part of the film will remind you with a concept or a principle Sherri has mentioned in this book. Then you will realize how much interesting this filed is. And for sure, a dream to create your own movie comes to mind.As said, \\" This book will not make you Steven Spielberg, but it is a good step to start with\\", this book gives you a strong background in the field of animation.Not only the people that interest in working in the field of short films who can use this book, but also all who work in the filed of animation, including cartoons and web and digital animation. It will give the key to add a flavor to your animation and create eye-catching ideas with the principles used in film production industry.This book is divided into three parts that take you step by step to reach by the end of the book to create a complex idea. Enhanced with the exercises after every step. The first part (Digital Storytelling) prepare you to create your own story and develop it to create a story board for your film, in this part you will learn the concepts and principles of creating interesting story and develop it through its stages using its basic elements (Plot, Character, and Theme).After writing your story, Sherri takes you to the next step in part two (Visualizing Your Scripts) which converts your story into a storyboard ready for production. In this part, you will learn how to use film elements like cameras and locations to well deliver your story target to the audience. This part is very important to learn the principles of filmmaking and animation. However, it is important for all who works in the animation field.The third part (Creating Digital Short Films for Different Production Styles) is about using different techniques to come up with your film into the production phase applying all what you learnt through the book.This book provides a great experience for all who work in the fields of films production, cartoon and animation."},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"This book has proved invaluable to me as the coordinator of a first year undergraduate course designed to introduce media students to film and video, as well as multimedia skills. Sherri's informal style of writing, coupled with her unpretentious approach to sharing her own experiences as a digital film maker, makes this an ideal text for first year students. This book captures the spirit of the convergence between traditional film and multimedia, and the countless examples and case studies presented throughout the book are a great source of inspiration for students.While many of the concepts addressed in the book are not new and have been adequately addressed in other texts, Sherri describes these concepts in a way that is highly engaging, and the comic book style illustrations appeal to a young audience (as well as those of us who are not so young). Of particular note are the chapters that deal with \\"generating new ideas\\" (something first year media students find difficult), \\"creating original characters, themes, and visual metaphors\\" and \\"developing plot points\\", as well as the final three chapters of the book that deal more specifically with the convergence between film and video and multimedia.Two of my lectures this semester were based on Sherri's analysis of several popular movies, and the sections of those lectures that focused on themes and also on the use of color palettes in popular movies were real winners! Moreover, Sherri was more than willing to communicate via email and made several resources available to me as a teacher to address particular student needs.When you purchase this book you are investing in a treasure trove of teaching tips, techniques and resources. Sherri's Website adds to the richness of these resources, and her commitment to inspiring and motivating budding film makers is evident in this book and Sherri's willingness to go the extra mile to further such educational ideals.Thanks Sherri for providing educators with such a powerful set of teaching tools at a time when we are challenged to meet the demands of a student population who need to be conversant with both traditional and digital film making techniques."},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"This book pioneers a fundamentaly new concept in step by step film making. The \\"Process\\" is so deep that it may take several reads to get all the information, yet so exhilarating and instantaneous in it's effect as to be the handbook for all new media artists. Anyone who doesn't have 500,000 dollars to spend on Film school and 15 years to blow should seriously consider the small price of $25 here on Amazon. Jump start your career and open your mind. I bought it an I LOVE IT!- 100% convinced!"},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"I used this one with my small group of creative folks when we were creating a digital short for a local film fest. It really helped because I am not technically inclined. A very complete and cohesive manual. Highly recommended! I turn to Sheridan's guidebooks when I need the basics of screenwriting/film making AND when I want more complex instruction (post-production).Must have for the digital age.petra"},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"I'd rate this in the negative if I could. I won this book as a prize and I promptly gave it away in disgust. The online editorial review sure makes the book sound good, full of sound advice written by an experienced short film maker. However....I've always thought that you can tell an inexperienced writer by the length of their acknowledgements... why? Because the author who seems to think that this is their one and only shot at getting published, will inevitably try to thank everyone they've ever known. Well, Sherri's acknowledgements *chapter* is extremely tedious and puts a bad taste in one's mouth from the beginning.The very next horrifying thing about this book is the illustrations... they're shockingly bad. The artist-slash-technical editor-slash-musician, Dr. Spook (!?) needs lessons in drawing anatomy, composition, perspective and EVERYTHING ELSE.. please, where can I get his trance album!After the initial shock, I thought that I would try to ignore the illustrations and try to glean what good advice I could from the book. After all, it's very obvious that a lot of time went into the book, there's a lot of information packed onto every page.. infortunately it's quite impossible to ignore not only the illustrations, but the frequent referrals to Sherri's own personal 'yet to be proven' short film about bigfoots. It's a good idea on paper, but it would have been a triumph to see these concepts proven on the CD as a digital short film. It would also help us to see that.. hey, she knows what she's talking about!Unfortunately though Sherri, the examples on the CD were abhorrent. I could reproduce any of that without training. Say no more about that.If you really want this book, my advice: get it 2nd-hand. It will teach you things I'm sure.. but do your research first."},{"Title":"Developing Digital Short Films","review":"This book was a total joke and was a total waste of time and money on my part. This author, Sherri Sheridan, has no integrity, as she will self-indulgently give her readers second-hand knowledge, common sense sentences and ideas that serve no purpose then to pad her book, and rehashed renditions of information that are better said elseware. Buy this book if you like fillers and bad drawings."},{"Title":"Heartland of a Continent","review":"Native Iowan Ron Fisher guides us across America's midsection through time and space. Traveling from east to west (as so many have) he examines the (tallgrass) prairies, which people have converted to the cultivation of corn (a tall grass) and the plains (shortgrass prairies) dominated by wheat (a short grass). He honors the difficulties that people have faced to survive in these challenging lands, tying tragedies of the past to hopes for restoration in the future.This volume is part of the National Geographic's Special Publications Series, one of the best-kept secrets in the world of books. Since 1966 the Society had released four titles per year.

Her surviving brother is paralysed, an invalid. Her father, a general, is still involved in the war effort although they're now back in London. So when she hears the idle, indolent and supercilious Duke of Avon mocking the English troops and suggesting that Napoleon should have been allowed to run free on the Continent, she is furious - and lets him know her views in no uncertain terms. And when he informs her that the severe limp she sees him walk with is only an affectation, she is incensed and dismisses him as a worthless fop. Only, once he leaves, she notices that there is blood on the handrail where he had walked...Dominic Maitland, Duke of Avon, is indeed a cripple, and has been since birth. He is also up to his neck in the war effort himself behind the scenes: he decodes encrypted messages and is in charge of a network of couriers. The night Emily meets him, he has just come from a rendezvous with a courier which went badly wrong, and he was nearly killed. His business with her father is to establish the source of a leak in the war office, for which her father is responsible.Avon has long decided never to marry, and never to fall in love. After all, who could love a cripple like him? And anyway, his father always told him that his crippled leg was hereditary - so why have children only to pass that on to the next generation? Furthermore, he detests feeling pitied, so he avoids friendship - the person he is closest to is Moss, his valet, who is more like a father to him than his own father was.However, he is deeply attracted to Emily, and she to him. He tries to scare her off by indicating that all he wants from her is sex - but she refuses to be completely scared off. And when Avon starts spending a lot of time at her home, working with Devon, her brother, they are thrown more into each other's company - and then when Emily and her father save Avon's life and he has to stay with them in order to recuperate, feelings grow even stronger and he finds it impossible to deny what he really feels for her. But he still won't marry her... and then things get worse when, under severe stress and worry, Emily says something unforgivable to him about his limp. Can these two ever forgive each other and find love?This is an amazing, gripping and so well-written book - Gayle Wilson is a real find! I would put this on a par with the better long Mary Baloghs, and I'm now off to get hold of as many other Gayle Wilsons as I can.

This book is a keeper that can be read and enjoyed time and again! This is the first book of a three book series. The Gambler's Heart and The Heart's Wager are just as wonderful! Gayle is truly gifted. This book is going to be re-released in December 2000 - I recommend it to anyone who loves dangerous romances that are full of love and emotion."},{"Title":"The Heart's Desire (Heart's Desire, Book 1)","review":"I don't usually care to see books released again, but this is certainly an exception! I loved this book and scoured the used book stores when it was first released to buy a second copy to loan to friends. It was too good not to share, but too good to risk losing. Avon is a hero to die for--great strength of character and intellect hiding a wealth of strong emotion. Very sexy combination. I sympathized with the heroine so deeply when she voiced something she wished with all her heart she could call back. Excellent story, excellent romance, and great conflict. These series books have such a short shelf life, I'm glad that more people will get a chance to enjoy this story."},{"Title":"The Heart's Desire (Heart's Desire, Book 1)","review":"Talk about your tortured hero's. Dominic Maitland, Duke of Avon is the poster boy. Not only was he born crippled, his entire family dies (except father) in a horrible accident and his father abandons him to a harsh school without an allowance. So basically he has lived all his life without love and only relys upon himself. He decides the only life for him is that of a spy/informer of military strategems for England in her war with Napolean. Lady Harland's father, a general, is one of the few people privy to his secret activities. And so the romance begins or not with Dominic and Emily. Dominic does everything ( including some very hurtful things) to keep her away even though he's madly in love. He believes that his handicap will be passed on to his children and so has decided never to marry, but Emily will not be denied and so a rollercoaster begins. There are so many ups and downs in this book. Just when you think all will be well -BAM!- a huge misunderstanding or a crule twist of fate intervenes.This is a wonderful book. After what these characters have been through, you really feel their deep love in the end. Just magical."},{"Title":"The Heart's Desire (Heart's Desire, Book 1)","review":"Lady Emily Harland is a strong young woman who has experienced a number of things in life. She's followed her father and brothers to the Peninsula, hastily marrying Lord Harland in order to do so; she's then widowed, lost two older brothers to the war and has had a harrowing trip back to England with her father and her badly wounded younger brother. But even her seemingly indomitable strength and compassion are tested when she meets the cold, sardonic Dominic Maitland, Duke of Avon.Dominic is secretly working with Emily's father who is a former field general but now working at the War Department. Disabled from birth and unable to do his duty to his country any other way, he's created and run an important spy network compiling crucial information about the enemy, only there seems to be a traitor leaking information and killing couriers. Dominic has led a hard and solitary life: his father had always despised him, sent him away to a harsh school to fend for himself without visits home or even an allowance and had told Dominic his defect was hereditary and he's a disgrace to his name. Dominic has learned to cope by vowing to survive despite his father, but to never love or have children. He is strangely tempted to ignore his vows because of the lovely--and persistent--Emily, but does his best to keep her away, and he's very good at what he does.Emily's invalid brother, Devon, needs something to work on, however, and Avon could use his sharp mind to try and figure out who the traitor is, so Emily has opportunity to try and find out if Dominic will ever allow love into his life.Dominic is definitely a tortured hero. His words and actions are often brutal, whether hunting down traitors or keeping others away. This is no light, fluffy romance, rather it's full of hints of the harsher realities of war and injury and the state of medical care, the cruelties of society, a traitor who doesn't hesitate to kill or sell out his country. Dominic and Emily love each other, but their path is far from smooth and both make very human errors that cause pain. The characters are well-drawn and their feelings and trials are carefully related so that you feel their joys and anxiousness and pain. Parts of this book made me tear up, which was a good thing, since it meant I was really feeling for these characters. It was definitely one of the more memorable romances I've read lately, which is also a good thing since many books I'll read and forget about right after."},{"Title":"The Heart's Desire (Heart's Desire, Book 1)","review":"Gayle Wilson's The Heart's Desire begins with Emily Harland hoping that she won't lose her last living sibling (two of her brothers have died already). Her brother, Devon, was seriously injured and has a bullet lodged near his spine. Emily's father makes the decision to move him from the hospital where so many have died and back to their home, both risking his son's life and attempting to save his life. Once back in England, Emily encounters Dominic, the Duke of Avon, a man her brother warns her to stay away from. Their first meeting is more than unpleasant, but it doesn't prevent Emily from seeing Dominic for who he is and not who he pretends to be.Emily was married and widowed before the book's start; the reader learns hardly anything about her husband. The Heart's Desire merely travels the usual route of having the heroine express the distance she felt from her late husband and also informs the reader that he never quite satisfied her. In all honesty, there seems to be no reason for this character to have had a husband at all (other than the fact that she would be considered an old maid if she had not been married). Dominic has a permanent limp, and the treatment he has received because of this has taught him to put walls up around himself. Because of this, Emily is forced to pursue him.I enjoyed the first half of the book, but the character development was a little one-sided. Dominic was much more developed than Emily. So much is told about him, and he has so many dimensions to his character, but the case is not the same with Emily. A few things are learned about her (such as vague things about what she went through during the war and in losing two brothers and a husband - which doesn't seem to have a great impact on her; again, I will have to say that these things could have been left out, and the story would have led to the same result). In the first half of the book, she displays some moments of good sense, has a few slip-ups, isn't too prideful to make amends for bad decisions, and pursues Dominic whole-heartedly. Eventually, her pursuance of Dominic takes over the story, and she becomes more of an obsessed character, losing most of her edge (and strength of character) in the process.Once these characters finally get together (after so much trouble in doing so), I felt robbed of seeing how this worked out. As the writer wrote things, they spend months apart and are suddenly reunited and then things jump ahead to months in the future after they've been together for some while, having seen nothing of their interactions. This was very annoying.Also, this is the point where I stopped liking the book. After they finally get together, and, at this time, the major villain present in the book's first half has already been done away with (and I really liked this character), Emily becomes excruciatingly annoying. If her manner of throwing herself at Dominic at the novel's first half was no indication of what was later to come, I had more than enough of her presence by the book's end. She behaves stupidly, treats Dominic very badly (and they both behave like morons, merely because the book no longer has a conflict, so these two are forced to have numerous dumb misunderstandings that only made me dislike Emily more - as she behaved worse than Dominic), whines constantly, and becomes a complete nag. All she does is complain and nag at Dominic over and over and over.********ENTER SPOILER********By this time, she has a baby. She constantly refers to the baby, when speaking with Dominic, as \\"your child.\\" Unlike her, he says, \\"our child.\\" And I found this really annoying. I can't explain why Emily kept referring to the child as Dominic's and not her own, but this was irritating and made me dislike her even more. It seemed like a jab at the hero, more than anything.*********END SPOILER*********I started off really liking The Heart's Desire. But, I've noticed something about numerous romance books lately: if there isn't a villain left (or plot, for that matter), some authors will add asinine conflicts between the two main characters in an attempt to make the story longer (when it probably should have ended already). This is not only incredibly obvious, but, in The Heart's Desire's case, Emily underwent a negative change that altered my feelings for this character completely. I found her unbearable, and I can only imagine why the poor hero would want to be near such a constant, unrelenting nag. Ever hear someone say something about things being great during the dating period but, once marriage rolls around, the true colors come out. Yep. Things let up once another conflict arises and Emily gets it handed to her by Dominic's servant (I was glad someone finally said something). The second half is also largely taken up with Emily's feminine issues (breastfeeding, etc.), and I don't like to read about these kinds of things in a romance. Along with her horrid treatment of Dominic in this half, I have to hear her whining about her body and this being discussed about way too much, which only served to strengthen my dislike for the book. I hated the interactions between the characters in this section.What started as a 4-star read with a dark, brooding, and damaged hero quickly became a 2-star (I would prefer to give it 1.5-stars) due to the Emily's descent into becoming nothing more than an annoying, nagging wife.I do not recommend this read and thought I would put this review up for any who have happened across this book (especially considering that all the other reviews at the time this was posted were 4 or 5-stars)."},{"Title":"The Heart's Desire (Heart's Desire, Book 1)","review":"Gayle Wilson writes an engaging story of life's imperfections and the struggle to find love. This is a must read for any romance fan who really believes that love conquers all!"},{"Title":"The Heart's Desire (Heart's Desire, Book 1)","review":"This book had tears running down my face as I devoured the 2nd half, aching for the Duke and his Duchess as they misunderstood each others intentions. Darn willful pride! But a great romance it always makes!I read The Hearts Wager first, not knowing it was a sequel, and I'm glad I did, because there is quite a lot of this book devoted to Devon and his relationship with Emily and Avon. I loved Devon in the Hearts Wager and I really enjoyed reading about his recovery in this book, which I may not have appreciated fully if I hadnt already been acquainted with his character.This is a very gripping and emotional romance, but I do have a few qualms with it. I didnt care overly for Emily. The glimpse you get of her in The Hearts Wager shows her to be a fiery and independent redhead, possessive of her crippled husband and his love. She came off strong in the beginning of The Hearts Desire, and a few later scenes, but she made some really questionable choices in the book that had me nearly disgusted with her. For example, after she criticizes the Dukes handicap, she falls ill, and Devon has to convince her to find the determination to get well. The author would have us believe that she welcomed the solace of her illness so much that she contemplated death? There were other instances as well, but detailing them would expose spoilers in the plot, and I dont want to detract from what really was a lovely read.So lovely in fact, that this and the The Hearts Wager have earned a special place in my treasure hutch, and I know I will reread many times.

Never did the lines from the English Book of Common Prayer, \\"In the midst of life, we are in death.\\" reverberate so strongly for me as in the reading of this novel. Everywhere our Romantic (in the true sense of the word) Angelo meanders throughout this meandering book people drop dead of the Cholera. Families toss their loved ones out the window to be picked up on the streets. Angelo is chatting with a fellow one minute and the next the fellow begins vomiting, develops the tell-tale signs of cyanosis and - after a few writhings and contortions - expires. Only Angelo himself seems immune----because, well, his name is Angelo.The best parts of the book are the hallucinatory landscapes through which Angelo passes after he crosses a certain border in his own inner landscape: \\"When the boundaries between the real and unreal disappear and one can pass freely from one side to the other, one's first feeling, unexpectedly, is that the prison has contracted.\\" The prison of the world, of course.Here is a brief, random example that Giono seems to be able to conjure out of nowhere in the midst of a pleasant walk through the countryside:\\"The glints of reddened light stretched out until they were like those strands of pale hair that certain spiders hang on the wind, and before disappearing, they wrapped themselves one last time around the naked branches of the trees from which, thread by thread and cautiously, they were picked off by the still-burning shadows. The west was sighing with regret.\\"The novel works best as a sort of allegory - I was reminded several times of Pilgrim's Progress - in which the short time we have on this Earth is dreadfully accentuated and in which Angelo stalks through an almost medieval landscape of representative characters.My only problem with the book is that, in the 15 years that it took Giono to write it, he seems to have lost track of certain narrative threads. This gives the book a stylistically disjointed feel. Thus, only four stars. But, still, highly recommended. The book casts a cold eye on human life, human values, human affections in this world where, as Angelo puts it to himself:\\"Only the cholera is genuine.\\""},{"Title":"The horseman on the roof;","review":"I don't know if I'm the only one thinking like this, but.....let's start by saying I've read plenty of novels, from Dostovyeski to Stendhal, from Boris Vian to Umberto Eco, writers from present, from past, classic literature, contemporary literature, and for me this is one of the most memorable novels I've ever read. When i started reading, I didn't expect too much from it, but I was deeply impressed... The story is a thriller, the description breathtaking, detailing superb,everything is so vividly narrated...that once you start reading, you just can't stop! Angelo's character is an icon, it is so similar to a Stendhal's character in a story called San Francesco A Ripa....definitively, a book everyone liking literature must read!"},{"Title":"The horseman on the roof;","review":"I loved the film version of Horseman on the Roof but the book definitely leaves something to be desired. If I didn't have such a soft spot in my heart for Giono, I would have only given it three stars.The Horseman on the Roof is the story of Angelo Pardi, a young Italian who is making his way across the French countryside to his home in Italy during the cholera epidemic. Unfortunately, the book lacks a cohesive storyline and Angelo simply meanders from one village to another, encountering first one cholera victim, then another.While The Horseman on the Roof isn't strong on plot and certainly won't keep you up at night turning pages, it does contain gorgeous descriptions of Provence. Giono's descriptive writing is the equivalent of a full-course gourmet meal and anyone interested in the south of France, especially during this period in history, will find the book fascinating reading.There really isn't a story here, so perhaps the book doesn't deserve the four stars I gave it, but Giono's prose, however, is so lush and beautiful I couldn't justify giving it any number fewer.If you love gorgeous prose, France or are interested in the cholera epidemic, by all means, read this book. Others will no doubt find the film more engrossing as I did."},{"Title":"Metadata Solutions: Using Metamodels, Repositories, XML, and Enterprise Portals to Generate Information on Demand","review":"Our large Fortune 100 organization is spending lots of time developing metadata.

Sometimes this may turn people off, but it kept me interested. I think my absolute favorite part was Part V, the section that started with an example of a &quot;A Typical Metadata Disaster&quot; (chapter 21) and then showed various ways of solving it...starting with a centralized metadata repository,then an &quot;integrated architecture&quot;, then an &quot;information directory&quot;, metadata interexchange (XML), a standalone metadata store (an Access db in this example), and an Enterprise Portal.I don't know of any other book that takes the time to illustrate many types of solutions, with many types of products, all for the same problem.I didn't give the book 5 stars because there were some sections which I think were theory (like defining information, knowledge, and data).

Next, the source..some of our data results from many sources, some doesn't have a source. So how do we depict this? Everyone has an answer.I started looking to books. Read data quality books, data warehousing books. Only this book takes the &quot;metadata problem&quot; approach.The book is broken down into several parts. I thought some of it was beyond my understanding at first. I discussed some of the book's ideas with technical developers here, and when I went back to Part 4 (meta-meta land) and Part 5 (Sample Metadata Solutions), I understood what needs to be done in order to solve our metadata problems. I am not sure if we will ever come to terms on what is right and what is wrong, but with a &quot;metadata solution&quot;, everyone can be happy before this decision is made.I recommend this book to everyone that has been struggling with existing metadata.

After struggling through the verbose content, I am no better off now than when I turned the first page of the book.In general, the first few pages of each chapter can be interesting reading, but beyond that, Ms. Tannenbaum takes you through a web of definitions, rules, terminology and repetitive drawings/tables that adds little value to the reader.For a book that is supposed to introduce concepts of metadata, the language sometimes is hopelessly complicated, worthless and intimidating. I quote from page 180, \\"In meta-meta land, all tool's metadata are described by meta-metadata\\". And in the introduction to metamodels (page 134), she says, helpfully, that, \\"Metamodels are models of metadata and they always represent a particular perspective. In fact, there are so many perspectives to metadata that metamodels always overlap\\". I have no idea what the author means!This book could have been compressed to about a fifth of its size.

So is the syntax for UML object. This is a very worrying error for a metadata book. Finally, there is the amusing quote on page 180, \\"if you have mastered the art of metadata by mastering the ability to think like a tool...\\". In England, \\"tool\\" is actually a well-known synonym for d*rk! Not the author's fault, but one would expect an editor to pick up on something like this!Apart from these unfortunate errors, the book is well-written and very readable, and will certainly give you lots of useful information and techniques for working with metadata.

A must read."},{"Title":"Metadata Solutions: Using Metamodels, Repositories, XML, and Enterprise Portals to Generate Information on Demand","review":"This book is not only essential for architects involved with portal design, but also the supporting cast of data architects, business analysts and process modelers. If the &quot;XML&quot; or &quot;portal&quot; keywords in the title led you top this book and you are not exactly sure what a &quot;metadata solution is&quot;, the following definition from the book succinctly describes it and the theme of the book itself: Metadata solution An organized and integrated set of related metadata, logically connected but physically separate, with common access points and methods.&quot;The author covers the topic thoroughly, starting with an exhaustive discussion of information and its value to business that spans the first six chapters. Some excellent case studies are included to reinforce concepts. Part II consists of five chapters that take information up one level of abstraction and introduce metadata. Topics in this section start with requirements, and move to modeling. It's worth noting here that the OMG Open Information Model notation is heavily used in this section of the book. This should not be a problem because the notation is easy to follow and is widely known and used, reducing any learning curve to zero for experienced architects and modelers.Part III's three chapters delve into the underlying infrastructure technologies and tools. I especially liked the chapter on repositories, as well as the one that provided a balanced view of standards. Part IV is where the pace picks up with four chapters devoted to factors you need to consider before designing the solution. The case studies that are included in some of these chapters are important reading because they portray the issues and challenges that are associated with the factors. The last chapter in this section leads you through the design selection process.I especially like Section V, which is a catalog of solutions that thoroughly examine each aspect of the solution. It starts off with a chapter that describes a typical disaster, followed by viable solutions presented in a format that can be easily recast into design patterns. I also like Section VI, which covers post-implementation administration and maintenance. The three chapters in this section cover topics that are often overlooked until a solution is ready to go into production or (in too many cases) after it has been released into production.Key points about this book: (1) It is unique in that it addresses the data abstraction requirements of portals, and does so comprehensively. (2) Provides an end-to-end view of metadata from concept to final solution using real life examples and sound techniques. This is a refreshing change from many books that address metadata, but are so abstract themselves that it is difficult to transform the concepts into a working solution. (3) Addresses post implementation issues, which is something I have never come across in a book on metadata.This is an important work and is essential reading for key players in a portal design and implementation project. Five stars and my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Metadata Solutions: Using Metamodels, Repositories, XML, and Enterprise Portals to Generate Information on Demand","review":"Metadata Solution Review:As a practicing Data and Metadata Architect, I have noted with interest Ms Tannenbaum attempt to offer solutions to a very difficult problem namely first of articulating what metadata is and then managing it to make it useful in full understanding of the data/information/knowledge chain within an organization.The book traces historical roots of the issue by introducing the data/ information systems developments in organization and respective development of complexity. She then introduces the world of metadata. The treatment of identification of what metadata is, various meta-metadata models is indeed in-depth but makes very dense reading (only data bigots will love these sections). Her treatment of solution is also covers a range of possibilities and various case histories at the end of book only go on to illustrate that metadata problems and solution are varied and complex.The book suffers from two omissions. One, is that the definition of the metadata is leaves out a significant area namely that of the business metadata i.e. metadata that would adds further information/understanding to organized data e.g. reports. Examples of Business metadata are industry reports, internal documents and communication which form a major portion of the current metadata universe but receive scant attention.The second omission is examples of what constitutes good metadata vs. mediocre (bad) metadata. Writing good definition is no trivial task. &quot;Receipt_Date - Date when the goods are received&quot; is typical of the definitions in any organization dictionary and yet these definitions are less than useless as they lead you believe that the data(s) are defined when in fact they are not. Take for instance an oil tanker disembarking it's cargo which may take over two days - what is the Receipt_Date?Overall the book tries perhaps to cover too large an arena and fails to offer depth that would make it more useful."},{"Title":"Metadata Solutions: Using Metamodels, Repositories, XML, and Enterprise Portals to Generate Information on Demand","review":"Metadata books are finally starting to appear. I have read all of them because I am actively involved in the maintenance of a poorly developed metadata repository. I had a feeling that it was purchased prematurely and now after reading this book I am 100% convinced.The title of this book accurately conveys its contents. Many of us forget why metadata is around - it is around to get us to and detail the information that we need to do our jobs. Do we care about metamodels? Only if we need to know about them in order to set up a place to get &quot;information on demand&quot;. Ms. Tannenbaum takes this approach, which is perhaps why the book is not everything to everyone.In order to build or buy a metadata solution, a full set of metadata requirements need to exist. These requirements are not what you find documented in the average data warehouse reporting tool - they are much more. Metadata Solutions explains what else needs to be considered, and takes you through the way to get them, organize them, and use them. She shows how each type of requirement matches the resulting metadata solution - which is good because it will let you know clearly what will suffer if you do not spend the time figuring out what needs to be done and how.This book is for the person that is implementing a metadata solution. It is also for the person that needs to decide why the metadata solution that exists in his/her organization isn't what it could be. It represents a new way of thinking for some of us, but it is worth reading because it shows us what we all could have done better."},{"Title":"Metadata Solutions: Using Metamodels, Repositories, XML, and Enterprise Portals to Generate Information on Demand","review":"This book is probably the only one that handles the metadata process from start to finish.It begins by describing what we all did wrong (and I was one of them!) and then takes us through a corrective process.

The thing that amazed me the most about this book was the fact that actual examples are shown, including real code. If you are interested in metadata, or if you actually have to deal with it, I strongly recommend this book. It is the best on the market!"},{"Title":"Metadata Solutions: Using Metamodels, Repositories, XML, and Enterprise Portals to Generate Information on Demand","review":"Tannenbaum clearly knows the data storage and mining industry. She has produced a book that brings together a comprehensive view of metadata and of its parent, meta-metadata.It is rather easy to find a book on the details of XML, for example. Or on SQL and its various commercial and open source implementations. And on database design.But all these can be regarded as lower level details. What if you have several data warehouses, each with its own DBMS catalog, and the warehouses are not from the same vendor? Plus, there are manifold, quite separate application tools that read/write to these. You want to develop a coherent integrated view of the data, hopefully by using metadata descriptors. The type of texts mentioned above are of little help here. The vendor specific books typically orient you to their product alone.Tannenbaum has striven to fill this market gap. She explains what metadata is, and what a metamodel is. All done at a high level that frees you from the syntax of XML or SQL. Though she does use UML in many diagrams, you do not need to know UML to understand them.My only quibble is that perhaps some more detailed examples would have been instructive. The high level discussions are good. But some readers might miss the significances of some remarks. More explicit pedagogic examples might drive home the points."},{"Title":"Metadata Solutions: Using Metamodels, Repositories, XML, and Enterprise Portals to Generate Information on Demand","review":"It's about time that I found this book.

THere are others on the market that introduce us to metadata concepts, but leave the implementation to vendors. Some of us know that this can fall short.If you already have a vendor product and want to improve your situation, consider this book as a starting point. It covers a realistic definition of metadata in terms of not just data, but the world around data (programs, files, business rules, physical database catalogs, for example). Metadata Solutions also shows the reader how all of these perspectives are necessary in order to be successful.Metadata can take on two flavors in today's world. The popular view uses it as a detailed description of data warehouse data. Ms Tannenbaum does not necessarily fault that viewpoint, but shows us how to some degree we are participating in a potential disaster by keeping copies of metadata that may already exist in a standalone data warehouse product. Likewise, a centralized metadata repository might also create the same problem.Ms. Tannenbaum likes the portal approach, but she does show examples of virtually all metadata solutions, from separate standalone database, through XML transfer, through a fully integrated portal-based &quot;search and retrieve&quot; solution.Is this for managers? Yes...but they don't need to read the whole thing..(in fact she even gives reading paths). Is this for data people? Definitely. Is this for developers? definitely.

The book has six parts.Part I focuses on information. It begins by introducing data management, and briefly presenting data warehousing, object-oriented models, and directories as the integration technologies of the 1990s. A few 2-page case studies illustrate data warehousing, directories, and Web-based data management. Next it lays the groundwork for introducing metadata as the solution. Unfortunately, although some chapters mention packaged vendor solutions and \`\`tools, tools, and more tools'' (chapter 6), the lack of concrete examples keeps the discussion abstract.Part II introduces metadata. These chapters present a methodology that begins with requirements, stakeholders and perspectives, and produces metamodels and a metadata architecture. Before introducing the architecture, the author also presents several options for storing metadata. This part also includes a discussion that contrasts vendor and custom metamodels. However, the lack of vendor model examples leaves the discussion unconvincing.Part III discusses meta-metadata, shifting focus from the outside of a metadata solution to its implementation. The first chapter introduces meta-metadata and meta-metamodels. The following chapters present repositories, the Web, file managers and file systems, database systems, and class libraries as metadata-based technologies. This part concludes with a discussion of standards for metamodels, metadata exchange, and architectures and frameworks. The discussion covers efforts by the Meta Data Coalition, the Object Management Group, and the World Wide Web Consortium, among others.Part IV continues the implementation discussion, but focuses on non-metadata aspects. As such it covers the non-technical environment, the technical environment, and technical support. Finally, it discusses several implementation options from the perspective of the metadata store, and sketches a brief answer to the \`\`Buy versus Build'' question. Case studies illustrate non-metadata factors and an XML-based solution. Again, although sometimes the discussion involves packaged products or tools, the author doesn't provide concrete examples.Part V presents six sample metadata solutions. Generally case studies provide excellent vehicles to illustrate how reality impacts solutions presented on paper. Unfortunately, the case studies in this part are cursory and lack detail. As such, they do a poor job of showing how each metadata solution makes different tradeoffs to deal with its specific requirements. If you expect carefully dissected and thoughtfully presented case studies like in Software Architecture in Practice (by Bass, Clemens, and Kazman) you will be disappointed!Finally, part V focuses on the phase of the lifecycle following implementation: metadata solution maintenance. As such, it covers beneficiaries, the metadata quality, and how metadata fits within a business strategy. However, this part leaves unanswered an important question that has crystallized throughout the book: what types of problems are unsuitable for metadata solutions? The absence of this analysis may wrongfully lead uninitiated readers to regard metadata as a solution to problems it cannot solve.From a presentation perspective, the book has a distracting number of problems. The writing style uses passive voice and fairly long sentences. In addition, unlike most technical books, the text doesn't contain references. Instead, the author has chosen to supply a few additional readings for several topics at the end of the book. Moreover, most forward and backward references appear as footnotes. Finally, footnoting the \`\`5 Questions'' as copyrighted and trademarked each and every time they're mentioned comes off as a monotonous, repetitive, and tiring sales pitch.If you're looking for MBA-level information about metadata solutions, this book will give you a better idea of the area. However, if you're looking for detailed technical information about designing custom solutions or evaluating COTS systems, this book won't fit the bill. All in all, Metadata Solutions remains an MBA-level book written by an MBA."},{"Title":"Metadata Solutions: Using Metamodels, Repositories, XML, and Enterprise Portals to Generate Information on Demand","review":"This book, without a CD, has more practical metadata information than any other one I've read. THere is a section, Part V, which shows actual solution implementations. In fact, each chapter represents a specific type of implementation including centralized repositories, information directories, centralized and distributed metadata stores (these by the way are not the same as repositories), metadata exchange (XML is the example used), portal-based information access.I suspect that all of these practical solutions represent actual implementations. In some cases, the submitters are mentioned. Many of the chapters however were written by consultants from Adrienne Tannenbaum's firm.If you are looking for something to plug into your CD-ROM, then don't get this book.

Cay Sal Bank, already nicknamed \\"CSB\\" by Finneran's cult following (who call themselves Finnerati), is typical Nick. With his trademark vivid yet matter-of-fact imagery, troubadour tales of big fish, island girls, bad monkeys, and the Italian Pirates of the Caribbean, Finneran has once again set the standard for nautical nerd fiction.

Finneran doesn't bother with that stuff. He just tells what it was like to be a sailing bum, and to be involved in an incredible series of events in the Caribbean in the 1950s. Without any of the syrupy stuff, Nick makes you feel like you were really down there, chasing the wind, chasing girls, catching fish, drinking beers, steaming lobsters, and living through a few tragedies too. If you want a book that goes fast and makes you happy (and makes you cry a few times), check this one out. There are a few pages here and there (e.g., brief histories of Cuba and the Dominican Republic) that go a little slow. But, for the most part, the book is a page turner. Rock on Nick!

I do hope that she not too busy in Heaven to pay attention to her Amazon reviews, and that she realizes just how much her book meant to me."},{"Title":"Writing Articles From the Heart","review":"Some basic writing guidelines are timeless...and I think Marjorie Holmes proves that here. If you want to celebrate the wonderful &quot;stuff&quot; of your daily life and put it on paper then this book is for you. I teach a personal writing workshop using this book and it's always a hit."},{"Title":"Writing Articles From the Heart","review":"Marjorie has something to say and says it well, but I find little from this book that I can take away and use for my own writing development. Her style might do well in more conservative publications, but, in general, I find it a bit dated.I certainly believe in writing in a warm, conversational, and humorous manner (this review aside!) but Marjorie's style strikes me as overly sentimental and &quot;pat.&quot; Also, as a liberal, non-Christian, urban lesbian, few of Marjorie's suggestions for topics apply to me. She also makes some statements that I find offensive.If you're planning on writing for Guideposts or for Chicken Soup for the Soul, snap this up. If you're a suburban heterosexual mother of four, this book may be inspirational. However, if you're looking to publish in more progressive or liberal venues, or you like writing with a bit of an edge, pass this book by. You can find encouragement and affirmation in other books on the Reference shelf."},{"Title":"Writing Articles From the Heart","review":"Amazingly, this is still in print, though that is probably due to the author's reputation and not on the strength of the content. It is very dated--and it was likely dated when first published, since it seems written for those aspiring to write for the women's magazines of the 50s and 60s. I don't recall seeing columns of the sort Holmes seems to be emphasizing for more than 20 years.Another distraction is the overuse of her own writing as examples. Yes, I know that it can be hard to obtain rights to include large excerpts and, yes, her own works were readily at hand, but there are two problems with this approach. First of course is the egotism that jumps off the page and can be very off-putting after a short time. The larger concern however, is that it does not always seem as though the examples chosen are really all that good. Marjorie Holmes has written much and written well, but were her editors afraid to suggest more active pruning and judicious use of the work of others with better writing samples for the points she was making?One final point to address regarding a couple of the other reviews here: is there some kind of over-sensitivity developing around all things gay? As I read through this entire text, I found one tiny reference to a gay son, so downgrading an entire book just because the author had the temerity to express an opinion only briefly seems akin to a campaign for censorship and against free speech."},{"Title":"Writing Articles From the Heart","review":"Several reviews mention the book is dated-- and it is, but the advice is good and the author takes the time to give step-by-step instructions on how to write and sell articles. Reading this book I felt the author really had a passion for what she did and shared some personal feelings, but most importantly she gave how-to details. Good reference book."},{"Title":"Writing Articles From the Heart","review":"As a straight, non-Christian mother of two I found this book to be highly offensive as an opinion piece (the writer is homophobic and believes in censorship) and worthless as an aid for writers (the section on humor was flat and the advice is the same in other (and better) books that don't feel it necessary to force Christo-fascism down the reader's throat). I am only thankful that I bought this book used for $1. It removes any guilt I might have had over throwing the book in the trash had I paid new price for it."},{"Title":"Strength and how to obtain it","review":"Eugen Sandow (1867 - 1925) is probably most known from Olympic body builder award that is a statue shaped like E.

This book is interesting in historical aspect, not as a training manual as it does not contain any good programs. It is written solely for educating tool for his timers about his physical culture and results and not for strenght training even one would like to believe so from its title.The real interesting point is the bibliography of his life at the part II. Conserning only these aspects I give the book full 5 stars. For true strenght training manuals I say that his books: \\" \\"Body Building or the man in making\\" and \\"A Study in the Perfect Type of the Human Form\\" are good for giving set of exercises that are interesting to see or even to try."},{"Title":"Strength and how to obtain it","review":"The book came without the chart.

The layperson's reaction to reading such perceived mumbo-jumbo is typically \\"Say what?\\" or \\"So what?\\"In The Making of a Philosopher, Colin McGinn seeks to rescue philosophy from its ivory tower, bring it down to earth, and explain it in an accessible, engaging way. He is only partially successful; some sections of his book remain tough sledding.McGinn, 52, was born in West Hartlepool, county Durham, a small mining town in the northeast of England. He was educated at the Univ. of Manchester and Oxford Univ. He now lives in New York City and is a Professor of Philosophy at Rutgers.An analytical philosopher dealing with language and logic, McGinn traces his philosophical lineage from Plato and Aristotle, through Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant, to Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein--a tradition that emphasizes clarity, rigor, argument, theory, and truth.\\"It is not a tradition,\\" he writes, \\"that aims primarily for inspiration or consolation or ideology. Nor is it particurlary concerned with 'philosophy of life\\"--though parts of it are. This kind of philosophy is more like science than religion, more like mathematics than poetry--though it is neither science nor mathematics.\\"As an academic philosopher, McGinn has been interested mainly in epistemology, linguistic analysis, and cognitive science. Alas, in The Making of a Philosopher, he does not even mention my two favorite philosophers, Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, nor does he deal with Eastern philosophy, other representatives of Continental philosophy, or post-modern philosophy.McGinn is probably best known as the author of a provocative essay, \\"Can the Mind-Body Problem Be Solved?\\" (which is by far the most cited, reprinted, and translated paper he has ever written). His answer to this question is no. \\"We aren't god, after all,\\" he writes; \\"we are recently evolved organisms made of pretty low-tech materials. Our human intelligence is not cut out for the job\\" [of solving such knotty problems.\\"Maybe the human species cannot be expected to understand,\\" he writes, \\"how the universe contains mind and matter in combination. Isn't it really a preposterous overconfidence on our part to think that our species--so recent, so contingent, so limited in many ways--can nevertheless unlock every secret of the natural world?\\"In my opinion, the \\"linguistic turn\\" that characterized 20th-century philosophy was unfortunate, leading to a dry, dreary, and dull wasteland. And, apparently, McGinn himself would agree. After spending many years as an analytic philosopher, he has now turned his energies to connecting philosophical concepts with \\"real life\\" and making philosophy accessible to educated laypersons.In discussing metaphilosophy--the philosophy of philosophy--McGinn points out that philosophy is not an exact science and can never attain the certainty of mathematics or the clarity of logic. The closer we get to philosophy, the more problematical it becomes.\\"Philosophy must now be admitted,\\" he writes, \\"to be a condition of terminal puzzlement, a permanent fretting ignorance.\\" One should not be daunted or discouraged, however, by this insight, for as Socrates always maintained, it is the wise man who knows his own ignorance.The Making of a Philosopher is a candid work revealing that philosophy can be a passionate and exciting pursuit. Writing with intelligence and humor, the author pulls no punches concerning the strong and weak points of his chosen field. And the narrative flows smoothly: not many academic philosophers can write this well.Colin McGinn is the author of thirteen previous books, including The Mysterious Flame, The Character of Mind, The Problem of Consciousness, and Ethics, Evil, and Fiction."},{"Title":"The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey Through Twentieth-Century Philosophy","review":"This book is both a memoir and yet another introduction to philosophy. McGinn tries to come at introducing philosophy in a different way: through his autobiography and through the issues that prompted his interests in philosophy, the ideas he found interesting as a young man studying philosophy, and what he has thought about at particular times in his career as an academic.The results are rather mixed. You don't get much of substance here, and so you should look somewhere else if you're searching for a serious and comprehensive introduction to philosophy. But this book does cover enough ground to give you a taste of what current academic philosophizing is like. It includes a breezy, straightforward picture of the life of an academic along with brief sketches of lots of interesting philosophical issues. Furthermore, there's not a lot of history covered here; the emphasis is on a few historically important philosophical issues and the more striking arguments and positions that have been defended in contemporary analytic philosophy. So this really gives you an account of what professional life is like for people working in contemporary Anglo-American analytic philosophy, the tradition in which McGinn works.It appears McGinn intends the reader to come to philosophy in the same way he did. We go from the vague, somewhat confused ideas and concerns that first led McGinn to philosophy to immersion in ideas and concerns of current-day professional philosophers. Now, this emphasis on the intellectual development might seem too limited a perspective from which to introduce a subject. But this isn't such a problem here since specialization isn't as extreme in philosophy as it is in other parts of the academy. Since the division of intellectual labor here isn't as extreme as it is in the sciences, all philosophers tend to know a lot of the same stuff.The book is quite interesting at the beginning, and I think the first couple of chapters would be a good introduction to just what philosophical thinking is like. Here there are very few details about McGinn's early life, and he concentrates on only those elements of his autobiography that are relevant to his intellectual development and his eventual interest in philosophical questions. So these chapters are concerned with the kinds of philosophical problems that are likely to be of interest to those without much, or any, background in the subject. Skepticism, free will, the existence of God--these are the sorts of issues that are introduced in this chapter. McGinn doesn't say a great deal about these issues here, though he says enough to reveal how philosophers attempt to answer them and how they criticize or defend the answers given by others.The latter chapters come to focus more on the nature of life in academia and the issues that get discussed in contemporary analytic philosophy along with McGinn's own intellectual development as an academic. So we really get two stories here. The first story is the one of McGinn's rise to prominence in academia, and the other is the story of major issues in U.S. and U.K. philosophy from the sixties to the present. And these stories are interconnected since McGinn is a prolific thinker who has published on nearly everything of central importance in contemporary metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language. Some of the highlights he mentions are Davidson and Quine on meaning, Wittgenstein and Kripke on rule-following, Kripke and Putnam on reference, David Lewis on possible worlds, Dummett's anti-realism, Nagel's views about the mind and its relation to the body. And whenever McGinn discusses someone's ideas, he attempts to provide a brief portrait of them.Whatever one thinks about McGinn's personality--and some aspects of it can be off-putting--his discussions of issues here is pretty even-handed. While he occasionally says unflattering things about other philosophers, but he's more even-handed when it comes to their ideas--even those ideas with which he isn't sympathetic. He doesn't ridicule the ideas of others; nor does he use the book to push his own ideas on the topics he discusses."},{"Title":"The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey Through Twentieth-Century Philosophy","review":"On page 222 the author explains his reputation as a tough reviewer of other books. I'd love to imitate him, but cannot avoid giving him five stars, for five reasons.First, I literally read this book at one sitting - OK lying down on my bed, for four hours 5 minutes, not even one trip to the john. Credit for page-turnability must go to the writing; but also to fine contributions by the editorial and design teams.Second, accuracy. He describes well the Oxford I knew as a B. Phil (Philosophy) student a few years earlier than him, also from a non-Oxbridge background.Third, determination. He was not from an academic family, and his first high school did not expect its students to go on to college. But once he got the thinking bug, there was no holding him back.Fourth, stimulation. This is not a crash-course in philosophy. However, enough is said sufficiently clearly on metaphysics - oddly, a word never mentioned - and on moral philosophy to stir my flaccid philosophical loins.Fifth, anecdotal warmth. I enjoyed the accounts of philosophers behaving generously or pettily. It's a book that humanizes philosophy. He had his spats with the Oxford establishment - and Rutgers has been the beneficiaryFor those with an interest in cross-cultural studies there are nice reminders that driving on the left is not the only habit that Brits need to correct if they want to become good Cis-Atlantic citizens."},{"Title":"The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey Through Twentieth-Century Philosophy","review":"I enjoyed reading this from the standpoint of finding out what it might be like to teach and write in the field of philosophy. McGinn was honest about the tedious and rewarding parts of such a career. The author's writing style is clear and unpretentious."},{"Title":"The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey Through Twentieth-Century Philosophy","review":"This is a great book but I felt something cold inside of me while reading it. I don't know if it is cultural (the modern English philosopher's fear of displaying passion) but I had the feeling to talk to a plumber who developed expertise in abstract concepts and their relationships just as if they were small plumbing problems fitting together under a generalized plumbing theory. Perhaps philosophy needs to be treated like that, just like engineering --but not for me. At least I give myself the illusion of doing something more...literary.Colin McGINN teaches us that we need nevertheless to master the art of clarity of both thought and exposition. He write with perfect clarity: a clear, unburdened, unaffected, UnFrench UnGerman philosophical prose.The book has a presentation of the Kripke idea of naming as necessity of such clarity that I felt actually smart reading it.Other than that there is the feeling of drabness in part of the book of the type I got once at a conference in an industrial city West of London."},{"Title":"The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey Through Twentieth-Century Philosophy","review":"I am currently aspiring to gain a bachelors degree in philosophy and this book is a great way to grasp fundamental theories.

A very enjoyable romp."},{"Title":"If I Am Not For Myself","review":"For quite a while, most Jews, especially European Jews, have been liberals. It is easy to understand why. As the author explains, liberals believe in a rational approach to political questions, individual freedom, progress, and cultural pluralism. Jewish emancipation appeared to require liberalism.Wisse points out that there is a problem with all this. Where were the liberals when Jews were slaughtered in World War Two? And where are they now, when antizionists threaten them? Just prior to World War Two, most people underestimated the destructive power of antisemitism. Are we doing the same thing now?Wisse also points out the dilemma of many Jewish liberals. In the past, Jews had to agree with many political views of non-Jews to fit more easily into society as a whole. That's true today, as many Jews see support for Israel as politically incorrect. So it makes sense that many Diaspora Jews refuse to support Israel: these Jews are trying to gain acceptance. But Wisse reminds us that it won't work: antisemitism bears no relation to Jewish achievements or behavior.I think Wisse's best point is that it makes little sense for Jews to try to arouse sympathy by reminding people of the murder of the European Jews. While it may be a good idea for non-Jews to know about this in order to try to avoid repeating it, it doesn't do Jews much good. As the author explains, all it does is give people the impression that Jews are an easy target, that there must be something wrong with the Jews (or they would not have been picked as a target), and that it isn't a good idea to be a Jew.The author points out the significance of the massacres at Sabra and Shatilla. The world reacted as if it were a major crime. So major that it even wanted to blame Israel for its role. But was it major? Did they want to do anything about the actual murderers?Wisse discusses the Arab Big Lie. She explains that this is \\"the attribution to one's target of one's intentions against it.\\" That's why the Arab antizionists had no trouble equating Zionism and racism.The author concludes that the ultimate test of liberalism today is whether it will defend the Jews. After all, joining those who blame Israel exacts almost no political price, and it sure is easier than standing up to the antizionists.Wisse thinks that many Jews would benefit by some serious soul-searching. And that if they did, they would have to confess to something. Not a false confession to Arab crimes. But a real one to their own idealism and their readiness to sacrifice other Jews in their attempts to be accepted by non-Jews.Edward Alexander has a little test for liberals: do you demand for yourselves the same rights that you demand for others? I think Wisse passes this test."},{"Title":"If I Am Not For Myself","review":"This is a short, well-written book, but it was not a quick read. Prof. Wisse pulls no punches and what she has to say hurts. Every Liberal Jew and every Liberal who is not a Jew should read this book. Liberals live in fantasy land. The world is not filled with reasonable folks just waiting to negotiate a \\"just peace\\", or anything else, for that matter. For much of humanity, hate is a steady diet and, as Prof. Wisse points out, when liberals deny what underlies much of human conduct, they are simply trying to create all of humanity in their own self-image. This is a prescription for disaster. It is not only the Jews of Israel who are in deadly peril from such puerile sentimentalism, for, as has been noted so often, Jews are the canaries in the mineshaft."},{"Title":"If I Am Not For Myself","review":"The contemptible practice of selling one's own people out in order to court favor with others is sadly not strange to Jewish history. Ruth Wisse is a tremendously sensible and solid thinker who analyzes the condition of Jewish liberalism and finds it wanting. The case she makes for Jews having the courage to stand for their own interests especially in regard to the defense of Israel rather than curry favor in the eyes of those whose favor they will not have anyway, is very strong. I think that she also understands that underlying much Jewish liberal self- criticism is a real ignorance not only of Jewish history but of present world- realities. This work should be a basic text most especially for all those Jews engaged in civil rights activities."},{"Title":"If I Am Not For Myself","review":"I'm in the middle of reading this invaluable little book and felt so compelled to write a review, my first on Amazon. For years, no, decades, I had been wondering why anti-semitism still exists as the dominant ideology of the world. Now, with Wisse's acute perceptivity, i realize now why. We, as Westerners, have been assaulted and inculcated and \\"propagandized\\" by the Arab dissemination machine of anti-Israel bias, hatred and demonization, masked as liberal and even conservative political campaigning. And you know what? I, and i don't think i'm alone here, now feel victimized by the relentless Arab campaigning. This is just like the 1930's, folks. I'm hoping we all awake from our slumbering yet impassioned masking. AND, do you think Palestinian statehood will achieve \\"peace?\\" Let us not fool ourselves. Read this important book."},{"Title":"If I Am Not For Myself","review":"I strongly recomend book. A book by Marqusee which carries a similar title is a terrible mudd slinging of Zionism and Israel and is short of mentioning role of Palestinians in the conflict.

They can and should find their way on their own."},{"Title":"Love is a Four Letter Word","review":"This book is incredibly well written, about a woman who has lost her one love, and is cynical about ever falling in love again.Her family and friends around her are always trying to get her to meet new men.

While those few are expected, some of what Ulmer and Rose chose to exhibit for this distinctly Canadian A-B-C shows a delicate and wonderful understanding of both the child and adult audience of this book.From Banting and Best, who gave the world Insulin, to Anne of Green Gables, to Terry Fox, and to - of all things - the Zipper, there are at least 26 nuggets of Canadian Heritage and History here that are presented in an accessible format for kids and adults alike.Moreover, each page is not just the rhyming quartet for each letter - there is also a sidebar with a few paragraphs or so on the topic, or on other letter related topics. (E, which is for \\"Eh?\\" also contains a little write-up in the sidebar on Edmonton, for example. G stands both for Grain and the Governor General.)The illustrations are beautiful - seeing the artistry of Terry Fox literally stopped me in my tracks. I remember seeing him run by when I was young, and the picture was a perfect capture of that moment.The perfect Canadian kids book gift, for those relatives overseas, or for those who've been in Canada all their lives, \\"M is for Maple\\" has real information, lyrical rhymes, and great artistry. It belongs on any Canadian Youth's shelf, and has certainly found a place on my nephew's.'Nathan"},{"Title":"M is for Maple","review":"This is a great book for all children, but especially for children living in other countries.

As someone outside of Canada who bought it as part of an effort to introduce other countries early I thought it should have been better advertised as not being for other readers. It's one of the hazards of buying it without being able to leaf through it first. This is a small thing but I think it's confusing for very young readers (the kind who are being read alphabet books) who aren't Canadian. I realize it's titled \\"A Canadian Alphabet\\" but it isn't titled \\"A Canadian Alphabet for Canadians\\". 2) The book we received is NOT the book other reviewers have described with expanded text and other letter examples. Each letter has one short sentece of text and that's it. I would rather have had the other book with more information and other examples and explanation, including some pronunciations when needed (I'm not 100% sure how to pronounce Inuksuk or Ojibwa and don't want to teach incorrectly). B is for Bluenose in this version, a reference I'll look up but the page would have been so much better with additional examples (eg. British Columbia, Banff, etc.) If you are Canadian and want it really simple this is a five star book. From anyplace else and if you were expecting what was described in the other reviews it's three star, still recommended."},{"Title":"M is for Maple","review":"The alphabet book has nearly become a genre of its own within the world of children's literature. With every child's bookshelf containing one or two alphabet books that proclaim, \\"A is for Apple, B is for Banana\\" or alternately, \\"A is for Ant, B is for Bear,\\" it's easy to see how the elegant and informative alphabet titles from Sleeping Bear Press are redefining the genre.M is for Maple: A Canadian Alphabet by Mike Ulmer is quickly becoming the quintessential Canadian version of the alphabet book. Illustrated in rich, glowing oils by accomplished artist Melanie Rose, and covering a broad range of topics that are woven deeply throughout the culture of Canada, this beautiful book is both appealing and useful in a wide variety of age groups and settings.Each letter of the alphabet is introduced through rhyming text that draws out one symbol, historical personage, location, people group, sport, and so on, that helps to capture the spirit of Canada as a whole.So instead of a simple, \\"A is for Anne,\\" readers are treated to:\\"A is for Anne - that's Anne with an Ea red headed orphan who loved Avonlea.The Cuthberts had thought they were adopting a boy,But that red headed girl would be their pride and their joy.\\"Informative sidebar text that digs into the presented subject matter provides background information, facts, and trivia - leaving readers \`in the know' about important Canadian topics. Adding to the educational element, Sleeping Bear Press also has a free downloadable teaching guide available for grades 2 - 6, helping teachers dig deeper into the presented materials with their students. Literature, geography, social studies, research, writing, and history extensions are provided to accompany each letter and topic as it appears in M is for Maple.Depending upon the age of the audience, this versatile work can be read several ways. Preschoolers will enjoy the rhyming text and vibrant illustrations that appear in either two-page spreads or on single pages - it is even available in a board-book edition for the tiniest Canada lovers. Early elementary students can dig into the informative sidebars as well, and children who are familiar with basic mapping, reading, and writing skills can delve into a fuller unit-based study of Canada with the book and teaching guide serving as a spine.Far from being limited in interest to children - the handsome hardcover makes an irresistible coffee table book - relatives have nabbed our copy whenever we visit with it on hand. My twenty-something sister exclaimed in delight over, \\"B is for Banting, B is for Best,\\" and my seventy-something grandmother has poured over it several times.It was her eagle eyes that happened to catch two small errors in the factual text that could have easily been caught by a good fact checker. Downtown Winnipeg is well known for having the windiest corner in Canada, but not the coldest and Cape Breton Island is part of Nova Scotia, not New Brunswick. Thanks Grandma. Other than these two counts, the remainder of the information presented seems sound.NOTE: These errors have since been corrected in the current version.In only 26 letters, Ulmer's introduction to the alphabet and Canada covers a large territory both geographically and in the number of foundational \`pegs' for children to hang additional knowledge on as they grow. From coast to coast to coast, from city to field, from past to present, the broad selection of topics join together to form a tapestry familiar to all who know and love Canada. Whether in the library, schoolroom, or home, M is for Maple is sure to hold onto its status as a classic in Canadiana for children for years to come."},{"Title":"M is for Maple","review":"This is a lovely book with lots of interesting facts about Canada.

The book was about a girl Amelia. The book was like she wrote in a diary every and she sared it with us. The book was about her dad being a Prince of Ginovia and his mother is the Queen of Ginovia. His mother came to see Amelia to tell her a sceret.Amelia never knew she was a princess. When she found out that she was a Princess she freaked out. She never wanted to tell anyone because they would of made a big deal out of it. She was going to tell her best friend Liliy but she knew she was going to make a big deal and tell everyone. Then Amelia couldn't keep a the secret and more. She told her best frined Lily that she was a Princess and she freaked out. When her grandmother wanted her to go to one of the dinners that she is having she wanted her to get her hair strained and cut. She said that she looked like a freak. When she got to school she was in her math class and she was wearing a hat and the one girl she hates told the teacher that we weren't allowed to wear hats in school so she had to take it off. All the girls were laughing at her. Twards the end her dad dies and something happens!

To be perfectly honest, I was kinda glad to see him gone (ecstatic doesn't even begin to describe it), but his disappearance has really been hard on my current wife (Bessie). She loves cats and her Bobo had been \\"a part of her\\" for almost 14 years (ridiculous). Obviously, I couldn't imagine replacing Bobo with another cat and neither could Bess (don't get me started). I've tried several things to try to cheer my distraught girl up (Fur Real Pet, Screensaver for her computer, daily cat calendar, etc.), but nothing has worked (Bobo was a very unique cat). Until now!!This \\"Cats in the Sun\\" 2003 calendar has brought a smile to my bride's face I haven't seen in the months since Bobo went missing. The photography is stunning (really)--these Grecian kitty cats are depicted frolicking in romantic settings, climbing all over one another, and exhibiting a playful nature certain to bring a smile to many a catlover. As an unexpected bonus, I have all but convinced Bessie that Bobo is alive and well in both June and August. Great stuff.

This is the story of John Trudeaux, a personal injury attorney whose commercials on daytime television promise quick, painless settlements of accident cases. He doesn't want to save the world, he's not even interested in saving his clients, but he is very worried about his golf handicap; and he does all that he can to avoid going to court. The plot hinges on the &quot;Thed Device&quot; which is a machine that can determine with 100 percent certainty whether or not a person is telling the truth. Trudeaux finds himself caught up in a billion-dollar legal battle with both sides wanting to use the machine to their advantage. An unlikely romance develops between Trudeaux and much younger and more refined female attorney during the process. The plot does not hinge on the romance; however, but on how important is &quot;truth&quot; in the courtroom. It was funny and thought provoking and I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"An Offer of Truth","review":"This is an enjoyable story while at the same time providing insight into the legal profession, including average personal injury attorneys and whether Courts really want the truth and how new technology could come into play in the future. If you're getting tired of all the Grisham books, try something new."},{"Title":"An Offer of Truth","review":"Besides being a good story, this novel has an important message about the legal process in civil actions. One cannot assume a judge is unbiased or that witnesses will tell the truth. This book, though not entirely believable, shows what could happen, especially when very large sums of money are at stake. If more citizens were aware of the limitations of the justice system and the ease with which a court can influence the outcome of a case, it might be a first step in getting better judges and higher standards overall in civil cases. Worth reading for the story and the message."},{"Title":"An Offer of Truth","review":"Of course I am somewhat prejudice, but I would judge what I've written as a delightful vindication of what most people think of when they hear the words &quot;trial lawyer.&quot; After thirty years before the bar I asked myself what our great legal institutions might do if they actually were faced with the prospect of bringing unquestioned truth to the courtroom. We live in an age where science can weigh a photon with accruacy. Is it so much to believe that soon we will have a device that will perfectly judge truth in court? Truth without human judgement. Of what use is artful counsel in the face of perfect truth? I hope you find the answer delightful. I had fun writing it. I am a romantic and thought that only love could save a lawyer from his own kind. So there's a love story here too."},{"Title":"An Offer of Truth","review":"A REALLY GOOD READ, AND SINCE THE AUTHOR IS A PERSONAL FRIEND, I MIGHT ADD THAT THE BOOK IS MILDLY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL!gREAT FIRST ATTEMPT,AND AM LOOKING FORWARD TO BOOK #2!"},{"Title":"The Eyes of Raymond Hu","review":"I recently saw a documentary on young Raymond Hu on ETV and was unnerved by the power of his art. The vibrant reds and spiritually chosen hues (especially on or around the eyes of the animals)suck you into the enlightened eyes and smoldering embers of the predatory beast and the fragile yet cunning tiny bird; as if to tell humans to connect their psyches to the animals that mirror their true inner personality.His paintings remind me of the drive through safari at Jersey's Great Adventures. The only animal caged in that whole place was the black panther; it paced in this tiny rectangular cage in the middle of this expanse of land. His beautiful eyes and frustrated growls made me want to set him free to terrorize the landscape.The colorful and taloned herd of baboons that attacked the vinyl roofed cars (signs were posted against cars entering with such)like banshis on the slaughter, though terrifying, seemed natural and justified, in their element.It's amazing the depth of Raymond's perception, he has obvious poor vision, yet his work is so definitive. The down syndrome isn't even an issue. Raymonds art takes you from the crust to the core of his true being."},{"Title":"The Eyes of Raymond Hu","review":"Raymond Hu is a young artist who works in the medium of Chinese brush painting. His extraordinarily striking portraits of animals are wonders to behold, and the expressions these animals have and the cast of their eyes adds an unexpected dimension or &quot;soul&quot; to these portraits, and it's as though we've entered the spirit of the animal itself. I have friends who've gotten pages from Hu's book framed. This book cannot be recommended too highly."},{"Title":"The scarlet lily,","review":"A magnificent tale of Mary Magdalene from the Bible.

He desperately tries to pass his memories onto his son so that they will never die, even if he does.\\"The Forgotten\\", like most of Wiesel's books, weaves back and forth through time and between different narrators. At times the transitions between these various changes is a little choppy, but the stories all interconnect in the end. Elhanan's son, Malkiel, struggles with the task his father has assigned him. He cannot fathom how he is to possibly hold and retain his father's memories along with his own. And when his father asks him to take a pilgrimage to his hometown, both are unsure as to what to look for, but know that an answer must exist there that will free Elhanan's painful memories and grant him peace.Wiesel has devoted his life to searching for meaning in what has happened to the Jewish people. As a survivor of the Holocaust, he has a tremendous witness to bear. That aspect of being a witness plays a large role in \\"The Forgotten\\". As Malkiel finally realizes, he must do what his father no longer can. \\"I will bear witness in his place; I will speak for him. It is the son's duty not to let his father die.\\" And it is the duty of the world not to let the past slip into oblivion. Lest we forget."},{"Title":"The Forgotten","review":"The Forgotten explores both the holocaust experiences of the aging father, and his new horror of losing his memory. Both are intensely moving, whether seen through his own eyes, or those of his son struggling to fulfill a difficult obligation. Like all of Elie Wiesel's writings, this book stays with you and influences your own thinking on many topics. A sad story, unforgettable.Professor Wiesel did me the honor of writing a blurb for my novel,The Heretic (Library of American Fiction), which describes anti-Judaism on the eve of the Spanish Inquisition. I also invite you to consider my new novel,A Good Conviction, the story of a young man in Sing Sing prison, wrongly convicted of a crime he did not commit."},{"Title":"The Forgotten","review":"This is an author I hold with great respect. However, I must be honest in saying I had difficulty reading this book. I agree that it may be me, and not him, but I do feel his Trilogy to be much easier reading.

The First Lady became a sounding board for the country's ills at that time, while Americans, and others, vented their sometimes heartbreaking concerns. Eleanor Roosevelt listened with open ears and answered with compassion and caring, understanding the pulse of the common American citizen, as has no First Lady since. At a time when Americans were in need, Mrs. Roosevelt used her influence to effect change.Dr. Knepper paints a captivating picture of that history. Her next book should be a follow-up on some of the folks whose letters are included in this rich collection - how did they fare?"},{"Title":"Dear Mrs. Roosevelt: Letters to Eleanor Roosevelt Through Depression and War","review":"In these days of conflicting priorities and overwhelming crises, Dr. Knepper's book reminds us that people have overcome much more difficult odds than we face at present. The letters she has chosen to reprint depict poignant and harrowing situations. It reminds us that all Americans have been pioneers. In a charming touch, each letter is faithfully copied which makes you \\"hear\\" the accent in which it was written. This book begs to be performed with a series of actors reading the letters on a stage. Fans of Ken Burns would love this book.Of course, it also portraits Eleanor Roosevelt in the way she shone best: through her actions. When faced with so many letters carrying pleas for help, she had to say no to so many of them that you almost feel her compulsion to act when she could do so. The greatest impact this book had on me was in reminding me that any action toward the good of others counts, even when there are so many issues to address. I plan to reread this book often."},{"Title":"Dear Mrs. Roosevelt: Letters to Eleanor Roosevelt Through Depression and War","review":"This remarkable collection of letters spans the FDR presidency and gives remarkable insight into Eleanor Roosevelt's personal experiences as first lady and her interactions with government agencies.

They also, of course, give powerful testimony to the almost worshipful admiration that ordinary people had for the extraordinary Eleanor Roosevelt."},{"Title":"Damia's Children","review":"Although I have read many of Anne's novels, Damia's Children truly captured my imagination and interest. The book opens leasurely, some years after its predecessor, the book Damia. The beautifully written openings describe in great detail the individual characters of Damia's Talented children, but it foreshadows the menace the reader expects. And true to its promises, the book plunges into an exciting expedition where the combined fleets of both the Human and Mrdini species track down the home world of their decades-old enemies, the Hive. But this book is not just about space-battles and &quot;star wars&quot;. The reader witnesses the growing-up and maturing of Damia's four eldest children, and we even see glimpses of characters that one would expect to be obsolete: the Rowan, Isthia Raven, and the rest of Damia's children's predecessors who played such a large part in previous books. The book is definitely, without a doubt, a must-read, especially if you have read the previous two books, The Rowan and Damia.."},{"Title":"Damia's Children","review":"I had a hard time listening to this book.

THE BOOK WAS IN GREAT CONDITION AND RECEIVED THE BOOK BEFORE THE EXPECTED DATE.. GREAT."},{"Title":"Damia's Children","review":"Great book from a great series by a great author. She writes in a clear style that draws you in with intriguing story lines and appealing characters."},{"Title":"Damia's Children","review":"This third novel in the chronicles of the Rowan and her descendants takes us into the 24th Century and a third generation of the Talented, the \\"parapsychic\\" Primes and T's whose telepathic and telekinetic powers make possible interstellar communication, supply, and the unity of the Nine-Star League. At the heart of the book are the Raven-Lyon family, the eight children (Laria, Thian, Rojer, Zara, Kaltia, Morag, Ewain, and Petra, ages fourteen to eight months at the start of the story) of Damia Raven and Afra Lyon, particularly the two oldest boys and, later, Zara. Growing up on Iota Aurigae, where their mother is Prime of the local FT&T; station, the siblings are also at the forefront of an important and unique experiment in interspecies co-operation, raised with pairs of Mrdini, members of the intelligent, spacefaring species that has been allied with humanity since before they were born. The 'Dinis, as they're generally called, have a long history of battling the mysterious Hivers, who have also threatened the human colonies but been beaten back by the Talents. Now it's the turn of the new generation to take up the battle. At 16 Thian (accompanied by his 'Dinis) is assigned to the military spaceship \\"Vadim,\\" part of a human-'Dini fleet attempting to backtrace the course of the last Hiver incursion; here he must serve as a combination liaison officer with the 'Dini ships and \\"catcher\\" of supplies 'ported on by the Talents--while coping with the hostility of an unknown crewmember and his first experience with love. Then the fleet encounters a Hiver wreck, a vast craft the size of a small asteroid that appears to have been caught in the blast of a supernova. Has the Hiver homeworld been destroyed? What will this mean to the nascent war between the human-'Dini alliance and the Hiver colonizer-ships? When Thian discovers living Hiver larvae in a protected area of the ship, everything comes to a head. Then Thian's brother Rojer is assigned to the \\"Beijing\\" to help observe a Hiver queen whose lifepod has been captured by the Alliance--and softhearted sister Zara proves unexpectedly crucial in the effort to keep her alive.McCaffrey's picture of a large, close-knit family of psychically gifted parents and children is so well-drawn that as you read it you think that this is definitely the way such a unit would operate. Her 'Dinis are an intriguing alien culture that definitely *is* alien, with just enough points of similarity to humanity to allow a sympathetic unity to be established between them. Her colonies are an intriguing mix of high and low tech (Damia's children go hunting on horseback with bows and darts), and her Navy and its ships seem a natural future outgrowth of what we have today. The book ends on a note at once upbeat and incomplete, as Damia's father, Earth Prime Jeff Raven, admits that the allies now have \\"a waiting game to play.\\" But both humanity and the 'Dinis seem to be better prepared for the final confrontation than they were even 20 years earlier."},{"Title":"Damia's Children","review":"I expected more after reading The Rowan and Damia. I think the novel could have been much improved if it had again focused on the viewpoint of one main character, as was done in The Rowan and in most of Damia. This would have alleviated the problem of too many jumps in plotline with too little elaboration. The characters seemed flat as well. I found it boring, and very disappointing."},{"Title":"Damia's Children","review":"Damia's Children is a wonderful follow up to The Rowan and Damia. This is a wonderful series. Anne McCaffrey is a gifted writer and I love reading about telekentics and the things they do. The hive creatures are very strange and the way Zara reacts to the captured queen is awesome. I thought for sure the queen was going to eat Zara, but instead she seemed to not even really know she was there. The Rowan and all the others in this series are definately page turners from page 1 to the end. One just can't wait to get to the next page or the next book in the series. I am starting Lyon's Pride now and can't wait to see how that turns out. THanks to Anne for wonderful reading. Joy Jenkins"},{"Title":"Damia's Children","review":"Disappointing story about Damia's children and their &quot;great&quot; exploits. The story tries to cover as much time and action as possible in as few a words as possible creating a disjointed and thin plot. It's even a bit hard to follow there are so many gaps; not one of McCaffrey's better works. And the anti-racial discrimination theme was tired and trite, a pale facsimile to Orson Scott Card's Ender series which is much better written and a bit more provocative. Too bad. It had potential."},{"Title":"Damia's Children","review":"This books along with the latter talent books are so unrealistic as to be boring. The first talent books, Pegasus in Flight and Pegasus in Space were interesting and fun because we were reading about real characters.They had Talent, but they were still real people.The characters in the latter talent books are nothing less than gods, with an almost all-powerful Talent, and seemingly little or no personal problems or limitations (which makes th books dull). Also, what the books really portray, without actually saying it is basically a Talent autocracy. Non talented are inferior and unimportant, and the talented rule over everyone else with their powers. This reminds me of Star Trek, where everyone is law abiding, and the authority of the Federation is unquestioned.So what happens to those who question the authority of the Federation? They are automatically outlaws. Its really quite totalitarian.Anyway, this book is boring and not worth the money."},{"Title":"Damia's Children","review":"I have read- and loved- several Anne McCaffrey books, but this was not one of them. I was repulsed when I came to the part where Mrs. McCaffrey attempts to set up a mystery-Talent who has a secret enmity for the aliens aboard. However, she repeatedly gave away who it was- from the looks on the character's face, to a near-outright confession. These seemed to me to be an insult to the reader's intelligence and made this book one of a very few books which I was too disgusted to finish. Still, part of my disappointment stems from the knowledge that she can write much better than this, and has."},{"Title":"Damia's Children","review":"This is a very good book.

Wonderful to see the legacy being fostered in the newest generation"},{"Title":"Damia's Children","review":"I listened to the Audio version of Damia's children, and found that it was quite well-narrated. And while I liked this book, I would prefer a book which focused on a single character rather than a novel split into three parts. By rights this should be three books.The plot is simple: with a threat of the HIVE upon them, the telepathic 'talented' Lyon children must help their parents defend earth from....The predations of a vicious insect species, but are they so vicious? Only the Lyon children seem capable of figuring this out.I think that the author may fall into a bit of a rut with this series. The Lyon children are 'super' kids, squeaky clean, friendly and well-adjusted. While I understand that they have lots of responsibility, these children are too perfect. They are more competant, more intelligent, and more powerful than anyone else. &lt;Sighs>. No WONDER some Terran's resent them.Two things that skeeved ne out about this book: Number One: How easily these 'children' are manipulated by the adults. I would hope that in the future they have some form of child labor laws Number Two: The second story about Theon, where he has a relationship with a much older army nurse. Ick. this completely skeeved me out. I guess its just my western mind, but a relationship between a teenager and a much older woman and this person a nurse in a position of authority is pretty gross. No thanks! Ick. Ick. Double Ick!Overall, the second story cost this book two stars. Not as good as some of her earlier works."},{"Title":"Damia's Children","review":"It's interesting to read about Damia's children;their personalities,relationships,the challenges they faced,and the lives they lead.The characters of the previous books(&quot;The Rowan&quot; and &quot;Damia&quot;) are not forgotten,and we still hear about them and see their involvement.This book has more technical details,especially about the Hivers.A good read!"},{"Title":"Damia's Children","review":"I absolutely love Anne McCaffrey and have read all of her books.

The result is a scrumptious wealth of recipes which are truly a delight to prepare and eat. The only reason I didn't give the review 5 stars is that I found that many of the recipes were a little more time-consuming than I prefer, taking 45 minutes minimum to prepare. However, the result is food that is truly authentic Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Laotian, and so on. This book really delivers on the flavors of South East Asia. Most recipes call for ingredients which can be found in any grocery store, but there will be times you'll have to make a trip to your neighborhood Asian mart to discover the delight of cooking with real banana leaves, palm sugar or some of the more unusual ingredients. I would say that if you love cooking, especially on the grill, and enjoy flavorful food, you'll really get a lot out of this book."},{"Title":"Asian Grilling: 85 Satay, Kebabs, Skewers and Other Asian-Inspired Recipes for Your Barbecue","review":"My wife and I have been visiting Thai and Vietnamese restaurants for years.

I would recommend this book to someone who has as least cooked some Asian food."},{"Title":"Asian Grilling: 85 Satay, Kebabs, Skewers and Other Asian-Inspired Recipes for Your Barbecue","review":"This is a nice cookbook for those interested in Asian food. There are many recipes for marinades and sauces, as well as grilled salads, noodles and flatbreads, even Thai quesadillas. Su-Mei Yu, a native of Thailand, does a nice job of explaining methods for grilling and for proper satay. There are recipes from most countries in southeast Asia, Japan, Korea and China. The recipes appear to be rather authentic and easy to follow. There are many good pictures of the food, and she suggests multiple ways to serve particular dishes (for example, with different sauces or sides).While this isn't my very favorite Asian cookbook, it is one I refer to often.

He was moved to Cairo after a wild party during which guns were fired through the ceiling. Indeed, an Aldrich sub-theme is the extent to which British and American secret agents frequently unnerved their own governments more than the regimes they were supposed to monitor subvert or liberate."},{"Title":"The Hidden Hand","review":"Richard Aldrich is another British historian of intelligence who offers lots and lots of data, fact as well as myth, and adds his own opinions to sort of freshen the materiel. His 740-page The Hidden Hand is preceded by Stephen Dorrill's MI6 and several works by Christopher Andrew and some of Andrew's co-authors; he credits both Dorrill and Andrew for their support for his own project.Aldrich tries to debunk some of the myths that are carried from one U.K. published espionage history to another - none more prevalent than that Harold Adrian Philby's betrayals destroyed much of the MI6 and CIA/OPC covert and often fatal dispatching of East Bloc exiles to do political mischief in their homelands, such as driving Albanian dictator Enver Hoxha to history's ashheap. By Aldrich's brief light, Philby was too important a spy for the KGB to allow him to be much involved in secret shoot-'em-ups. While it is to his credit for not totally swallowing the British - and too often American - myth about Philby, he misses some important details that grew the Philby legend; did Burgess truly courier Philby's purloined top secret papers to KGB case officers in New York City?One overall element that bothered this writer is Aldrich's themantic approach. Too often a reader has to overuse the index to maintain one thread or another coherently. That is not to say the book is badly written, for it is not; rather it is merely inconvenient. In fact, there was little if any of the obvious mistakes that gatherers of huge volumes of factoids too often make. Finally, for this American, there is reason to credit Aldrich for his obviously huge amount of research effort. One must assume that he visited such backwater American presidential archives as the Truman Library at Independence, Missouri, and its even more isolated neighbor, the Eisenhower Library at Abilene, Kansas.With both the British and American governments moving to release ever more Cold War era documents, there seems a certainty that more volumes on the fascinating 1950s West-East faceoff will surely be turned out. One can only hope that the myths that make up the history of Cold War intelligence 60 years after its beginning will one day be debunked by an availablity of solid evidence rather than merely by an author's guesswork."},{"Title":"The Hidden Hand","review":"As someone else said, well written, but I only mean the sentence structure in this case. The entire book goes back and forth on dates and people so much that there is no timeline structure, and therefore impossible to get a better understanding of the events after reading it than before. It reads more like a soap opera giving name after name with one anecdote after another but with no clear overall picture.Having so much jumbled information with such a heavy mixture of what I believe to be personal opinion \\"facts,\\" such as the opening chapters reliance on \\"sources\\" focusing almost entirely on how the English and Americans thought that the Russians were nothing more than animals, makes this a book that does not seem like a very reliable source of information.Personally, I prefer the historical books that have a well written timeline with a much less emotional focus, such as the Winston Churchill books on WW2 events or the XX system of 1939-45. They may have biases etc, but they are not mostly about trivial opinions and people in an unstructured timeline."},{"Title":"The West: Encounters & Transformations, Volume B (Chapters 10-18) (MyHistoryLab Series)","review":"This textbook has some advantages in terms of considering the \\"significance\\" of historical events and phenomena, but it suffers severely in terms of basic details and even offers inaccurate phrasing of important historical data. Admirably, the textbook hammers home the concept of cultural identity through its coverage of many different periods and peoples. This is not the only theme it highlights, but also attempts to give significant space to other sorts of \\"significance\\" of historical events--giving students some interesting perspective beyond the facts and figures.Unfortunately, it offers poor explanation of the details, revealing an ignorance of current scholarship (one need not talk like a scholar for a textbook, but should reflect the best scholarship). We used this textbook in a course on Western Civilization, for which I was a Teaching Assistant. My own specialty is in Christian origins. Thus I noticed inaccuracies in that area. For instance, Jesus is described as the \\"founder of Christianity.\\" Rather than discuss the pastoral and occasional nature of Paul's letters, the textbook states that his letters \\"articulate key doctrines of the Christian faith--doctrines that helped divide Christianity from Judaism.\\" The description is generally unhelpful and the term \\"doctrine\\" anachronistic (implying a later \\"system\\" of doctrines). Students get an image of Jesus founding a new religion from scratch and Paul making certain that the two (supposedly distinct) religions are clearly divided. These things may have happened much later, but is inaccurate regarding the first century situation.My fellow Teaching Assistants noted similar inaccuracies and missing data in their own fields, such as Ancient Greece and Rome. We noticed that much data is missing in favor of more explanation of \\"significance.\\" It is my opinion that a textbook like this should provide a firmer foundation of data.Furthermore, the book fails in terms of its basic \\"tools\\" for students. The index is spotty, missing out on important terms (the Egyptian concept of Ma'at, for instance), and sometimes even incorrect pagination. The glossary of terms is quite weak in its selection of terms. For example, out of the sixty or so terms required of students in one course on Western Civilization for their exam (*central* names and events), less than ten appear in the Glossary. The boxes offering lists of dates often miss important events in the timeline. Such weaknesses make exam study for students very difficult.I have not used many other textbooks on Western Civilization, but Civilization in the West by Kishlansky/Geary/O'Brien (same publisher) is a much better option (even if its maps are not quite as attractive as Levack)."},{"Title":"The West: Encounters & Transformations, Volume B (Chapters 10-18) (MyHistoryLab Series)","review":"This textbook is not only written in a conversational tone which holds the reader's attention, but it brings in art, personalities of historical figures, and other tidbits to enhance a student's learning experience.

I was looking forward to the class, however, I must admit that history is not my strongest suit. It starts by explaining how to learn history, and that one should really strive for the method that asks the following questions: Who, what, where, when, why and how. I would assume this to be a fairly obvious point, however, the authors made a point to not only explain that this process is needed, but also explained each and every single one...in detail.I think I would have probably been able to have learned better from a more linear book. What I mean is to start at the start and work your way through history, and by utilizing the 'who, what,..., how' method. However, this isn't the way this book was written for the most part. I found that it would explain a topic that would happen later in the time frame of that particular chapter, and then later (almost, it would seem, as if time was catching up with how the authors wanted to write) it would be brought up again, yet now more detail is given. I understand that to make a point you might sometimes have to refer back to something else or even refer to a later topic, however, most of the book was written this way.I am just writing this review as an honest person that isn't strong with learning history. I think I would have been better off with a more linear book rather than one that jumps from one topic to another with GREAT frequency, and sometimes to the point of near confusion to me.I hope this review helps, and I kind of wished I would have focused more on others' reviews I read rather than being all giddy about taking the course and learning about our past.

When I attended the University of Arizona there was a full blown course in embryology, both descriptive and experimental. By the time I was a graduate student at the same institution the course had been rolled into Organismic Biology in which all of embryology was loaded into a third of a semester. In essence developmental biology in relation to evolutionary studies gave way to molecular. Still some pretty good work went on in the background that impinged on development and was to result in the discovery of HOX genes. HOX genes (or homeotic genes) proved to be the \\"organizer\\" that was postulated by various experimental embryologists such as Spemann. Even more astoundingly they proved to be pretty much the same, no matter which organism was being studied. HOX genes in humans were essentially identical to those of insects!This remarkable fact offers proof for the idea that all life is related and that development is a key factor in evolution. In \\"Endless Forms Most Beautiful\\" Sean B. Carroll explains the significance of such discoveries as the genetic \\"tool kit\\" (including HOX genes) on our understanding of evolution and of development. Indeed, this is a fascinating story that has already caused me to rethink some of my understanding of evolutionary principles.We live in an amazing world in an amazing universe. The genetic material made up of DNA is a very remarkable material. What other materials could have developed huge numbers of organisms (as many as 30 million extant) that vary from zebras to sulfur bacteria? Yet that complexity appears to have developed from a very simple beginning.Carroll was influenced by Steven J. Gould in his interest in biology, but he does not flinch from disagreeing with Gould about contingency. Carroll says that if the tape of evolution were run again, pretty much the same thing would have happened. I think that I may have to agree to a point (although not as far as Simon Conway Morris goes with it). However, certain alterations in earth history might still have caused a radical change in the outcome, as in the development of a completely water covered planet or a very large asteroid strike (larger that the one that apparently killed the dinosaurs except birds). At the same time not all evolved faunas that developed in isolation from each other resemble each other exactly. The marsupials of Australia, for example, had a number of forms similar to placental mammals. However, there was no exact analog to the kangaroo outside of Australia or of hoofed animals in Australia (giant wombats don't have hooves). I agree faunas can be similar, but not necessarily identical and that intelligent life may be inevitable, but may not necessarily have looked like us or even evolved from mammals.That said, evo-devo, as the evolutionary development researchers call it, has much to offer and it certainly cannot be dismissed. This is an exciting time to be involved with evolutionary biology, despite the creationist (or more sophisticated \\"Intelligent Design\\") attack on the whole idea.This is an excellent introduction to the excitement of a continuing unfolding of evolutionary thought. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Ever since high school I've been looking for ways to branch out my fascination and interest from physics to biology. I have read the books and collections of essays by Stephen Gould and loved them, but nothing else has so caught my attention until THIS book.Sean B. Carroll (there's more than one Sean Carroll out there) does a fine job showing how insect and vertebrate forms are built. More than that, he shows how they are fundamentally related WAY back in the past. Even more controversial than humans being related to chimps, we're related to, say..., lobsters!What's cool is these conclusions are based on repeatable experimental evidence of the makeup of DNA, genes, chromosomes etc. Carroll makes a nice analogy between the vast amount of DNA strands that are NOT expressed in individual forms and the vast amount of matter in the universe that is NOT expressed as visible stars and galaxies. (OK, so maybe I STILL like physics a little more, but I'm making progress!)Carroll nicely acknowledges Gould's contributions to the popularization of better public understanding of evolution (e.g., Wonderful Life) and further extends the discussion of Darwin. Trying to understand life without evolution is like trying to understand the universe without gravity. But Carroll moves the discussion from anecdotes to evidence. I like that!I hope to see MUCH more on this new field of evolutionary developmental biology. As much as I am interested in how the universe began (and where it's going), I am interested in how human beings began and where THEY might be going."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Despite vast differences in form and function common principles coordinate animal development from a single fertilized egg. Master genes that control development are found across widely divergent species - Drosophila fruit flies and humans share a deep genetic legacy - many of the genes identified as controllers of vertebrate development were originally discovered in these flies.Multicellular plants and animals are essentially societies of cells that vary in configuration and complexity. Darwinian evolution shaped these multitudinous forms as a result of small changes in offspring and natural selection of those best adapted to their environment. Variation arises from mutations in genes that control how cells in developing embryos behave. This tight linkage between evolution and development lies at the heart of the questions evo devo, shorthand for evolutionary developmental biology, is attempting to answer. Sean B. Carroll is perfectly positioned to explain evo devo, and his comprehensive understanding illuminates \\"Endless Forms Most Beautiful\\" The New Science of Evo Devo and the Making of the Animal Kingdom.\\"When and where genes are expressed determines how animals develop. The control regions of these genes - switches that change existing patterns of gene activity into new patterns - are crucial and a single gene can have many control regions. This flexibility underlies the fact that 95% of genes coding for proteins are similar in humans and mice. Evolution of control regions has made us human - and different from our primate ancestors.Drosophila is utilized to explain the basic developmental tool kit shared by all animals. Carroll introduces the master Hox genes and intercellular signaling molecules such as proteins specified by hedgehog genes. The economy of signaling proteins utilized during development is also emphasized - the same molecules can be employed multiple times since cells respond differently according to their genetic characteristics and developmental history. Carroll also illustrates how individual animals are made up of similar parts - modular construction plays an important role in evolution. Structures ranging from vertebrae to spots on butterfly wings are artfully presented to drive this point home.Complex animals arose in the Vendian period (650 - 543 MYA). During the Cambrian (543 - 490 MYA) animals with hard body parts enter the fossil record. Evo devo shows that genes responsible for Cambrian animals were plausibly derived from Vendian precursors. Cambrian arthropod dominance is probably due to Hox genes that specify different body segments and the corresponding appendages that formed their bodies. Carroll explores how the number of distinct appendage types increased - the relative shifting of Hox genes could have lead to the ancestral biramous (forked) limb that eventually diversified into structures ranging from gills to wings.Butterfly spots are a beautiful and clever example of evolutionary tinkering. Each spot appears to evolve its shape, color and size independently of other elements. Evolution has tinkered not only with the qualities of each spot, but with the making of the spot itself. Carroll's group discovered that at the center of each spot the gene Distal-less - a key gene controlling the distal development of appendages such as insect limbs - is expressed and initiates spot development.Carroll also addresses creationists - the bizarre bibliolaters who think Flintstones reruns on late night TV are documentaries - by pointing out the importance of evolution and evo devo to science and human knowledge in general. The PR campaign known as Intelligent Design is similarly debunked as irreducibly insipid. Science is full of mysteries, that is why there are still employment opportunities for scientists.After reading this important book tryFrom DNA to Diversity: Molecular Genetics and the Evolution of Animal Designby Sean B. Carroll, Grenier, and Weatherby for a more detailed discussion orThe Plausibility of Life: Resolving Darwin's Dilemmaby Kirschner and Gerhart - who introduce \\"facilitated variation\\" based on evo devo insights to explain the evolution of complexity and novelty."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Here's the short version:We have about 25,000 genes. A large number of these are \\"tool kit\\" genes that evolved over 500 million years ago - even before the Cambrian explosion. Almost exact counterparts are found in apes and mice, and close counterparts in arthropods and worms. Next to each gene is a stretch of so-called \\"junk DNA\\" that does not code for genes. These DNA segments contain from three to twenty (or more) switches that collectively turn that gene on or off. The switches are activated or repressed by the differing concentration gradients of the protein products of other tool kit genes produced by neighboring cells. A useful but not perfect analogy involves complicated circuitry with multiple on/off and if this/then that switches. By virtue of the servo-feedback loops creating different combinations of the protein products of tool kit genes, cells of the early embryo create a geographical map of their future body.An escalating orchestra of domino effects builds complexity, each new development affecting the others. The tool kit genes and the other core genes that control biochemical function from bacteria to man are resistant to mutation. Novelty and speciation comes from the infinite variety of changes that come from the more successfully mutable genetic switches. Not a single biologist 40 years ago would have predicted this discovery.The exciting developments of evo-devo have sent jolts of electricity through the evolutionary community. Nothing basic has been overturned; much has been enhanced. For example: It used to be thought that eyes had evolved independently many, many times - after all, the lumps of light sensitivity in primitive wormlike creatures, the compound eyes of insects, and the eyes of mammals have more differences than commonalities. As it turns out, the making of each eye-like organ is directed by a PAX6 tool kit gene. Not only that, if the PAX6 gene from the mouse is artificially introduced into the genetic material destined for the leg of the fly, an eye will form on the fly leg...and it's not a mouse eye - it's a fly eye. The mouse PAX6 gene switches - influenced by chemical gradients from adjacent tissue in the fly embryo - cause the gene to produce a fly eye! Astounding!Tool kit genes (and other genes) are frequently named after the anomaly that doesn't develop when that gene is absent. The TINMAN gene controls development of the heart and circulatory system from butterflies to badgers - named after the Wizard of Oz character who had no heart. The wealth of information presented in this book will surprise, educate, and entertain the reader - and evo-devo researchers have just scratched the surface. New graduates in biology are surging into this explosive and previously neglected science.There are three other books that I know of that cover these captivating discoveries of the last 30 years:\\"Coming to Life,\\" by Christiane Nusslein-Volhard. This fine book, written by a Nobel Prize winner for her meticulous ground-breaking work on fruit flies emphasizes the concentration gradients, which are indeed central to the story.\\"The Plausibility of Life,\\" by Kirschner and Gerhart. These authors are so excited about the new findings, they think it deserves a name - facilitated variation - and of course, they thought of the name. It is an excellent book with more basic sciences than the book under review, emphasizing how evo-devo facilitates novelty through an enhanced Baldwin Effect.\\"From DNA to Diversity,\\" by Sean B. Carroll, Grenier, and Weatherby. This excellent book has much more detail and is geared toward the graduate student in the biological sciences.I have studied them all. For the general public, \\"Endless Forms Most Beautiful\\" is the best. I recommend the introduction and chapters 3, 5, & 6 for those who prefer the short version, but there is not a dull chapter in the book.\\"Endless Forms Most Beautiful\\" is superbly written - essential reading for those who wish to keep up with the stunning advances that have occurred in evolutionary knowledge during the past thirty years."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"I admit that Carroll's work contributed to my decision to study genetics and evolution. This book in particular was captivating like few other pop-science books. Only Richard Dawkins' \\"The Selfish Gene\\" was as engaging.That being said, \\"Endless Forms Most Beautiful\\" (EFMB) consistently pushes a specific and personal agenda. Carroll's basic thesis is that most genes we see in animals are highly similar yet species look amazingly different (for example, a human eye gene, Pax6, can also induce eye formation in the fruit fly), and it's in the use of these similar genes - the timing and location of gene expression - that truly causes these differences.Carroll's successful career in research has hinged upon this emphasis on gene expression, and he takes every advantage to propagate it. What naive readers of EFMB will not appreciate is the level of debate surrounding this idea in current evolution research. While Carroll's ideas make logical sense, there is not nearly enough evidence to support it. Carroll writes as an authority, but he glosses over interesting and conflicting evidence.This book is recommended for those wanting to learn more about evolution - those with little to moderate background.

P Grant & R Grant (2010)."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"I needed a book like this. I had already tried two books on Evo Devo but they were so full of technical details that I couldn't keep track of what I was reading. Endless Forms leaves out most of what is known about the subject but it says enough for me to grasp the central ideas and it has just enough examples to illustrate its story. Hence the title of my review.The book is strongest in explaining how genes regulate development, mainly because this is the area where most is known. Most readers will have heard of hox genes, sonic hedgehog, and a few others. Carroll gives particular examples of the workings of these genes. For example, the shoulders of vertebrates form where the areas of expression of certain hox genes meet; in some snakes, one of these genes isn't expressed and so the snakes never form shoulders. This suggests something about evolution - that these snakes lost their limbs through a change in gene expression - but it doesn't suggest how that change came about. This is a topic for future research but, unfortunately, Carroll doesn't talk about the fact that evo devo has a lot of work ahead.In a few spots, Carroll loses track of his main theme. For example, he has a section on the evolution of humans, especially our brains. This relates a number of important changes, but doesn't relate most of the changes to evo devo.Carroll also says that evo devo provides evidence to refute creationism, but he doesn't back this up. For example, he outlines the evolution of legs, arms, and wings from lobed fins. However, as any creationist will be quick to point out, from lobed fins to legs and wings is no big deal; the hard part is getting from a flat-sided fish to one with bony fins. I wish he had addressed that. And he should be aware that creationists aren't interested in facts; their only consideration is to save people from the sin of atheism. If you want to argue against creationism, direct your attention to people who will consider facts.Although I have said that Endless Forms has its minor flaws, I still recommend it for its strength: it gives to us non-specialists a good view of the role of regulatory genes in development and it suggests why this role is significant in evolution[Above written 12 Oct 2005; this added 17 May 2006] Carroll has another book on Evo-Devo, From DNA to Diversity. It has more information than Endless Forms and might be more appropriate if you've already read a bit about evo-devo. If you finish Endless Forms and want to know more, it's a good place to look.

You'll have to go past the first page.[This added 24 July 2006] I have just read and reviewed a book, Coming to Life, which treats genes expression, control genes, and embryology at a very elementary level.

One of the pioneers of evo devo, Carroll successfully summarizes this quiet revolution in thinking about origins both large and small.Carroll's task is to relate how complex biological structures, from the seemingly unrelated circulatory systems in flies and humans, to the striping of a zebra and the camouflaging patterns on a butterfly's wings, originate from a very few basic genetic \`tools'. This toolkit - the contents in large part shared by all living creatures - and the vast number of genetic \`switches' its components throw between egg and birth, makes for fascinating exploration. It is not simple reading, but Carroll makes it comprehensible.Accessibility is particularly important in areas where evo devo comes head-to-head with cornerstone arguments of ID. Without mentioning it by name, Carroll addresses several of ID's basic questions, such as how functions such as immune or respiratory systems \`evolve', when such systems are so inherently complex that intermediate evolutionary states would seem largely unworkable, if not fatal. His explanations are clean and coherent.Carroll stumbles when he takes short cuts to feel more accessible. For instance, we get fairly weak tie-ins to Jimi Hendrix or Eric Clapton lyrics, which feel cheesy and out of synch. Other possible weaknesses - his praise for much of Gould's thinking, or his implied scorn for ID's very existence - are overcome by the pains with which he lays out his scientific positions.This is the best kind of science writing because Carroll is willing to admit how much he does not know, just as he is determined to understand as much as is possible. We are fortunate to be party to his exploration."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful is a clear, well organized, and nicely illustrated popular account of one of the most important recent developments in biology, the discovery that all multicellular animals share the same basic developmental machinery. Because of the great diversity of animal forms, the conservation of developmental mechanisms was a considerable surprise. The author is a leading researcher in this field and a very good writer. The basic identity of developmental mechanisms provides further proof of common ancestry of animals. As the author demonstrates very nicely, exploring the ways in which the basic \\"toolkit\\" of development works in a variety of species provides huge insights into the nature of evolutionary processes. Carroll argues convincingly that the melding developmental biology and evolutionary biology (known as evo devo)carried forward by a number of laboratories, including his own, constitutes completion of the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology that began with the reconciliation of genetics and evolutionary thought in the 1930s and 1940s.Carroll covers the basic molecular biology and genetics, basic embryology, implications for development and evolution of animal forms, and the implications for macroevolution. There is a concise and thoughtful chapter on human evolution. Carroll concludes with some thoughtful comments on urgent issues like the nature of science education, the creationist-science controversy, and mass extinctions. His proposal about biology education is particularly good."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Evo Devo consists of the merged sciences of evolution and embryology. The relationship between these two branches of science isn't new, but it has expanded hugely over the last several decades. Darwin anticipated the role that embryology played (and would play) in the theory of evolution, as Carroll shows by quoting Charles Darwin in his September 10, 1860 letter to Asa Gray:\\"Embryology is to me by far the strongest single class of facts in favor of change of forms, and not one, I think, of my reviewers has alluded to this.Even though Darwin clearly understood the implications of embryology to evolution, Carroll's book is a breathtaking example of previously (perhaps) unimagined insights into evolution that embryology has brought to modern science, much of which has been discovered and expanded upon over the past 20 years.One of the most important discoveries of Evo Devo is the ancient origin of the genes used to build basic body plans. From fins to legs, fingers, and wings, nature has a tendency to use many of the same basic genes. The fact that a common set of genes is used to form such a wide variety of different body shapes and appendages was unanticipated, and shows the great antiquity of life while illuminating the literal truth of the fundamental thesis of evolution: decent from a common ancestor. The author presents detailed examples and evidence showing the different ways in which ancient - very ancient, in many cases - tool kit genes are used to shape the evolution of animal forms from Urbilateria to Homo sapiens.A not uncommon misconception is that different features in living organisms require different genes. In this flawed world view there are things like an \\"elephant trunk gene\\" and an \\"intelligence gene.\\" To understand why an elephant looks the way it does and why people are smart (supposedly) you simply need to find the genes that make them unique. Through the science of Evo Devo we've learned that body shapes are determined not simply by what genes are present, but when and how various genes are turned on and off. As the old saying goes: \\"timing is everything.\\" It's the timing of how genes are activated during development that largely results in the stark physical differences between humans and mice, even though the two species share more than half their genes. As Carroll puts it:\\"We have seen that insects, pterosaurs, birds, or bats did not invent \\"wing\\" genes (chapter 7), butterflies a \\"spot\\" gene (chapter 8), or humans a \\"bipedalism\\" gene (chapter 10). Rather, innovation in all of these groups has been a matter of modifying existing structures and of teaching old genes new tricks. The key to innovation at the genetic level is the multifunctionality of too kit genes. The multifunctionality of tool kit genes stems from their deployment at different times and places through batteries of genetic switches. In this manner a protein such as Distal-less can act at one time to promote limb formation, and at another to promote eye-spot development.\\"Historically, some biologists supposed that different genes would be used for similar solutions in different species. Carroll shows that \\"this view is entirely incorrect.\\" Much of his book is devoted to showing how a relatively small group of \\"tool kit\\" genes is used in many different species to accomplish the same general task. He uses examples from fly legs, mouse feet, and the tube feet of sea urchins. Although these structures look and act in entirely different ways, they are all governed by the distal-less gene. As it turns out, it's not just the genes that determine body shape and function but when and how the genes are tuned on/off during embryological development.The use of common genes goes beyond development of different structures. Organs that were once thought of as distinctly different, such as eyes and hearts, are now understood to have common genetic ingredients that control their formation. This, Carroll explains \\"has forced a complete change in our picture of Cambrian animals...\\" The real lesson here is the great power of combinatorial genetics, and its ability to create vastly more complexity. For example, in a simple case we might imagine four genes, each responsible for a single function. Those same four genes, if used together - in combination - can be responsible for dozens of functions. Quoting Carroll again: \\"The combinatorial power of the genetic tool kit acting on vast arrays of genetic switches has produced this complexity and diversity [of the natural world]\\"This book rates as one of the best I've read in 2006. Carroll is a fine writer and accomplished scientist, and his book offers insight into one of the great developing scientific fields of the 21st century. My copy of the book is hardbound with color prints, as well as many black-and-white figures/drawings that help bring Carroll's writing to life. For anyone fascinated by life and its origins, this is one book you'll definitely want to read."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Outstanding intro to the field of Evolutionary Development. Author convinces of the pivotal role of this integrative approach in biology. Initially a difficult read because of the emphasis on research advances not yet part of everyday vernacular. How often do you hear reference to evo-devo in the news? Might be best to read last two chapters first and then refer to back to earlier chapters for the details, as the subject has a few technical challenges for the non-scientist."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"This is a book about \\"evo-devo\\", a discipline which encompasses both embryonic and evolutionary development of animals, and how they get their physical form. This is a topic that has always interested me, and I was amazed to learn how much has become known.The first part focuses on embryonic development. The most important idea is that there is a lot of DNA in animal genomes which comprise switches, which are precisely controlled to turn on and off genes at different points in the body as it develops. These switches effectively encode the coordinates on the body where each type of feature is supposed to arise. When these coordinates get screwed up, as in mutations, you get bizarre things like flies with legs growing out of their heads.The second part is about evolution, and how one form (or species) arises from another. The most crucial notion is that evolution is a tinkerer, not an engineer, making very small adjustments. But since these adjustments are typically to switches, not genes, they can turn on or off complete features, or alter their location on the body. So, often, an evolutionary path will start with many copies of a given feature (think millipede), and then refine and specialize particular instances of the feature (think of the varied limbs of a lobster). There are numerous examples of features which start out serving one purpose, and them morph into some entirely different purpose, as in gills morphing into wings.Very well written, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"The discoveries of evolutionary development (\\"Evo Devo\\") displayed in Endless Forms Most Beautiful extend our knowledge of Mendelian genetics and DNA to offer a clear picture of how animals present in the Cambium period evolved into present-day forms with their variety of body types, colors and designs. Endless Forms Most Beautiful should be made part of any high school biology course."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"One of the most well written current evolutionary writtings I have read in awhile. Highly recommend this book to not just the public but many up and coming scientists like myself."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Sean Carroll, researcher and professor at the Howard Hughes Institute, is a genetics expert who offers a wonderful exploration of the cutting-edge science of evolutionary development (evo devo). This book, drawing from decades of genetics research as well as experiments performed in Carroll's own lab, reveals the subtle and exquisite results of millions of years of evolution as it relates to (specifically) embryology.The first hundred pages or so are a primer on evolution as it is theorized in the Modern Synthesis of evolution. We find that the evidence for evolution is not just substantial, but largely consistent with this theory and overwhelmingly evidence of its predictions.The second part of the book serve to isolate a few choice types of evidence, including fossil records and genes, and presents the findings of evolutionary development researchers as they apply to the making and diversity of animal species. Carroll focuses on numerous examples in nature of evolutionary processes, including the diversity and differences of butterfly patterns, three different wing development processes, and the coloration changes which lead to black pigmentation.Carroll wraps up the latter half of the book by challenging the notion that creationism can explain any of this, and instead, offers that the proof of evolution was undeniable decades ago, and only strengthened with more recent research. Humans share a staggering portion of our genes, including the nearly-universal tool kit genes which dictate timing and location of other genes. Human beings are shown to be part of this earth-wide process, not a seperate entity with unusual properties.At times, Endless Forms is a bit clinical, with several dozen pages running together filled with technical terms and often difficult-to-understand processes. I did have to reread sections to fully understand what was being stated. While this made it slow going at times, the result for me (and I hope for other readers) was a detailed understanding of why evo devo research can answer difficult questions about evolutionary processes which are unanswered in other disciplines.For anyone interested in the clinical side of evolutionary research, this book is an excellent intermediate-level study of evo devo. Carroll is a fascinating researcher with years of first-hand experience in the field. While the text is dry at times, the information provided is worth the time spent to understand it. Four stars."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"For a large part of the 20th century, zoologists thought every type of animal had a unique set of genes, the genes that made rabbits give birth to baby rabbits, or that made grasshopper eggs hatch grasshopper nymphs. Instead, Sean B. Carroll tells us, in his charmingly offhand style, animals turn out to share great numbers of genes. In particular, we share master genes, the ones responsible for controlling embryological development. These master genes have been highly conserved for hundreds of millions of years, have passed into both great branches of animals, and have been central to the evolution of what Darwin called, \\"endless forms most beautiful.\\""},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Whether discussing spots on butterfly wings or accidental mutations, Carroll transfers his wonder and fascination to the reader. His sheer interest and curiosity in the subject matter is contagious, and he explains exactly how a simple form taken for granted in everyday life is shared by countless species. For example, the x-rays from chapter 1 on animal architecture are absolutely breathtaking. When the obvious external appearance fades, the likeness beneath demonstrates that the limbs of a turtle resemble that of a falcon, dog, crane, cow, human, etc...Rationalizing and breaking down aesthetically stunning animals to their fundamental units does not detract from their beauty; instead, understanding the complex nature of evolutionary development made animals I previously overlooked much more interesting. Intricate designs are backed by reason and vast animal diversity is linked by commonalities. This book does not focus on humans, but rather ties our existence into the larger scheme of the history of life on earth.However, I did labor through biological technicalities and needed many fundamental concepts explained. Therefore, before reading this book, basic background knowledge in genetics is needed. The concepts behind the scientific details are very relevant to understanding natural selection, and Carroll often has to explain the microscopic function of genes to convey a broad and interesting message. This book does such a good job explaining natural selection that sexual selection is often missing and the full explanation for the evolutionary process is left incomplete. Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to those interested in the evolution of endless forms most beautiful."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"I have always been told that the best way to ruin a good book is to start at the end. In the case of Endless Forms Most Beautiful, written by Sean B. Carroll, I actually think it is a good idea to start with the last chapter, or at least the last fourteen pages. Carroll uses these pages to describe the startling amount of misunderstanding and lack of proper education regarding evolution. He cites an international survey in which the United States came in dead last in general understanding of biological evolution. If that staggering fact does not provide you with the motivation to read first 280 pages then finish the last chapter. Here Carroll describes the countless species of animals that humans have driven to extinction because of a lack of understanding of evolution and biology. He points out that we are destroying the very things that could hold the key to many of the great mysteries of human biology.This book is at times dense and overly detailed the few moments of confusion you will have while reading are worth the much deeper understanding of evolution that you will have after reading the book. Carroll covers one of the newest and most interesting aspects of the study of evolution, evo devo, or the study of the evolution of development. I do think it is important to have at least a basic understand of biological concepts but in general Carroll does a good job explaining the extremely technical concepts. He includes a lot of diagrams, which I personally did not get a lot out of but I can see how they might be very helpful. My main criticism of the book is Carroll's apparent fear of clearly outlining what we don't know. There were times I felt as though he was leaving out answers to question, when in reality nobody knows those answers. That is fine; I just wanted him to say that science hasn't come up with those answers yet. I would recommend this book to anyone with a general interest in science who is curious about what kind of discoveries are being made on the forefront of science."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful (Alyssa Johnson)I have to admit that at first sight, Endless Forms Most Beautiful by Sean B. Carroll did not look enticing. The colored pictures of butterfly eyespots and embryo were slightly terrifying. I was introduced to this book in an anthropology class about natural selection, so the intense pictures representing intense science were intimidating. In addition, reading about the development of different organisms through mutations in genetic switches was hardly my forte. Carroll's book seemed like it was going to be very technical and very hard to understand.I was, however, very mistaken. Carroll used personal stories and little jokes to lighten the mood after getting very technical. I really enjoyed how he integrated light commentary with heavy scientific evidence. He also eased into each chapter by starting off with an anecdote or story from his childhood. I felt as if I was getting to know him as a person, while learning more about the area that he studies as well. In this regard, Carroll is a very effective writer; his pieces pleasurable to read.Carroll used many pictures, which helped me to understand what he was talking about. Thus, if you are a visual person, this book will be a very good way to introduce you to evolutionary development (called \`evo devo' for short). While I read this book in an introductory class in college, I would definitely say that a basic knowledge of biology is necessary. Without knowing about genetics and evolution, I do not think I would have understood things in as much depth as I did.When I was first given Carroll's book Endless Forms Most Beautiful, I was unenthusiastic about reading it. His personable writing style and excellent explanations of evolutionary development made reading his book fun for me. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the basic principles of evolutionary development."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Very good book for the person with a general interest in science, but who is not a professional biologist. I knocked off one star because the book very badly needs a handy glossary, a handy lookup for a concise definition of the more important terms."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"This is a fascinating book, very much worth reading, but I knocked off one star for the outrageous way in which the history of biology is distorted, whether deliberately or because of the misleading if not mendacious histories of biology that disgrace the subject and confuse even specialists and authors. Looking at the index one finds no reference to the developmentalists, such as Geoffrey St. Hilaire or Von Baer. Darwin meanwhile is made over into a precursor!! It is not nice that the history is this outrageous, one must conclude that modern biology, certainly its history, is a subject without integrity. Surely the history of biology shows that the embryologists in the first half of the nineteenth century anticipated modern breakthroughs of the last generation, but that Darwin and the Darwinists clipped this early research with their incorrect and limited microevolutionary obsession with natural selection. Many critics of Darwin, including many of his first reviewers, could not accept Darwin's thesis because they were aware of the implications of embryology. Even Huxley we forget supported Darwin but demurred on his mechanism because he was aware of the discrepancies.Obviously the paradigm has to get fixed without anyone being the wiser, and Darwin has to remain the icon here, and to sell books the subject has to be fixed.Beyond that, and the book would have been better simply presenting the basics of the new developmental genetics, this is a compelling read and a good fast intro to the new world of the remarkable hox genes and their implications for biology. Since Darwin did _not_ know of all this and assumed that natural selection would do the job of hox genes, any reasonable presentation ought to point out that Darwin was wrong and that we are moving in a new direction. Further, now that we see so much developmental structure we should suspect that something more is involved in macroevolution than natural selection. We should at least demand some better proof.In any case, read skeptically this is a fascinating book, but let's hope we don't get railroaded into a new phoney synthesis here.It is worth reading Soren Lovtrup's _Darwinism: Refutation of a Myth_ to get from the old embryological underground the real history of biology in relation to developmental issues."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Quite simply the book is fascinating, comprehensive, informative, documented, validated, thorough and genuinely interesting from cover to cover, BUT everything he writes fits Intelligent Design (ID) just as easiy as evolution and probably more so. Where do these Hox genes and tool kit boxes come from? Accidents or ID? How could the first one have come about? And why so organized? In other words who put the tools in the tool kit?I don't see him discussing any accidents, but only smooth transitions --why--and indeed he uses the word design again and again. Even some of the drawings look like they were done by architects (designers). If these genetic programs were accidents or survival modes, he ought to remove the word design. To me he writes as if it looks like a duck, smells like a duck and quacks like a duck, but it's a fox. I highly recommend the book, although it does get a litte erudite in parts and perhaps confusing to some average readers, I particularly recommend it in support of ID. Four stars for superb work, less one star for missing the bottom line."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Too technical for the average reader. One gets lost part way through. It is obviously well researched, supported by other research and seemingly very thorough, but it comes across as having built an exquisite ocean liner that sinks the moment it sets sail. I agree with the other reviewer, Dr. Carroll speaks of evolution, argues strongly for it, yet uses the word design over and over again and never ever explains how this toolbox evolved. Why wouldn't the hand, the paw and the fin come from the same genetic area? That doesn't prove evolution and the book doesn't prove it, either. Had he written this was a pro-Intelligent Design book, he would have received more stars from this reader."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Sean Carroll has performed a useful public service. He synthesizes the latest evolutionary and genetic science in a form that's easy for lay readers to understand. He combines our traditional understanding of biological and paleontological sciences with modern molecular and genetics research. The combination, which he calls \\"evo-devo,\\" reveals fascinating insights into the development of species. For example, certain genes perform different functions in different animals. Evolution in cases respects results from genes and gene switchers playing new roles, rather than radical macro-level changes. I think anybody with a high school education could make it through this book and get a lot out of it - no need for a bio degree."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"This book is an engrossing look at evolutionary development, which is the study of the way genes shape the form of species and evolution. Sean Carroll takes the reader through a vast array of genetic findings, much of it made only within the past few decades, to show how certain genes act as switches to specify how body structures are formed.These genes are in what is called the Tool Kit, and are found across numerous species. They perform their actions by being turned on and off at specific times during the course of development. As Carroll says, the same sets of genes control the formation and pattern of body regions and parts with similar functions, but different designs, in insects, vertebrates, and other animals. These genes have important implications in our understanding of how evolution from early forms proceeded and go a long way toward refuting the claims of creationists concerning the evolutionary process.This book is highly recommended for anyone who is deeply interested in the evolutionary process, or who would like to counter creationism."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"This is a fantastic read; informative, yet laid-back enough to make it easy to digest. Carroll has a way of integrating just enough humor to keep you interested, without going overboard. If you're super science-savvy, you may be a bit bored in a few places where he goes over the basics of DNA structure, etc., but the fact that he starts at the bottom makes his books suitable for a much broader audience. If you want a good popular-science style read, this is your book."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful gives a fairly comprehensive introduction to the science of evolutionary biology, however, Carroll could do a far better job of clarify many of the more intricate concepts he presents. Endless Forms Most Beautiful is definitely a book worth reading, especially for those interested in understanding how evolution and development work in conjunction with one another to create a variety of different forms. However, for those who lack a strong background in biology or evolutionary science this book may be a difficult read. It fails to provide basic explanations for more of the complicated science involved in evolution and development. The images in the book are helpful to enhance the understanding of the text, but there is still much to be desired in terms of explanation.I think this book is really excellent in some parts. For example, chapters that discuss why certain organisms benefit from particular evolutionary features. Also, chapters that discuss Carroll's own research with regards to butterflies, for example, are usually more thorough than his other chapters. Carroll uses a lot of terminology which could be better explained. For example, he refers to many genes as \\"tool kit\\" genes, but does not adequately address each gene individually and their role in the evolutionary processes. Also, although Carroll devotes some time to explaining the significance of his work, he needs to do a better job explaining why his research and the study of evodevo is important for science in general or for the future of humanity.Overall, the book does a fair job of explaining a complicated concept, but it could have more specific details and a simpler and more complete explanation of some of the more advanced concepts. I recommend this book for students studying evolution or for anyone interested in the topic, but be warned that a background in evolution is necessary in order to fully appreciate the intricacies of the work."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"- fascinating book, maybe not as revolutionary as Carroll claims.I would have like more technical detail about DNA \\"switches\\", but SC is evidently aiming for a non-tech audienceThe most amazing claim he makes is that repetitive patterns are not made by one organising principle:\\"The genes expressed in stripes in the early fly embryo were some of the first to have their switches examined. One of the most surprising discoveries made in taking these genetic switches apart was that individual stripes of multistripe patterns are encoded by separate switches. For example, even though the seven stripes of some tool kit patterns appear very similar and evenly spaced, each stripe is drawn by a different switch that integrates different combinations of longitudinal inputs....mathematicians.. influenced by a 1952 paper by the genius Alan Turing .. \\"The chemical basis of morphogenesis\\" many theoreticians sought to explain how periodic patterns could be organised across entire large structures. While the math and models are beautiful, none of this theory has been borne out by the discoveries of the last twenty years..\\"I find this very hard to accept. A python with 'hundreds of thoracic vertebrae' must surely have a generator to make each (somite?) vertebra similar.It is clear that particular segments must be identified if they are to have particular legs etc, but I predict that a prior uniformly regular generator will be found.I read another fly-stripe book around 2001 which had some great stuff on how the stripes get crisp. Sadly I cant recall the title, nor find it on my shelves... anywy the beautiful immuno-flourescant pictures in EFMB are not the first.Interesting that Onychophora are now held to have all 10 hox genes that arthropods have.The rule now seems to be: duplicate some genes first, use them later.SC claims that the 'hopeful monster' idea is now dead, but some of the changes he instances are extremely saltational, eg mice have twice doubled the flies set of Hox. Each doubling must have been quite an event, even if not monstrous.I recall in NZ around 1967 finding a peripatus in a crumbly log in Manawatu. I didnt realise its significance.One symmetry breaking that SC does not discuss much is the left-right distinction. Front-back & Top bottom can be 'random' but information is required to choose right. A famous wrong choice was by Gregory Bateson - he guessed that some spiral structure on the oocyte surface would dictate polarity. It is now believed that the choice is molecular. Cilia are chiral because Amino acids are chiefly L. Cilia all turn clockwise, and churn some molecule to one side.SC does mention \\"situs inversus\\" where the liver can be on the left, etc.Recent imaging studies of the brains of situs inversus individuals reveal that the left-right asymmetries in the frontal lobe and planum temporale are also reversed. However these individuals still have left-hemisphere dominance in speech production and are generally right handed - if this is true, and I take most brain imaging cun granis salis, then a lot of handwaving about speech, humans over apes etc is challenged. Brocas region without significance?I would love to get Behe to shake (whichever) hand of a situs inversus sufferer, and offer congratulations on surviving with defective cilia, those unchangeable devils."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"This book certainly succeeds in educating the everyday man. It provides a solid ground for dispelling the notion that mutations are the heart of natural selection and devastates the creationist arguments based on it with effective, gene logic. Overall, to the non-scientific layman this can function is as a great introduction to evolutionary theory in general, especially since it focus on a field (evolutionary developmental biology or evo-devo) that explains many of the questions laypeople have on natural selection.However, anyone seeking more detailed information should look elsewhere. DNA switches, as crucial as they are, are only given superficial coverage in the book. It is never quite explained why DNA switches work when they do to generate complexity. In not explaining this, the author fails to still to answer the fundamental question of how the organism knows how to develop in such a specific way. It is strongly advised that one become moderately fluent in basic genetics before attempting to read this book.While the book features great and interesting examples of the research in evo-devo, such as butterfly stripes, it does not dwell enough on the genetic foundations. Given only a superficial walkthrough in part one (less than half the size of part two), this foundation is necessary for actually understanding how evo-devo works as opposed to just knowing about \\"cool\\" and interesting facts. The author occasionally forgets this and goes out of his way to entertain with random references and little jokes as opposed to sticking to hard explanations. One may want to have Wikipedia on hand for better understanding the genetic and cell biological principles mentioned in this book.The author asks certain laws to be accepted almost axiomatically, such as the idea in chapter one that evolution in an organism reduces and specializes the number of parts. While this may seem intuitive to a person of science, it will leave many readers wondering how or why this should be accepted. Also, the author occasionally strays off topic to answer creationist critics. While his annoyance with them is probably understandable, the last chapter deviates a little from the topics discussed earlier in the book and could have conceivably been left out.All this shouldn't cause one to take it that the book as bad. The book certainly succeeds in describing an exciting, new theory that answers many previously unexplained questions, such as the mechanism of selection and the nature of our common ancestry with other species. The book reiterates the principles till they're ingrained in ones head. One comes away from the book definitely knowing the importance toolkit genes have one using a few basic genes to generate vast arrays of organisms. It provides interesting examples, such as fruit fly mutations and arthropod commonality. However, these examples occasionally dominate the text, taking up full chapters near the end. Just as one cannot explain math purely on examples, so must the author take care to make sure evo-devo theory is as properly explained as his examples."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"I confess that I'm rating my interest more than the book itself. While the title (taken from Darwin's writings) is eloquent, the contents are dry and tedious. I'm sure people in the field of EVO DEVO get excited about this stuff, in the same way an archeologist can spend all day brushing a few centimeters of dirt off an artifact at a dig site. The basic premise that a few simple rules (the same gene toolkit) can account for the multiplicity of life forms is interesting. The story reminds me of the old biology mantra: \\"Ontogeny recapitulates Phylogeny.\\" I just got somnumbulized by the detail that seemed more suited for a textbook. It's no stroll through Jurrasic Park; more like a lecture on fruitfly anatomy."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Excellent copy and shipped fast. This is one of the books that I have been waiting to read. clean book."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"I can't say I personally had many negative things to say about this book. First of all I think this might be my favorite science author to date. For one you can feel his excitement for the material on every page. I greatly share his sense of enthusiasm for the material, something that is often lacking for many science books. Some people find or feel that science ought to be or is a dry subject, so it's always refreshing to read someone who entirely disagrees. Moreover, aside from the last chapter Sean Carroll also largely avoids mentioning creationism, which for me is a pet peeve in science books. I could write the entirity of this review about how many times I've rolled my eyes while reading a credible scientist who can't help but vent frustrations about creationist this and creationism that. Sadly evolution defines itself by it's controversies as much as it does it's accomplishments. This book spends most of it's time on the latter.The chapters are written very well, with clear introductions, informative main sections and thorough conclusions. It definitely hits you with a lot of information, much of it very technical, so it's good to have a firm grasp of evolution before picking this up. You will find yourself keeping up with a lot of jargon such as Distal-less and homeotic. I was fortunate to have read up on genetics prior to buying this book, however often I reread sections and paragraphs just to make sure I understood them. Again, be prepared.The downside of this book is it's not a book of answers, but a book that raises plenty of engaging questions. I feel the purpose of good science literature is to make you think more deeply about your surroundings. In that regard the book is a phenomenal accomplishment. I caution buyers though; if you simply want to get a basic primer that doesn't require or encourage further investigation and reading this book is not for you. If you are ready to scratch beneath the surface and want to understand more of the details this book is absolutely for you.One other point of criticism directed at the author is that in the openning chapter he tells a story about how an evolution professor (presumeably someone who doesn't study embryology) asked how you'd construct a chicken after it's embryo had been put through a blender. The implication is that despite the genetic components theoretically being intact, they will never result in a chicken. The problem is Carroll never satisfies this professor's critique. I imagine I would simply say \\"why not?\\" but that's hardly an answer. It does seem as though the science of Evo Devo is an exercise is tediously studying genes and may not answer as many questions as the author presumes it does, that said, it's clearly important when accompanied by all the other evidence we have. Unfortunately spending all your time on genes doesn't really offer any perspective on the world and environmental factors which shaped them, so you as a reader are left to surmise this for yourself.Bottom line is I highly reccommend this book, but I also reccommend you not make it your first and CERTAINLY not your last book on evolution and or genetics."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"This book provides an interesting discussion of the concept of Evo Devo or evolutionary developmental biology. This is my first exposure to this science and it provided me with a good introduction to the subject.According to Carroll, Evo Devo is like a third major act in a continuing evolutionary synthesis. He states it provides a critical missing piece of Modern Synthesis - embryology. This is integrated with the molecular genetics and the traditional elements such as paleontology.Carroll speaks of the story of evolution in three acts: I) the work of Darwin, II) Modern Synthesis which unified three disciplines and III) Evo Devo.I gathered from the text that two key components of Evo Devo are switches and the tool kit. In brief:Switches:The key to diversity in animal life results from the astronomical combination of regulatory inputs and switches. How genes express themselves is determined by these \\"switches\\" that regulate or modulate the gene's expression in an organism. One gene may be regulated by many separate switches such that the gene is used many times and in different places. An average size switch is usually several hundred base pairs of DNA long. Within this span there may be anywhere from a half dozen to twenty or more signature sequences for several different proteins produced by the expressed gene.Tool Kit:We have tool kit genes. Despite their great differences in appearance and physiology, all complex animals share a common \\"tool kit\\" or \\"master\\" genes that govern the formation and patterning of their bodies and body parts. The tool kit genes have a multifunctionality that stems from their deployment at different times and places (e.g., a different body segment) in the organism. Also, common to all living descendents since prior to the Cambrian, are Hox genes which are developmental control genes involved in establishing the front to rear axis and the identity of each body segment in organisms. The fact that these Hox genes and other tool kit genes have been preserved for hundreds of millions of years demonstrate the pressures to maintain these proteins over the course of evolutionary history. The bilaterian (animals having a bilateral symmetry) tool kit predated the Cambrian, the mammalian tool kit predated the rapid diversification of animals in the Paleogene, and the human tool kit predated the apes and other primates.I found the whole concept of Evo Devo fascinating, and I can see how this work on the embryological/ genetic level can assist us in coming to a better understanding of the origins of life. And that's what I want - to better understand how it all happened. I would recommend this book as an addition to the library of anyone who is interested in the origins of life."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"I just finished this book, and was delighted. I cannot evaluate prior reviewer's claims about the difficulty level, as I have a prior formal education in biology, but I didn't find it too taxing, and I'm definitely not a molecular person. In fact, part of why I bought this book and why I'm glad I did is that it explained several concepts and terms I had encountered from time to time (HOX, switches, etc) but hadn't had enough genetics or molecular biology to be fully informed about. I thought he did a masterful job of conveying both the necessary background and the application of it.That said, I did have one main issue, which was the way several problems of evolution (such as insect wings) were presented as definitively solved by Evo Devo, yet with even a cursory knowledge of both the problem at hand and Evo Devo, I could see how a different POV could still be argued for, specifically that insect wings arose from thermoregulatory structures on the thorax, and that toolkit genes were simply expressed in new locations for this purpose, rather than co-opting existing gills. However, this is popular writing, rather than scientific journals, so such a definitive position could be excused as necessary for clarity.Overall, an excellent introdution to the evolution of morpholigical features via developmental mechanisms."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"This book is a model of popular scientific writing: it's scientifically rigorous, clearly written, and takes us into exciting new realms.The young science of evolutionary developmental biology (evo devo) seeks to explain how single cells develop into hugely complex life forms, and to explain why millions of life forms exist on our planet. Biologists are discovering that nature isn't profligate in her creations; new organisms aren't built from scratch, but by reusing and modifying existing genetic material. A small number of tool kit genes, which include HOX genes, turn out to be the basic building blocks for millions of organisms, from birds and bees to thee and me. These tool kit genes are modular, redundant and multi-functional, and nature appears very reluctant to mess with them - several basic tool kit and HOX genes have survived for over 500 million years.The key to life's diversity appears to be the ways in which these building block genes are regulated and activated. This is the role of genetic switches, which can combine to influence gene functionality in innumerable ways. To take one example, the same tool kit genes, activated differently, can create a human arm, a bird wing or a centipede leg. Understanding these genetic mechanisms allows molecular biologists and embryologists to see similarities that were previously masked by the wild diversity of life forms. For instance, despite the fact that rodent and primate lines separated some 75 million years ago, mice and humans share a 99% correlation of genes, with 96% of those being arranged in an equivalent chromosomal order. This similarity is a powerful argument that nature's game plan is to preserve basic genetic structures and to make changes only at the margin by tinkering with the switching mechanisms of tool kit genes rather than their underlying functionality.Evo devo gives a powerful boost to our understanding of how evolution actually works. The evidence seems to indicate that changes in species don't occur in the genes themselves but by mutations in genetic switches caused by environmental pressures. (Chapter 8, How the Butterfly Got Its Spots, is an excellent illustration of this process.) Gene switch mutations that help an organism flourish in its ecological niche will persist; other mutations will die out. And the same basic building block genes can be adapted by different species for different purposes. Biologists hypothesize that gills in our common aquatic ancestor were modified on land into lungs, tracheae, spinnerets and wings. Evo Devo fills in blanks in evolutionary theory by showing exactly how small changes in the switches of tool kit and regulatory genes can lead to large scale changes in life forms over long periods of time.Carroll's prose approaches the E.O. Wilson level of elegant simplicty, which is high praise for scientific writing. While he's clearly enthusiastic about his subject, he doesn't oversell it. He's careful to delineate fact from theory, and stays humble about how much more there is to know. Several illustrations and color plates help to bring alive the genetic concepts Carroll discusses and they forge a visceral correlation between evo devo theory and the realm of our senses. This book will literally help you to see with new eyes both your self and the millions of non-human relatives with whom you share this grand adventure called life."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"It is a very well written book, on an immensely interesting topic in current biology. Written to the mythical average intelligent layperson without biological science studies. It doesn't require even bio101 to understand and it does get into topics which could be difficult if presented badly. The author is to be commended for not just his depth of biological studies but even more for his ability to popularize and write good science at a level that people can understand. I expect to see much more from this author over the years, this book is making the rounds of the discussion boards and i have yet to see a reviewer bad mouth the book.Start with one of two chapters, 5:The Dark matter of the Genome if you want to see an excellent discussion of hox genes or 6:The Big Bang of Animal Evolution if you'd rather see the effect of hox genes on the development of different creatures. Either one ought to tell you enough about how you will react to the book in order to decide to read it all. It is not so difficult that you have to own a copy and mark it up, library usage is possible with this book, an unusual thing for even popular science.The main point of the book is that evo devo=evolutionary development is adding so much information and substantiating so much theory that evolutionary biology ought to consider a new paradigm, the modern synthesis + evo devo(and embryology), as the new core of the biological sciences. Like the commonality of the genetic code mapping DNA codons to tRNA, hox genes have unified biology like nothing else since the incorporation of genetics into darwinianism in the 1930's(forming the modern synthesis). Not only their extraordinary widespreadness from round worms to fruit flies to human beings, something that was not predicted even 30 years ago, but the pervasiveness of mutations in those critical genes, their switches and other regulatory sequences and how it so greatly effects body plans.Get together a few pullquotes and summary aphorisms from the book:Preface: Revolution #3\\"the key to any scientific advance is to be able \\"to explain the complex visible by some simple invisible\\"\\"\\"development is intimately connected to evolution because it is through changes in embryos that changes in form arise.\\"Introduction: Butterflies, Zebras, and Embryos\\"The great variety in the size, shape, organizatin, and color of animal bodies raises deep questions about the origins of animal forms.

It is one of those books i wish i could make required reading...grin."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"This book is exactly what I was looking for. Although I've got astrong background in science (physics, computers, electronics), mybackground in biology is terribly weak. I've recently \\"caught thebug\\" and become fascinated with the developments being made in theunderstanding of the \\"molecular mechanics\\" of life and evolution.When I heard (somewhere on this site, I believe) about the idea of EvoDevo, it made such perfect sense ! But where to begin? Well, thebest I was able to do was \\"From DNA to Diversity\\" by Carroll and 2others. A great book, but a real stretch for someone with my limitedbackground. I wlaked away with a hunch that something profoundlyimportant was being presented, but I couldn't quite clarify what itwas. Anyway, I stumbled upon this treasure and it was just what I waslooking for.Carroll does a great job of explaining -- in reasonable detail andwithout overloading the reader with new terminology -- how a singlefertilized egg gradually establishes its own geometrical coordinatesystem. In doing so he refers to North/South and East/West axes,rather than tossing around conventional (but unneccesary) terms likeRostrocaudal and Dorsoventral. He shows examples of how theregulatory inputs to a gene can combine to select whether that gene isexpressed. So for those of us in the \\"dry\\" sciences, it looks veryliterally like electronics or computer programming. The sequencedstructure of a gene can quite literally be interpreted as : IF(lattitude = 30 AND longitude = 40) THEN (make_leg_here = TRUE).(NOTE: Carroll does not use this terminology). So an obvious testwould be to edit the code to change lattitude from 30 to, say, 15, andsee what happens. Well, that's exactly what evolution has beendoing....Anyway, this book suceeds perfectly in taking a field of immensecurrent importance and making it accessible enough to folks outside of the\\"wet\\" sciences to be genuinely amazed and excited. I can hardly waitto learn more."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"_Endless Forms Most Beautiful, The New Science of Evo Devo, and the making of the Animal Kingdom_, Sean B. Carroll\\"The evolution of form occurs through changes in development\\", i.e., new animals and the new body structures they possess arise from changes in the process that transforms an egg into a fully formed adult, the study of which is a combination of Evolution and Developmental Biology, or \\"Evo Devo\\".The author is a researcher in this field, and this book is intended to bridge the gap for the general reader between Darwin-style hand waving about 'variation leading to new species' and intro-to-biology pictures of egg meeting sperm. If we can understand the how of the process whereby nucleotides on a DNA strand map onto large-scale body structures, this will shed much light on the why question of the plethora of complex creatures we see about us in the world.Geared towards the 'naturalist' reader, as well as technical/engineering types, the book succeeds quite well in helping to fill this educational gap, in a simplified manner, first by reviewing how genes in a DNA strand are transcribed and translated into proteins, and then by use of the author's own research into how housefly larvae are partitioned by these genes in a X,Y,Z three-dimensional manner in the process of placing large structures like legs or wings on the body. Gene 'toolkits' and the all important gene switches are explained in a manner sure to interest any computer programming enthusiast. Many diagrams and color photographs help illustrate these concepts.Following this groundwork, Carroll moves to the implications of this research for Evolution, and how it gives yet another demonstration of the interconnectedness of all living things by showing how primitive pre-Cambrian \\"lobopods\\" morphed into later structures such as legs, gills, and wings using essentially the same gene toolkit but with changed switches. Other examples given are butterfly wings and zebra stripes.The concluding chapter calls for Evo Devo to be incorporated into school curriculums, saying that it can combat Creationist arguments such as Michael Behe's \\"Darwin's Black Box\\", which had said evolutionists could not account for the development of new animal designs, countering that in fact Evo Devo fills in the gap between basic genetics and evolutionary hand-waving perfectly. Once you answer the 'how', Behe's 'why' question dissipates into a smokescreen. I can't say this book kept me glued to the pages, but it definitely succeeded in it's goal of shedding some light on the mystery of how animals develop, both from an embryo and their ancestors. Highly recommended.rms"},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"The main title of the book comes from the final paragraph of Darwin's \\"Origins of Species\\". This is quite appropriate as this book is a great add-on to original classic of biology. The book begins with a history of evolutionary thought, and shows how the spread of genetics has helped to support, or refute, evolutionary thought. The book then introduces the reader to evo - devo; or evolutionary development. In essence, the development of an embryo can be used to track the evolution of that particular species. The author expounds on this by first explaining the science of genetics, how genes are used to generate proteins, how specific genes are expressed or not expressed in an organism, how the embryo develops, and how the artificial (by man) manipulation of genes affects the development of an embryo into a different organism. The author then focuses on specific examples to illustrate evo devo in progress. These include wings, spots, black skin due to melanin, and the hominid skull. The author concludes the book by showing how evo devo can be used in the debate of creationism versus evolution.Overall, a great book. There are multiple images and color figures that helps to explain the concepts explained in the text. I only give it four out of five stars as there is no commentary on how applicable is evo devo to plants, protists, fungi and other types of organisms. For evo devo to be an accurate tool to explain how evolution occur, it must apply to all organisms, and not just animals."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"According to the author, biology has gone through three major revolutions.The first was the 1859 publication of Darwin's \\"The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection,\\" which revolutionized how we view the diversity of life on earth. Darwin showed that this diversity is the result of the slow accumulation of mutations over geologic time, rather than a biblical \\"special creation\\" in historic times.The second revolution was the 1918 emergence of the Modern Synthesis, explaining the genetic basis for heritability and mutation. It finally laid to rest the long-standing debate over Lamarckian \\"inheritance of acquired characteristics,\\" since acquired traits can't affect the genes. Gregor Mendel had published \\"laws in inheritance\\" as early as 1866, but the mechanism for these laws had to wait for the discovery of the gene in 1900.The third revolution, and the subject of this excellent book, is the appearance over the past 20 years of Evolutionary Developmental Biology, dubbed by the author \\"Evo Devo\\" for short. This is the study of how embryos develop into their adult forms, through the expression (turning off and on) of various standard genes ('the genetic toolkit') during development. It turns out that all living things share a surprising percentage of basic genes -- 98.8% shared between man and chimpanzies, but also 96% between mice and men! The basic 'toolkit' genes for eye-building not only build our camera-like eyes, but a fly's compound eyes as well. How could such major anatomical differences arise from shared genes?The answer is the author's subject here, and it's a breakthrough in modern understanding. Through examples and principles, in layman's terms Carroll explains the recent discoveries in Evo Devo and how these strengthen and support Darwinism. Other modifications of Darwinism, such as Gould-Eldredge's Punctuated Equilibria, are also explained and fitted into the new understanding. The mechanisms behind the Cambrian Explosion in diversity of form are finally explained, as are the subsequent whittling to just a few of the most-successful bodystyles.In fact this Evolutionary Developmental Biology stuff fills a big gap in Darwin's original thesis, which explained how unfit individuals and species were weeded out but could not explain where new forms came from. The new understanding of gene expression, and 'switch gene' mutations, goes a long way toward making sense of the whole picture of the evolution of life.Fascinating, eye-opening and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Is a zebra white with black stripes or black with white stripes?The answer according Sean Carroll is that its the stripes that come first! This an example of the wit and insight to be gained from this book which explains the new science of evo devo to the nonspecialist.Evo devo combines the new insights which molecular biology has provided on how living things develop with evolutionary theory to give a new view of evolution. According to Sean Carroll evolution operates predominately by using a fixed repertoire of genes that are common to many living things and rearranging them in new patterns of regulation. He explains that the the very different hearts, eyes, limbs and body segments of such diverse bilaterally symmetrical animals as insects and mammals are built with the same very ancient genes.I learned a tremendous amount from this book but I have one small reservation. The author stresses repeatedly that the discovery of shared ancient genes was a total surprise. Actually, as you can read in Stephen Jay Gould's books, the idea of homologies between very different animals has a long history, for example, in the writings of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, and had gone in an dout of fashion periodically."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful gives a good enthusiastic overview of the recent advances in evolution theory incorporated in the term \\"Evo Devo\\".

The author, apparently not wanting to burden readers with low-level details, omits precisely those low-level details which are essential to understanding and following the actual workings of Evo Devo. For instance, the book discusses switches, a major component of Evo Devo, but omits any exposition of how they really work within DNA.

The \\"monsters\\" of one era became the new kings in the next.In nature there is a certain dominance by numbers: for a quarter of a million of years Neanderthals by being bigger and mostly smarter dominated the hominid evolutionary tree over the smaller more delicate modern human type, but an ice age brought that to an end.The \\"evo devo\\" ideas are that sometimes forms that are outside the normal genetic range are nature's new inventions for the strange new future."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"This is an interesting take on evo-devo.

It was very easy to understand, and an enjoyable read.It was a tad repetitive, with the author listing a couple of very detailed examples for every point he made. To be honest I appreciate this, but I did skip over some material after I had gotten the point of the chapter.I love popular science, particularly books about prehistory and evolution, but I avoid those books that are all about God vs. Evolution.

First, with Darwin, we had brilliant ideas including natural selection and descent with modification. This was incomplete however, as Darwin was wholly ignorant of genetics, and went without the support of the experimental biologists. Second, with the Modern Synthesis, mechanisms of genetics and evolution were reconciled enough so that most experimental biologists discarded ideas such as saltation and soft inheritance.Molecular biology and embryology still had more to offer to evolutionary biology, Carroll argues. In the last 20-25 years, these two fields have begun to explain evolution of animal development. How is the fruit fly genome structured to organize when various genes are turned on or off at the right time and place in the developing organism? How is the overall bilateral animal body-plan preserved, while variation in the details is maximized?

Carroll chose the title for his book, ENDLESS FORMS MOST BEAUTIFUL, from the most widely quoted passage in all of biology as found in Charles Darwin's THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. Some years ago I read in a science magazine that the same genes responsible for the formation of the eye fruit fly, and even of the eyespot in planarian, was also responsible for eye formation in humans. I appreciate that this book presents the research behind this discovery so clearly and readably. So all of the genetic material necessary for the formation of complex, advanced life forms were in existence long before those forms actually evolved. \\"Insects, pterosaurs, birds, or bats did not invent 'wing' genes, butterflies a spot, or humans a 'bipedalism' or 'speech' gene. Rather, innovation in all of the groups has been a matter of modifying existing structures and of teaching old genes new tricks\\" (p.288). Gill branches in arthropod ancestors are modified into book gills, book lungs, tubular trachea, spinnerets, and wings. These modifications are no doubt still enormously complex, but it is much less so than inventing all of these structures from scratch. \\"The key to the making of 'endless' forms (i. e. diversity) is in the astronomical number of possible combination of regulatory inputs and switches\\" (p.287). The fact that such different structures and functions were all shaped by similar sets of tool kits was \\"entirely unanticipated.\\" However, in retrospect, as is often true when startling discoveries are made, one is (or I am, at least left with the feeling, \\"Of course this is how evolution must have happened.\\" As Dr. Carroll points out, it is profound evidence for the essential idea in Darwin's theory that all forms of life descended (or ascended? from one common ancestor. So, with the wisdom of hindsight, it is easy to see that the \\"tool kit gene\\" mechanism was an essential feature of evolutionary theory.On the other hand, there are two key problems still left unexplained by \\"evo devo.\\" Namely, how life originated in the first place, and how genetic material made the great leap from merely replicating to being able to encode the extraordinarily complex information necessary for the functions of life. Material-reductionist science necessarily assumes that both of these -- although they are actually both the same thing -- occurred by pure chance. Typically, scientists who expound on evolution ignore the astronomical improbability of life occurring by chance so thoroughly that one would suppose it is a non-problem. The material-reductionist assumption is merely metaphysical, and is therefore no more scientific than the assumption that life is an intrinsic quality of existence. Typically, when I write this I get lots of indignant responses accusing me of being simply too stupid to understand straightforward scientific facts, and that I am giving support to the anti-scientific minions who are ruining American education with the superstitious nonsense of Intelligent Design. Most scientists complain that the public understanding of evolution is abominable. I am a scientist, by the way, and agree). Dr. Carroll seems to think that the only way out of this is through education, and has some confidence the evo devo can present evolution in a way that will convince people of its truth. It is hard to believe that he can actually believe that. Honest ignorance can be educated; dishonest ignorance is impregnable. The main supporters of ID have degrees in biology. And then, some scientists believe that people who do not, at least, acknowledge that the assumption that life is an innate potential is just as scientific as the assumption that it is an accidental potential are being dishonest. It is very important, if we are to understand ourselves in a way that gives life meaning, that we understand what we are. We are beings that descended (or ascended) from less complex levels of consciousness; but we need not take it for granted that we are no more than organic robots -- \\"gene machines.\\"Dr. Carroll quotes the theologian John Haught when he says, \\"our theology requires fresh expression in evolutionary terms. When we think about God in the post-Darwinian period . . . Today we need to recast all of theology in evolutionary terms.\\" But there is just as great a need, if scientists want to be taken seriously, to recast evolution in theological terms. The overwhelming majority of Darwinians-- if not simply all of them -- are convinced that humanity evolved by mere happenstance; a self-reflective level of consciousness evolved for no reason other than because of its superior ability to survive and reproduce. I doubt that any theologian, even those theologians who accept the reality of evolution, believe this. Theologians, in short, believe that Darwin's theory is fundamentally flawed. Natural selection defines the process of evolution, but life is its driving force, and its inherent nature is the achievement of consciousness capable of self-reflection; . I would be surprised if Dr. Haught did not agree with me here, though I suspect we would probably disagree on the nature of \\"God.\\""},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"The best feature of this book is the fantastic sense of the complexity of the development of the organism from the genes. Sean shows with genius how the tiniest changes in a gene can lead to huge effects in the developing organism -- much like in Chaos theory (see the book \\"Chaos: making a new science\\" for example)in mathematics where complex systems are affected by the tiniest influences (i.e., a puff of air from a butterfly's wings) which can be magnified to change the entire face of a complex multi-determined system from what it would have been (i.e. weather patterns) over time. This book shows how and why all life is related, yet very different. For example, we share about 50% of our genes with a banana plant, and about 99% of our genes with Chimpanzees, yet we are very different physically and intellectually. This applies ESPECIALLY with that most unique of human characteristics -- our large and staggeringly complex brains.

But with this book, we have the wonder of over 150 years since evolution was posited and Darwin is still teaching us new and wonderful things in the guise of evolutionary development.In this book the new science of evolutionary development biology is explained as one of the core understandings of how natural selection actually works.The key to this book is the genes that act as suppressor genes turn on or repress phenotypic variations in species or -- very importantly between species. Carroll describes how this new concentration of knowledge in biology has revealed the importance of tool box genes that allow variation to develop. Most importantly he proves that the actual amount/kind of these genes is very limited and that actual genes in one species are carried to other species and either expressed or not according to these \\"tool box\\" or Hox genes.One wonderful carrolary idea is the parsimony of nature: nature does not have to develop one building block base pair at a time for changes to occur within a species. The \\"tool box\\" genes have been transferred between species and allow different expressions in different species, so it is not nessary to build up genotypic changes over time, base pair by base pair, species by species. The \\"tool box\\" genes allow function to be conveniently transferred to each developed speciers.The implications are great. It means that evolution can unfold actually much, much faster than previously thought -- with species capable of development in very short time cycles. This principle of parsimony, which Darwin, with a prescience that is frankly freakishly outstanding, has been only verified within the past few years.I only gave the book three stars because I think that at times it dragged a little and was redundant. Also while butterflys are most interesting and we do know a lot about them, I thought that there could be whole lot of other species variations that would be much more interesting... (perhaps another future book?).Also, I think that he could had gone more into the implications of his theory more. For example this is further proof that crackpots such as Michael Bene are right out of it when they assume that every species has to evolve, base pair by base pair in order to achieve variation. I think that Carroll could have put him more in his place -- either that or just do not sully his wonderful prose buy even giving time to the views of Bene.Anyway the latter comments may not really be fair -- but I include them because that is the way I thought whilst reading the book. In sum this is a very interesting book on a very unique but certainly in another 5-10 years, rather commonplace subject."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"This book is a clear and concise review of the science of embryonic and evolutionary biology-ie- new science devoted to genetic and evolutionary development.

Carroll(Reviewed by Robert Leamnson [rleamnson@umassd.edu])It seems a shame to criticize a book written with such verve and intensity. I was into chapter five and enjoying the exposition of how a \\"relatively\\" small number of genes, if operating in a huge array of combinations, and the combinations coming in a variety of sequences, one could indeed produce forms endlessly. Something, however, seemed missing. The author's preoccupation with DNA could lead one to an impossible conclusion. Everyone knows that the DNA sequences in daughter cells are, for all practical purposes, identical to the progenitor. So it follows that all the nucleate cells in a given organism have identical DNA, including genes, Hox boxes, enhancers, repressors and the lot. How can invariant DNA produce variation? An average reader will be asking, \\"who, or what, is pulling the strings and flipping the switches?\\"That question is addressed, all too briefly, on p 116. \\"Ultimately the beginning spatial information [an expression that I can't decipher] in the embryo often (?) traces back to asymmetrically distributed molecules (kind not specified) deposited in the egg during its production in the ovary that initiate the two main axes of the embryo....\\"Indeed. DNA is a passive molecule; It doesn't act but is acted upon. I'm surprised that so little is said about cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic, and interstitial proteins, and how concentrations of these elements can vary from cell to cell and with time. There is enough here, along with golgi and exported proteins, and cell membrane receptor/signaling proteins to fill a small chapter. What is missing, in short, is the overall environment in which the placid DNA floats, and a clear statement that it's the DNA's protein environment that's calling the shots. How that environment changes from cell to cell and minute to minute is the big story in developmental biology."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"This book has some good stuff, and is definitely worth reading for the individual who already has some background in evolution and DNA, but it is also something of a disappointment. The problem is Carroll's approach, not his writing skills. He writes as if such subjects as: homologous genes and organs; the use of DNA to construct family trees for plants and animals; the importance of regulatory genes are all unique to \\"Evo Devo\\", which they are not. Instead of touting the new science, it would have been better to more sharply delineate what the contributions of evo devo are: as best I can tell the contributions are a better understanding of embryology and a focus on developmental processes in the construction of family trees and the study of specie differentiation. It is not only the genes we share, but where/when they are expressed that casts light on evolution.Caroll makes difficult subjects clear by using abstract representations of what is going on. This is great, but he could have done this and also better evoke the richness of the subject matter. I found his extended examples, butterflies and zebras, kind of dull. Also, he does not have much to say about the time phasing of development as genes turn off and on, chemical gradients, or the environment, other than to mention a case where the outside temperature impacts the coloring expressed on a butterfly's wings. In Caroll's narrative, the egg begins with a chemical gradient, inherited from the parent, and all the rest is in the DNA. This is totally misleading when talking about vertebrate embryos, particularly in the development of the nervous systems (cf. \\"Synaptic Self: How Our Brains Became Who We Are\\" by Joseph LeDoux).On the other hand, there are many wonderful findings and insights in this book. Many radically different organs have been developed \\"independently\\" for sight, yet remarkably the development of all these organs is regulated by the same \\"toolkit\\" of homologous genes. Ditto for the organs used for flight. The fact that we use the same basic genetic \\"toolbox\\" to govern development as the fruit fly certainly strengthens the case for evolution. Caroll makes a persuasive argument as to why much of evolution is driven by the development of additional regulatory areas for toolkit genes, which permits incremental, localized change without major disruption, but I don't see that he has totally refuted the idea of the \\"hopeful monster\\", wherein a very disruptive change just happens to work out.Finally, the discussion of the FOXP2 gene, so prominent in many discussions of speech and the great leap forward in human culture, is brilliant, and brings together some of the ideas learned earlier in the book."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Still among the most impressive accounts on the current state of affairs in contemporary evolutionary biology, \\"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo\\" is an especially lucid, well-written account on the relatively new science of evolutionary developmental biology - or \\"evo devo\\" for short - from one of its most notable researchers, geneticist Sean B. Carroll. Writing in a clear, often concise, prose that cites the likes of Eric Clapton and Henry David Thoreau, among others, in making his points, Carroll's book reads more like a grand adventurous trek through the science itself, not some mere textbook aimed for popular audiences. In Part I \\"The Making of Animals\\" Carroll gives his readers a most extensive, though concise, introduction to the fundamentals of developmental biology, citing mathematics, biochemistry, genetics as well as comparative anatomy in order to explain what are the basic building blocks for \\"assembling\\" animals and other forms of life on Earth, stressing the importance of Hox genes as those responsible for affecting the developmental biology of animals. In Part II \\"Fossils, Genes and the Making of Animal Diversity\\", Carroll takes his readers on a grand tour of the history of life on our planet, explaining the potential importance of hox genes and other aspects of evolutionary developmental biology in accounting for the relatively rapid diversification of metazoans (multicellular animals) during the \\"Cambrian Explosion\\" (Chapter 6) and in the origins of insect wings, tetrapod limbs, bat wings and bird wings (Chapter 7), the development of spots in butterflies (Chapter 8) and of coloration in animals (Chapter 8). Readers may be drawn especially to his discussion on the evo-devo explanation for the emergence of human intelligence and of humanity's close kinship with the Great Apes (Chapter 9). I know of no other book that does such a superb job in explaining the science of evolutionary developmental biology to a general audience; this is indeed a book that belongs on the bookshelves of anyone who is interested in modern biology."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"This is staggeringly rivetting science and lovely science writing. I have been looking for a work on embryology and evolution to clarify some questions about how to design evolutionary algorithms and this was it. At the same time, it opens up a breathtaking vista of how evolution actually happens and how it is constrained. This is one of the few cases where I can honestly say that I feel I understand a whole new set of principles and perspectives after reading that I did not before. It's also an engaging and thoroughly enjoyable read. Carroll is a professional in this most demanding field while at the same time being a great popular science writer. I can only hope he does not holster his pen after doing this.The central realisation is shockingly simple, even if the scientific work to acquire it was bogglingly demanding: Animal body plans do not do anything new, and haven't done since the pre-Cambrian. That's a brutal oversimplification which I will have to embellish a little: All animal body plans are developed in an embryology regulated by the same, dozen or so, highly-conserved genes which are common to all extant animals and remarkably well conserved. That is the unmistakeable signature of something that is so important that it kills you if it varies, evolutionarily-speaking. Variations in the homeobox genes mean you leave no surviving offspring, and probably never even have a surviving self. So how can body forms vary at all? By turning on and off switches. It's a concept that was almost made to be ripped off and used in software.Very early on in embryology, a set of dimensions asserts itself - a \\"geography\\". There is an East-West ordinate (anterior to posterior); there is a North-South ordinate (dorsal to ventral); there is an in-out ordinate (proximal to distal). These begin to be defined at the very first cell division based on arbitrary distribution of signalling molecules, and once established they are inscribed on the molecule by diffusion gradients. Each regulatory protein describes a gradient across the embryo or its local part of the embryo, and each engages switches that turn other genes on and off. Thus do the cells know whether they are at the head end or the anus end, the back or the belly, the shoulder or the fingers.The clever bit is that the switches can be multiple, of arbitrary complexity, and work in cascades without having to change the crucial regulatory third-rail genes. Touch 'em and you die. Touch their switches, on the other hand, and you have a set of coordinates precise enough to divide the zones of gene expression up hundreds-fold. The Hox genes, tellingly, are arranged on the genome in the same order as they are expressed along the body. And therein lies the second huge and simple realisation - virtually all animal forms you will have seen, from yourself, O Vertebrate, to worms and butterflies, are built out of a series of segments arranged from anterior to posterior. This is a simple and forceful truth of evolution: The same segmented body plan is seen in most of what you see in animals. Evolution proceeds from the duplication of general-purpose segments to their increasing divergence and specialisation.I have conveyed sufficient of the content, as this is meant to be a review and not a pr&eacute;cis. Carroll has had his 15 minutes of fame, as he describes in the book, according to the capricious mandate of the media agenda of the day. It's time for a further 15 hours, properly planned, for this is magnificent science writing and contains an understanding so profound that it is no exaggeration to say it deserves to be required reading for courses in biology for non-professionals. Perhaps even for professionals, but that's a question for them. At any rate, if you want to discuss evolution you need to have read the material in this endlessly beautiful book."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"This book explains how evolution drives differentiation basically through modular design: by duplicating some sections of DNA, differentiating some of them to achieve specialization and then selecting the best suited. This is how from the same gene, different limbs are developed (wings, feet, antenae, tweezers, etc.), depending on where in the body grid the cells are located. First several pairs of the same limbs were formed, some mutation might occur to some of the pairs so that they could be used for some different purpose like flying; selection did the rest. It is usually not an entire gene that mutates, since the basic functions that the gene performs could be damaged and therefore the whole organism could be endangered. It is more that gene receptors are mutated so that they switch genes on and off at different timings and in different locations in the body in response to different gradients of a specific substance, to generate diversity.The discoveries made from the 1980's onwards in these science fields are truly groundbreaking and really interesting. Truly new for me was the modularity concept, as well as the role that the relative position of a cell to the body's axis plays when determining the development of form. Also interesting is the merging of genetics with embriology and the study of hox-genes (genes that drive development).The only drawback I found in the book is that it sometimes does not fully explain the mechanisms at play. If you are a complete layman to the subject, I suggest readingYour Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body (Vintage)first, since it explains some basics in more detail. Then you can fully enjoy this book. For a deep and not too difficult understanding of the molecular mechanisms readLife Itself: Exploring the Realm of the Living Celland for a good overall explanation readNature Via Nurture : Genes, Experience, and What Makes Us Human.In Search of Memory: The Emergence of a New Science of Mindalso makes a good job explaining how gene receptors work.An interesting and probably complementary alternative view to how form is driven is morphogenesis (How the Leopard Changed Its Spots : The Evolution of Complexity)."},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"This book is so good that I lack adequate words to describe it. It is one of three great books on the modern developments in evolution. A second one is Jerry A. Coyne'sWhy Evolution Is True. See my review of that book for further information -- and for comments about a third great book (not yet written!)One great failing of evolutionary theory until recent years is the lack of an objective experimental basis for its sweeping assertions. \\"Evo-Devo\\" is a marvelous and promising contribution to such a basis. Evo Devo stands for \\"Evolutionary Development\\", and concerns the machinery that controls gene expression, the development pathways from the original fertilized cell to the final adult form.This book has lifted my general feeling of gloom over that failing. Finally, with evolutionary development as brilliantly explained here, is something that makes sense, something that is testable, able to be confirmed or refuted by objective facts. Karl Popper's remark (seeThe Logic of Scientific Discovery (Routledge Classics)) that evolution is a non-falsifiable theory, can finally be faced (in fairness it should be said that Popper retreated somewhat from this statement with the remark, \\"really severe tests of the theory of natural selection are hard to come by, much more so than tests of otherwise comparable theories in physics or chemistry.\\").Dr. Carroll explains (pg. 150) how Evo Devo sees evolution from a different perspective: \\"The simplest and, for a long time, the most commonly held idea relating genes to the evolution of complex form is that new genes must evolve in order for new kinds of body designs and structures to arise.... But as we will soon see, despite its appeal, the invention of 'new genes' is not the explanation for the origin or diversity of most animal groups.\\" This earlier misconception led to great puzzlements -- so-called convergent evolution, for example. How could widely separated species come up with essentially the same solution? -- such as the similar eyes of humans and octopi? Evo Devo provides a surprising answer: these widely divergent species share (essentially) the same package of development (hox) genes for eye formation, and this package has been in place since the very first fossils appeared.These hox genes are (relatively) stable over vast eons of evolutionary time: \\"The surprising message from Evo Devo is that all of the genes for building large, complex animal bodies long predated the appearance of those bodies in the Cambrian Explosion. ... While the genetic tool kit was not evolving, the rapid appearance and changes in body forms tells us that animal development was evolving a great deal\\" (pg. 139). Formerly, new species meant new genes. Now, new species mean new expressions of existing gene packages. Of course, because of random variations there will be minor changes in the actual genes, but a [the?] main engine of change is found in gene expression rather than in new packages of genes.I am not sure that this explanation will make the question of how we got here any easier to answer -- it just pushes the issue back further into the mists of time -- but it certainly does make it possible to make some sense of how many changes may have occurred within the time span of the visible fossils.The whole issue of relatedness has been around since the beginnings of biology. Everyone, even the most literal creationist, believes that species vary. Everyone believes that species can adapt to changing environments. \\"Fixity of species\\" never meant that no change is possible. The question has always been: what is the range of variation that is possible, and how does it come about? Evo Devo opens up the possibility for large and sudden changes, resulting (merely) from subtle changes in how the hox genes control the switches that activate or suppress gene expression.I don't pretend that all the puzzlements of evolution are solved with the insights of Evo Devo, but it surely is a large step toward clarification of some of the main issues.It seems to me that Evo Devo is the key to one particular observation of early geologists. J. William Dawson,Some Salient Points In The Science Of The Earth(1893) expressed this as the \\"law of specialization\\": generalized forms are succeeded by those more special (see his chapter on \\"Succession of Animal Forms\\"). Dawson makes particular reference to the elaborately complex trilobites. James D. Dana (a Creationist) inManual of geology: Treating of the principles of the science : with special reference to American geological history(1894, 4th Edition) says something similar: (pg 714ff) in his \\"Principles of Biological Change and Progress for Animals\\": From the simple, regular, or primitive in structure to the specialized.a. From a structure with two or more functions to organs, each with its specialized function.b. From a single-function organ that has several uses, to special forms for each kind of use.c. From simpler forms of specialization to more complex, better adapted forms.d. From a specialized form to others with newly acquired uses.e. From a head with large sense-organs and mouth-organs to one with smaller and well-compacted organs.I suspect this can all be described in terms of Evo Devo.In summary, this is a marvelous book, that has connected in my mind many disparate threads in the development of animal life.HMS Challenger"},{"Title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science Of Evo Devo And The Making Of The Animal Kingdom","review":"Carroll contends the greatest spectacle of life is the development of a single cell into a complete organism. From that one cell come trillions, grouped into special functions and producing everything from wings to webbed feet. How can such variation derive from a single fertilised egg? More importantly, in Carroll's view, how can creatures with a similar number of working genes, such as mice and humans, be so different? This highly readable overview of how embryos develop into adult bodies explores the mechanics of the process in exquisite and illuminating detail.The amount of media attention given DNA has often led us to assume direct links can be made between \\"a gene\\" and parts of the organism. Carroll sets straight this misleading image. Everything that goes into building a body, from butterfly wings to a zebra's stripes, relies on a sequence of events. The sequence begins with what he dubs the \\"Tool Kit\\" of development. Basic to all animal life are the HOX genes which control which parts are front/back, top/bottom and inside/outside. Other tools build limbs, regulate processes, arrange for hair, scales or feathers as required. Once the basic organisation is made, the development process uses a string of \\"switches\\" to fine-tune the body's appearance and operations. The switches are the key to many aspects of the body. Failure to work, turning something \\"on\\" or \\"off\\" at the wrong time, sending erroneous signals - may result in mutation or loss of the organism. It is a process that has been under way for millions of years, adding or removing features under environmental pressures.The author selects a small variety of examples to illustrate how the mechanism works. A favoured subject is butterflies, which come in a rich array of wing shape and decoration. Some even change with shifts in climate as the wrong colouration renders them vulnerable to predators. Another example is zebras, which were scorned by President Theodore Roosevelt who found the idea of \\"protective colouration\\" sadly lacking. Roosevelt, of course, hunted during the day while the natural predators of zebras seek them at dawn or dusk, when they are nearly invisible. How did zebras achieve their camouflage? Millions of years of switches guiding hair patterns. Even the tall, lanky giraffe, Carroll notes, can blend in with the background with subtle ease.The study of organic forms, \\"morphology\\", focusses on \\"snapshots\\" of current or past observation of evidence. An offshoot of morphology, known as \\"cladistics\\" is more flexible, but still relies on fixed images. Carroll demonstrates that this approach must be replaced by a more dynamic one. His focus on embryos as the starting point has led him to grant the name Evolutionary Development, or \\"EvoDevo\\" to what is an exciting new science. \\"EvoDevo\\" in Carroll's hands is more than an explanation of why we see what we do in today's animal species. It's also a new form for examining life in the ancient past and tracing how change likely took place. Knowing that natural selection builds on what's available, Carroll's analytical techniques show how animals shifted from a radial structure to a bilateral one. That's why you have two arms and legs instead of five arms like a starfish. Bilateralism proved more efficient and came to dominate animal structures.Carroll's prose too frequently lapses into a \\"cracker-barrel\\" style in his effort to reach a wide audience. However, he enhances his fine text with many illustrations and photographs. Evolutionary \\"trees\\", limb structure and how the switches operate are all well depicted. Some stunning views of butterfly wing markings are provided to illustrate the variations. Carroll's bibliography is limited, but the nascent level of the science justifies that. What is puzzling about this book is Carroll's treatment of leading figures in evolutionary biology. His iconoclasm reflects the influence of Stephen J. Gould on Carroll's writing. He cites Gould as a distant mentor, which seems anomalous in view of the material. Gould vilified \\"reductionism\\" but Carroll's explanation of tool box and switches is the most reductionist view of life around. It may not be limited to \\"one gene - one protein\\", but the depiction shows how life relies on a highly limited set of conditions in order to succeed. Gould's stance against the adaptationist programme is rendered untenable given how Carroll's switches must be suitable for particular environments.

In Endless Forms Most Beautiful, the author/scientist Sean Carrol describes exciting new developments in the field (as of 2005), starting with clear, illustrated explanations of some basic concepts necessary to understand the rest of the book. As someone who does at least know the basics, this made the book drag (even more) for me, but I think it would be really helpful to someone with little to no background in biology. The second half of the book was by far my favorite part and focused on some pretty cool examples of the concepts explained in the first half of the book.What most recommends this book is the author's enthusiasm for his topic. Through his perspective, I thought about how incredible it is that a single cell can become a whole organism and how strange it is that the DNA shared by all organisms is so similar, yet encodes instructions for so many different creatures. However by the time I started undergrad in 2007, a lot of the \\"new\\" research he describes was being taught in the classroom.My least favorite part of this book was the wordiness. Especially when describing the basics, the author came across as very pedantic. And he almost always included more detail than even I, another biologist, cared about (lists of gene names for example). I do think the book would fell less wordy to someone with less of a biology background, but most other reviews I've looked at also said the book could have been condensed a lot. Unfortunately, the excessive length made it harder to focus on the cool facts and as a result, the book felt kind of dry to me.

In between these final exhortations and his introduction, where he addresses the most recent advances in embryology and proclaims the \\"Evo Devo Revolution\\", he gets down to the nitty-gritty of how biology works at the molecular level.It turns out that not only are we 98% great ape, we are 100% bilateral. The genes that direct our development from embryo to adult human are derived from a postulated organism that may have lived a billion years ago - Urbilateria.Urbi was also the ancestor of all the other animals more complex than jellyfishes, including butterflies and zebras, oysters and trilobites. Each ancestor works with its inherited genes in its individual ways, turning them on and off at different times, in various strengths and always resulting in its own specific structures.Carroll's enthusiasm for his subject is infectious.

Regardless, I love his title, \\"Endless Forms Most Beautiful\\" a quote from mister big, Dr. Darwin himself."},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"Truly a wonderful book, it held my interest from page one to the end. You felt for Kathleen's family and their determination to find the killer. The book was well written and I am looking forward to reading more of Irence Pence's books."},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS BOOK I WAS SPELLBOUND. IT WAS THE BEST WRITTEN BOOK IT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION FROM THE BEGINNING AND KEEP ME TO THE END. I FEEL LIKE I KNOW BILL LIPSCOMB AND HIS FAMILY. SHE IS TRUELY AN AMAZING AUTHOR AND I WOULD READ ANYTHING SHE HAS WRITTEN. YOU REALLY HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK. YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY YOU DID."},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"I could not put this book down. It was really good. I work as a PI and was glad to see the hard work the Investigators put into this case to bring Lipscomb to justice. It was a very tragic story I feel so bad for the children.I like the way the author does not just focus on the trial thru the whole book. So many truecrime authors will just focus on the trial,which I find very boring. This book gives you a real inside look at a sister and mothers fight for justice."},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"As a member of Kathleen's family, I found the story to be extremely accurate as to what i've been told by other members of my family. Readers who read the book may think that our family seems to have abandoned Kathleen's children, but that is not the case at all. There are other details that are not revealed in the book, seeing as they are personal issues. Irene Pence defenately did justice to the death of cousin Kathleen."},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"Bill ALMOST got away with murder. One of the reviews of this book (May 14, 2002) is OBVIOUSLY posted by one of Bill's family members or, perhaps, his SECOND ex-wife. Kathleen's family DID NOT abandon her children since the arrest of their father -- they hired an investigator and SOLVED the murder of their mother for them -- Bill's family profited from Kathleen's death -- a place to live, a luxury boat and then they allowed the kids to live with them while living on the kids' social security income. Kathleen's family spent about $60,000 for the sake of the children -- let's ask Bill's family what they spent FOR THE KIDS! Kathleen's children didn't even have enough money to go to college when they could have had nearly $500,000 between the two of them. Why? Bill's family spent it on themselves! Greedy -- just like their son!!!! The story doesn't &quot;belong&quot; to anyone -- BUT the public DOES deserve to see what kind of monsters are walking among them. I hope that Bill continues to serve in jail for his RAPE, SODOMY AND STRANGULATION DEATH OF HIS OWN CHILDREN'S MOTHER. Talk about a Monster!!!! The thought of a movie probably sickens you because you would hate to see yourself protraying in such a negative light -- read the other reviews and get a heart! You don't have to like the style of the book or even the writer, but leave Kathleen and her family alone -- they've lost enough."},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"I was one of Bill Lipscomb's students at the MTI school just before the murder. Irene Pence did a great job changing the names to protect the innocent... but I knew or knew of just about every one of the folks involved. I could not put the book down! I ran into Bill while he was preparing to move back to VA on his 'humanitarian reassignment'... and expressed my condolences. What a manipulator he was!!! Was glad to see he was finally brought to justice. Only wish more had been punished in the WAPS test scandal. Great book!!!"},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"Irene Pence shows us one family's struggle to bring a killer to justice when the sheriff's office botches the investigation. I was put right in the middle of the family's desperation and determination. Clearly the author has done her homework. The riveting details throughout the book could only come from the parties involved: the victim's family, the investigators and the murderer himself. The story held me spellbound. I couldn't put the book down until I discovered how the charismatic Bill Lipscomb with his distinguished military career had slipped up and was caught."},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"Anyone who is so grotesquely repulsed by a book of this nature should maybe think twice before reading it. It obviously caught their attention for the simple fact that they read the book. I on the other hand found it a fascinating read!!"},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"Bill Lipscomb could've had it made, but he got too ambitious. He murders his wife, and her family spends all their time and money proving it. Ms. Pence takes this seemingly simple story and relates it very well. I could not believe how irritated Bill Lipscomb made me. It provokes many emotions. You will not believe this."},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"As a member of the US Air Force, it's creepy to see how this 'motivated' individual was on track to become a leader in the USAF. I found the fact that this 'superior' NCO had the audacity to create a WAPS cheating ring and killing his wife because she had the dirt on him to truly be a disgrace. What's sad is that I see guys (and women) like Lipscomb all the time. Granted not everybody whose motivated is a killer but when you see those guys who stab other people in the back for an award, it makes you wonder what they're capable of. I had seen a profile of this case on CourtTV and I was shocked that it took so long for Lipscomb to get busted. Kudos to OSI and the investigators for helping to bust him and kudos to Irene Pence for putting together this book.I do have one question: Why didn't the book address why Kathleen's legs were found in that awful position?"},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"This story was obviously well and completely researched by the author. Her ability to take real life facts and relate them in a story form makes this book memorable. The surprise twists in the story kept my attention from start to finish. In this case, the villian, a career military man, finally gets his due."},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"It could have told us more about Bill Lipscomb, perhaps tell us a bit more about his family and childhood. It seems there was so much more to this maniac then the reader found out. But other then that, the book was pretty good."},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"Irene Pence brought the characters to life and I couldn't put the book down until I could find out what happened to the husband. This murderer was so clever that I thought he could away with it, and I felt so sorry for the victim's family going through this."},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"The book \\"A Clue From the Grave\\" written by Irene Pence is about the murder of Kathy Lipscomb by her estranged husband, Bill. He's a not so nice guy in the Air Force (and they love him - he keeps getting promoted up the line - that's pretty scary!). She's a pretty nurse who's trying to get her life together.The book was written by Irene Pence in 1997. It's a disappointing read - it reads like a collection of notes that Ms. Pence took and then put together in a book. She goes from one paragraph to the next, each one almost not related. There are too many people to follow and the book is choppy - it could have been a really good book (I believe that she had access to Kathy's mom and sister) but the idea is the push to get the book written fast and written fast it was! Again, the older books are better and I'm still searching them them. If anyone has read a really great true crime book, please tell me! My collection of excellent books is growing and this one is going to Vietnam Veterans for resale.One final comment, the photographs are shocking!"},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"This true story was so wonderfully written! The author must have spent years getting all of the information together and presenting the events as they unfolded. I literally couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"I tried to put this book down, but it was no use. I was hooked. I would have liked to hear more about Libscomb's childhood and his parents, but still a page-turner of a book. I would give it 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"This \\"true crime\\" (actually, a tad unbelievable) SHOULD NOT have contained photographs of the crime victim. I could not believe the victim's family had approved this; extremely inappropriate, I believe. The content was a bit haphazard. To me, the chronology appeared to be off in places - confusing. References to U.S. Air Force protocol, for the most part, were hard to believe( I have served in USAF)."},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"No one reads true-crime books for their literary merit, but this book contains much worse writing than most others. Irene Pence is a truly lousy writer; her sentences are awkward, word choice is poor, and descriptions are stilted. I'm only on page 38, and I'm trying to stick with it, but I simply cannot believe that this book was published. The story may be gripping, but someone else should have written it. I will NEVER read anything by this author again."},{"Title":"A Clue From the Grave","review":"What readers need to keep in mind is that this is a true story, not just characters in a novel - Bill and Kathleen's children are real orphans, who, as young adults, are dealing with their mother's family's gross exploitation of her tragic death and its aftermath - a family that has abandoned them since the arrest of their father. No author should make a profit or critical acclaim from such a devastating chain of events. Irene Pence is less than a human being for pursuing such sordid story lines, and Kathleen Lipscomb's family has failed to remember that her story does not belong to them - Pence's boasting of a possible movie sicken and disgust me."},{"Title":"Rules for Writers","review":"The book that I purchased Rules for Writers has helped me tremedously with my writing projects.

Will be helpful in all my future writing."},{"Title":"Rules for Writers","review":"I have used this book during my college writing class, and I definitly learned about how to avoid a few gammar mistakes.

Then use the book to figure out how to fix them."},{"Title":"Rules for Writers","review":"Good book for rules on writing.

My fault for buying it without giving it a thorough look.The detailed index is nicely done.This one will go back to the store, to be replaced with Karen Gordon's Transitive Vampire. Meanwhile, I'll stick with Strunk."},{"Title":"Rules for Writers","review":"Retains most of the necessary regulations, but permits the split infinitive: p. 113: &quot;We decided actually to enforce the law&quot; IS perfectly natural; those who disagree should revise to &quot;We decided that we should actually enforce the law.&quot; Also, indefinite singulars, like &quot;everyone&quot; should never be equated with &quot;their&quot;! &quot;Everyone&quot; always must equal &quot;he or she.&quot; I shall require the text again for my Quality Composition course, but with a lengthy note-sheet of qualifications."},{"Title":"Rules for Writers","review":"This book was recommended by my professor and is very helpful. It is exactly what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Rules for Writers","review":"The book is a required book for class. It looks to be an excellent resource book. It came in great condition and timely fashion. It looks to be an easy read and easy reference."},{"Title":"Rules for Writers","review":"This book has some good information in it but it was a turn off when the author deals with gender and pronouns. She correctly states that to use \\"they\\" when referring to a singular person is incorrect. She advocates that singular pronouns also be avoided when the person to which it refers is unknown. She states that the use of the masculine pronoun in such cases is \\"offensive\\". This is a change in the rules of English grammer. She has allowed her feminist views to influence the book. I found this book distastful for this reason because I don't like this kind of propaganda and especially dislike the use of this book as a vehicle to promote the feminist agenda."},{"Title":"Rules for Writers","review":"The book was received in wonderful condition and delivered very quickly. A very nice experience in working with this company."},{"Title":"Rules for Writers","review":"The college where I teach English composition used Rules for Writers as the Handbook for three or four years. It now uses the Bedford Handbook. I found Rules for Writers to be very full and useful for every aspect of teaching, not only grammar and punctuation, but for composition and research writing as well. It tends to have fairly exhaustive explanations of most points of grammar. It has an especially good section on ESOL problems. All in all, it is a practical useful book that I keep on my writing desk for my own use, even though it is no longer used in our classes.I was usually able to teach my courses without using any other text other than this book and the required reader. Before we had Rules and currently with the Bedford Handbook (also by Daina Hacker), I had to rely on handouts taken from the internet to emphasize areas like MLA documentation and developing cohesion in paragraphs and essays or to provide remedial materials for students with problems. With Rules for Writers, and also with the Little, Brown Handbook, another good handbook, I found better supplementary materials right in the book than anything I found on the Net.The biggest problem with Rules for Writers is its spiral bound soft cover format. This book does not hold up. Pages fall out, the cover falls off, and the book gets banged up. I would have to replace it every semester, if only not to be embarassed by the wrecked appearance my copy would have when it was time to display the textbook on the first day of class!Now as a professor who gets free textbooks, that is not a big problem. However, for students who are simply robbed blind paying for text books and may be required to use a handbook like this in a series of classes--and should always keep a handbook like this for reference in and out of school--having a book that falls apart and constantly needs replacing can be financial murder.Still, I prefer this book to the Bedford Handbook. The Bedford Handbook is handbook in name only and does not have as many features or as deep coverage as books like Rules for Writers or the Little, Brown Handbook. It is a kind of dumbing down of the information here. Visually the Bedford Handbook is better as a visual object and has nice illustrations, charts and pictures. It is also well integrated with Diana Hacker's maze of web sites. However, if any professor is trying to decide between the Bedford and Rules for Writers, get Rules for Writers."},{"Title":"Rules for Writers","review":"When I was a freshman in college (circa 1979), the official reference book for my honors English Comp class was \\"Rules for Writers, 2nd ed.\\" And I still have that book on my bookshelf. When I discovered the book was still in publication and in its 5th edition (spiral-bound and fully updated to include the technology issues writers face), I had to have it.No matter how much you THINK you know about the rules of writing, grammar and punctuation, there's always something else you can learn. This book can benefit you whether you are a professional writer, a student, a business person, or someone for whom English is your second language and you want to improve your writing skills. Well-organized and indexed, with easy-to-understand examples, this little book seems to have it all.Add it to your reference library! Some things really are almost timeless."},{"Title":"Rules for Writers","review":"I found this book a useful tool for people who need a helping hand in their writing. It's not for the person looking for a quick referance. There are many helpful exercise to help you better understand you writing problems."},{"Title":"Rules for Writers","review":"I'm an SAT tutor, and I haven't been thrilled with many of the grammar/usage/writing SAT books on the market. They usually do a decent job on a few topics but not all topics. I'm getting this book for every one of my students (and my own son) because it will not only help them with the SAT writing section but it serves as the best ongoing reference for their use in school. I haven't tried the CD-ROM yet (sold separately) but it has over 1000 practice exercises."},{"Title":"Rules for Writers","review":"This is a top shelf book in my writers tool box.

He manages to get right to the main points, by introducing the pertinent theoretical and physical concepts with a minimum of distracting (and irrelevant) algebraic details. There is a perfect balance of 'theory' and 'examples' to enable any serious and literate EE undergraduate to master the basic concepts and ideas of Fourier transforms, Fourier series, Laplace transforms, and related continuous-time systems. Jackson's treatment of the DFT and its variants, as well as its relationship to the continuous-time transforms, is superior to all of the competing EE texts, and there are MANY!, that I have seen over the past 15 years. The book is a good size to actually USE, in stark contrast to the voluminous, inflated cartoon picture books/encyclopedias that try to pass as student 'textbooks'."},{"Title":"Signals, Systems, and Transforms","review":"At under 500 pages, this is a concise book on Transforms and Signal Processing. It makes an excellent reference for those beginning DSP or Telecommunications courses. I particularly find the tables within the book helpful when remembering transform rules.Make no mistake, this is a hard subject, but having studied under Leland Jackson, and having moved on to graduate courses in probability and DSP, I've found this text exceedingly useful."},{"Title":"Signals, Systems, and Transforms","review":"This book was very hard to understand. It had sections that were poorly organized with a total disregard for extensive examples. Examples that were shown were not only short, but were unrepresentative of problems that were shown in the Problem section at the end of each chapter. I also found it extremely frustrating that the author insisted on including problems in the problem section that required him to basically add full explanations and include indepth lessons for each. The author of this book clearly overestimates the knowledge held by most beginner Signal students."},{"Title":"Signals, Systems, and Transforms","review":"This book was given a poor rating by me because it has very few, and very poor examples. It is not a good book to learn from"},{"Title":"Us Army Airborne 1940 90","review":"I had read a fair bit on the German airborne arm, the legendary Fallschirmj&auml;gers, but I had read very little on the American version until this book by Gordon Rottman. It contained a number of surprises for me, first and foremost the debt owed to the famous Billy Mitchell. In October 1918, as a Colonel in the US Army, he put forward the plan to train the US 1st division in parachuting techniques, and to be dropped behind German lines by heavy bombers as part of the planned 1919 Spring offensive. The end of the war in November 1918 put paid to this plan, however the seeds were planted for the future. Colonel Mitchell had the forward looking idea to supply these men by air-dropping supplies, and using ground attack aircraft to prevent German use of approach roads to the drop zones, enabling the 1st US division to fortify their bases.It was Mitchell again, now a Brigadier General, who conducted the first US Army airborne experiment, on 29.4.28. He had three volunteers from the 2nd Division parachute onto Kelly Field in San Antonio Texas, where they set up and fired a machine gun as part of the demonstration. Progress was slow, however, and it was not until 1933 before an entire battalion was air-lifted. With the stunning success of the German parachute, glider and air-landed troops at the start of the campaign in the West in 1940, the Army activated it's first parachute unit, the Parachute Test Platoon, on 25.6.40. On 16.9.40, the first US Army parachute battalion was activated, the 501st Parachute Battalion. The Army Air Corp began glider trials in July 1941, and the book describes the wrangling within the Army about the structure and function of the airborne units, leading up to the declaration of war on 8.12.41The book then runs through the creation and formation of the various US Army and Air Corp airborne units, the success' and failures of these units in North Africa, Sicily and the Pacific, leading up to D-Day and Market Garden, followed by the Ardennes and through to Germany's surrender on 8.5.45. Next comes the years after the war, followed by Korea, Vietnam and beyond. The photographs are excellent, and as usual, Ron Volstadt has provided high quality colour plates. A great book for the casual and dedicated reader of military matters.A top read!"},{"Title":"Advanced Dim Mak","review":"I bought this book with the expectation to find some thorough background on Dim Mak...unfortunately, according to the author Dim Mak was invented by a man with X-ray vision!!! So, from that point of view I think it was a waste of money. Also the schematics which shows that if you hit someone on a point A, he will die in two weeks...right. I do believe (and based on experience) that hitting certain points on the body will be extremely pain full and effective from a martial arts point of view. But if you are looking for that, please buy another book. Or mine...on EBAY."},{"Title":"Surrender (Palisades Pure Romance)","review":"Lynn Bulock is the kind of writer that makes you want to go out and track down her entire backlist after reading just one book!

The boy kept the pups and eventualy he had a zoo full of animals. I won't tell you the rest of the story! Bye!!!"},{"Title":"Boys Like Her: Transfictions","review":"Boys Like Her: Transfictions (1998) is, above all, a collection concerned with border crossings, both literal and figurative. In fact, what Boys Like Her really made me understand is that literal crossings are always figurative in some way and that, perhaps, figurative journeys can be understood in a unique way by thinking of them as literal. The event that Boys Like Her begins with and keeps coming back to is the literal Canada-U.S. border crossing that the troupe Taste This (comprised of Anna Camilleri, Ivan E. Coyote, Zo Eakle, and Lyndell Montgomery) undertakes on their multi-disciplinary performance tour. This initial border crossing repeats and reinvents itself throughout the book, particularly in terms of gender and genre--word suspiciously similar, don't you think? The pieces, if I can call them that, in Boys Like Her are sometimes fiction, and sometimes not, although it is often hard to tell which is which. Some are poetry. Some of the entries are reflections on the performances themselves and on the artists' relationships with each other--they are inevitably tangled romantically and otherwise as you might imagine a group of queer friends all living in Vancouver at the time would have been. Other portions of the book are written transcriptions of stories told on stage: translations of live acts that have traces of the freshness and rawness of oral storytelling and performance art. Perhaps the narratives are best described as \\"stories of life,\\" as I've heard Ivan describe her writing...See the rest of my review on my website: [...]"},{"Title":"Boys Like Her: Transfictions","review":"This well-written book of short stories offers a unique perspective on gender and queer life.

Couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Boys Like Her: Transfictions","review":"I'm a big fan of this book -- it's quite simply amazing.

Intersex conditions are those in which an infant is born with sex chromosomes or sexual reproductive organs that are not exclusively male or female. Their condition is about sex, not gender. Transgenders on the other hand, are biologically born male or female but have gender identity issues. They are different, as are the medical needs and experiences.The author should be more respectful of people with intersex conditions and publish an apology. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Boys Like Her: Transfictions","review":"I wish I lived in Western Canada so I could have a chance to see Taste This (the performance troup whose work is showcased in this book) in action! The four members give some great memoirs and assorted stories of growing up different in terms of gender and sexuality. I wanted the book to go on and on because every story makes you stop and rethink the terms of gender forced upon us by society. And don't even get me started on the pictures!!! :)"},{"Title":"Boys Like Her: Transfictions","review":"This book is brilliant! For me at least it was like coming home. The stories are diverse, spectacular literary snapshots of life in the shadowlands of gender. It was confirmation and a challenge and I just can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Boys Like Her: Transfictions","review":"I don't usually like collections (they are often too uneven) but this one truly stands out from the pack. It is consistently beautiful writing, each of the stories meshing together well - kudos to the editor who pieced this one together! The photos are also excellent.

My pick for a Lambda award, personally."},{"Title":"Boys Like Her: Transfictions","review":"\\"Boys Like Her\\" is a GREAT BOOK!!!! It's incredibly well-written, each member of Taste This has their own unique voice in their writing and it makes for very eclectic, great reading, and the photographs are awesome!!!! This book and the contents of it definitely shine some light on transgender and gender issues in general, and that info is much needed!!

So go buy this already!!!!"},{"Title":"Boys Like Her: Transfictions","review":"I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this book... even if you can't relate to transgenders you can relate to the emotions and raw reality expressed among the pages.

I am not trained in the field, and was only able to understand any of it after having read most of the body of Freud's work. However, at about 120 pages, this brief exegesis on anxiety (called a neurosis in Freud's day, now called a disorder) is an informative look at three things: Freud's peculiar but influential theory on neurosis; something of what psychology was in the first half of the twentieth century; and a fascinating spin on anxiety and its causes and symptoms, as Freud and the early analysts saw it.Put simply, Freud described anxiety as essentially a glitch in the interaction between the ego (control) and id (animal desires); or a problem with a person's fight-or-flight response. This definition, I believe, has survived somewhat into the present, though Freud's explanation of the cause of the glitch resting primarily in the supression of the libido has probably been somewhat discounted. Remember: Freud's theories were very viable, it was his explanations (based on sexuality) that are brought into question.The other components of the title, inhibitions and symptoms, can be most simply defined as follows. In the case of inhibitions, those things that prevent the id from experiencing its pleasure successfully (Freud broke the necessity of function down to what he called the Pleasure Principle, or the fact that at root we all seek pleasure to satify our id). And in the case of symptoms, the physical and psychosomatic manifestations of the results of those inhibitions working against the id.In short, anxiety is the symptomatic result of the problems caused when inhibitions are instituted by the ego in an attempt to control the id.The take away from this is that, although much of Freud's actual explanations have been revamped and often discarded, his theories, as in the present case of anxiety, are still fascinating and worth a look. If you can get through the couched terminology."},{"Title":"Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety","review":"Often overlooked, this concise exploration of origins and manifestations of anxiety is often brilliant and provocative. Freud explores the basic properties of fear, anxiety, and touches on the sexual component of these human states of mind/body. Freud hypothesizes that the origin of anxiety is founded in the repressed memory of the human's separation from the mother's originary nutrition during the act of birth. All manifestations of anxiety are (in essence) a resurgence of this primal fear. This is crucial to the role of biology and nourishment to psychoanalysis, often glossed over in its modern variants."},{"Title":"Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety","review":"I ordered this book for my son who is dealing with some personality disorders. This book has been very relevent to him in helping him distinguish issues he has been dealing with."},{"Title":"Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety","review":"Really hard to read, this book is not for the laymen."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"It was such a pleasure to read these stories. Each story grabs you quickly, and makes its narative thrust accessible. His stories don't stray from his simple narratives; there is very little excess or digression.The stories are very personal and moral without being preachy. He knows how to capture people's moral ambivalence without judging them or resorting to stereotypes.I found this book to be both an easy read and very moving."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"Since this book won the 1959 National Book Award, and I had not read it, I found a copy and was amazed at the power of the stories. I usually am not too enamored of short story collections, since I don't appreciate starting anew every few pages in a book. But this book is an exception. I was amazed at how quickly one became caught up in each story. The first story is The First Seven Years, and is a most touching story, setting the reader up most felicitously for enjoyment of each of the following 12 stories."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"This set of stories surprises one with breadth of understanding which it exhibits. From the first story (&quot;The First Seven Years&quot;) which deals with a father's desire to provide the best for his daughter through the last story (&quot;The Magic Barrel&quot;)which provides an interesting contrast to the first, all of these stories expand on the single theme of human experience.The frustration built upon in &quot;The Key&quot; and &quot;The Last Mohican&quot; if offset nicely by the humor in &quot;A Summer's Reading&quot; and &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot;. &quot;Take Pity&quot; and &quot;The Mourners&quot; offer great insigth into growing old and dealing with lonliness. While &quot;Angel Levine&quot; is probably the most off beat of the set it still manages to increase hope, whereas &quot;The Prison&quot; causes an equal loss of faith in the human race.The 12 stories here provide a wonderful evening's reading, however if your looking for more they are included in the books of his complete stories."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"Malamud does three or four tricks in his fiction well, and here he does each one to utter perfection. And when taken together, this collection of stories almost transcends Malamud's normal limits: the stories are compressed, short, and below the surface, charged with almost unbearable tension. Unlike other collections of stories (or when you read too many Malamud stories) Malamud does not parody himself in the Magic Barrell. Everything is where it is supposed to be, and works like a well oiled machine. It is a shame that (as of writing this) only eight people have reviewed this masterpiece of a short story collection. In Roth's The Ghost Writer, Zuckerman explains that the world's morality has already passed by the E.I. Lonoff's (a character based on Malamud). Seems Roth was correct... and this is true even more today, thirty years after the publication of The Ghost Writer. We no longer live in Malamud's world, and it is a shame."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"These stories are pervaded with a certain sadness and disappointment, a sense of life as largely a trial in suffering. They are also however deep in a kind of quiet beauty, a unique language of slightly Yiddishized American colloquial restraint. The title story, and the most famous one tells of the hopes and disappointments of poor Jews seeking to find their ' bashert' their destined mate. It touches upon the world of tormented souls selling illusions to themselves and others. It really moves us with the sense of how the dreams of life turn bitterness into greater bitterness, with longing disappointment beauty. These stories are for those who are willing to read and take inspiration from the sadnesses of life, that nonetheless enrich our human meaning."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"These stories about New York, even when read fifty years later by someone like me from a totally different demographic, in Los Angeles, are still relevant. There are universal self-loathing themes for all immigrants, at all times. I wouldn't call it immigrant lit, but it's more like human diaspora lit, the transience of people, and how people make sense, however limited, of the world around them. Strongly recommend. Malamud is able to make writing about trash untrashy, but not in a falsely glorifying way, but in a humanizing way. These are real short stories, not failed novellas."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"I wasn't sure about this book but decided to give it a shot and I am so happy I did.

In one of her letters, she mentioned that she had justfinished reading The Magic Barrel and stated that &#34;this guy makes the rest of us look bad.&#34; (Or words to that effect;can't recall the exact quote.)Many years ago I read Malamud's &#34;The Fixer&#34; and never forgot it. Its message has stayed with me through many politicaltrials of my own. The only other book which has never been forgotten is &#34;The Arms of Krupp.&#34; Have not finished all thestories in The Magic Barrel but so far they are all wonderful. One cannot go wrong with truly gifted writers."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"This book was interesting. I feel not everyone gets these short stories. The stories are sad and depressing, but that's the author's point: immigrant life can really suck. There isn't always a happy ending.

Still looked practically brand new. The only problem is that it is upside down and backwards. So I look like a retard when reading it. It's not a big issue though. Otherwise it came in a timely manner and is in the condition the seller told me it was in."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"So who could say that Bernard Malamud didn't write well ? Not me. He writes very well indeed. These 13 stories, mainly about first-generation Jewish immigrants in America, but also about visitors to Italy from America, capture so much of life in a society where one is an outsider---that feeling of \\"being here but not here\\", or of living in a country, but not belonging. The wasted ex-coffee salesman, the harassed landlord, the loner rabbinical student, they all seem to pulsate with failure, with uncertainty, and fatal mistakes. Ah, this is a book about life all right, but it's a book in which the vision is almost tunnel vision. Every single story, without exception, deals with people who cannot rise to their own imaginations of themselves. They meet frustration, failure, death or disappointment, they are deflected from any purpose they might have once had. They are melancholy shades of fruitless endeavor. Does even one reach his ambition ? (They are all male.) No, the student doesn't find a house in Rome, the would-be art critic abandons his research, the would-be lover lies about his Jewish origins and loses the beautiful girl, the buyer on credit never pays back, the so-called reader never reads, the shoemaker allows his daughter to marry an unsuitable man. Only once, after humiliating an angel to tears, does an old man admit his mistake and save his wife from death, and this occurs in the only fantasy among the thirteen. Most of the characters lose, their labors come to naught, they grow wiser, but sadder. I would assume that Malamud himself felt an outsider everywhere, comfortable nowhere. If that is not true, his dreams must have been filled with worry, because this is a most melancholy collection. Does anyone smile ? Does anyone laugh ? Does anyone dash down the street radiant with love ? No. Life is full of personal shortcomings, a bald spot, a stubborn rejection of family, an inability to swim or make money. Frustration and lies run rampant--people certainly do shoot themselves in the foot again and again. Life is a tragedy, life always ends in disappointment-these are truths told in half the literature of the world, but there is more to our humble existence than that. Even when Malamud writes a humorous story, it is filled with underlying doubt in human nature, concentrating on the tendency of people to try to be what they are not. If you want thirteen superb stories to illustrate that sad point of view, here they are. If you think life is more of a mixed bag, then perhaps this book will only depress you."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"'The Magic Barrel' by Malamud contains several (mostly) entertaining short stories involving Jewish (/Yiddish) characters from the 1950s. He captures a culture and way of life today's generation has no memory of. Although well written I cannot quite understand why this book would receive any special accolades.Bottom line: certainly a good read but not the sort of book worth searching for unless one has a special interest in Jewish/Yiddish American life. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"This is a very strange book. There are a lot of small messages that Mr. Malamud delivers in each of his stories. Everything from the mistreatment of others to stealing. He covers many different aspects of life that can help make people better citizens of the world.I did not enjoy his style of writing though. It was dull, and very dry. There was no excitment in any of his stories and I found it hard to keep myself reading. I can see how somebody else might enjoy it though... if you're the type that likes dull, dry stories, Malamud is the guy for you."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"&quot;The Magic Barrel&quot; was a collection of stories that intrigued me, if only for the whimsical sounding name. I was disappointed, however, to find that the stories themselves were themselves not whimsical in the least. Malamud has created a world where paranoia is abundant, and worse, where poor, lackadaisical decisions are abound equally. There are no winners in any of Malamuds stories. I found myself becoming angry at the characters, for the way in which they responded to conflicts was alarmingly pathetic. His character development is strong, however, and I did enjoy maybe one or two of the stories until I found the ending rather dreary. If a literary work is &quot;sad,&quot; that is not a deterrant for me. Malamud's characters, on the other hand, are hopeless. I can't seem to enjoy reading about people who operate in such ways."},{"Title":"The Magic Barrel","review":"I was looking for a hard to find book in large print.

Extensions also give developers a way to write functional code modules for themselves, for others or for profit.Although, I have years and years of programming experience I wanted to pick up a book specifically on extensions before tasking my organization's development team on the task of creating a few sophisticated extensions for the developer community. I'm glad I found this book. It was not only easy to read, but it also maintained a great focus throughout the book on what the reader is trying to learn. There are so many books out today that spend the first 200 pages describing the history of the internet and evolution of man that by the time you get to the good stuff you're reading the appendices.

If you have a good instructor, he or she will probably be able to simplify things for you, otherwise the book will teach you nothing. Many of the problems/examples, however, seem to be simple enough and can be solved using simple equations, so one wonders why the text goes in to so much detail using esoteric mathematics.

Certainly, they helped me obtain my present job as a database analyst.

Too simple for an e-commerce site, for sure, but sufficiently practical that you can imagine some use for it, to help cooperative coworkers avoid inadvertent interference, for example. Or consider Kernighan & Ritchie's \\"The C Programming Language\\", in which the first lesson following the \\"hello world\\" program is a Fahrenheit - Celsius conversion. Eckel is content that we print a few debugging lines indicating that a function -- er -- method (in OOPS-speak) -- executed. While showing that the method main() should accommodate some string arguments, Eckel doesn't mention using the arguments in the first dozen chapters (I didn't finish the book), although this is the sole input technique introduced.Eckel should have started early with some kind of little project, like a craps game, or a shopping cart for a sporting goods merchant website, or even Fahrenheit - Celsius redux.From time to time, Eckel mentions that there are situations in which the theory he presents has good use, but he leaves the reader to guess what those might be.In short, the problem with this book is motivation. Should the reader ask \\"Why is this important?\\", there's no answer."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"First of all I'm a student. When I stared learning Java I knew next to nothing about programming and I had to use this book in an introductory Java programming class. Now let me tell you - this book caused me innumerable headaches and outbursts of anger and despair.Yes, it's a popular book, yes, many people will refer beginners to it, yes, you can find it for free. !!!BUT!!! other than that, the book is complete trash - the worst, the most stupid and useless examples ever, terrible explanations, terrible layout style and more.Don't listen to people that refer you to that book - I seriously doubt that they were learning from it when they began studying Java.THE BEST INTRO JAVA BOOK in my opinion, the book that really helped me to understand and learn programming is Introduction to Java Programming by David Liang. It's expensive and big but it's the best, really."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"I took this book to learn about Annotations since there aren't many on this topic. THe explainations were just PAINFUL. I mean the author just throws in sentences with no reference whatsoever to what the words mean. It's like he expects me to read his mind. Its like watching a movie where you have to sit through about 3/4th of the movie to finally get what the plot is. Ok so if you watch the whole movie you might be able to tell what happened in the movie. But the first 3/4th of your time is just a torture if you are a person wth average patience. And here we are talking about 1100 pages for heaven's sake. I guess I have to start looking elsewhere."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"This book is the best way to learn the core language of Java and to learn about object-oriented programming and design. It is really meant for someone who has a some Java programming experiences; I do not recommend it for a novice.You might ask: where should a novice start? Java is not a great language for n00bs; at the North Carolina School of Science and Math we begin with Python. The Python site has several good e-books and lots of tutorials. If you have never programmed before, begin here. Learn about forking, looping, functions, recursion and about working with objects such as lists,tuples and dictionaries.If you know how to write simple procedures and have some programming experience, the eccentric Head First Java published by O'Reilly is a fun and accessible place to begin with Java. I'd recommend if you are a beginner, you start with Dr Java ([...]). This runs on all platforms and has and \\"interactions pane\\" that allows you to inspect your classes live.Once you make your way through this book, you can turn to Eckel's book; you will find it accessible and informative. It will build on your intuition you acquired reading Head First Java. Eckel's book does not address much in the way of GUIs. The O'Reilly book Learning Java can help you with that. Learning the material in these two books will give you a significant knowledge of Java.In short, this book has an important place in the OO/Java cannon. It belongs in every serious programmer's library."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"The book is a little dirty.

Thinking In Java (4th Edition) by Bruce Eckel. It's the first one that actually made object-oriented programming understandable for me.Contents: Introduction; Introduction to Objects; Everything Is an Object; Operators; Controlling Execution; Initialization & Cleanup; Access Control; Reusing Classes; Polymorphism; Interfaces; Inner Classes; Holding Your Objects; Error Handling with Exceptions; Strings; Type Information; Generics; Arrays; Containers in Depth; I/O; Enumerated Types; Annotations; Concurrency; Graphical User Interfaces; Supplements; Resources; IndexI first got a copy of Thinking In Java back in 2000 when I was trying to wrap my mind around the language and object-oriented concepts. I was fortunate to read it before taking a Java class at the Sun headquarters. The person teaching object-oriented concepts was \\"less than stellar\\", but I was able to get my money's worth because I had been prepped with this book. Eckel has the rare ability to explain and structure his content in such a way that you feel like you're getting a personalized lesson. The diagrams and code samples work hand-in-hand to clarify each concept and to build your skill base step-by-step. Once you get done working your way through the 1400+ pages (yes, it's big!), there's not much you won't be able to do or understand in the world of Java.Thinking In Java is one of two books I recommend to anyone looking to get started in object-oriented Java coding. It will always hold a special place on my bookshelf, and I'll be forever in debt to Bruce Eckel for writing such an outstanding book."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"Thinking in Java is a quite comprehensive book for intermediate to advanced level for Java programmers.

I reccomend buying it in english, you have bargain priced books here. You also need to buy solutions for exercises for 20 bucks, so far there are solutions for 2nd edition exercises and 3rd edition.I reccomend buying book in english, since translation can be tricky, at least the one published in my country.Id say Eckel doesn't choose so obvious examples for what he wants to explain, and he lacks finesse in writing so you have to read REAL slow, but this book is Ok so far I've read it.Second thing I don't like is how Eckel chose to put stuff together: in one chapter, he begins wih constructors, then goes to explain finalize command, then to explain static. He does relatively good job, but he could structure book better.Now, when you add 20 bucks for exercise solutions and then some for hardcopy of book, Isn't that a little too much? Couldn't they sell the book and give away free CD/PDF file with solutions of homework questions? Or write answers at the end of the book? This reminds me of selling someone bycicle with flat tires or with no seat...I wouldn't reccomend this book to newbies in world of obj oriented languages. When you become little more experienced (buy two books from Barry Burd, Java for Dummies one and two)or attend some Java classes, start reading Eckel and you will understand it.---------------------------------------------------------------------After reading half of the book, I really got dissapointed in Chapter 9 , Holding Objects. Writer assumed, I guess, that everyone is software engineer or programer, so he doesnt start with lists, sets and maps, but with HIS code that uses Java classes. You either have to read it 4 times, OR ask for help OR know things before reading. Thanx god Eckel wrote good exercises, but one warning: there are some exercises which use constructors never mentioned, so you have to go to [...] or ask around.-----------------------------------------------------------------Ok, after chap 9 I had to hurry up and skipped some stuff I didn't need. It seems chapters after 9 are more understandable.

I spent a good amount of time in the I/O sections and that specifically was littered with excellent examples."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"Although this book purports to be written for anyone with even a little bit of prior programming experience, I am finding it very difficult to follow. This, even though I have been dabbling in programming since 1976 and I have gotten 'A's in several programming classes.The author makes three major mistakes all throughout the book:First, he uses compressed code formating that makes it difficult to see where one part of the code ends and another starts. I know it is common for advanced programmers and authors trying to save paper to use this format, but it should not be used in a book for beginning Java programmers. I spend more time just trying to sort out which curly bracket matches to which curly bracket than anything else in trying to read his code.Second, he continuously uses advanced techniques and Java features in sample code meant to illustrate beginning concepts. This leaves the reader confused about what the code is doing at all and forces them to simply take on faith that what the author says about the code is true. For instance, in the section titled \\"Your first Java Program\\" (page 78) the author instantiates an anonymous object and passes it to a method. There was no reason to include this line of code. But the author stuck it in there and then waved his hands at it saying merely, \\"The argument is a Date object that is being created just to send its va1ue (which is automatically converted to a String) to println(). As soon as this statement is finished, that Date is unnecessary, and the garbage collector can come along and get it anytime. We don't need to worry about cleaning it up.\\" In those few sentences the author has made reference to several more advanced features without even explaining them. So, in trying to understand that one unnecessary line of the reader is spun off on at least three different tangents.The next sample program is even worse. The very first line that actually does anything is \\" System.getProperties().list(System.out); \\" Holy cow! The System.getProperties() method returns a Properties object which is an extension of the Hashtable class. Then the second dot operator calls the list method for Properties object that has \\"replaced\\" the System.getProperties() part of the code as far as the second dot operator is concerned. The list() method then accepts as an argument a static PrintStream object which the list() method then sends its output to. And the author says merely, \\"The first line in main( ) displays all of the \\"properties\\" from the system where you are running the program, so it gives you environment information. The list() method sends the results to its argument, System.out.\\" But to someone who is only just now reading this page in the book, \\"System.out\\" is how you print something, NOT something that can be passed as an argument. And have you ever tried to Google a period (.)? How is a beginner supposed to figure out that the list() method is a member of the Properties object that was returned by the System.getProperties() method. Sure, you can dig it out of the JavaDocs but a beginner won't be able to do this easily. Besides, if you are going to force the reader to dig everything out of the JavaDocs then what the heck is the book good for?This same pattern is repeated throughout the book. Every single example has something in it that is more advanced than a person who has gotten to that part of the book could reasonably be expected to be able to figure out.Finally, the biggest problem with this book is that the author has created his own set of libraries and uses them heavily in his code but doesn't indicate where. So, if you don't have the entire JDK memorized you have no clue when he is using something from the standard libraries or something from his own libraries. If you are trying to learn the basics of Java, you don't want to have some other stuff mixed in at random. Sure, the author's libraries may solve some interesting problems and it may make some things easier to code. But it DOES NOT teach the reader about how Java works other than it is possible to completely obfuscate everything you do.So, my conclusion is that this book is really good for nothing. It is too confusing for the beginner and is way too wordy for an expert. Intermediate users will spend more time digging through the JavaDocs than they do reading the book."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"[Note: this review refers to the 3rd edition. I haven't had access to the 4th edition to see what has changed.]The summary says it all. This 1,000+ page monster probably has the best coverage of all the Java books purporting to be considered as introductory texts. In terms of completeness, it is better than the Sierra/Bates and Deitel books. However, these two books are much more approachable, with better layout and presentation, whereas working through this book is sheer drudgery.The book uses extensive use of long examples to demonstrate the various language concepts and features. This approach IMO is very long-winded, and bumps up the size of the book to its present doorstop size. The coverage of inner and anonymous classes gets bogged down with the excessive use of example listings, while the treatment of the Java I/O System runs to 110 pages, and Collections to 120 pages, more than double that used by Deitel! A better approach IMO, as successfully used by Lippman in his popular C++ Primer, would have been to use small code fragments to demonstrate each point, and then present a more complete, compilable example at the end of each section or chapter. With free time a precious commodity, I want to learn new topics as quickly as possible, and learn the more esoteric details from more specialised sources later.The presentation of the book could also be improved. As has already been mentioned by other reviewers, there is a dearth of diagrams to break up the monotony of the presentation. For example, Eckel makes occasional reference to design patterns in the text. Why not add UML diagrams to emphasise the point? Also, the coverage of the Java I/O Syetem, with its large collection of interrelated classes, simply cries out for a class diagram.The book can be used as a very readable language reference. I should mention that Eckel's writing style itself is quite readable; a pity about the dour presentation. The on-line availability of the book is also a boon for searching particular topics."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"This is not a beginner's book to programming, but if you have a little bit of programming experience and the desire to learn, this is the book for you. Thinking in Java helps you understand the thought process and concepts that the developers of Java had in mind when they developed the language. Bruce Eckel is a very experienced teacher and excellent communicator who is able to present the concepts in an understandable way. This is not for bedtime reading, you should have Java installed on your machine and interact with the book. Of course, nothing is better than attending a seminar by Mr. Eckel but this book comes pretty darn close. Don't bother with the \\"free\\" versions of this book's earlier editions, the Java Language has evolved and moved beyond them (Java added \\"generics\\" which is a major and painful language after-thought). It is clear that Mr. Eckel is not a fan of the way that Sun implemented Java (and I agree with him). But if you limit the use of Generics you can get by. If you are relatively new to programming and have the desire to learn, you should expect to spend at least three months crawling through this treasure book. It will be worth the effort. If you are an experienced programmer, this book will reveal the underlying concepts in a meaningful way to help you understand the differences between Java and C# and you can get through it in about a month. In addition, this book tries to show you how to organize your code for human readability (when properly done, your code almost reads like a human language - and please remember, I said \\"almost\\"). As a final comment, Java is a complex and verbose language (especially since Sun added generics) so this book will always be a good reference."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"I'll make this short.

The sheer size of this weighty tome is overwhelming, and it does not come with rollers. It is a great book for your second pass thru Java, certainly more so than any other book that I've looked at. I have extensive teaching experience and I do spend lots of time examing books. Eckel is a very readable and much more than competent writer as attested to by the great sucess with his previous C and C++ books. They are still great reading and studying books. For Java starters, you can't do much better than the Sierra and Bates book, 'HeadFirst Java' from O'Reilly. (By the way, at good price from Amazon). Check out their newest, Design Patterns in Java. Everything in the 4th edition of this now classic Eckel book looks more polished. In agreement with other reviewers, this book lacks a polished publishing job. Where are the pictures ?

There are better ones out there for learning Java or using as a reference. This book fails at both, for two reasons:1) Half the book is code examples. Normally, these would be provided online, and you could download them at your leisure. Instead, pages and pages are solid code blocks, interrupting the flow of reading. This makes it hard to learn Java, and hard to use as a reference later on.2) The code provided is poorly written. Not only does it occupy too much space in the text itself, but the code is so poorly formatted as to be unreadable. If any dev working with me formatted their code this way, I would force them to rewrite it.If you're looking to learn Java, you're much better off buying Head First Java. If you're looking for a Java reference, O'Reilly's Learning Java is much better.Overall, I deeply regret purchasing this book."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"I really liked this book, its a complete one. I used it to study for the SCJP 5.0 Exam as a complement to the Kathys book. Its however not a beginners book. You have to have some programming background cause its very theorical book. It explains in depth every subject, and its it drawback too, it gets a little boring with so much explanation, and in some examples it focuses more on the Design Patterns than Java. This is the Java Bible,every thing you will need is inside."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"Intro:First and for most, back when I first started programming, I grabbed the first few editions from Bruce Eckel off his website and used those books as a reference guide, jumping all over the place confused out of my mind. Now I have a very mature understanding, and 7 years of software development under my belt. I decided to borrow the 4th edition from a friend who received this book as a gift. After blowing the dust off the covers, I am reminded at how detailed Bruce can be in his explanations.Pet Peeves:The problem when learning something is time. If you want to read this book from front to back, be prepared to go through an extremely (emphasis on extremely) slow pace. In fact, it takes nearly 100 pages to begin discussing if else conditions. Personally, I think most of the content that is intertwined with the actual learning of the language should have been \\"appendixed\\". He talks heavily about concepts that are involved in the underlying structure of java, something more useful to the programmers at sun microsystem than the actual programmer trying to figure out why he/she should get into java. This is the kind of information that \\"you don't need to know, but if you're interested, keep going\\" kind of thing. For example, after skimming through the first 400 pages, he got into extensive discussions about garbage collection, heap allocation, naming conventions,.. in fact, around the 100th page you'd find 6 pages of nothing but lists of operators you can use (again, something that should have been as an appendix).Oh and one more thing I have to mention, you will encounter something where he starts talking about a topic, and after you finish like 2 pages of reading, he mentions \\"you will seldomly encounter this when your programming\\". This does happen often throughout his 1080 page brick.. I mean book.Conclusion:This book is certainly not a pragmatic approach to understanding a language. If you are pressed for time on a project, and you need to know the bare minimum to get the job done, look elsewhere. If you are writing a thesis, your internet is slow or not working, or you need to brush up on the advanced concepts (cut the book in half, and keep the latter half).Two Cents:Its just crazy that each chapter can be ~100 pages long. Atleast put some pictures or diagrams, those are worth a thousand words you know."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"Bruce Eckel's \\"Thinking in Java\\" is the best technical book that I have ever used. I have read many technical books on Java, C, Visual Basic and a host of other programming languages and this book is by far the best written that I have ever read.The book introduces the reader to the concepts behind the technology and builds on these concepts by providing examples and exercises. Each topic is explored in reasonable depth. This gives the reader a good foundation to build on. The book also references other texts for more detail and depth on specific topics.I strongly recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn Java or be introduced to the object oriented programming paradigm."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"A more appropriate title should be something like \\"Transitioning to Java from C++\\"!I rarely ever do reviews, I know its a bad thing but I am trying to change. With that being said, let me jump into why I do NOT like this book. I have programmed before. In fact, I have taken a course in Java before but back then I hated programming and learned very little (now, I have seen the light :-). I am enrolled in a grad course that expects us to understand Java and so I bought this book. Before I even started reading the book, I had concerns. I \\"skimmed\\" through the book and noticed how conversational the book seemed. In my opinion a conversational tone does not teach you how to program. For example, if I have no clue about Object Oriented Programming, do I really want a five page lecture about what it is, and explaining all the parts. Explaining such terms makes little physical connection and you really never get it unless you code and see it working. The first code in the book refers to methods that were not explained and the continuous reference to C++ is extremely annoying and counter productive for those of use who don't know the language. In chapter one of a Java beginners book, there are comparisons to C++ with regards to memory leakage and garbage collections, terms that means very little to the beginner. What this approach will do, is to allow new terms to accumulate in your mind and it will start to frustrate you as the things mentioned has no meaning to you. The book assumes that you have some exposure to programming, it does not say what kind of programming language, so why does every page make a comparison to C++??I am trying to return my book and I will be more cautious when buying my next book. I just kind of picked this book randomly."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"This book makes your day sunny: It not only explains how JAVA works, but also go one step further to tell your WHY it is made so to work this way. It were like that the author be one of the designers of JAVA and now he were telling you all the secret behind the design, in the most charming way."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"This book was born out of business seminars and this fact is imprinted throughout the book. The most striking aspect of this is a lack of rigor and fluidity with what should be precise concepts. This approach is highlighted in a footnote on page 62 of the 4th edition: \\"One could argue for the precision of such convoluted statements, but I think my approach simplifies the understanding of the concept...\\" In programming, it pays to be precise about the language you are studying. It may require non-trivial discussions, but programming languages as large as Java are non-trivial. Trying to paper over details by providing imprecise explanations only hurts the student down the road.The examples in the book also exhibit a similar carelessness. In the chapter \\"Initialization & Cleanup\\" constructors are introduced in the section \\"Guaranteed initialization with the constructor\\". However, neither of the two examples in the section actually initialize anything.Overall, a reasonable book if you've already mastered another language (like C++, which is referred to constantly in the early part of the book). But if you are learning programming for the first time, this book will only confuse and teach simplified concepts which you will have to relearn at a later date."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"This is not a \\"learn programming using java\\" - type of a book .

I found some very clear examples of oriented object programming. The 4th edition add the new features like the generics classes, the enumeration type for mention a few. I think this book is the best for learning Java."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"I had heard a lot of positive talk about this book, so I picked it up based on that...only to find I could read it online later. The book contains exceptional in-depth information about the Java language. The writing is conversational which makes it fairly easy to read. It is less a reference book as it is written to help you understand how Java was intended to be used. It is a definite read for anyone working with Java for the long haul. If you are coming from the C++ world, there are good comparisons and contracts between C++ and Java as well. The only down side, some of the examples do get a bit long winded. A clean up in this area would have helped the book tremendously."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"This is a beginner addressed book on Java: if you are already skilled in programming with procedural or even OO language, you'll find this book very useful.The text is very simple and clear, the examples are incisive and at the end of each chapter you'll find a couple of exercises that can be very useful to focus the concepts.A \\"thinking in enterprise java\\" would be a great successor to this good book.5 stars!"},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"This book is the clearest text on what Java is and removes the scariness of programming in this language.

I have some background in C++, and this book is the perfect level."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"After reading (more than) 1/4 of the book, I find to be pretty useful (I'll try to keep updating this until I finish this book). It is something in the middle of a tutorial and an encyclopedia, and it can serve both as a reference and a text. However, I find it to be poorly organized:1. The basic (really BASIC) stuff almost always followed by some really obscure things (that sometimes end up being shouldn't be used at all). It could be better if the author separate every chapter into two, one basic and one advanced.2. The code samples. Oh the code samples. Please just give people some guidelines and let them try it out; throw in samples that are several pages long without any valuable comments/notes like this book are horrible practices. No matter you are writing real code or a book.3. Just another example: Inner interfaces before Inner classes. And the code sample there are littered with inner classes. Sometimes I think Bruce Eckel are trying to confuse us into believing that Java is much harder than it really is, so more people will buy his 1000-page book (I know probably he is not).But overall, this is a great book. However, I am trying to make notes, because I think it'd be terrible to try to find the piece of information I want from a 1000-page book after I finish it. Novices beware: finish a book or two (Head First or the official tutorial, even maybe Effective Java), then come back. This is the book that prevented me from learning Java as a undergrad."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"Although the book includes the main Java features and libraries (which is positive), I found it a bit boring and way too long. I think that for that amount of pages the reader should get much more insight.

It's the corporate-issued text. It's good but the section on JSP's and anything on JDBC is sorely lacking.

I am rating this book at 2 stars. While the book covers the topics and explains some important concepts in pretty good detail, the writing makes it a bit challenging. It is fairly confusing at times(it feels like a very experienced programmer forgetting to realize he is explaining topics to beginners), and the examples in the book are pretty bad. Maybe if you enjoy just long detailed explanations with mostly wasteful examples, the book would work well. However, for me, I enjoy a book with examples that are actually useful in some way, teaching you to think from there to understand how to move on with your own programs. The exercises in the book are also pretty bad, many times you are simply asked to do the EXACT same thing the previous example did(Which was a worthless example), or prove that something that is shown in an example previously works. There are some decent chapters in the book however, and I am not done with the entire thing. I enjoyed the exception, and strings chapter, but again, better examples and exercises would have been great. I feel like every chapter in this book starts out interesting and slowly begins to bore me. If I read this book for more than 45 minutes at a time I need a break and I feel ready to take a nap. I would definitely not recommend this to people for learning. The only way I can recommend this is if you have another book or 2 to read and use this book for deeper explanations after getting the topic from the other books. I would however highly recommend Head First Java for beginners."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"I don't like computer books that treat you like a kid: you need to go through chapters and chapters before the author starts challenging you.

If you don't have experience programming in some high level programming language (like C++, C#, VB.NET,... etc.) then this book is not for you. However, if you have done some programming with a high level language then you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Thinking in Java (4th Edition)","review":"This book - nor the author - needs any introduction for those who have read any of the previous editions of this book, or read other books written by Eckel (Thinking in C++ series). If you are new to Java - this is the book to get you going and get you started with the latest version of Java SE5 and 6. It covers everything, literally. The book is over 1400 pages, and it covers the JAVA programming language from the beginning to advanced topics such as parallel programming with threads and even GUI and user interface design. The topics are comprehensive and field with examples demonstrating the topic which is being discussed. The examples are relatively short in length, and get to the point. There is no one example that the author builds upon, making each chapter a discourse that can easily be read separately.There have been many important improvement and new features added to Java SE5 such as Generics and such things as Enums and better String manipulation (StringBuilder class being a prime example). Generics - or programming with Templates if you are a C++ programmer - are the most important and complicated addition to this version of Java and the author spends plenty of time explaining it. As you may very well know, programming with templates is a very challenging and somewhat daunting task in C++, and it does not get much easier in Java. The challenge with the Java programming language is that the language must be backwards compatible with the older versions of Java. This has caused the language designers to make some rather difficult choices of how generics are used in Java. Bruce covers the topic very well, and takes about a quarter of the text to talk about generics and containers in Java.Let's not forget the other things that make Java great; things such as its Object Oriented design and its ease of programming. The good-old topics such as polymorphism, interfaces, exception handling and I/O are covered in detail as one would expect. Improvements and additions are made to the topics are needed to cover advancements made to the language. Much of the semantics of C++ are slowly making it to Java; things such as Enums, formatting of the output as one does in printf(...). One of my favorites must be the concept of annotations, similar to pre-compile directives in C, and almost exactly the same as C#. Annotations are metadata that is added to your code which tags your code with information that you can use later. You can such things are suppressing warning messages, and denote deprecated methods and other user defined tags when needed.Threading and parallel programming, graphical user interface design and libraries, runtime type information and design patterns and their implementations mark some of the other topics that are covered throughout the book. As with his other books, you can download an electronic version of this book from Bruce Eckel's web site. All the source code is also provided, and tested with JSE5.This book marks another great achievement for Bruce - right next to his other books. Thinking in Java is easy to read, concise, complete and filled with examples and howto's. The author covers the latest advancements to the Java programming language, and does so with ease and clarity for the beginner to advanced readers."},{"Title":"Global Outrage: The Origins and Impact of World Opinion from the 1780s to the 21st Century","review":"Worldwide media coverage of disasters over the last 12months have shown everyone the power of the people when we all act together for or against something.Like so many others, I found the outpouring of real concern - as well as money and help - in the wake of the Tsunami last Boxing Day very moving to witness. This is what it might have been like had the anti-slavery campaign been conducted under the floodlights of today's global media. I am sure it would have created just this sort of dramatic groundswell of world opinion - and world outrage.Consequently, I jumped to buy this book when I came across it on Amazon, and was not disappointed. It is not a mushy overview of the subject, but a considered and very welcome historical introduction. I didn't find it a particularly difficult read, but I must admit to being very interested in the subject to start with, so I'm biased anyway. I think it offers a really interesting angle on and into some of the most important issues in world history.Where perhaps I disagreed with the author was when he questioned the impact of world opinion on some local customs - where there is imperviousness or deafness, I think this is often because at the local level \\"world opinion\\" is still hard to hear, for example against child labor.The technological faciltiies for sharing the information necessary to generate anything approximating world opinion are comparatively recent, but the author argues well that world opinion is already a powerful force in the world and in the big scheme of things this is very significant.While national governments may feel they have the international leverage or club membership to ignore world opinion and shrug off negative reports, I do agree with Stearns that at some point in the not too distant future financial and political forces will be brought into line with world opinion, and it will exert a very powerful force in even these areas, and he gives examples of where it has already.His suggestion to solicit research on world opinion to feed back into national the national arena would find a ready audience among the many who today feel disempowered or alienated from national politics by the sense that their views are not being listened to.A really good book on an important subject."},{"Title":"Global Outrage: The Origins and Impact of World Opinion from the 1780s to the 21st Century","review":"The title is misleading--Global Outrage is a bit strong--the book is actually a very long narrative about the emergence of \\"world opinion,\\" a phrase that appears innumberable times on every page. it is therefore a difficult read with no illustrations, charts, or tables. Somewhat tedious.Removing one star, then, the book is never-the-less quite interesting in its topic, which the author says has not been systematically reviewed in the past, and its findings. The author reviews the early days of anti-slavery, women's rights, labor rights, child labor, and the environment, concluding with the new campaigns against McDonald's wrappers, sweatshops, and Central American death squads.Among the gems that made the purchase and the effort worthwhile:1) World opinion, when it does mobilize, is generally right.2) World opinion is insufficient to deter a great power such as the USA from its chosen course, but it can impose great and lasting costs on that power as time goes on.3) World opinion is equally helpless against local customs and conditions, including the economic need for child labor and the deep cultural attachment to female mutilation in some regions.4) World opinion is a force that rises and ebbs, whose tools and techniques change across issues and times, but it is a constant force in that it exists and it can have an impact.5) World opinion has been reduced in force by the demise of the U.S. Information Agency and the once powerful labor unions whose AFL-CIO did so much to nurture labor rights around the globe. I had two thoughts as I contemplated this observation: first, that the US and the multinationals were short-sighted in ending the one and crushing the other--it is only now that we appreciate the intangible power for good they both represented; and second, as we grapple with the needs of Public Diplomacy and Strategic Communication, it is clear we need to reinvent both.6) The book excels at pointing out across several examples that world opinion is powered by information sharing. The most important information sharing is from the bottom up--from those who are persecuted to the outside world, and then back again in the form of petitions, letters, emails, etc. Information sharing is also important across national and cultural boundaries, helping raises expectations and standards as well as the costs of non-compliance with expectations.7) Finally, \\"world opinion\\" is put forth by the author as the means by which humanity agrees on common standards and expectations that co-exist with regional and cultural differences, and provide a shared vision for humanity.I found the author's concluding suggestions quite relevant to the global Information Operations campaign that the USA is about to embark upon: he suggested that we need to research as deeply and broadly as possible where popular opinion rests on a wide variety of issues, and use that as a benchmark for evaluating the acceptability and sustainability of governmental politices as well as corporate practices; and we should, at least once a decade, examine the organizations, tools, and techniques of \\"world opinion\\" to see who they are changing, and if they are changing in the composition of constituencies or the focus of effort.Concluding, the author is slightly optemistic about \\"world opinion\\" being a countervailing force against both militant Americans and radical Islamists, but he notes that \\"world opinion\\" is by no means a steady or assured power, only one that will have some form of influence, always varied.This is an academic work, with a good index, notes, and recommended readings for each chapter. It can be tough going, but all things considered, a useful reading on that intangible power called \\"world opinion.\\""},{"Title":"Canon Eos Rebel G: Eos 500 N (Magic Lantern Guides)","review":"I found that this book provided me with more useful information than the manual that came with the camera.

It is philosophy, it is theology, it is profound, intelligent, and inspiring. C.S. Lewis discusses the four loves - that is, Affection, Friendship, Eros, and Charity - in the most brilliant manner. Philosophy like this will attract the attention and interest of anyone, regardless of their prior opinion on philosophy. For once, I felt like it actually mattered; whereas most other philosophy works I have read seemed quite far away from the business of \\"living a good life\\", which was philosophy's first goal. This is practical, useful, and usable.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"C. S. Lewis is not only one of the 20th century's finest minds, he's also amazingly perceptive of human behavior. This well-written description explains so clearly the four kinds of love and with such accessible illustrations from real life. Most eye-opening for me was the chapter on \\"affection\\" where I began to understand for the first time why we moms think we are so misunderstood; in actuality, our \\"affection\\" (storge) for our family has gotten out of hand! You'll need to read in order to understand. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"CS Lewis does a wonderful job defining the four Greek words for Love. I would recommend this book most highly to the man (women are less likely to make this error) who thinks he needs no friends. Lewis shows the importance of friendship to a good life."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Supposedly this is the only existing audio of the voice of C.S. Lewis. Originally, I was hoping to find audio of his famous radio talks which later became his book \\"Mere Christianity\\". Even though this wasn't exactly what I was looking for, it is phenomenal to hear the voice of C.S. Lewis. The Four Loves should be recommended reading/listening for every engaged couple. For those of us who have been married for some time, his book sheds beautiful light on what our relationships should look like.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"In the introduction, Lewis discusses the differences between Gift-love and Need-love. He explains that although our Need-loves may be demanding and greedy, they are good and necessary because there is little danger that they can be made into gods. They are not near enough to God, by likeness, to be twisted like that. The highest does not exist without the lowest and a plant has roots below as well as sunlight above.Chapter 2: Likings And Loves For The Sub-Human, is a discussion of Pleasures of Need versus Pleasures of Appreciation. The types of love explored here include patriotism and love of nature. The next chapter: Affection, deals with the humblest love as Lewis calls it. He refers to literary works like The Wind In The Willows, Tristram Shandy, Emma and others to demonstrate the good and the bad manifestations of this kind of love.Friendship is explored in Chapter 4, again with reference to literature, including inter alia Ralph Waldo Emerson. This section includes an interesting discussion of the word \\"spiritual\\" - which is nowadays often used as substitute for \\"religious\\". Lewis reminds us that there is spiritual evil as well as spiritual good. The next chapter deals with Eros and he points out its aspects of glory and its playfullness, with reference to books like Anna Karenina and 1984, and certain passages from scripture.The final chapter is titled Charity and includes an interesting view of a passage from the Confessions by St Augustine. Lewis notes that the Gift-loves are natural images of God whilst the Need-loves are correlatives (not opposites) of the love that God is. When God is admitted to the human heart, He transforms our Gift-love and our Need-love. Conversion is necessary for our natural loves to enter the heavenly life.The main lesson of the book is the importance of Charity. Without it, all three of the aforementioned types of love may become distorted and even dangerous. Although this little book provides great insight, I have not found it to be as accessible as his masterpieceMere Christianityor his comforting book titledThe Problem of Pain.Sometimes his arguments are hard to follow and his views and examples of certain types of love are coloured by the English culture of the period in which he lived, thus not always universally applicable. The book would also have been a better reference source if an index had been provided. Besides these minor comlaints, The Four Loves is still a great read that provides valuable insight into the human condition."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"It was wonderful to actually hear Clive's actual voice and put a little more of the man behind all his words.I was left with the impression of an ascetic academic.

But you will be rewarded."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This book is short but covers the topic well. This is one of the most concise and clear books I have ever read. An excellent piece of writing."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I think most of the people who purchase Lewis' non-fiction do so because they are interested in his take on Christianity. One of the odd things about this book is that Lewis doesn't make it clear how he decided on these four Greek words. It turns out that the New Testament doesn't use the word eros or storge. This means that the New Testament usage is actually closer to colloquial English usage that you might guess from this book. I assume he chose these words because classical Greek philosophers classified love in this four-fold way.When Lewis discusses friendship in this book, he gives it a rather odd definition that no longer seems appropriate in today's world, and probably even in his time almost no one except a university professor have. Lewis' concept is that a friend is someone with whom you share an arcane interest. It is an interest so rare that when you meet someone with a similar interest, your reaction is \\"What? You too?\\" Now that most people live in large cities and many have access to the internet, finding someone with an interest in say Wagnerian Opera isn't nearly so hard as it might have been for Lewis, who hated London and large cities. I think for most urban dwellers today, the people whom we consider friends are not so much those with whom we share a rare hobby, but people whose company we like and whose lives we are interested in hearing about.If you are a hard core Lewis fan, you will probably enjoy this book, but if you are new to Lewis, you might have more fun reading something else like Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, or The Great Divorce."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Far more than merely a &quot;book on tape&quot;, these tapes contain a series of lectures which (I'm guessing) were delivered before the writing of the book &quot;The Four Loves&quot;. The words of the book are more polished and the ideas more expanded but I actually find these talks more accessible than the book itself, although both are very fine. These tapes are also the only professional recordings of the actual voice of C.S. Lewis which we still have, and as such are a priceless treasure. His voice sounds a little like Winston Churchill's and his droll sense of humor sparkles throughout. Though not a Christian myself, I find a lot of inspiration in Lewis's thoughts. I know that whenever I reread any of his books from now on, I will hear his rich, warm, dry baritone voice in my head."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"C.S. Lewis has made a priceless analysis of love. My experience of reading his book &quot;The Four Loves&quot; (friendship, affection, eros and charity) and comparing it with other books on the subject, is that Lewis uses a fresh (to me) approach. It is like looking through a beautiful diamond. I have observed the diamond several times before, through people like Gerald May, Donald Goergen etc, but have not looked through that particular face of the diamond's prism that Lewis shows.I liked &quot;friendship&quot; where the love of a particular subject can bring two or more people together in a love. I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Eros&quot;. Lewis calls that &quot;love&quot; that is purely genital sex, and the love that leads up to this, &quot;Venus&quot;. He says that Venus is part of Eros. &quot;We must not be totally serious about Venus, and if we are serious about her we can do harm to our humanity&quot;. And &quot;Venus is a mocking, mischievous spirit, far more elf than deity, and makes game of us. When all external circumstances are the fittest for her service she will leave one or both lovers totally indisposed for it. When every overt act is impossible and even glances cannot be exchanged - in trains, in shops and at interminable parties - she will assail them with all her force. An hour later, when time and place agree, she will have mysteriously disappeared, perhaps from only one of them. ......&quot;In Eros at times we seem to be flying; Venus gives us the sudden twitch that reminds us we are really captive balloons ..... on one side akin to the angels, and on the other to tom cats. .... St. Francis called his body 'brother ass'..... It is impossible for anyone in his right senses to either revere or hate a donkey. An ass is a useful, sturdy, lazy, obstinate, patient, loveable and infuriating beast; deserving now the stick and now a carrot; both pathetically and absurdly beautiful. So the body. .... The fact that we have bodies is the oldest joke there is&quot;.Lewis goes on to emphasise that none of the &quot;natural&quot; loves can survive without agape love, that is the love that comes from God, which Lewis calls &quot;Charity&quot;."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I have now read this book three times - twice for school courses and once for personal reading. With each reading I find that a deeper understanding of the subject is obtained. This book is a great examination of the human heart, the different types of loves and how they each interact. Lewis examines: Affection, Friendship, Eros, and Charity. In each of the first three categories he shows both good and bad examples of that form of love, or in other words, the love and the perversion of that love.Lewis states: \\"Let us make no mistakes. Our Gift-loves are really God-Like, and among our Gift-loves those are most God-Like which are most boundless and unwearied in giving. All the things the poets say about them are true. Their joy, their energy, their patience, their readiness to forgive, their desire for the good of the beloved - all this is a real and all but adorable image of the Divine life.\\" p.9 This is the ultimate in love; this is when our love comes closest to God's Love.Lewis gives us a great study in love, what love is, what it means to truly love and some of the pitfalls of love gone askew. This book will help you live and love better."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I wish I could thank C.S. Lewis for writing this book! Not only was it a joy to read, but it has helped change my life as a person and as a Christian. Those who are not Christians would even enjoy this book! His analysis of the different types of love from an academic and a theological viewpoint is very gentle to the soul and easy on the mind. I didn't expect it, but reading this book caused me to examine the types of love in my life, both in giving and receiving, and after doing so, lessened so much of the heartache I had before reading its pages.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wonders what love is, or if love is even worth having."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Many individuals think that Mere Christianity is the flagship work of Lewis, which is understandable, however I really believe Lewis is at his best in this book.His overall tone and voice throughout the entire book convinces you of the material and points without ever really seeming like Lewis is even really trying to convince you of anything but is just expressing deep truths that we've always known to be true but never really discovered them.It's easy to see how Lewis has influenced so many authors and thinkers over the years and continues to be an influential thinker and writer well into the 21st century.If you look at some of the new writers of the 21st century who will probably shape Christianity and the literary world themselves, they have each been influenced by C.S. Lewis.If you've never read Lewis or have only read the Narnia series, you must begin diving into his non-fiction books because he is a well of wisdom and insight that will be around forever, as a writer and as an influence on other writers.This book will help reveal to you the many different aspects of love in life."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"There have been many good things and helpful reviews already written about this book so there's no reason for me to go on about how wonderful and insightful it is. My comments are more directly related to those who have a wish (or are assigned) to read Aristotle's work &quot;The Nichomachean Ethics&quot;. I read the Ethics for a philosophy discussion class my freshman year and was intrigued by mush of what Aristotle had to say about love and human behavior. While it is a very insightful work, the Ethics is extremely difficult to read, and takes much time and pastience.About a month after completing the Ethics, I happened to pick up Lewis's &quot;The Four Loves&quot; in my college's bookstore, and I couldn't put it down. What surprised me most upon reading it, however, was that much of Lewis's understanding of the human loves came directly from Aristotle. I went back and reread the Ethics and found (not surprisingly since Lewis was a classics scholar) that for his understanding of friendly and passionate love (for Aristotle philos and eros), Lewis's arguments followed Aristotle's very closely, and were much more clear and easy to understand. On top of this, his additions of affectionate love and agape or godly love (a Greek thought to be sure, but not in Aristotle's time), expanded upon the notions of love and offered a fuller treatment than Aristotle.I say all this not to disuade anyone from reading Aristotle or thinking that Lewis was an Aristotle knock-off, on the contrary, both these these works should be read, and in opinion my opinion they complement each other very well and aid the reader in more fully understanding both works: understanding Aristotle because Lewis presents many of his same arguments only more clearly, and understanding Lewis by seeing the evolution and expansion of his thought from the Greek concepts.And even if you don't feel like tackling Aristotle, &quot;The Four Loves&quot; is a work worth reading in and of itself (just don't think that you can get away with substituting this work for the Ethics, since the Ethics goes far beyond a discussion of love)."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Lewis' genius in all his writings shows forth as piercing insight in warm and delightful prose, and he brilliantly succeeds in this book. There has been more written on love than perhaps any other topic, but the vast majority is mindless drivel or hormone driven blindness or sentimental fluff or philosphical madness. Lewis will have none of that: he sets forth the nature and varieties of human and divine love, and through his keen insight allows us to see ourselves, others, and God better.His basic franework for the book is looking at love through the four different kinds of love that the Greeks defined. He devotes chapters to the \\"natural\\" human loves of storge, the love of family affection; philia, the love of friendship; eros, the love of sexual love and romance. He looks at their characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. He also looks at love through a three fold division between need-love, gift-love, and the love of appreciation.Lastly, he examines agape, the selfless love of charity. In some of the most beautiful passages he ever wrote Lewis describes how agape perfects our natural loves and prepares us both to truly love God and be like Him. \\"When we see the face of God we shall know that we have always known it.\\"Leading a life marked by love is not a matter of just reading a book, but understanding the nature of God and the nature of love. This book is welcome wisdom in leading such a life."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Read the book for yourself! It has everything about love in it. For me, it was a step in the healing process. The world confused me about my sexuality and the types of love. This book cleared the questions and has equipped me with the knowledge to press on as a child of God."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"In general I have been pleased w/ Kindle books, this book edition is unfortunately terrible. It is more that just punctuation errors, there are parts of sentences missing. I am very disappointed that such a fine book is unreadable in the kindle edition."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"C.S. Lewis wrote this book late in his life after he had experienced love with a colleague in writing. He gives sound advice that I believe applies to a broader base than his usual Christian readership. The four loves are: Affection, Eros, Friendship, and Charity. Each type of love has a chapter dedicated to a fuller explanation.My favorite section is the one he wrote on Friendship. I think he is honest about limitations we place on who becomes our friends. Many believe any two people can become good friends, when in reality, this is just not so. Friends are people who share some vision or passion in life. That vision or passion is the cement of the common bond. Lewis had deep friendships with interesting people, such as Tolkien. He even elaborates on his own experiences with such companions.Charity is the true form of love. Charity is the deepest form of giving our feeling, freedom, and even our very selves, to each other and finally, to God, whom Lewis calls \\"Love Himself.\\" There is wisdom in his admonition that love is not easy or cheap. Work, loss, and sacrifice often accompany the application of true love, which is charity.Unlike other works, such as \\"Miracles\\" or \\"Mere Christianity\\" where logic sets the primary pace, \\"The Four Loves\\" is a book where Lewis brings much of his experience to light. This is not, however, to say that Lewis does not apply logic to experience. Rather, Lewis uses logic to makes sense of experiences in his past to try and uncover truths about love.In writing about love, Lewis articulates some significant moral, social, and psychological truths. Most importantly, he shows that love itself is not God. Love exalted to divinity becomes a \\"demon,\\" as he quotes one of his contemporaries. Love is only a part of the greatness of our complex lives, not the full of it. \\"The Four Loves\\" is another insightful masterpiece by C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I only read the chapter on Friendship, so my thoughts are limited to that. I rated this chapter two stars because Lewis defines friendships as sharing a common interest (side-by-side) as compared to marriage as face-to-face. This seems too black and white.In looking at it from a Christian point of view, Jesus never experienced marriage and yet seemed to have much face-to-face communication and relationship with his disciples and even with the pharisees. They didn't seem to have too much in common. Jesus' disciples came from all different careers and socio-economic backgrounds and yet they hung out as friends.I understand Lewis' point in that the level of commitment and closeness in a marriage should be unmatched, however it would seem dishonest and unloving of us to have friends and yet not be able to communicate face-to-face in helping build each other up, speaking the truth in love, encouraging one another, and so on.Perhaps the chapters I didn't read make up for the chapter on Friendship."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This book has proven to be useful for the class I am using for.

I thought the author had some well thought-out ideas but meandered on the supporting arguments. The main idea being the ancient Greeks had four words for love depending on the type of love. C.S.Lewis analyses these types of love; Affection, Friendship Eros, and Charity. I suspect most readers will be surprised when they read what is included in each classification. I would recommend an audio version of book. The supporting arguments are better suited to the ears, which are more adept and can selectively tune-in. I plan on reading other books by C.S. Lewis.

Lewis is a great writer and one of the great accessible Christian minds but I think he got lost in his own theory in this one. This book has some great ideas and is very clarifying in the many senses of Christian love but Lewis gets very verbose and muddy in his heavy essay writing in the Four Loves. I think Lewis does better when he suggests or leads the reader to answers rather than writing and supporting his philosophy and theology in a straightforward manner. The Four Loves is still a worthwhile read but for a great Christain C.S. Lewis read try the Screwtape Letters first."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"There are two types of love... true love and mundane love, mundane love is mixed and can be given, taken for selfish reasons, true love however has no shadow of selfishness, but is selfless in the presence of the object of its/his/her lover. infact true love empties itself into the person or thing it is loving. just as some of us empty ourselves into the posts we put on amazon. And in emptying ourselves we are filled with the satisfaction that we may have shared a little understanding (truth).i have given this book three stars because this is such a monumental subject lewis is writing about, and also because it is very honest. he is clearly wracked by certain doubts as pertains to his somewhat 'evangelical' slant which gives so many simple, though often emotionally unsatisfying answers. this is a christian exploring deeper than the answers he has been giving in his previous books. Having met Joy Davidson in September 1952, this book was published in 1960, but he is certainly asking some very difficult questions for which a simple answer just wont do. not knowing the history of lewis i can see that he was brave enough at the time of this book to confront certain loose ends in his once over-simplistic theology. [on page 154 in the chapter 'charity']some excerpts from p 154: Harper Collins 2002 edn: \\"God carried in his hand a little object like a nut, and that nut was 'all that is made'(Julian of Norwich). God, who needs nothing, loves into existence wholly 'superfluous' creatures in order that He may love and perfect them... the buzzing cloud of flies about the cross...[and] If i may dare the biological image, God is a 'host' who deliberately creates His own parasites causes us to be that we may exploit and 'take advantage of' Him. Hererin is love. (are these not the views of some, and with these 'some', he is struggling in the chapter on charity, clear as crystal. infact this whole chapter is a struggle. i find it sad some have said, he denied his faith at the end, no, he found it at the end!)those of us who have watched and loved the film \\"shadow-lands\\", though i hear it is not an entirely accurate representation of things, can see something of the struggle that was going on inside his mind as to just what is 'love' and what love demands of us. his future wife, Joy, a christian herself, and a divorcee was a very profound thinker and challenged the way he thought, right into the marrow of his bones, to the core of his heart and soul. his simple little packaged answers to difficult questions, of which at one time he was so sure all came tumbling down when joy was diagnosed with cancer. he married her shortly before her death... much to the horror of a traditional and evangelical church. one just did not marry a divorcee in those days! in the film, perhaps the most moving scene is when he admits... \\"i just dont have any answers anymore\\".the four loves are the four greek words: agape (charitas), filia, eros and sorge. the one we are interested in here encompases and enlivens the other three. the one is \\"charitas\\"/\\"agape\\", we do not have a new testament in the original hebrew sadly, but it is in my mind a certainty that the word 'chesed' or 'hesed' is synonymous with the greek usage 'agape' and that the word charitas is directly derived from chesed. this chesed or agape represents true love, or as the jews understand it 'loving kindness'. loving kindness is the force behind creation and salvation in the mind and heart of the jew. this too would have been the word in jesus that propelled him and moved him to will and act as he does and did. he would have grown up a witness of the chesed between his mother and father, and the chesed he shared with his parents and friends, even his enemies and the chesed between God and his chosen people.as christians though, we believe that Jesus was and is the personification of true love. that is... Jesus is Chesed, Jesus is Agape, God is Love. we christians believe that it was Jesus the Word that created all (\\"by him, all things were made\\"), we also believe that it is Jesus who will redeem all. \\"for he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the 'whole' world.\\" (Authorised King James version-New Testament). therefore Jesus is chesed. it is only sad that we cannot read the original hebrew to see this word inscribed before our very eyes. not only is chesed a word, it encapsulates the true nature and being of God. I wonder if the cHasidic Jews realize just how awesome their nameing, and the 'full' meaning of this name chesed.the awesome, and i have to use this word awesome again and again, christian revelation is that God is Love. God is Chesed/Agape. some will frown at this... \\"is not chesed, albeit the highest of all Gods attributes, only an attribute?\\" No, we as christians believe that loving kindness is God. And what is agape? agape is chesed! and what is chesed? chesed is 'true' love, and what is true love? true love is 'loving kindness'.lewis points towards a jewish translation when he calls agape 'gift love', this is because, chesed is a giving, merciful love without strings attached. it shows and shares itself with both the good and the bad, the obedient and the disobedient. it is a free gift. Lewis pointing at a christian understanding speaks of 'Love Himself'. the personification of Love, being God. (one person within three).it is from God that all good procedes, gods love is found in all and therefore all are God, love makes divine, that which is not divine, thus speaks the language of love, without judgement. the language of logic and reason says: \\"ah yes, but God is 'that' i am\\". correct, the truth however always resides in a paradox. that God is all and yet perfect in and as one. love says all is one, reason says one is one. love says everywhere, reason says over there. love knows all, reason knows nothing. or love knows all, reason knows very little. logic, analysis and interpretation can only take us so far, the reason has its limits, we must be prepared to open our hearts. chesed is more than an attribute, chesed is one, and makes all things one. its tendency is to draw together and not to separate.this is the earth-mending teaching of the early church, but not always remembered. that God is love/agape/chesed. lets try not to forget it, so please help us dear father in heaven to remember this and live it by your chesed/yourself.perhaps the most significant thing CS Lewis ever said was on the last page of his final book - \\"A Grief Observed\\" (here on earth), and that is that he had a direct experience of Joy's mind touching his... it was an experience of mind that was he said correspondent with love. mind is love, love is mind. pragmatism (mind) and altruism interface with love and its fruits. the mind of love, the heart of love. most doctors either have a good bedside manner, thus facilitating the individuals own inner resources to heal, or a good practical manner, thus healing through objective means. the ultimate doctor is one who combines both bedside manner and mind... a snow flake paradgm. one may become a buddha, or a doctor, whatever his slant, but he should aim for union of heart and mind. There has always been the ages old debate, is it developing the mind or developing the heart that will lead to ascendance? actually one should seek to develop both.with loveing kindness, by loveing kindness, from, snow-flake. xxx"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"The author is one of the most important theologians of the 20th century, although his scholarly discipline was literature. He examines four main types of love, with special concentration on two types of love he calls \\"Gift-love\\" and \\"Need-love.\\"Early in the book, Lewis identifies the humblest and most widely diffused of the loves, that is, the loves and likings at the sub-human level. Following an examination of sub-human love, he addresses a love that he calls \\"affection.\\" Affection comes from the Greek love word storge.The third chapter is devoted to friendship love, from the Greek work philia. This friendship love is the least of the natural loves, \\"the least instinctive organic, biological, gregarious, and necessary\\" (58). Friendship should be distinguished from community love, because communities require cooperation. Friendship love by contrast is free from instinct, free from duty, and free from the need to be needed. Following an examination of friendship, Lewis addresses eros. By eros Lewis refers to \\"the love in which lovers are in,\\" i.e., romantic love.In the book's final chapter Lewis addresses charity. Charity is \`Gift-love' and the primal \`Gift-love' comes from the divine energy. While Lewis claims that \\"to love at all is to be vulnerable\\" (121), he also claims that God is self-sufficient. \\"In God there is no hunger that needs to be filled, only plenteousness that desires to give. The doctrine that God was under no necessity to create is not a piece of dry scholastic speculation. It is essential\\" (126). Also, \\"God, who needs nothing, loves into existence, holy, superfluous creatures in order that He may love and perfect them\\" (127).After God loves into existence wholly superfluous creatures, God implants in those creatures both Gift-loves and Need-loves. Gift-love comes by grace and we call it charity. God also gives a supernatural Need-love of God and a supernatural Need-love of other creatures. It is through these two gifts that creatures have a longing for God and a love for others."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Doing a book review on CS Lewis' \\"The Four Loves\\" brings forth an entire new meaning on 'a writer's block'. To expound this extraordinary Lewis' work on the four New Testament Greek \\"love\\" words - storge (natural affection), philia (friendship, love), eros (attraction, sexual love), and agape (love, charity) - amounts to nothing more than a leaky version of the Cliff Notes at best. There are Lewis' scholars who could do far more justice to this work than I.The long and short of \\"The Four Loves\\" is this. The three \\"loves\\" (storge, philia, and eros) are stemmed from agape (God's perfect love). Each is fractured and flawed since the Fall. Underlying all that we do, in both good and not so good, are these shades of loves. All are a fragment of and a divagation from the origin. The agape. Our forms of love have fallen short and are in need of mending. Only God's love mends.If your affectionate other were to ask after a romantic candlelit dinner, \\"What now my love?\\" Don't sing. Lean forward and cup her hand, you segue to say, \\"Eros makes promises. Romance must die in marriage, and that marriage requires affection.\\" Saying this may or may not take you to places you've never been - for the better or for the worst. Your look of love, however, could only change for the better.

Lewis discusses Love, with the ancient wisdom of experience, as well as a lifetime of thought in a uniquely loving way. He does not sugar coat love, and that is loving indeed.Full recommendation!"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Book Summary (From the Back Cover)In this candid, wise, and warmly personal book, C.S. Lewis describes the four basic kinds of human love - affection, friendship, erotic love and the love of God. He explores the possibilities and problems of the love between parents and children; the love of men for other men and women for women; the love of men and women for each other; and the love of God that enriches all love. Lewis also explores the questions of sex, possessiveness, jealousy, pride, false sentimentality, good and bad manners in loving, and the need for more laughter between lovers. There are risks that accompany the rewards of love, the author cautions, but he recommends taking them, since \\"hell is the only place outside heaven where we can be safe from the dangers of love.\\"Book HighlightsWhile this is considered to be a minor work of C.S. Lewis, it nevertheless treats the broad subject of love in a concise, yet profound way. Lewis begins the book with an introduction to the subject where he comments on the differences between what he calls \\"Need-love\\" and \\"Gift-love\\". He describes the nuances of the two terms and how they will relate to future chapters that deal with affection, friendship, erotic love and the love of God. He concludes, \\"The human loves can be glorious images of Divine love. No less than that: but also no more - proximities of likeness which in one instance may help, and in another may hinder, proximity of approach. Sometimes perhaps they have not very much to do with it either way\\".In the opening chapter \\"Liking and Loves for the Sub-human\\", Lewis makes a further distinction between the types of loves. He says, \\"Need-love cries to God from our poverty; Gift-love longs to serve, or even to suffer for, God; Appreciative love says: \\"We give thanks to thee for thy great glory.\\" Lewis touches on the love of nature and the love of country as non-personal loves. The love of country consists of different elements: the love of home, love of the deeds of heroism, the belief that our nation is inherently superior to all others and the sense of obligation that our nation can help and ought to help other nations lift themselves up. Finally the love of country means that we love our country simply because it is our country. In each type of love, Lewis presents his criticism.In the next chapter, Lewis treats affection. He notes both the good side and the bad side of affection. If we are too affectionate toward others, then we may idolize them or seek to control them. It could also result in co-dependency. If we are too affectionate toward the things of the world it can result in idolatry. Lewis comments, \\"They may work for ill as well as for good. By itself, left simply to follow its own bent, it can darken and degrade human life\\". The good side is that affection is natural and normal and a gift of God to his creatures. It enriches our appreciation for the world and for others. It helps us to show affectionate love towards all kinds of people and things. In fact, a sign of maturity is the ability to appreciate such a variety.On Friendship, Lewis says that, \\"very few modern people think Friendship a love of comparable value or even a love at all\\". Friendship seems to be marginalized by modern men. Lewis touts both the benefits and dangers of friendship. One very profound point of friendship is that, \\"in each of my friends there is something that only some other friend can fully bring out\\". In other words, we grow in friendship when we have a group of friends. Seeing how our friends react to others, helps us to appreciate them more. Some other points he brings out are that friendship is strengthened by adversity and friendship must be centered around a common interest. One danger Lewis points out is the tendency to form exclusive groups or cliques. This must be guarded against. Lewis concludes the chapter, \\"They are, like all beauties, derived from Him, and then, in a good Friendship, increased by Him through the friendship itself, so that it is His instrument for creating as well as for revealing\\".On Eros or \\"being in love\\" or romantic love, Lewis makes the point that Eros may or may not be accompanied by Venus (sexual expression). He writes that Eros is exclusive, \\"Now Eros makes a man really want, not a woman, but one particular woman. In some mysterious but quite indisputable fashion the lover desires the Beloved herself, not the pleasure she can give\\". He notes the danger of Eros in that one may try to constantly to please one's spouse to the point of being too preoccupied. The Beloved could possibly supplant the place of God in our life if we are not careful. Lewis says that there is both a grandeur and terror of love. There is a very real risk of rejection. It is a mutual revelation of ourselves and therefore inherently risky. As far as the danger of Eros, Lewis says that the real danger is that we will idolize Eros itself. It is the idea that Eros can be used as an excuse for unfaithfulness. True love makes vows, so the danger is that we will break our vows to our Beloved.Finally on Charity, Lewis Lewis writes profoundly, \\"Do not let your happiness depend on something you may lose. If love is to be a blessing, not a misery, it must be for the only Beloved who will never pass away\\". It is a point well taken. Charity is the highest love because it is the one that lasts into eternity. Lewis goes on, \\"We begin at the real beginning, with love as the Divine energy. This primal love is Gift-love. In God there is no hunger that needs to be filled, only plenteousness that desires to give\\". This is a crucial point. God is the source of all loves. His love is a part of himself, one of his many perfections. He has many perfections which we only faintly understand, but love is not the only one.Lewis relates Divine Love to human, natural loves. He says, \\"In such a case the Divine Love does not substitute itself for the natural - as if we had to throw away our silver to make room for the gold. The natural loves are summoned to become modes of Charity while also remaining the natural loves they were\\". So there is room for the natural loves, as long as we keep in mind that God's Divine Love is the source and justification for them.Book RecommendationIt probably goes without saying that I would recommend this book. Lewis' insights into the subject are many. He helps us to put love in its many variations in its proper context and expression. Our natural inclinations to love are gifts of God. They are graces or gifts to men. He calls us to a higher Love. A Love that is eternal. A Love that purifies all the other natural loves."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"C.S. Lewis never ceases to amaze me. He makes understandable Christianity in the culture in which we live. He takes my breath away in how simple he can make what seems beyond comprehension.

I've read it before. It's worth reading again."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"THE FOUR LOVES (1960), by C.S. Lewis, has enough thought provoking ideas for all of one's lifetime. Lewis is the author of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and was a close friend of J.R.R. Toliken, the novelist who wrote THE LORD OF THE RINGS, when both were on the faculty of Oxford. This little book by Lewis is a lesser known, but perhaps his best advice for all generations, which he also gave as a lecture. One can hear the audio version of his presentation which is available from Amazon.com. It provides a lasting memory of his ideas with special emphasis on the words in proper spoken English. In this account of \\"love\\" he distinguishes between likings and loves for the sub-human and then goes on to describe four human characteristics of love with their separate Greek meanings as: Affection (storge); Friendship (philia); Romance (eros) ; and Charity, unconditional love (agape). Perhaps the love to seek -and is almost within grasp - is friendship, which was also the subject of the 44 B.C. classic by Cicero, \\"De Amicitia\\" (friendship, based on the Latin word for love, amo, amare, amatus). In reading Lewis's categories of love with perseverance and refection one can hope for a friendship, as Cicero extols, that can exceed storge and eros, and might be a basis for discovering agape, the most difficult love to find. This C.S. Lewis lecture together with Cicero's essay provides material for a life time of reflection and aspiration.H. Nardi , 25 December 2012"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"If you ever get the chance to read this book, do! it's amazing how c.s. lewis breaks down and analyzes the four loves. very very interesting if you ever need a good read!"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Within this work, Mr. Lewis is quick to point out the inherent difficulty with regard to the concept of love facing individuals whose native tongue is English. That is, it is easily recognized that there exists an extreme deficit when one applies the same word to describe the sentiment shared with one's spouse, as well as their favorite food. In such extreme cases of difference in terms of the word's application, clarification is hardly needed and might be written off as an embellishment about that which one feels about, say, strawberries or chocolate. However, other instances are more difficult to write off as a poor choice of words; such as, love for friends, family, a spouse, and God. One must surely agree that the sentiment in each of these instances of love can exist and be experienced in significantly different ways. While love is the umbrella under which all of these sentiments rest, they are, as far as most people can tell, very different things. That being said, it is lucky for the reader that Mr. Lewis, almost immediately, circumvents the language barrier and begins to illustrate the foundational understanding which must be apparent for further exploration of the concepts of love to proceed. For those who have struggled with this, even the simplest concept of love's significance, as this reviewer has, the first chapter alone is worth the price of this work's purchase.Building upon a necessary base of knowledge, Lewis begins to explore the nature of love beginning with that love which might be the gray area between the words love and like, or either of the two, as spoken in the English language. Lewis continues his endeavor by tackling what people often consider the more significant forms of love such as friendship, erotic love, and the love of and for God. While no attempt will be made here to convey the significance of the final chapter regarding actual Love in fear of diluting a brilliant message, each of the chapters leading up to that point share common threads. That is, Mr. Lewis illustrates the difficulty which can be had with love in any form if left to our own devices. This illustration is achieved in the author's typical fashion of profound analogies and appeals to common experiences. One can be certain that while this recognition of the volatility of human love is of extreme importance, it is the overriding concept that only by surrendering these loves to Love that one can achieve happiness, solace, and purity in Love which makes this work unquestionably valuable to those that are fortunate enough to read it."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"\\"The Four Loves\\" is one of C.

In a brief 156-pages, Lewis captures the essences of \\"AFEC\\": Affection, Friendship, Eros, and Charity.From the Koine Greek of the Bible, affection is \\"storge,\\" friendship is \\"phileo,\\" romantic and/or sexual love is \\"eros,\\" and charity or love for God is \\"agape\\" (self-giving, unselfish, other-centered, grace love).Lewis' remarkable achievement is his integrative, balanced, and holistic approach to love. Many theologian-philosophers tend to emphasize one (\\"agape\\"), demonize another (\\"eros\\"), minimize a third (\\"phileo\\"), and misunderstand a fourth (\\"storge\\").Lewis not only correctly interprets all four loves while giving each their validity and importance in their respective spheres; he does so in his renowned pithy, provocative, philosophical, and practical style.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \\"Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,\\" \\"Soul Physicians\\" and \\"Spiritual Friends.\\""},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This is the finest book I have ever read on love outside of theBible. Lewis' insights on friendship define what true friendship is and cautions us that those who we call friends for lack of a better word have value and admonishes us not \\"to desparage silver because it is not gold\\". He encourages us that if natural love is to see eternity, it must be committed to Charity Himself. An excellent book and profitable to everyone."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"While the English language includes the four types of love under the heading of one word, the original languages of the Bible are more specific in distinguishing between the particular kind of love discussed in the Scriptures. The four loves Lewis covers in this book are: affection, friendship, eros, and charity.In the early part of Genesis God tells us it is not good for the man to be alone. Eve was created to meet this need. Anyone who denies this reality is denying the truth of what God said. We are not just spiritual beings, we live in a body and we need other people.Consider one's love for his or her home country. Lewis argues that this is a legitimate love. In citing Chesterton, he explains that a man not wanting his country to be ruled by foreigners is similar to him not wanting his house to be burned down in that the reasons are too many to list.Affection comes from the Greek word &quot;storge&quot; and refers to the kind of love found between a parent and child or child and parent.Friendship, he says, is the least jealous of the four types of loves. He makes an observation worth noting, &quot;those who are going nowhere can have no fellow-travelers.&quot; Frienship strengthens us.Eros is sensual love. The stimuli gains and sustains our attention. We become totally focused on the object drawing us toward it. He reminds us that St. Francis did not respect this part of his humanity, calling his body &quot;Brother Ass.&quot;Charity is selfless love. &quot;We were made for God. Only by being in some respect like Him, only by being a msnifestation of His beauty, lovingkindness, wisdom or goodness, has any earthly Beloved excited our love,&quot; Lewis writes.Jack Lewis helps us to gain a clearer understanding of the different ways we love. This book isn't just for the sake of acquiring more knowledge, it helps you to express your love more fully after having gained that understanding."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This book was first published in 1960, and as such, I'm sure a lot of people might say \\"Hah. It is out of date. We've learned a lot about love since then!\\"To which I would reply, \\"No we haven't. There's nothing new, really.\\"The subject matter of this book is just as applicable today as it was back then. And just as applicable as it was fifty years before Lewis wrote it, because it deals with timeless meanings and principles of love, albeit, from a decidedly Christian perspective.He begins by distinguishing what he calls Need-love (based on need, such as the love of a child for its mother) from Gift-love (selfless, the kind of love we attribute to God, or to a loving father), and then divides love into four categories, based on the four Greek words for love.Each word is treated in its own chapter.Affection (storge) is described as fondness through familiarity, especially between family members or people who have otherwise found themselves together by chance.Friendship (philia) is a stronger bond that exists between people who share a common interest or activity. I love the part where he said In this kind of love, as Emerson said, Do you love me? means Do you see the same truth? - Or at least, \\"Do you care about the same truth?\\" The man who agrees with us that some question, little regarded by others, is of great importance, can be our Friend. He need not agree with us about the answer.This kind of Friendship goes beyond mere Companionship. It's like a celebration of common ground, between people of similar interests and compatibility.Then there is the Greek word Eros, which is love in the sense of 'being in love'. This is distinct from sexuality, which Lewis calls Venus, although he does discuss sexual activity and its spiritual significance in both a pagan and a Christian sense. He warns that if Eros is elevated to the status of a god, it has a tendency to self-destruct or at least not deliver what was promised or expected. However, he praises (to the rooftops, really) the proper (indispensable) function of Eros and Venus!Charity (agape) is a love towards one's neighbour which does not depend on any loveable qualities that the object of love possesses. In this final chapter, Lewis presents quite a challenging and well-reasoned argument against living a life of \\"self-invited and self-protective lovelessness.\\"Overall, I think it a tremendously relevant book.In probably the most radical statement found in the entire book, he says \\"The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.\\""},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"There is really some dynamite material in here. C.S. Lewis explains in typical style and clarity all that is right and wrong with love. Dealing with affection (that warm, fuzzy, it-sure-bugs-me-how-you-twiddle-your-thumbs-but-it's-endearing-in-a-funny-sort-of-a-way type of love you experience after knowing people for a while), friendship, Eros (romantic love, not to be confused with Venus (sexual passion), which is only an element of Eros), and charity, the highest of the loves, Lewis explains the glory of each, and the temptations that arise because of the glory. Much of the book is just hilarious, since he points out little faults common to us all, and he makes it easy to laugh at ourselves. But he also offers much practical advice, good for understanding and enriching our relationships.Main thesis of the book: If you make love God, love becomes a demon. Love is a great gift from God, but because love is so lovely, it's a great temptation to serve it as the whole end and purpose of life. But if this occurs, love becomes a demon, and turns against you. Keep God at the forefront of your mind and your relationships, and love can be kept rich and sweet in its proper perspective."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I approached this writing with some prior experience and formal study of love. Consequently, I cannot judge with complete objectivity, how one might feel about The Four Loves if this was one of their first exposures to the concept. The book made perfect sense to me and was as captivating as any of Mr. Lewis's writings. While the book was not entirely ordered in the way that I would have liked, he adds his own concepts to the Greek notions of agape, storge, philos and eros. These additions help to explain the Greek notions to the modern reader and are at least as meaningful. They even suggest further ways in which to better understand that extremely nebulous word. He sees much farther in matters of loves than the typical modern writer. His knowledge of Renaissance and Medieval literature and history gives him a deep well of insights from which to draw and reveals how deficient the English language is in some basic areas of humanity despite having over 1/2 million words.Lewis points us clearly in the direction of Christianity and the necessary selflessness it prescribes. Until we are truly selfless in attitude and not only in deed, we miss the Christian point of view.I like the way he makes me think. This was my second Lewis book, after Screwtape, and it firmed my resolve to read more."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This book will tell you. It discusses in depth the four different kinds of love. It's classic Lewis; it inspires the reader and delivers deep insight in laymen's terms.The text is a treasure chest embedded with jewels like this:\\"God, who needs nothing, loves into existence wholly superfluous creatures in order that He may love and perfect them. He creates the universe already foreseeing - or should we say \\"seeing\\"? there are no tenses in God - the buzzing cloud of flies about the cross, the flayed back pressed against the uneven stake, the nails driven through the mesial nerves, the repeated incipient suffocation as the body droops, the repeated torture of the back and arms as it is time after time, for breath's sake, hitched up. If I may dare the biological image, God is a \\"host\\" who deliberately creates His own parasites; cause us to be that we may exploit and \\"take advantage of\\" Him. Herein is love. This is the diagram of Love Himself, the inventor of all loves.\\"In a word: beautiful."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I'm trying to read what should be an excellent book on my Kindle Reader on my iPhone 4.

It's about the true love, it's meanings, explanations and everything you need to know about many different kinds of love, such as love between friends, between man and woman, between parents and their kids etc. If you are interested in the subject, don't think about buying it. Simply but that book!"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Though C. S. Lewis was a bachelor most of his life, he never lived alone. And the people with which he shared his home were far from perfect. In one of his letters, he writes that he often came home with a feeling of dread, because he was afraid of the horrible conflicts that had arisen in his absence. A peaceful home was something that Lewis did not experience very often.This - apart from his literary input - provided him with ample examples of what different kinds of love are like and what their corresponding weaknesses are. Especially the weaknesses. It does not come as a surprise, then, that \\"The Four Loves\\" is filled with everyday examples of human weaknesses, many of them in a home setting.As in his other writings such as \\"The Screwtape Letters,\\" Lewis makes his observations of human nature with a keen eye and articulates them eloquently, focusing in this book on the themes of affection, friendship, romantic/erotic love, and selfless love (in the original sense of \\"charity\\").About romantic love, for instance, he says that oftentimes it \\"extenuates - almost sanctions - almost sanctifies - any actions it leads to. When lovers say of some act that we might blame, \`Love made us do it,' notice the tone. A man saying, \`I did it because I was frightened,' or \`I did it because I was angry,' speaks quite differently. He is putting forward an excuse for what he feels to require excusing. But the lovers are seldom doing quite that. The confession can be almost a boast. In extreme cases what their words really express is a demure yet unshakable allegiance to the god of love.\\"Strong words. But with much wisdom.\\"The Four Loves\\" is as challenging as it is delightful and instructive. I have little doubt that I shall read it again one day.- Jacob Schriftman, Author of The C. S.

It defines the various types of pure love: agape, venus, and storge to name some. It truly defines where the 'heart' is and perhaps defining the brotherly love, the parental love, or the true love...Susan Saige"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Lewis discusses the differences between Gift-love and Need-love in the introduction, explaining that although our Need-loves may be demanding and greedy, they are good and necessary because there is little danger that they can be made into idols. They are not near enough to God, by likeness, to be twisted like that. The highest does not exist without the lowest and a plant has roots below as well as sunlight above.Chapter 2: Likings And Loves For The Sub-Human, is a discussion of Pleasures of Need versus Pleasures of Appreciation. The types of love explored here include patriotism and love of nature. The next chapter: Affection, deals with the humblest love as Lewis calls it. He refers to literary works like The Wind In The Willows, Tristram Shandy, Emma and others to demonstrate the good and the bad manifestations of this kind of love.Friendship is explored in Chapter 4, again with reference to literature, including inter alia Ralph Waldo Emerson. This section includes an interesting discussion of the word \\"spiritual\\" - which is nowadays often used as substitute for \\"religious\\". Lewis reminds us that there is spiritual good as well as spiritual evil. The next chapter deals with Eros and he points out its aspects of glory and its playfulness, with reference to books like Anna Karenina and 1984, and certain passages from scripture.The final chapter is titled Charity and includes an interesting view of a passage from the Confessions by St Augustine. Lewis notes that the Gift-loves are natural images of God whilst the Need-loves are correlatives (not opposites) of the love that God is. When God is admitted to the human heart, He transforms our Gift-love and our Need-love. Conversion is necessary for our natural loves to enter the heavenly life.The main lesson of the book is the importance of Charity. Without it, all three of the aforementioned types of love may become distorted and even dangerous. That alone is worth the price, but I have not found The Four Loves to be as accessible as his masterpiece Mere Christianity or his comforting book titled The Problem Of Pain.Sometimes his arguments are hard to follow and his views and examples of certain types of love are coloured by the English culture of the period in which he lived, thus not always universally applicable. The book would also have been a better reference source if an index had been provided. Besides these minor comlaints, The Four Loves is still a great read that provides valuable insight into the human condition."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I hope more people would read this book.As we live in time of extreme feminism, some people don't get the idea of harmonious relationships between two sexes [no homosexuals included. sorry ;) ].

For instance, 'metanoia' is usually rendered as 'change of heart' but is more like 'a long dark night of the soul followed by a repentant altar call and acceptance of Justifying Grace.'Thus it is with our English word love, which subsumes not one but FOUR words from Koine Greek: \\"storge\\" (affection), \\"philia\\" (friendship), \\"eros\\" (sexual or romantic love) and \\"agape\\" (selfless love).THE FOUR LOVES lets you join C.S. Lewis, master theologian and Christian apologist, for a series of superb and profound essays into the nature of love and our relation with God.LOVES is serious, deep stuff and a must-read, not just for Christians but for anyone interested in the origins and nature of Love.

There are few opening chapters which lay the ground work for Lewis' essay. I must admit, though some of the information was necessary, I found the opening segments to be rather boring. Lewis has a tendency to get off on rabbit trails that, I imagine, would have been more beneficial to original audience than modern readers.After laying a foundation, Lewis than lays out the \\"four loves\\". Based of the Greek words for love, they are Affection, Friendship, Eros (Romance) and Charity. In typical Lewis fashion, the author picks apart each concept until it seems that there is nothing more to analyze.The study, while incredibly intellectual, is surprisingly practical. It provides great insight into human behavior and relationships. Lewis was a master of presenting concepts that we all have some fuzzy idea about in a defined, logical and articulate way.

This analogy applies most of all, I think, to The Four Loves. Lewis has such a gift for unpacking complex topics with all the learning of an Oxford professor without coming off as condescending. Yet he never short-changes his readers - he challenges just enough to keep you walking with him as he explores the human heart and that part of it that is knowable in the Divine.Like most of Lewis' works, you can pick any paragraph at random, and you will find a quote with the ring of Eternal Truth:\\"Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket - safe, dark, motionless, airless - it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.\\"\\"Suppose you are fortunate enough to have \\"fallen in love with\\" and married your Friend. And now suppose it possible that you were offered the choice of two futures: \\"Either you two will cease to be lovers but remain forever joint seekers of the same God, the same beauty, the same truth, or else, losing all that, you will retain as long as you live the raptures and ardours, all the wonder and the wild desire of Eros. Choose which you please.\\" Which should we choose? Which choice should we not regret after we had made it?\\"\\"[Affection] is indeed the least discriminating of loves... There need be no apparent fitness between those whom it unites. I have seen it felt for an imbecile not only by his parents but by his brothers. It ignores the barriers of age, sex, class and education. It can exist between a clever young man from the university and an old nurse, though their minds inhabit different worlds. It ignores even the barriers of species. We see it not only between dog and man but, more surprisingly, between dog and cat. Gilbert White claims to have discovered it between a horse and a hen.\\"Christians, especially those who have marveled at the thirteenth chapter of Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, should not go through life without at least one trip through this book."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"The Four Loves by CS Lewis has taken me a while to get through but is very interesting and challenging. CS lewis is a very deep thinker."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I'll admit that I haven't read a ton of work by Lewis, but of the work I have read, The Four Loves felt the most scholarly, moreso even than my recollections of Mere Christianity. In The Four Loves, Lewis breaks down the concept of love and analyzes it from a moral and Christian perspective.He uses familiar scholarly concepts from Plato's day by breaking love into the same four main segments that the Greeks used: Affection, Friendship, Eros and Charity. He adds to this the Christian scriptural reference that \\"God is Love\\" and then explores the religious aspects of love.Some of the scholarly breakdown twisted my brain a little bit and took multiple readings to try and untangle...as he expounded on \\"Need Love\\" versus \\"Gift Love\\", I was right there with him, but when he started putting forth various in-depth analysis between Venus (sexuality) and Eros (romantic 'being in love'), things started to get muddled...and when he broke into the chapter on Charity, there were a number of theoretical and rhetorical leaps that were difficult for me to follow at times.Overall though and in spite of moments of confusion, the general message of the book was good and well presented. He provided great insight into the differences between each of the categories presented. The concept of Affection vs Friendship in terms of what makes a 'real friend' was rather intriguing, especially as he continued his examples through love's progression to show how and why friendships are formed or fail to be formed, how and why friendships can grow into romantic relationships or not, and what aspect Charity plays in all of this.As with Lewis's other books, there is plenty of theological discussion going on. I don't agree with everything he had to say, which is fine, but I think he made some great points. During the last chapter or so as he speaks on Charity, he provides some great nuggets for us to think on as we think about our own charitable behaviors. He also talks about the idea of Charity being both a 'need love' and a 'gift love' and that as we engage in that paradox, we are growing nearer to God's love.I enjoyed the message of the book and the well thought out and well expressed arguments Lewis makes. The tone of the book was a little too scholarly at times which made it occasionally hard to read (since I've just finished school and am enjoying the break *grin*).Still, I really like Lewis's insights, research and writing. I enjoyed \\"Mere Christianity\\" and \\"Screwtape\\" and I'm looking into a few of his other 'theological'/'scholarly' works. He has a nice style and presents great messages without being overly preachy.****3.5 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This was a great book.

Lewis. It was a classic. According to The Saturday Review, it is a rare and memorable book. Yes, it is. It included sincere Christianity, insight, wisdom and deep meditation. When you read this book, it will give you a feeling that C.S. Lewis tells this story beside you. The contents are four kinds of loves; this is affection of parents, friendship between same genders, erotic love of lovers, and charity for people.The each stage of life can include the mixture of these love. But, usually it is chronological. When people were born, they experienced parents' love at first. Then, when they entered a school, they shared friendship with their classmates. When they became adults, they experienced erotic love emotionally. When they were retired, they gave charity to the needy.He described the difference between Gift-Love and Need-Love throughout all the chapters. In fact, I understood parts of affection and friendship but the parts of Eros and charity were difficult. Divine love is Gift-love. The Father gives all He is and has to the Son. God lacks nothing. However, our Need-Love needs to be filled with.Only God's love is eternal. Except God's love, earthly love is finite. Parents, friends, lovers and people will die when the time has come. So, to love is ready to be vulnerable. It contains the death, the separation and the suffering. It is to accept the cross with love. To share the suffering with the lover is better than to be happy alone.Just as God commanded Abraham to offer his precious son on the altar, the nearest and dearest can exist between God and our obedience. So, we should be careful. There is the priority order.

Oh well.The first thing you should know is: if Amazon has heard of a C.S. Lewis book, you should read it. The Four Loves, however, is one of the ones that you should probably have heard of before browsing to here. It is a classic work, it is widely heard of and praised, and if you want the review to end here, then yes, it deserves to be.Now, I do have one more specific comment. The best chapter is Friendship, because it's full of the most truth and importance. Affection is inundated with truth, but (as he adequately shows) it isn't as important, in any sense greater than the bestial; Eros is fairly important and fairly truthful; Charity is extremely important but it's largely his speculation (as he admits), and half a recap of the last 3 books\\"Mere Christianity\\". But Friendship rings with truth, importance, and original insight. It makes you rethink your friendships in real life -- and in a good way.Best quote? \\"Affection and Eros are ... face to face; Friendship is ... side by side.\\" Friends, and perhaps ultimately all lovers to some degree, get on much better when focussing on something they both enjoy, rather than on each other.\\"Oh, lastly, as for edition, this is a pretty solid edition.

A must read!"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"~ How being true friends can help us stay in love for the long haul ~CS Lewis' eloquent depiction of what true friendship is in his book 'The Four Loves' provided much fodder for thought. It has struck a chord as to why some marriages and long-term relationships become trying after a while.The following are helpful quotes on the characteristics of \\"true friends\\", which is very different from the everyday usage of the word \\"friends\\":1) Friends operate side by side. They let you be you and are not duty-bound. 'Don't mention it' is the way they really feel. They do not impose nor do they burden us with demands or expectations.2) There is no jealousy or rivalry. They are truly happy for us when our external circumstances may take a turn for the better vis-&agrave;-vis theirs;3) Companionship is not friendship. Friendship begins with the pleasant discovery of common interests, 'What? You too?' and involves not only being absorbed in congenial activities but growing mutual interests as the friendship deepens over time.4) A friend needs not agree with us about our answers and would stop at the onset of any arguments by agreeing to \`Let's just agree to disagree';5) Common quest which unites friends does not absorb them in such a way that they remain ignorant or oblivious of one another. A true friend is never uninterested or uninquisitive about our affairs, no matter how many times they might have heard about our issues and are ever-ready to present help in any way they can;7) Eros (lovers) have naked bodies but true friends have naked personalities - they dare to be honest and are not fearful of showing the best and worst in us8) Proverbs 17:17 - \\"A friend loves at all times\\", with the sort of love that covers over a multitude of sins (1 Peter 4:8).Marriage is the closest human relationship ordained by God where a man is to leave his family and be cleaved as one flesh with the woman in betrothal (Genesis 2: 14). Marriage is much more than just legitimizing or maintaining a healthy sex life or coming together for the purpose of procreation. Since it is not good for the man to be alone (Genesis 2: 18), a married couple is supposed to be each other's best friends or soul mates who click and have fun together, completing each other in this side of Heaven.The crux is the depth of our friendship with our spouse determines how much and how long we shall remain in love with each other. The feeling of being 'in love' can be a powerful motivating force that oils the engines of our marriages and long-term relationships. Otherwise marriage is a tall order (even for practicing Christians) and one that would be doomed to fail or stuck in the mire of low-level stability where people stay in loveless marriages for the sake of their kids or avoid being social stigmas.Unfortunately, many couples fail to remain true friends in every sense of the words. Many marriages and long-term relationships become duty-bound/obligations-driven/debt-repaying where jealousy rides high and burdensome as participants demand constant affirmation/approval/agreement. Oftentimes these relationships degenerate into downright unloving.We would need to search our hearts and honestly ask ourselves whether we have endeavored to remain true friends with our better halves, actively seeking God's help when the goings get tough. We learn to do this by choosing to adhere to biblical precepts on love (1 Corinthians 13: 4-8),\\"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails\\".Even when it may deeply pain us to take every thought captive in fighting those accompanying raw emotions to be in obedience to God's words in the doing (2 Corinthians 10:5).Regardless of how we are being treated in any given relationship, we are called to live in peace (Romans 12:18, 21) and to return good (love) for evil (unlove). Our religion would be worthless if we claim to love God but fail to demonstrate a loving attitude towards our spouses (who also happen to be our closest neighbors). There should never be any strings attached too - whether our partners have changed or not (in actuality or in our mere perception) or are deemed unlovely, unlovable and unloving."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"The inherent bias in my review is that I rate Lewis in context with his other writings. He represents the ultimate pop-theologian who speaks with cutting erudition. Lewis possessed an uncanny power to speak to all Christian denominations through his powerful prose style and unpretentious approach to the ideas of God and the Christian religion. His works make it hard to believe that he was not a trained theologian. With all that said, I dare say he has not written a book that was not great. Perspective with Mere Christianity (among others) dictates that this book receive 4 stars (A \\"4-star\\" rating for him supersedes \\"5-star\\" for many others.). Let me not be misunderstood, his ideas are powerful and his approach is classic Lewis, but the profundity found in Mere Christianity is not present at the same intensity. That is most probably given the fact that most Christians (as I) who read this book probably have given at least some thought to the four loves before this book. The problem may therefore be my own desensitization.The chapter on Eros perhaps engages the reader best as the word draws the interest while Lewis forces the reader to gaze upon the issue in a new light. The chapter (along with \\"Affection\\" and \\"Charity\\") gives the reader a new understanding of familiar themes of love while gifting a new respect and awe of the unique characteristics of the different manifestations of love. The gestalt of the book ultimately drives the reader to a new respect for the Creator of love as well as an appreciation for the complexity found in the four faces of unity that love expresses.May we only continue to strive to reach for love--both as \\"need-love\\" and \\"gift-love\\". Then we fully can (with God's grace) appreciate the depths of humanity and the spiritual end of mankind."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This book truly grips the truth of love and helps people put relationship love and God's love into perspective. I am a teenager who was taken away by Lewis' great work. Any age male or female will be absorbed and grow in wisdom. The book has helped me make decisions that will benefit my future for the better and I am extremely happy to have the chance to read such a great work from an author as talanted as CS Lewis."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I enjoyed this book. Through college courses I was already somewhat familiar with the idea of breaking down love / friendship / etc. into different emotions.To me, although the compartmentalization of the different emotions was interesting, I'm not sure I entirely agree with Lewis's breakdowns and this isn't what made the book for me.Rather I appreciated some of his simple insights. Especially when he discusses the subject of friendship. Friends become friends through common interests, through a common truth. He writes something along the lines that friendships will start when in conversation by chance someone says, \\"you noticed this thing here as well?\\" The act of wanting a friend or trying to make one without having a common interest is futile; Friends stand shoulder to shoulder, lovers face to face - just some other Lewis' gems.Also, be aware for non-christians that may read this book, that there are numerous references to God and christian love, and good christian practice, and that sort of thing through-out the book. Most of it is in good taste, sometimes, towards the later chapters, it dominates the book a bit.A good read, though not life changing, as some other reviewers might suggest."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I found this excellent little book misfiled in a used bookstore and felt immediately that I had to rescue it. I'm very glad I did! This short and utterly readable book is nothing less than an introduction to the subject of love as understood by one of the great Christian minds of the 20th century.Following the Greeks, C. S. Lewis divides love into four categories: Affection, Friendship, Eros, and Charity. He goes through each of the first three natural loves, offering observations and describing the joys, dangers, and challenges inherent in each. The last and highest love, Charity, is the love of God. Lewis claims that with love always comes risks--the ultimate risk of loss of the beloved or that your heart will be crushed. However, if one chooses not to love at all for fear of this risk, he will become hard, cold, and ultimately irredeemable.Lewis's conclusion is startling: \\"The only place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.\\"This book is littered with wise aphorisms and witty asides that are much too numerous to be listed here. If you need help understanding the role of love in your life, I encourage you to read this book. It will answer a lot of questions. That said, it is just a starting point for the subject as Lewis offers little in the way of practical advice. A further way station for folks who wish to continue exploring the role of love in the Christian life might bePhilothea, or an Introduction to the Devout Lifeby St. Francis de Sales."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"C.S. Lewis' The Four Loves was not a book that I expected to reshape my thinking. I first picked it up while following the reading guide at the end of Lindskoog's Mere Christian. I thought it would be a fun read during valentine's season. One often is most vulnerable to the trap when one is not alert...And so, once more, C.S. Lewis has changed my thought on a broad portion of life. He's done it to me before--the Narnian Books, Mere Christianity, An Experiment In Criticism--have all been books that have greatly shaped me. Now I can add the Four Loves to the list.One does not often sit down and ponder the different kinds of love. One may have generalized \\"loved ones\\" such as family and friends, we may \\"love\\" certain activities or places, we may even say we are \\"in love\\" ... but do we stop to consider our words?Lewis spends time surveying the lay of love's different lands. Building on blocks of seemingly deepening emotion, he moves from looking at affection to friendship to erotic love (Eros) to the love of God (Agape). Each is looked at in detail, their meaning and impact on life is explored.The most helpful thing about this book is that Lewis allows the reader to think about how they deal with their own loves in life. Does one stress a certain kind of love in an unhealthy way? Do we ignore the possibilities of one love because another kind holds too much sway in our lives?I believe Lewis makes the case that God's love should be primary in the lives of humans. The other loves, though they can be wonderful in their place, can be used unnaturally and ineffectively to try and fill in for Agape if it is not felt. A healthy life will involve all four loves. Yet they must be rooted and grounded in Agape.My own favorite passage in this book is in the friendship section. Dispelling the myth that an intense friendship between two people is always the best, Lewis notes that after his friend Charles (Williams) died, his friendship with J.R.R. Tolkien was something less than it was when Charles was still around--he could no longer appreciate Tolkien through the eyes of Williams. The passage is personal, poignant, and true to my own experience.The Four Loves is a remarkable book. I give it my full recommendation."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I was not especially expecting to be engrossed by a book about four greek words, but I was wrong. This was one of the better books that I have ever read. Lewis overviews each of the four types of love: storge (affection), phileo (friendship), eros (romantic love), and agape (charity or God-love). Each discussion was extremely insightful, especially the friendship one.He desribed storge as the kind of love we have for people whome we spend a lot of time with, but whom with we do not necessarily have a lot in common with. For example, if you have a sibling whom you do not share many interests with but whom you love nonetheless, it is probably storge. These are people whom you probably would not be friends with if you were not related to or neighbors to these people. Lewis notes that these are people we often do not really realize how much we loved until they are gone (or until we realize that they are those kind of people to us).He had an amazing chapter on phileo and the gift of friendship as well. I won't go into much detail so that you can enjoy it more when you actually get around to reading it. Let me just say that it made me appreciate my friends much more, and changed my views on what a friend is. He had the amazing insight that each friend brings out a different part of you. He noted that his friendship with J. R. Tolkien was not quite the same after Charles Williams died, because Williams brought out parts of Tokien that Lewis did not. Very insightful.Lewis' discussion of eros was very insightful as well. He discussed the nature of romantic love, and what romantic love looks like in a marriage. His main point seemed to be that eros loves the other person, and does not try to make the other person become more like himself.Finally, Lewis discussed agape, the kind of love that gives with no expectancy to receive in return. The whole point of this book, through there may have been amazing sidenotes on the way, is that this is the only perfect love. All the other kinds of love can be twisted until they are no longer recognizable. Storge can degenerate into condescendence, phileo can consume us and destory our lives, and eros can degenerate into lust or domineering, but agape is uncorruptable.I highly recommend this book. I can nearly guarantee that it will change the way that you think about love.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I own nearly 1000 books, of which a few I have multiple copies of: The Bible, Sun Tzu's The Art of War, The Prince. This book I have only one copy of, but have bought at least 5 that I can recall off-hand. That's because I loan it out, and it rarely gets returned (folks always return the Bibles, for some reason...). Anyone concerned with the nature and types of love should read this book. C.S. Lewis compares and contrasts love of God, Family, Lovers, and Friends in a way that makes good sense, is easy to understand, and is practical in real life. Should be required reading for anyone that has just started a relationship of any kind, or just ended a relationship for any reason."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I used to think that if I just found the \\"perfect\\" way to do relationships, I would never get hurt or have my heart broken.Lewis counters that kind of thinking. Love is vulnerable, and you will get hurt, he says, and the only place you can fully escape from the \\"dangers and perturbations\\" of love is in Hell.This book helped me, and I hope it will help you, to break free from the mindset of seeking to avoid hurt in relationships, and replace it with a desire to truly love other people.We can never entirely avoid hurt or pain in relationships, but if we approach relationships with the mindset of avoiding pain, we will never experience the joy of true love.This book's scope is not limited to one kind of relationship. It is the \\"Four Loves,\\" after all. Four kinds of love...affection, friendship, eros, and charity.Lewis truly goes through the whole gamut of love. He covers what he calls the \\"likings and loves for the sub-human\\" (like a pet), simple affection for other people and family, the love that friends share, romantic love, and then God's love--the fullest expression of love.I think perhaps this is one of the best books on love and relationships (for the two are inexplicably bound up in each other) that I have ever read. I don't think you will be able to read this book without being changed."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Trust is fragile and does not come without an open heart.C.S. Lewis' book on the four loves: affection (between a parent and a child), friendship, romantic love, and charity or love towards God is truly a remarkable piece of work.Professor Lewis writes with an easiness rare amongst writers, speaks deliberately and with wisdom in his words.He speaks of trust and of hearts, of humanity and humility. Truly, this is a moving book (or was for me) as well as a book which takes the seriousness of love rather lightly and playfully, for good reason. The seriousness and playfulness of love are but opposite sides of the same coin.Read this book with an open, honest, yet vulnerable heart. One needs to take risks in the matters of the heart. And you shall experience the best of dark and bright.--spaceboy"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I have now read this book three times - twice for school courses and once for personal reading. With each reading I find that a deeper understanding of the subject is obtained. This book is a great examination of the human heart, the different types of loves and how they each interact. Lewis examines: Affection, Friendship, Eros, and Charity. In each of the first three categories he shows both good and bad examples of that form of love, or in other words, the love and the perversion of that love.Lewis states: \\"Let us make no mistakes. Our Gift-loves are really God-Like, and among our Gift-loves those are most God-Like which are most boundless and unwearied in giving. All the things the poets say about them are true. Their joy, their energy, their patience, their readiness to forgive, their desire for the good of the beloved - all this is a real and all but adorable image of the Divine life.\\" p.9 This is the ultimate in love; this is when our love comes closest to God's Love.Lewis gives us a great study in love, what love is, what it means to truly love and some of the pitfalls of love gone askew.

Using the logic Lewis is so famous for and written with the same intelligence as &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;, this book is not to be discounted simply because it is about love. Lewis is regarded as one the best Christian theologians of modern times, and it is no mistake that he wrote about this subject, the different types of love, and the importance of it.I went on a spiritaul search for true love--the love of God--at the same time I read this book. &quot;The Four Loves&quot; made everything about love that is cloudy much more clear. From Lewis, you can't get an better than this!"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"In one of Lewis' Narnia books, he describes a quiet, restful place called The Wood Between the Worlds, where &quot;You can almost hear the trees growing.&quot; Reading Lewis at his best, you can almost hear the spirit growing, taking up water through its roots in God.I can't say how much I've learned from this beautiful little treasure. Reading it for the first time twenty or more years ago, each chapter struck me as a revelation, and has been a part of the &quot;spiritual furniture of my mind&quot; ever since. (Though living up to it is more difficult.) It gives me food for thought on &quot;like&quot; and &quot;love,&quot; how to treat animals, the beauties and dangers of friendship and romance, how they differ, the inherent riskiness of love, the disquises by which hatred can enter the soul, and what it means to love God and for God to love me. I do not agree with Gross above that this book is a more &quot;persuasive apologetic&quot; for Christianity than his other books, but I do think that non-Christians are likely to enjoy it. M. Scott Peck's books, Road Less Travelled and People of the Lie, (the first written as a Buddhist, the second as a Christian) can even be read as &quot;case studies&quot; of some of the points Lewis makes here.Four Loves proves that the most eloquent and deepest truths can be expressed in the simplest language. It (they?) would be a wonderful gift for a newlywed, a young person graduating from high school or college, or anyone else to whom you wish to express your love.author, Jesus and the Religions of Man"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I find so much comfort in this book. C.S. Lewis once again brings his keen intellectual analysis, and his profoundly honest introspection to bear in this, his unique Christian interpretation of the complex subject of love. Often when reading Lewis, I find that I have to put the book down every couple of minutes, and just ponder and analyze exactly what he's saying, and it's the same with this one. His descriptions and analysis of the affection between people and their pets, co-workers and family members is spot on, his take on the deep and profound nature of real friendship rings true, his summary of the unbridled power of romantic/erotic love will strike a chord with anyone who has been in a passionate love affair (for better or worse), and his take on the selfless love of mankind in general, and God ultimately, gives us a needed dose of perspective.I love the fact that Lewis was so educated, and so familiar with the religious and philosophical traditions of the West specifically, and the world in general, and that he has a deep understanding of and respect for those non-Christian traditions. He most certainly did not come to Christianity through an ignorance of, contempt for, nor fear of other traditions. I find it sad that so many non-Christians have an image of Christianity as a narrow-minded, bigoted tradition hostile towards other religions---reading C.S. Lewis will dispell that. I feel greatly indebted to C.S. Lewis for helping me on my journey, and The Four Loves is one of my favorites of his. If you're struggling with ANY type of love (and aren't we all), please read this book."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Even more than most works by C.S. Lewis, \\"The Four Loves\\" spans diverse life stages, offering golden wisdom not only to mature singles and married couples, but even to teenagers sorting out keys to friendship and romance.Three themes are especially powerful tools for shaping rich, reliable, safe and empowering relationships, whether in friendship, in romance or in the family: 1) Relationships are destiny; 2) Extreme conformity is no act of love; and, 3) Controlling personalities eviscerate themselves and others.1) RELATIONSHIPS ARE DESTINY: Lewis notes that friendships can be schools of virtue or schools of vice, as life companions tend to pipe into our lives their strongest traits and block out qualities alien to their nature. Thus we absorb wisdom, love for truth, courage and faith from virtuous friends, who also buffer us against self-inflicted wounds, corruption and spiritual inertia. What marital grief is saved for those who absorb this Lewis tip before locking in for life!2) EXTREME CONFORMITY, SUBMISSION OR CAPITULATION IS NO ACT OF LOVE. Mindless self-surrender, notes Lewis, can amount to idolatry for those who relinquish control a mere human that should only be yielded to God. A woman who is to a man as a child is to an adult, adds the author, destroys hope even of genuine friendship. Furthermore, \\"a man would have to be...indeed a blasphemer,\\" charges Lewis, if he accepts for himself such sovereignty over another person's life.3) CONTROLLING PERSONALITIES EVISERATE THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. At extremes, both \\"need love\\" and \\"gift love\\" are used by covert-controllers. A \\"tyrannous and gluttonous demand for affection,\\" notes Lewis, consumes not only the object of love but also the ravenous heart searching to be fed, rather than to love. Equally treacherous, notes Lewis, are those who exploit \\"gift love,\\" such as \\"Mrs. Fidget\\" who slaved away for her family day and night. By giving them so much that they did not need, indeed, did not want, she put them in her debt, so they could hardly rest for jumping to please this woman who \\"lives for her family.\\" Such a family colludes to sustain an illusion of warmth, while secret resentment simmers against those whose \\"love\\" leaves others impoverished emotionally. After her death, there were \\"astonishing\\" changes in the family, reports Lewis, as the husband could laugh, the children enjoyed staying home, and \\"even the dog, who was never allowed out except on a lead is now a well-known member of the Lamp-post Club.\\"Lewis notes that more overt controllers may seek to isolate partners from other relationships, clinging to \\"love\\" in ways that excludes others. But a wife who alienates her husband's male friends may create a spouse not \\"very well worth having; she has emasculated him,\\" warns Lewis. Such a partner may accept this fate or go underground, adds the author, creating a secret life beyond spouse control. As a family counselor, I note that marital affairs commonly evolve out of desperate but treacherous attempts to salvage personal identity and escape a controlling partner. As Lewis observes, controllers inevitably lose what they seek to control, as those they strive to master are spiritually annihilated or driven away.Through \\"The Four Loves,\\" C.S. Lewis has given us a remarkable roadmap for safe, empowering, destiny-shaping relationships. In an era of disposable spouses, children and friends, we more than ever need such wisdom for relationship radar, spiritual protection, and at times, for survival.REVIEWER: Beverly Hubble Tauke, LCSW, is author of \\"Overcoming Sins of the Family\\" and is a Virginia-based family counselor and lecturer."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"By splitting human love into four basic categories, C.S. Lewis creates a stunning and convincing commentary on our existence. Throughout the text, the question &quot;Which love is closest to God's love?&quot; is strung. Lewis does an amazing job at answering this question, and the book comes full-circle in the end and proves that &quot;to love is to be vulnerable&quot;. The Four Loves digresses quite far from where C.S. Lewis normally writes. Discussions include detailed definitions and explications of the Greek gods and how they relate to our lives. Still, this book is 100% Lewis. An essential book for the &quot;thinker types&quot;, and a must for any fan of C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"CS Lewis can take a difficult issue and boil it down to something remarkably simple--that's the beauty of his writing. Here Lewis tackles love--the most simple, the most complicated, the most pleasurable, and the most painful of all our emotions. He approaches his subject with uncanny insight, and divides this passion, what we call love, into four types: affection, friendship, eros (sensual love), and charity. Then, starting with affection, Lewis proceeds to tell us just what we thought we could never understand.I am not a flowery, luvvy-duvvy type of guy. I don't find it all that amusing to sit around and talk about emotions. But Lewis's writing is different--he takes the subject of love to a higher level, and examines what it is that makes us feel the way we do and, more importantly, how that can bring us closer to God.This book, like many of Lewis's works, is a case for Christianity. But even without that approach this book is invaluable, because Lewis can make you understand WHAT IT IS to love. In short, you can learn how to love better, and how to make your dealings with others much more meaningful.CS Lewis is different than most theologians (he would have hated to be called that). While many concentrate on doctrinal matters, Lewis explores everyday life. What he teaches are good, solid morals--the things that will make you a better everyday person. This book is highly recommended for a good look at what we call Love."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I approached this writing with some prior experience and formal study of love. Consequently, I cannot judge with complete objectivity, how one might feel about The Four Loves if this was one of their first exposures to the concept. The book made perfect sense to me and was as captivating as any of Mr. Lewis's writings. While the book was not entirely ordered in the way that I would have liked, he adds his own concepts to the Greek notions of agape, storge, philos and eros. These additions help to explain the Greek notions to the modern reader and are at least as meaningful. They even suggest further ways in which to better understand that extremely nebulous word. He sees much farther in matters of loves than the typical modern writer. His knowledge of Renaissance and Medieval literature and history gives him a deep well of insights from which to draw and reveals how deficient the English language is in some basic areas of humanity despite having over 1/2 million words.As Lincoln said, &quot;With malice toward none, with charity for all,&quot; Lewis points us clearly in the direction of Christianity and the necessary selflessness it prescribes. Until we are truly selfless in attitude and not only in deed, we miss the Christian point of view.I like the way he makes me think. This was my second Lewis book, after Screwtape, and it firmed my resolve to read more."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This is in my opinion C.S. Lewis's best nonfiction work. The premise has been done before, but rarely with the sort of insight given here. His overviews of Affection and Friendship are much too often overlooked and glossed over as unimportant, but here they're given a status they really deserve.The section on friendship, and the idea that people are bonded through mutual passions, and his grim statement that people who are just looking for a friend will never find one, was spot on. Friendships are formed as an extension of a passion for something bigger than the individual. A mutual cause drives people, whether they be sports fanatics, a tribe pining for survival, or art critics.The pitfalls he explains for the loves such as lust, bigotry, elitism, etc. are self explanatory, but it's also practical. Friendships are exclusive by their very nature, and there's nothing intrinsically wrong with such a thing. Eros is most certainly exclusive. He emphasizes that we can't be friends with everyone, love everyone with Eros, but we can love everyone with Charity, the final section of the book.One could write a book three times longer and not come close to the depth portrayed in this little book. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"One of the things I like most about college are the lectures of a really erudite professor. It's such a joy to hear someone with a dazzling array of experiences and insights speak on his subject of expertise. These 4 talks are the closest most of us will ever come to sitting in a Cambridge classroom and hearing the one and only C.S. Lewis talk and talk about a subject of intense and intimate interest to just about all of us: love. While perhaps of lesser aesthetic quality than Plato's \\"Symposium\\", it is, nonetheless, far more insightful and USEFUL (That's not to say Plato is not useful; far from it! It is precisely BECAUSE Plato is so eminently insightful and useful that I consider this to be just about the highest compliment one could pay Lewis's work, and a compliment which is richly deserved!). Lewis's unparalleled understanding of human nature; his ability to illustrate the true significance of often overlooked, seemingly trivial things; his use of disparate and always apt illustrations from literature, history, psychology, life, philosophy, and religion; the way in which the highest and the lowest are always placed in right relation in his account of things; all these hallmarks of Lewis's genius are on full display in these lectures on the four types of love: domestic affection, friendship, erotic love, and Christian charity.In fact, Lewis's understanding that these various types of love differ not only in degree but in kind enable him to avoid many of the apparent problems of Plato's account. I would recommend that Lewis's \\"Four Loves\\" and Plato's \\"Symposium\\" be read back-to-back and then criticized in light of each other, and then reread back-to-back again. Listening to them both (there is an excellent line of dramatic readings of Plato's works by Naxos audio-books) is very helpful, for one gets something different from hearing a lecture than from just reading notes (even if they are an exact transcript of the lecture). Also, Lewis's talks differ slightly in content from the book, and the differences, while slight, are somewhat instructive.One can truly listen with rapt interest and amazement to these talks over, and over, and over, and over, and..."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"If you have only read \\"The Four Loves,\\" you haven't heard all that Lewis had to say on the subject. The audio version, read by Lewis himself is shorter than the print version of this book, but it includes material not in print. It takes a few minutes to get used to Lewis' voice, but soon you feel that you are sitting in a room with him as he tells stories and talks about what he has learned from his experiences of the four loves."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"C.S. Lewis's short _The Four Loves_, published near the end of the author's life in 1960, is worthy companion for a long afternoon or evening of reading and meditation. Lewis discusses in both an enlightening and light tone the four forms of love in ascending order: affection, friendship, eros, and charity. As a preliminary to this discussion, Lewis also describes likings and loves for \\"sub-human\\" (that is, loving a cup of tea or loving nature). The work is a philosophy of love that draws upon Lewis's own day-to-day observations, the writings of well-known and lesser known philosophers, and the works of artists. All of these types of love lead to an insight that these natural loves--that is, the loves that make up our daily lives--intimate a much large love, that of God for humankind. For Lewis, these natural loves are themselves not enough. Lewis describes a form of Christian love based on Jesus's own sacrifice and the unknowable mystery of God's love. This is the majesty of charity.One basic principle of Lewis's work is the distinction between Need-love and Gift-love. The Need-love has to do, for Lewis, with \\"a craving to be loved,\\" which is akin to a child's longing for the love of his parents'. Instead of disparaging this type of love as wholely selfish, Lewis describes how this type of love, while limited, is \\"the accurate reflection in consciousness of our actual nature.\\" Lewis writes that \\"we need others physically, emotionally, intellectually; we need them if we are to know anything, even ourselves.\\" Lewis acknowledges the human condition sympathetically. Gift-love, by contrast, has its ultimate expression in Christ's death on the cross. This is an active, selfless love. Lewis characterizes Gift-love in its ordinary expression as \\"that love which moves a man to work and plan and save for the future well-being of his family which he will die without sharing or seeing.\\"Lewis's book is filled with wise observations. The chapters on affection and friendship, which are the least religious in nature, are superb. The comments about divine love are engaging, as well. For example, in describing human beings' craving for God's help, he writes, \\"Man approaches God most nearly when he is in one sense least like God.\\" Here, Lewis points out that often humans turn to God or spirituality in type of deepest despair or wretchedness. Later, he quotes a line of verse, \\"The Devil was sick, the Devil a monk would be\\" to highlight how in need people will search for god, not out of sincerity per se, but in a desperate longing to be saved. In chapter one, Lewis draws an analogy between a traveler's journey being not always straight in path and the journey toward God. For example, a traveler who is near to a village in physical proximity, say staring down on the rooftops from a mountain crag that he can almost touch with his hands, may need to follow a path that takes him much further from town before bringing him closer to it (for instance, as the path winds slowly down the hill).Most of Lewis's observations about love speak to all religious traditions as does, arguably, the recognition that human love longs for more than its natural forms. The final chapter \\"Charity\\" is the most explicitly Christian in worldview, and it is the most difficult to grasp. Lewis admits the possible imperfection of his own knowledge and that what he writes about are imagined experiences rather than real ones. He reflects, \\"Those like myself whose imagination far exceeds their obedience are subject to a just penalty; we easily imagine conditions far higher than any we have actually reached.\\"Lewis's _Four Loves_ brims with human insights about love. This is a short work, written in the style of a kind, wise friend sharing his thoughts on a walk or over an evening."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"An illuminating view on affection, the so-called 'the most humble', friendship, 'the least natural and the most independent', eros, 'the most natural' and charity, 'the noblest' of all loves, treated in terms of the so-called 'need love', 'gift love' and 'appreciative love'. The beauty and potential danger of distortion and abuse of each love is also covered excellently. C.S. Lewis is both a psychologist and a philosopher, a brilliant one. His treatment on this subject of love is important for every one to know; some that I personally learn and thought to be beautiful, are:- That we ought to love with decency and common sense;- The reward of the accomplishment of a gift-love is its abdication, when it is no longer needed.- When love becomes a god, it turns into a demon;- The calculating love is no love at all which leads to the beauty and mark of eros, where calculations are irrelevant, and when it is in us, we \\"had rather share unhappiness with the Beloved than be happy on any other terms\\", and finally...- The excellence of charity, confirmed in the Scriptures, something Jonathan Edwards calls 'the sum of all virtues', where Lewis exhorted to love God who will never pass away, \\"Do not let your happiness depend on something you may lose. If love is to be a blessing, not a misery, it must be for the only Beloved who will never pass away.\\"- The gracious call to risk and forego for the greatest good. Speaking of Christ, Lewis says, \\"... His teaching was never meant to confirm my congenital preference for safe investments and limited liabilities... And who could conceivably begin to love God on such a prudential ground -- because the security is better? ...Christ did not teach and suffer that we might become ... more careful of our own happiness... We shall draw nearer to God, not by trying to avoid the sufferings inherent to all loves, but by accepting them and offering them to Him; throwing away all defensive armour. If our hearts need to be broken and if He chooses this as the way in which they should break, so be it.\\"Get this book, friends, and learn that \\"loves\\" are beautiful, when handled properly, but 'the greatest of these is charity'."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"She reaaly enjoyed this book and wrote a great essay about it for her class.

Thank you. Patricia Clemens"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I \\"love\\" the writings of C. S. Lewis, but I had real trouble with this book. I just never \\"cared\\" about what he was writing about. But that is my own personal issue...If you are looking to understand the various types of love in society and culture, and how various people have thought about love, and how our love for a dog differs from our love for God, and how parents and children can be abusive toward each other by loving with the wrong kind of love, or with love wrongly applied, I highly recommend this book.Lewis looks at the four kinds of love in the Greek language, and shows how these forms of love reveal themselves in our lives today, and shows the benefits and dangers of each. If this topic interests you, make sure you read this book."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"[Throughout the years, I have written a number of reviews that have never been published online on Amazon. These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written.Mike London 10-3-2012]The Four Loves were originally recorded as broadcasts for the radio, and because of Lewis's frankness on the sexual nature of Eros, some of the supporters of the company did not want to advocate this. Lewis told George Sayer it is very surprising that a nation who peddles such voluminous pornography, and here Lewis speaks of America, that they would object to a Christian discussion on sexuality.Sexuality makes an essential part of human nature, and God intended it as one of his most blessed, and highly unusual, gifts to two people who are very deeply in love and wish to express this love in a very intimate way. That is why a person must be married for sexual activity to be divinely approved of, for anything else lessens the activity's purpose and makes a mockery of it. Tim Lahaye has found in surveys conducted by him that religious people are generally the most sexually satisfied individuals. Lewis is quite consistent in the portrayal of the sexual nature of men and women and God's purpose for it. The whole institute of marriage, like any other gift of pleasure of God's, shows us God's love for mankind.Charity, or agape love, stands as the most intense and the deepest kind of love, because it is the love between humanity and God.Lewis goes on to deal with the other two types of love, friendship and effect, and each of these four types of love are presented with such clarity of thought that after a reader is finished with this book he/she has a much deeper understanding of the loves in general.Affection, one that is not generally counted as a love, is a necessary requirement for happy living, for if one has no affection then their life will be utterly miserable. Friendship, for Lewis, stands as the most unnatural from a biological standpoint of the four loves, but also one of life's biggest blessings. Lewis valued his friendships all of his life.It is truly a remarkable book.*(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\".)"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"A very thoughtful and insightful work on the many facets of love. I really appreciate Lewis' powers of observation and his ability to show how the theory and practice match. It is one of the few books I have bothered to read more than once. I think it actually requires multiple readings to get it all."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I got home today and the book was waiting for me on my bed, thank Jesus! The book is in great condition, I read what I could off the preview amazon gives and figured it would be a great read, I'm going to start ASAP reading it, hoping to learn some new things all God willing. Anyway, thank you for giving me a great buy and a great book, with great shipping time and everything! God bless you :)"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"C.S. Lewis is one of my favorite authors, and I consider his \\"Mere Christianity\\" and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" to be two of the finest books written in the 20th century. But I must admit that some of his stuff is rather grueling to read. \\"The Abolition of Man\\" was one of the more laborious that I've read, and though not to that same extent, I would categorize \\"The Four Loves\\" similarly.To be sure, \\"The Four Loves\\" offers some fascinating insight into the four different types of love that Lewis describes: affection (family love), friendship, eros (romantic love), and charity. His analysis of these different loves helps to explain how and why we can profoundly love different people in substantially distinct ways. I especially appreciated some of his critique of how modern assumptions about romantic love have created vastly dysfunctional and destructive patterns of relationships. I was able to borrow a few quotes from the \\"Friendship\\" chapter for a sermon that I recently preached about relationships. And Lewis is always Lewis, finding clever ways to explain very profound ideas and putting words to things that we've all felt in the past but have previously been unable to articulate.However, \\"The Four Loves\\" was definitely more laborious for me to read than most of Lewis' other work that I've read. Several of his main themes (the distinctions between \\"need-love\\" and \\"gift-love,\\" for instance) were so abstract that I really struggled to follow his reasoning. And even when I was able to decipher what he was saying, I struggled to understand how his ideas even mattered. Lewis' gift as an author is taking high-minded, intellectual stuff and bringing it down to earth, to make it accessible to normal folks like me. I just never felt like \\"The Four Loves\\" ever really landed, but instead stayed in the philosophical stratosphere. It's a fine and decent book which offers some interesting food for thought about the nature of love. And there are definitely some sound bites that provide great quotes to share in various contexts. But I'd easily recommend a dozen other book by Lewis before I'd point someone in this direction."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I first heard of C. S. Lewis in 1964 when I attended Bible school. I read THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS and found it somewhat interesting, but at 19 years old, I didn't appreciate the breadth and depth of his work. My interest, however, was re-kindled in the early 1970's. I was at a point in my life when I was making relationships with people more important than my relationship to God. Through the suggestion of a friend, I started reading Lewis again. How I found this book is a whole story in itself, but suffice it to say that I found it useful and spiritually helpful.Lewis discusses four loves: affection, friendship, eros, and charity with \\"Charity\\" being the biblical sense of the word and not the modern one of helping the poor (although that can be included). He even devotes Chapter 2 to likings and loves for the sub-human. Lewis is nothing, if not thorough.As he discusses the four loves he talks about \\"need\\" love and \\"appreciative\\" love, discussing how one is not necessarily superior to the other and, in fact, we need both. He brings this into many places in his discussion of the loves.The part I appreciated the most was that he always leads the reader back to the fact that he or she needs to give these \\"loves\\" to Christ, and to always keep God central. He shows the good and the bad that can happen with each love if allowed to run rampant.You may or may not agree with every point Lewis makes, but it is valuable, Christ-centered reading. It was of great spiritual value to me in my own growth as a Christian."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I just can't get enough of C.S. Lewis, I have read each of his books and never been disappointed. Everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This is just another amazing work from C. S. Lewis! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"C.S. Lewis once again lives up to his reputation as a brilliant Christian thinker. I wasn't very excited about this book when I started, but found it fascinating and changed the way I see love. It's interesting how he sees our foibles and gets to heart of human motives. Read this and allow yourself to be challenged. If you're not the thoughtful type, given to self examination, this may not be the book for you."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"The seller was efficient, honest, and pleasant. The book was first reported as being in \\"good\\" condition, but when the seller discovered that the book had highlighting throughout, he immediately e-mailed me, giving me a chance to back out of my purchase based on the new information. I chose to buy the book anyway, and was pleased with the purchase. The book was not highlighted to the extent the seller implied! It was in very good condition.As for the book itself, it is a great read worth coming to over and over again. Anyone with family, friends or a \\"significant other\\" in his/her life must read this book. C.S. Lewis comes to the table with wonderful ideas and a friendly, enjoyable -to-read voice. I loved this book!"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Worth reading, but it takes a lot of work to read. Some parts are very datedand don't translate well to modern life."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"The book is divided into four sections...the four biblical loves.Four biblical loves are described by Lewis in a simple and direct format. The Four Loves was published in 1960 just three years before Lewis' death and after his romantic interlude. The book reflects a lifetime of experiences.Eros...an obsession for most people, receives extensive coverage but is superceded by agape. Agape love,as the scripture tells us in 1 Corth 13, is unconditional and the purest form of love.I picked up \\"The Four Loves\\" in the army airfield library as a light reading book for my daily train commute...and then...the unexpected happened:I expected a quick read due to its small size and large print, but was unexpectly convicted by the discussion of \\"need love\\" as I fought with the realization that most of my personal experiences with God have been conditional and ego based. If we are honest there is little true agape in our lives.Does God create need love as a basis for the other loves? A recent brush with death, on autobahn A3 near frankfurt, showed me that need love always directs our attention towards God. I had been drifting into a carnal attitude towards my wife for quite a while...that day I came upon a sudden traffic jam. Looking into the rear view mirror I saw an quickly approaching pharmacy van driven by a woman looking down. I prayed to Jesus. She looked up at the last minute and hit the brakes. My car a Ford Focus 2007 withstood great shock, and activated its airbag. I walked away with only a sore back. Needless to say I have started praying actively. The need love has renewed my agape love.The Four Loves...ideally found together in marriage, an idea which Lewis overlooks: affection, eros, friendship, and charity. An idea I overlooked until recently.An interesting side note in the book is the remark C.S. Lewis made about George Orwell. Lewis correctly stated that the characters in \\"Animal Farm\\" were more human than the human characters in \\"1984\\". The two writers worked for the BBC during the same time when they were both famous.They had to have met frequently, yet there is no record of any dialog between them except for initial hostile barbs from Orwell in his reviews and later the one above from Lewis. Lewis initially wrote many good things about Orwell but to no avail...apparently the culture war between them was too great.An easy read...but possibly with distressing insights mining the reading path. By the way I did love it!Pathway to the stars"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Every once in a while, you come across a work that strikes a very personal chord. This is one of those books for me. I came across it as a young man with very real faith concerns. It contains a thorough exploration of the different forms of love and a plain-spoken critique of many timeless temptations and expressions of imperfect love.Blessings,[...]"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"The Four Loves describes the increasing complexity and nature of love of men toward things than themselves. From the simplest types of love that center on mere feelings and general liking, to ones with a deep sense of sacrificial giving, Lewis explains the nature of the types love so that the reader can understand the appropriate love in the right situation, and understand how to express love more consistently.By describing definitive types of love, Lewis argues that knowledge of love, particularly for believing Christians, will lead to a better experience in exercising the types of love in their right context. Lewis illustrates his teaching by using concrete examples for each of his definitive four types of love, while giving special note to loves directed towards sub-human things. Affection, friendship, eros, and charity are what Lewis lists as his types of loves going from leastt to greatest in significance.Lewis, especially when examining love for things subhuman and eros, deeply attacked the sentimentality and nostalgia that mistakes pride for love for sacrifice. The modern split to love either the rational man or a pantheon of natural things is shown to be a deep misunderstandings of what love really is. Ultimately, man makes the mistake of trying to assign love to things that have value in them and to treat things that have no value in themselves, like a nation-state, with unnatural love. For eros, Lewis shows that since many modern men have rejected the call of the One who is love, erotic love has become a very serious, selfish thing. We would only have to look at the so-called sexual revolution to note than man has taken the most playful and needful type of love and turned it into something that is serious and that is treated as if it can be rejected as easily as if it were never needed in the first place.For today's church, the four different types of loves call all believers to reexamine their feelings of love in their homes, ideas, families, communities and marriages in the light not only of the love of Christ, but of Christ as love."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I first encountered this book in a college Theology class - I'll be honest I didn't read as much as I was assigned. But I didn't forget it. Now I'm reading it with two of my friends and we're really excited about it. Lewis does a great job of outlining the different ways we 'love' things and each other. I highly recommend this to anyone who has ever found themselves trying to figure out someone else's actions or feelings. It helps to put things into a better perspective."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This is a small nonfiction book or, more accurately, I should say, it's a short book. It's only about 140 pages long and at first it might seem like an easy read. Lewis categorizes the four types of loves as Affection, Friendship, Eros and Charity. He writes clearly and directly but there's a subtlety to his meaning that might easily be missed if you don't re-read, pause, consider, and then read again. There are so many wonderful \`ah ha' moments and treasures to be found in this book. I'd highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Went beyond accommodating!

As a result she questions the path she has taken in life, examining with relentless candor her own past. At the same time, her obsession with a nineteenth century literary figure, Constance Fenimore Woolson, leads her on an unpredictable and surprising course of speculation on matters of spirituality, feminism, and personal psychology. The author's intelligence, humor, determination, and sheer literary skill take this memoir well beyond the usual inspirational new age stuff, and the result is a fine meditation on the coming together of many forces that refocus and redefine her sense of self."},{"Title":"Tolstoy's Bicycle","review":"Tolstoy's Bicycle is not the most encouraging, or graphical, of titles, but what a book it is!!

The facts and figures make amazing reading and, if nothing else, it will inspire you onward to greater deeds and improve that old self-esteem.

American (and Irish-American) readers have every reason to look forward to the next publication of this and to pre-order it now to be sure that they don't miss a copy. For those of you who are familiar with the phenomenon of 'Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable' they will realise how enjoyable each entry is for lovers of words, folklore, history, mythology and so many more topics. The original Brewers dictionary covered a whole range of WORLD lore. It is so incredible that the distinguished authors have managed to present no fewer than 6,000 brilliant entries just related to Ireland!!! This book is an essential reference tool not only for the Irish (this book belongs to all Irish people who have every reason to be proud of it). It should also be possessed by anyone who seriously loves folklore and language lore and who has a love and respect for the history and culture of the beautiful Emerald Isle. P.S.

I received it today and have to say...it was well worth the wait! I've hardly put it down since it got here...what a wonderful way to learn about my heritage!"},{"Title":"Brewer's Dictionary of Irish Phrase & Fable (Cassell Dictionary of...S.)","review":"Six thousand entries on language, folklore, history, and myth enliven these 860-odd pages, edited by Sean McMahon from Derry and Kerry-born, Dublin-based Jo O'Donoghue. The regional balance attests to the need, in such a compendium, to include pithy, sometimes wry, brief, but informative entries. The scope of this work rivals its parent Brewer's, the Dictionary of Phrase & Fable's 1300 pages, from its appearance in 1870. (I review the edition published in 2010 in the US, apparently that which first came out in Britain in 2004.) Rival volumes focus on Hiberno-English derivations, history, culture, or literature, but this version tries to combine these fields into one volume.The panoramic scope of such a volume even on such a small island demands a narrower focus. So, I spot-checked one letter's section. I opened it at random to \\"S,\\" a good section for variety.Scanning its contents, I found the following among hundreds of selections. \\"Salt Monday\\" commemorates when this was sprinkled on bachelors and spinsters to get them married during Shrovetide; \\"Scrap Saturday\\" was a satirical radio show. \\"Save Ireland from Sodomy\\" as an entreaty from the Reverend Ian Paisley was met with in Ulster the inevitable transversion as graffito: \\"Save Sodomy from Ulster.\\" \\"Sapphira\\" as the pen-name of a protege of Swift and \\"Speranza\\" as that of Oscar Wilde's mother appear.As for another writer's merit, \\"Seamus Heaney\\" enters 1) \\"Seamus Famous\\" and 2) as neo-Cockney rhyming slang for \\"bikini,\\" while \\"Segotia\\" as a Dublin derivative of who knows why to indicate a \\"dear friend\\" can be distinguished from \\"sonsy\\" as an epithet for all that beauty can bear. The early saint \\"Senan\\" is not to be confused with the plastic explosive \\"Semtex,\\" taken from a Czech village near its manufacture. War and division, no more than invective, hyperbole, and derision, characterize many names found here. \\"Slag\\" as in ridicule appears, and so does \\"sl&aacute;n\\" for health, if oddly not \\"sl&aacute;inte \\" as a crucially common version for a toast. \\"Shin shin\\" separates from \\"sin-&eacute; \\" for those untutored in Ireland's ancient language. By the way, the NYC bar of the latter name in its third incarnation closed three years ago, whereas the entry speaks in current tense of its existence.The past of an Irish culture confronted by shortcomings that were forgotten in drink appears. \\"Sky farmer\\" refers to one too poor to command for his cow but the roadside verge next to the land he has lost. \\"Seven Drunken Nights\\" as the English-language version of a traditional Irish ballad gets its lyrical transcription; even though the English version in 1967 for The Dubliners got but five of its seven verses, it was still banned by the Irish radio station. The Irish-language version escaped censorship. The lines about the hairy tin whistle merit your own scrutiny.Some entries merited more clarification. That on the \\"Swastika Laundry\\" which surprised with a \\"certain cognitive dissonance\\" the British who visited it in Dublin during WWII doesn't do justice to the fact that it was founded around 1912 when the crooked cross was but a benign sun symbol-- and good-luck charm worn by the laundry's own black cat mascot. \\"Servant boy\\" earns a sixteen-word definition that young folks went into domestic or agricultural service, but this seems not to deserve even a sentence stating the obvious.Spot-checking, any reviewer may not be able to match the broad command of lore needed to do this book's critique justice. Still, I caught a few places where improvements would have helped. I wish a few illustrations could have been included, as in \\"Sniper at work\\" as a sign mimicking the triangular road warning notice in south Armagh during the Troubles needs its visual equivalent to do justice to the meaning. Seeing the \\"Starry Plough\\" again would assist comprehension of how its shape imitating the constellation as a logo for a working class rebellion. Under \\"SAG\\" for the \\"Saint Anthony Guide\\" entry that explained how these letters once graced the back of an envelope that a pious sender wished to guard from vanishing in the mail, the attribution to \\"a Dominican of Padua\\" errs. This patron of lost items, second to the Order's founder in terms of popularity among the Friars Minor, was a Franciscan.However, inevitably these are minor flaws for this vast reference. If consulted as a guide for the casual inquirer needing a one-stop source, or a first-stop as a stimulus to more research, McMahon and O'Donoghue have succeeded in providing a welcome, and affordable, source. It makes a fine armchair companion to lose hours in, too. For pub quizzes (\\"Quiz\\": see the entry as won as a wager, perhaps), this may rival that Guinness volume for those Hibernians who claim to know it all."},{"Title":"Brewer's Dictionary of Irish Phrase & Fable (Cassell Dictionary of...S.)","review":"I purchased this as a gift (fortunately, it was for a close relative, so although it did not arrive in time for 2 occasions, I was able to get to the recipient at an appropriate time.)

In America, it is easy to forget that a very significant portion of the population struggles against just the sort of totalitarian political machinery that Orwell describes. The addition of an insightful introduction by a life-long fan, the late Chrsitopher Hitchens, reveals that Hitchens' anti-totalitarian beliefs were shaped in large part by an early introduction to Orwell. As someone who has always heard of Orwell, but never read any of his works, (even though I have a bachelor's degree in English), I am equally amazed at these books' importance; and, that they are not required reading in any secondary or post-secondary education of which I am aware.

In \\"Animal Farm\\", it was quite interesting to use animals as the characters because even children could understand its strong message, even if not fully comprehending its value at a young age. In \\"1984\\" Orwell was WAY ahead of his time with his description of corruption within the government and the unbeknownst oppression of its people.

Both Orwell novels seek to point out the shortcomings of socialist governments by satirizing the roles of Europe's leaders of the WWII era in Animal Farm and by issuing a dire warning of what could have transpired, and still might, if such totalitarian regimes hold sway in his disturbing portrayal of life under an all-seeing, all-controlling dictatorship in 1984."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"I've only read to chapter 8 so far but I intend to finish it soon.

In a world that is all too often manipulated by and for those who are able to obtain control and power of others, it would be wise for all people to consider these subjects, if nothing else, for the preservation of one's chosen way of life.

In the 1984 of Orwell, there is not much home, only rumors of an opposition, an opposition which may only exist as an excuse to persecute and victimize. In the 1984 the technology is use to overwhelm his hero who seeks freedom.Orwell was a member of a trend that lost hope in the cause of socialist revolution, and believed that the Soviet Union and the Nazi government of Germany were the same thing. It was the wave of the future, bureaucratic collectivism, James Burnham the former Trotskyist named it as he fled to the anticommunist ranks of the National Review. It couldn't be stopped, Nazism, the corporate society, and Stalinism would all grow into what Orwell depicts in 1984.But now, 20 years after 1984, the bureaucratic regimes in Eastern Europe and China and the former Soviet Union have been pushed aside, and great avenues for free political life, the exchange of ideas, and struggles by workers for union rights, by oppressed nationalities for freedom from discrimination, even without the kind of revolutionary leadership that emerged in Hungary in 1956 or in Cuba in 1959.Technology has proven a weapon for working people and others fighting for their rights, not something by which tyrants can rule through. For Soviet dissidents the first big explosion in the discussion and circulation of ideas came with the advent of the photocopying machine that spread texts and reports against the bureaucracy across the country. Today web sites for unions fighting the coal bosses in Utah, fighting to organize textile workers in Miami, or fighting to defend coal miners in China, reach out around the globe.As the world seems to be heading into an economic criss marked by aggresive wars by Washington and resistance by working people we can expect not the bleak sunnless future that Orwell painted, but a festival of freedom for working people fighting the bureaucracies in Eastern Europe, the USSR, and China and the billionaires in North America, Japan, and Europe.However, what will live forever in this book, what lives more strongly in every other thing Orwell wrote is his ability to picture a real man, not a hero, not a perfect man, living a real life, hoping, fearing, wanting, messing up in little things, searching for bigger things. Read 1984 and regardless of its political pessimism, its author had a clear hold on what is like to be an ordinary man or woman trying to hold onto life even when it all seems too big to conquer."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"I decided to buy this because of the reputation of the author and both of the books as being &#34;classics&#34;. What a disapointment. I do get the point of trying to describe totalitarianism vicariously through the farm animals, but this is boring. I started reading it fast just to get it over with. 1984 starts out by dragging on and on. Finally, it starts to pick up about midway through. It has been stated that Orwell was trying to finish this book while on his 'death bed' and it shows. Whereas the beginning dragged on the ending certainly gives the feeling of being rushed. But, I have read it now and I will forever know where the terms &#34;Big Brother&#34; and &#34;Doublespeak&#34; originated. The book seems redundant because we see all of it in our daily lives right now with the doublespeak (a.k.a. lies) told to us everyday from politicians and news organizations alike. Maybe that's why I don't like the book - because we already live this stuff everyday, and it's telling me things that I already know."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"I cut out the forward since I believe the person to have written it to be an atheist and as a Christian I didn't want that and I didn't want to lend it to friends with that in there.The stories where scary and told stories of massive oppression.However they should be a lession to us as well of what can happen when certain people are allowed to go power mad and violate your God given basic rights that we all have.When things like The 7 Commandments Of Animalism are changed around,added on to, no matter how small can mean big trouble.We in the US for example need to remember our Consitutional rights and when they are violated we need to speak up and stand out ground of not letting this happen. Even today here in the US there are people in the government that have \\"pleged\\" to uphold the Consitution yet when that is done and over with they make up \\"loop-holes\\" or try to change around the words when they speak of it to suit they're own selfish needs and take advantage of people.These storys may have been fictional but they are based on the truth of something that can really happen and sadly still happens today in this world (ex.North Korea).We must stand up to defend our God given rights.

What sends shivers down our spines is not the various tortures O'Brien performed, but after these tortures, Winston's total capitulation&#61630;mind, body, and soul&#61630;to Big Brother. When the mind kowtows to external authority and ceases to reflect and question, then the individual had successfully metamorphosed into a machine.Winston, by editing previous documents to conform to Oceana's present position, such as whether Eurasia is friend or foe, had helped the regime's guardians, who like O'Brien believed \\"who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past,\\" mold the citizens' minds. But Oceana, like other totalitarian regimes, also turned to the indispensable tool, fear, to chisel its citizens' minds and hearts to its agenda's shape and form. To stimulate fear and rouse its citizens to a common cause, it would when necessary create fathom enemies, either Eurasia or Eastasia, even though these totalitarian regimes also had similar ideologies, or rather, like Oceana, no ideologies.Under 1984's dystopian sky, Winston must bow, not only because of Big Brother's overwhelming power and presence, but also because of Winston's inability to form any ideologies. Even though he wanted to think freely, he lacked the training and thus the analytical mind to counter O'Brien's offenses. In the end, his mind followed the path of least resistance.Orwell's 1984 is a dark apocalypse of sub-human society where homo-sapiens had replaced machines to operate an efficient hierarchy, an apocalypse which any people would usher wherever and whenever they ceased to question \\"intuitively obvious truths.\\""},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Keeping in mind both of these works were written in the 1940's, George Orwell comes across as visionary.Animal farm details an uprising by farm animals against their owner. Initial elation at their new found freedom turns to a somber, sorrowful existence of work, work, work with very little to show for it. The self proclaimed leader, Napoleon the pig, creates evil in the form of another pig who he runs off the farm. The need for fear is realized as a weapon used to control. Napoleon becomes more isolated and rules with an iron fist. The workers work harder and harder in the hopes of the bounty promised them by Napoleon. In reality, the lives of the majority have changed little between pre-revolution and post-revolution. Eventually, no one can distinguish between pigs and humans. All animals are created equal, but some are more equal than others.1984 - wow, what an absorbing read. A post-apocalyptic England is the setting for a dark tale of warning. We follow Winston as he struggles with the indoctrination handed to him 24/7 by Big Brother. War is peace, freedom is slavery and Ignorance is strength is the mantra for this dark, controlled world. The past is constantly changing as per the dictatorial orders and the proletariat are ruled by fear and summary justice. Again, the need for a constant threat is used as a form of propaganda which controls the masses as, they are led to believe, they are kept safe by Big Brother. So many parallels with recent world events.Reading both these works, readers notice similarities with what they see today. It's hard not to see elements of the story, especially 1984, in society today. The constant fear we see banded about, the promise of better times in return for hard work etc etc. Personally, I found myself wandering inside my own mind and equating what I was reading with my own life here in America. Orwell certainly seemed to have a crystal ball and, whether or not this is purely a musing on Orwell's part, it is certainly prophetic.The text is easy to read. Orwell strikes a marvelous balance between giving us just enough description to put us at the scene but not too much to leave us yawning as background overwhelms the narrative. The reader always knows where the protagaonist is in space and time. Also, we always know who the subject he or she is. Masterful stuff from a great author.Excellent work on Orwell's part."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Well, what can I say?

It is decentralization of power from the human being, in all aspects of one's life, to a higher power, a bigger cause, communism (more so in Animal Farm; but it would be error to say that it is just politics Orwell is hinting at) called the great Lucifer because all was given to the collective body and not to God, now God is the great Lucifer because we give ourselves to the collective body of something that we can not prove, so Science is the great Lucifer, producing weapons to kill the world a million times over, toxins to poison us a million times over, are all forms of giving to a collective body the nature of death? Is it the giving to a collective body that robs the soul of its power? Is it giving oneself wholly and utterly to something other than one's own self the conduit of decent into the investment of despair. 1984 sees men and women working their themselves to skin and bone to achieve a greater good that never emerges, the ultimate failings masked by a strict authoritative regime, BIG BROTHER, the power all seeing and ever controlling, rewriting history, editing the world around them, at war with this nation one minute and switching to another the next, neighbours up and vanish and protagonists invest in each other for but a fleeting glimpse of love only to be captured by the THOUGHT POLICE for engaging in illegal activity, men at the top of this society using torture and mind control to enforce a pathology of unquestionable and undeniable supremacy of all the power to the BIG BROTHER system, and that this is the system and that is why they are alive at all, at which point we question if it is worth living at all to which Orwell delivers a resounding, no, of course it is not worth living this life, why bother at all, and that this is a piece of work that must be understood by everyone and anyone who can read and is certainly mandatory reading for anyone in least bit interested in politics or political science.Unfortunately however we tend to vote in military commanders, lawyers and extreme capitalists into government and then ask why it is all going down hill.The problem is there is no terminology in the English language to describe the act of one human being killing their unborn future children by process of setting up a bad management system with a legal body incorporated into that system before they die. This prison kills, yet it is justified. 1984 is maybe that word, filicide being the closest English equivalent."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"The book came in even better condition than I expected!

Animal Farm is speculative fiction. The main characters are a pig named Napoleon and another pig named Snowball. Snowball and Napoleon were the leaders of the farm once it turned into Animal Farm.\\"The pigs did not actually work, but directed and supervised the others. With their superior knowledge it was natural that they should assume the leadership.\\"Napoleon didn't talk much and wasn't introduced until after the rebellion. He had a reputation of getting his way. Snowball was more talkative and did have a part in the initial rebellion. Snowball was a persuasive speaker.One of the big themes for Animal Farm was leadership and corruption. When the animals decided to rebel against Mr. Jones they wanted to be free with no leadership nor corruption. They thought it was a great idea. So, all the animals got together and rebelled. The first year it was great. They changed the name of the farm from Manor farm to Animal farm, they set up a set of 7 rules and got more crops then they did the previous year with Mr. Jones.Napoleon and Snowball and the other pigs were the leaders of the Animal Farm. Napoleon and Snowball never got along. They always fought and wanted different things for the farm. That is until one day Napoleon ran Snowball off the farm using nine dogs. And from then on, whenever something bad happened, they would blame Snowball for sneaking in in the middle of the night and doing it.Napoleon corrupted the farm. He let the pigs have special treatment and turned all the rules around and talked to humans and made deals with them and got money to buy things for the farm. All of this was was not to happen according to the original rules.This book is one big metaphor on how the government works today.I really enjoyed this book.

Now that the 20th Century is over and Communism and most forms of Marxism are considered obsolete, I read it again and gained new insight. For some reason, idealistic movements always have the great man or men (Marx and Trotsky in this case. Lenin is missing) and their brutal practitioners (Stalin). Orwell is of course a master and a necessary warning to those who are idealists. Reality is the real dictator. Perhaps that is why the democratic tolerant state is so important, but not for the obvious reasons. It is the only state that allows its representatives and its citizens to properly sense reality.

Even if you're just looking for 1984, this edition is to be commended; it comes with a fine introduction by today's leading Orwell enthusiast, Christopher Hitchens, and the reward of including Animal Farm requires very little in the way of additional effort or expense on your part. At 80-odd pages, you may as well pick it up in the same volume, and you're virtually certain to be glad that you did.I'm not alone in being of a generation that was first required to read Orwell in my student days (Middle School, in my case.) It seems that there was a lot of literature churned out then, accessible to if not directly aimed at children, with the horrors of totalitarianism as its theme. In addition to reading Orwell, we were also reading Huxley, Bradbury, and Verne -- the youth-oriented John Christopher books being yet another example. The generation that lived through Nazism and Stalinism clearly wanted the younger set to be aware of the horrors that could be, and to remain on guard against them.It doesn't seem to be quite that way anymore. Orwell's name is invoked today, but often in trivializing contexts: \\"Big Brother\\" is now a brain-numbing reality show, and \\"Orwellian\\" is a convenient and often hysterically-applied charge to political opponents. Some complaceny does seem to be inevitable: we are now further removed from the days when the likes of Hitler and Stalin killed tens of millions. Still, regimes arise that are nearly as horrific on a local scale, from Pol Pot to Saddam Hussein to the Taliban, and are real enough that Orwell's book is no joke. Orwell deserves attention if for no other reason than to sensitize us to the bad form associated with invoking his name in a trivializing context. There was a political ad on Youtube last year from an Obama supporter that cast Hillary Clinton on a giant Big Brother-like screen. I'm not in the least a fan of Senator Clinton, but associating her image with those of 1984 -- as was also done in an infamous Apple Computer ad -- trivializes Orwell's message in a deplorable way. Orwell wrote his novel to warn against real dangers that his generation lived through, and which others might yet, not as a marketing ploy to be used in selling either computers or nearly indistinguishable democratic political candidacies.The main reason I am writing this review, however, is that re-reading Orwell in my 40's is a stark reminder that his novels are more than political parables, but are worthy literature. I hope that those reading these reviews will be aware of this, and not shut their minds to a rewarding literary experience.As a kid, I was able to perceive the pedagogical intent of these books, but less so was I able to appreciate the literary artistry. 1984 in particular passes the Nabokovian test of creating a fully believable, if terrifying, alternate world. Beyond that, on nearly every page, Orwell leaves an image that just might stay with you forever. Small wonder that so many of the terms in 1984 (\\"Big Brother,\\" \\"Newspeak\\") have burrowed their way into our lexicography.Orwell was a man of the left who understood something that many of his compatriots did not; that what had arisen in the Soviet Union was a regime unprecedented in its horror (arriving before, and ultimately outlasting, its horrific mirror image, Hitler's Third Reich.) At a time when others on the left simply refused to believe in the reality of the USSR, he looked at it unflinchingly and wrote what it was really about.Also, in childhood, I was not able to fully appreciate that Orwell's books simply weren't negative-utopian nightmare-fantasies, but paralleled actual events in the USSR with chilling accuracy. I knew, at some level, that he was satirizing certain events and characters in the Russian Revolution, but only in adulthood was I able to closely recognize nearly every episode and character in Animal Farm. Those familiar with USSR history will find it all here in the two books: the rewriting of the past to reaffirm the infallibility of the Party, the sudden reorienting of national propaganda to suit the latest twist of foreign policy, and the complete elimination of all references to those unfortunate souls decreed never to have existed.Truly, the thing that makes 1984 terrifying now, is not what was imagined in the novel's construction, but what was real in its sources. It exaggerates even relative to the Stalinist state -- but not by much. It is this recognition that makes it a chilling read today.1984 is the more vivid and evocative of the two novels. Excepting one passage (Goldstein's dreary history lesson about 2/3 of the way through) it is riveting almost throughout its 300 pages.A few notes for younger readers: The moral of Animal Farm is not that Napoleon was simply a bad apple, but rather that the system adopted by the Animals ensured that ultimately such a tyrant would dominate. (I find the end of Animal Farm to be something of a false note; in the end the pigs prove no better than, and resemble, the humans they replaced, but this understates the tragic reality that the USSR was worse still than that which it replaced.)As I close, I leave you with one random question about 1984: how come it never occurs to Eastasia and Eurasia to combine against Oeania? Given that Oceania keeps flipping its allegiance from one to the other, you'd think they'd ultimately catch on and both decide to attack Oceania at the same time.Silly questions aside, this book is highly commended. Worth re-reading again, especially if you only have read Orwell when as immature as was I."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Because most people will review the actual book(s), which in this case are classics and I feel do not truly need a review, I will review this edition. Having the two in one is useful if you, like me, have not read the two prior to purchase or if you are a fan of both books. They are bound handsomely and the dust jacket is simple and smooth. The introduction is by someone who is obviously enamored with Orwell, and it gives some insight to the work and history of Orwell, though is mostly unecessary as you could probably wikipedia the information. This is a nice edition and I felt it was a good choice for me."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Animal Farm and 1984 are classic literature. You've probably already read them.This edition presents them in a classic manner -- it is a lovely book, lovely dust jacket, and Christopher Hitchens does the intro. I usually find him funny and a little snarky, but in this intro, he is serious, high-minded, informative, and respectful.I wanted to read 1984 again, since so many people are kicking around the terms \\"Orwellian\\" and \\"Big Brother\\" regarding current politics. I'm so glad this is the volume I bought. I know I would have gotten the same *words* in a flimsy paperback, but this was a really nice read.I read both novels again. It has been... 20 years? Maybe longer since my first read-through. I'm a different reader than I was before.I've got that grisly Room 101 scene back in my head -- I had forgotten that one. Thanks, Mr. Orwell.This is a lovely edition. Treat yourself."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"This was my first venture into audio books and I purchased this because I could get two books for only a few dollars more than 1. This turned out to be a great purchase. I do not own a cd player that plays MP3's, but I was able to put the disk into my computer and drag and drop the files into my portable MP3 player and copy the files onto my hard drive so that I can listen on my computer or convert the files to WAV myself and burn onto a standard CD.The boxed set is essentially a regular DVD sized box with a chapter listing. Nothing else is included, but you don't need anything else. The readers are wonderful. Very clear voices with nice inflection that doesn't distract from the story. Both these books are classic reads, so if you'd like reviews on the content of the books, I'd suggest you look up the paper editions as they are heavily reviewed and provide a lot of information.This version is unabridged so the same information should apply. As a matter of fact, much of the information is easier to understand when listening to it rather than reading it off the page - particularly the introduction portion which I normally just skip over to get to the story was very interesting and much more thought provoking to listen to than I would have expected.The sound is crystal clear and the product is highly recommended."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Simon Prebble and Ralph Cosham both do a fine job of narration. They both have easily understood English accents, and differentiated character voices that are not distracting and allow the listener to easily follow dialog between multiple characters.Both books are very good cautionary tales about over-mighty governments that remain unchecked by citizens. I am a naturally optimistic person, but after I read either one of these books I am forced to take a more warily critical look at the government and media. It is very important that all citizens do this occasionally to avoid becoming the sheep of Animal Farm or the blind party member of 1984."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"This is a fantastic piece of literature, but it is befuddled with typos.

It's part of a retirement project to read as many iconic works as possible that somehow I didn't get down to reading early in life. However, in this day and age of spellcheckers, why are there so many typos in this Kindle edition? It looks as if the works were scanned and translated into text by software, but not then checked. Come on Amazon, you can do better."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"I really wish these books were required reading when I was in school! I do remember watching the movie Animal Farm in 8th grade though, but I don't remember much of it. I was glad when I found the books here for such a reasonable price. These stories go very well with each other. I'm not going to give an entire book report on them, but here's a very basic rundown:Animal Farm- A group of animals on a farm (duh) overthrow their cruel master. Because the pigs are the cleverest of all the animals, they establish themselves as the \\"leaders\\" (although, their motto is \\"All animals are equal\\") Two pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, are consistently fighting with each other on how the farm should be run. Eventually, Napoleon trains some dogs, and they run Snowball out of the farm. After that, Napoleon basically turns the farm into a dictatorship under his rule. Towards the end of the book, Napoleon changes their motto to \\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\\".1984- In this society, based in what was once London (in the story, it is called Oceania), Big Brother controls everything and everyone. Almost every citizen has telescreens in their houses that can not be turned off. Not only do the telescreens broadcast all the time, but they also receive, so citizens could be watched, although you never know when they are watching you. The protagonist of the story, Winston, is a rebel of sorts. He purchases a diary, and writes in it (a crime punishable by death). Eventually, he ends up having an illegal romantic relationship with a woman named Julia. And, well, you'll have to read the rest, because I don't want to give too much away. It is a great read, although, there is a part towards the middle-ish end of the story where Winston is reading \\"The Book\\" (a book given to him by the \\"botherhood\\", the underground movement against Big Bother)That part is a bit dry, but it picks up after that.As far as the Kindle version I bought, I was going to go with the hard copy, but I went with the Kindle edition instead so I could read it instantly. I defiantly don't regret it, but there are some misspellings in the Kindle version. I'm not majorly picky about spelling, so it didn't bother me too much, but I feel this something that needs to be mentioned. If misspellings are a major issue with you, don't get the Kindle version. (although, I'm not sure about the spellings in the hard copy version either, but chances are, there are less). In my opinion, these both are stories everyone should read."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Many of us were assigned these books to read in school by thoughtful teachers. All of us should read them. In both, George Orwell gives us the tools to see exactly what liberty means and why we cannot afford to lose it.In \\"Animal Farm,\\" the fable is sufficiently removed from human experience that you can read this one to quite young children, just as you can \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" or other classics which say more each time you read them as you grow up. Even a first-grader could see the relationship of the politics of the barnyard to the politics of the playground. The jeering refrain of \\"Surely you don't want Jones back\\" can easily be recognized as the propaganda fallacy called \\"Reductio ad Hitlarum.\\" Whenever the ruling pigs ran out of useful things to say, they fell back on slogans which meant nothing, but which could be molded to mean whatever they wanted them to mean in a given circumstance.The completely classic \\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\\" is one we must keep in mind whenever politicians start using words as if they mean the reverse of what they do mean.1984, too, has its beautifully classic lines. The main characters are all members of the Ingsoc Party (English Socialism). It is not until well into the book that we learn they are only some 15% of the population; the rest are proles. The proles are easily dismissed as insignificant: \\"They can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect.\\" Use that line the next time someone tells you it's not important to educate our entire population to the best of their capabilities.When the main character, Winston Smith, attempts to placate his tormenter by saying \\"You are ruling over us for our own good,\\" he is scorned as \\"stupid, Winston, stupid.\\" The party big shot responds with one of the most chilling lines I have ever read: \\"If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face--forever.\\"Through the medium of conversations in the lunch room of the \\"Ministry of Truth,\\" Orwell is able to tell us much about the creation and preservation of a totalitarian state. One key is the control over language which the Party exercises: \\"Newspeak.\\" One of the people working on the Newspeak dictionary explains it to Winston: \\"You think, I dare say, that our chief job is inventing new words. But not a bit of it! We're destroying words--scores of them, hundreds of them, every day. We're cutting language down to the bone.\\" He brags that very soon \\"all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared. The whole literature of the past will have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron--they'll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely changed into something different, but actually changed into something contradictory of what they used to be.\\"Putting these two in a single hardbound volume and adding a thoughtful introduction by Christopher Hitchens was a stroke of genius on the part of Harcourt Books. It will make it all the easier for professors of political science, literature, history, psychology . . . indeed, if it was not such a contradiction with regard to books so dedicated to liberty, I'd say make them required reading."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Six decades later, his work still speaks to us. Orwell's Animal Farm & 1984 are important pieces of literature and should be required reading for all.

Who knows, maybe the powers-that-be are using his books as a guide on what to do.Regardless, you owe it to not only yourself but every other decent American to get this book. Good people suffer when ignorance is widespread. Don't be one of the ignorant ones. Buy this book and prepare yourself for some bad times ahead."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"I just have to agree with the many reviews here. This is some SERIOUS high quality binding. The book looks great. The spine is black with classy white lettering and looks great on book shelves. The front and back cover have the parchment look. And the quality of the paper is high. No cheap 'see-through' newsprint looking paper here. And most important, it's standard, tight spine binding, not the cheap library style binding (where the pages on the outside spine kind of have the wave pattern).For those who don't have a copy but like these works, buy this edition. For those who have a copy of either book and want to trade up to a serious collectible version (like me) do so! This is the best looking version I have seen yet.There is also a lovely introduction by Christopher Hitchins and a nice appendix about Newspeak (from 1984). I won't spend too much on the actual books themselves except to say that these are two of the greatest modern classics in the English language. 1984 is among my favorite novels and it is a very relevant novel in today's society. Along with Fahrenheit 451, I think these two dystopian novels show a future which is very possible. Animal Farm is a little less relevant today since the USSR went away, but it still is chilling nonetheless to view a kind of parody on a totalitarian state.These are novels that I enjoy reading multiple times. And 1984 is the one novel that at one point actually made me jump and say \\"Oh [insert appropriate expetive here]\\". If you've read it you probably know the part. (We are the dead.) And let's not forget room 101. Seriously one of the finest novels ever written and the arguably the iconic Dystopian novel, the one that gave rise to the term \\"Orwellian\\". Buy and read multiple times. But I seriously cannot rate this edition highly enough."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Nineteen Eighty-Four, by George Orwell, is a novel set in a Dystopian World War II era. In this imagination of a future from someone in the Ninteen forties, Oceania, where the novel takes place, is under a totalitarianistic rule. Big Brother, the dictator, is seldom, if never seen, and there exists three classes below him - the Inner Party (high ranking officials), Outer Party (Middle Class), and the Proles (proletarians, bottom class). Winston Smith, the protagonist, is a cynical historical record forger for the government. He despises his job, Big Brother, and also the totalitarian regime. One day, he happens to meet Julia, a revolutionary like him, and forming a forbidden (by the government) relationship, they rebel the government by night while working by day, maintaining their double life. I thought the book was very eruditely written, a masterpiece of George Orwell. Orwell's style conveys as much as there is needed to know, enough to grasp a solid, tangible picture of the scene going on, and then some in more opulent situations. He even manages to word feelings that humans have a hard time describing, using the momentum of the scene to convey these feelings, a remarkable feat. During the \\"Two Minute Hate\\", one of the events in Nineteen Eighty-Four, as a reader I could see the rancorous, primal, enmity that was going on in the scene. Orwell even manages to imbue what seems like his own political opinions and conclusions in the guise of a book written by Emmanuel Goldstein, one of the unseen characters of whom was ousted by the Inner Party and drenched in rancid propaganda who is rumored to be alive and operating a revolutionary group. Additionally, Orwell sets up situations so well, it's almost as if the reader can picture the grime on the walls of Winston's apartment, or the omniscient glare of the telescreens (one channel televisions that have camera and microphones to observe citizens). Another one of Orwell's strengths in writing is his ability to set in themes that run throughout the entire story. Themes of oppression, repression, lack of freedom, and also the manipulation of truth and power are evident throughout the entire story. Everywhere, from the Proles to the Inner Party, readers can see that their freedoms are limited - though the characters may choose what to do, they are severely limited in what they're allowed to think - any thought against the government is known as \\"Thought Crime\\", and according to Winston Smith, \\"Thought Crime doesn't entail death. Though Crime is death\\". Another major point of Orwell's tale is how the characters are set up. Winston Smith seems at first a bit contrived as one of the \\"only people sentient in the flock of people\\", yet still displays his own signs of originality such as his cynicality and original thoughts. I felt that Winston's actions are pretty justifiable, more than for the reason of the author demonstrating governmental brutality. Winston secretly despises the party, and therefore has his own thoughts, feelings, convictions. Having the tenacity to rebel against the government as openly and as dangerously as possible without getting himself killed takes a lot of guts. Moreover, he accepts the fact that he's already dead from the day he committed thoughtcrime, so he adopts a \\"all out\\" mentality. Julia's actions, however, aren't as independent as Winston's, or at least, as readers, we do not see how much more her personal life is besides her relationship with Winston. Though I would say her actions and mentality in rebelling with Winston are justifiable, readers do not really get to see her own independent thought or actions like they do Winston's. Overall, the things that I liked most about the book is the pacing and 'feel' of the book. There's a certain way the syntax moves so that as a reader, I can see the colorful language, and yet have no need to stop and think about any potential ambiguity. The reading of the book slides easily and smoothly, and the range of emotions felt is flawless and very real. When Winston felt enmity towards Big Brother, I felt like throwing a book or something at Big Brother. When Winston felt apprehensive, or nervous, I could understand the furtiveness he was feeling as he wrote his diary, also an action banned by the government. The book, overall, was a delightful, harrowing read that will thrill and challenge the minds of any sci-fi or retro enthusiast, or even mild horror enthusiasts."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"These are books 2 and 3 in my 2012 quest to read 25 books that are most often targets of banning attempts. My motto is \\"if they want it banned then it must be worth reading\\". I was already familiar with \\"1984\\" but am sad to admit I had never read \\"Animal Farm\\". I'm sure this will be a recurring theme, but it saddens me that I never read it earlier. As with any book review, I do not want to spill the plot, but suffice it to say that the (potential future) world Orwell paints in vivid detail is not always a pretty one. Both these books should serve as a reminder of what could happen if we let it.These are two very thought provoking novels. They are not \\"fun\\" in any way, but they are both addicting and difficult to put down once started.Regardless of your age or political leaning, I highly recommend giving both a read.

They are housed in cardboard pockets, so care is needed when removing them to prevent scratches. The first \\"Animal Farm\\" disc opens with an 18-minute introduction on the original release of the novel during the same month when the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki took place. Coincidentally, some thought (and many historians today believe) the atomic bombs were as much a message sent to the Soviets (the Russian Revolution and Stalin's Purges, of course, were parodied in Orwell's novel) as an attack on Japan to end WWII. It also explains why \\"Animal Farm\\" is considered a \\"fairy story.\\" The introduction was mildly interesting, but hard to follow at times, and seemed longer than it needed to be as I was anxious to hear the story. There is no introduction for \\"1984.\\"Simon Prebble (\\"1984\\") and Ralph Casham (\\"Animal Farm\\") give excellent readings that bring life to the stories. They speak clearly and even give voices to the characters.

Both stories can usher feelings of outrage and anger towards the characters, especially \\"Animal Farm.\\" At the end of that story I hated that pig Napoleon.

One example was at a small grocery store by my house. The owner and I often make small talk and one day he noticed I had this book with me.

Next thing I know I found myself sitting out in my car for 25 minutes after arriving at my hotel transfixed by the power of the reading. Some parts of 1984 that had never caught my full attention before were illuminated by hearing some other voice than my own speak them. For example, I have always loved the phrase \\"We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.\\" and wondered what kind of tone would these words would be spoken in. Should this phrase be spoken like a vow or promise? Should it be spoken like a flat fact? Should it be spoken with a smile, a frown, a far off look? This narrator chose the musing tone of a foregone conclusion, like a thoughtful old gentleman saying \\"We will have biscuits with our tea tomorrow.\\" I totally approved.

Mostly, I listen to the classics.Where did the terms \\"big brother\\" and \\"big brother is watching\\" come from? They came from the book 1984 by George Orwell.1984 is one that I read in high school because I was required to do so and learned little from it -- it seemed complex and the teacher kept talking about the threat of communism. Now, the sound is more relevant, the words more precise, and the democracy we have seems to be more delicate and vulnerable to the dangers proposed by Orwell.1984 talks to the impact of the full use of technologies we have available today. For example, today it is possible to have two-way video and two-way audio transmissions in/from each home. What if the government provided those technologies to everyone to help improve our security, our physical fitness, and our economic well-being? Of course the government would be on the other side of the two-way part. That was the promised use of these technologies in 1984. As the five-year plans in Russia demonstrated, government controlled goals over such things can describe socio-economics plans and processes which are not obtainable, much less desired. What happens to love and romance and intimacy? These are elements of our privacy and human needs addressed by the government in 1984. What happens to individuality and creativity if the government is in constant two-way communications with all citizens? The book is intense and intellectual. The individual reading the book to you is effective providing us the feeling of the various characters. I liked it all.The bonus with this audio book is you get Animal Farm, too. Although a fantasy and not possible (as 1984 is possible), the lesson is genuine and relevant. We must listen to what our government is doing, read 3rd party reporting, and push back on changes we feel are wrong. It seems intuitive. It is not. The crowd may be against us, not because they disagree with our logic but because they lack all the information to participate in the discussion. And to get all the information takes time and objective reporting. The book has animals speaking, thinking, teaming, and warring. It provides no solution. It provides us a sensitive look at how silly and dangerous we can be in the governments we support, whether in Seattle, Moscow or Tokyo.Orwell was brilliant. He thought through some of these things for you and made them consumable. You will enjoy and be frustrated by listening to his stories. He wrote precisely. He shared his view of the role government might play. I liked his word choice, his grammar, and his character development. There are several surprises in both books waiting for you."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"After having read both 1984 and Animal Farm multiple times, I purchased this hardbound book with both titles.

While the left may tend to want to cite these novels the most (the Patriot Act as \\"Big Brother\\"), there is probably more ammunition for the right, particularly in today's politically correct culture. Think former N.O.W. executive and conservative lesbian Tammy Bruce's book \\"The New Thought Police\\". A good historical/political read regardless of your political persuasion."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"George Orwell was a genuis and if he were alive, he wouldn't have to be spinning in his grave right now, watching the world of '1984' descending upon our heads.For those of us who read it before '1984' it was a frightful tale of a possibly impending future. For those of us who grew up after '1984' it's more of a big \\"So what?\\" as it isn't nearly so different from the current reality as it ought to be, unfortunately.These books are very entertaining, mind you, and very well written; but they were not written to entertain, but to instruct. I would suggest you read them with an open mind and for entertainment, the first time, and then go back later and read with the understanding that he intended to highlight some of the more despicable aspects of society and the world at large."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"George Orwell's classic works warning against the rise of the State as the arbiter and guardian of human well-being are more pertinent now than ever. While the threat of Communism is receding, there is an American intellectual love-affair with socialism that ignores the quagmire that Western Europe has become and remains well after the fall of the Soviet Union.In easy to understand, simplistic storytelling, Orwell traces the replacement of one system of domination and exploitation with another in \\"Animal Farm\\". And astute followers of current events as well as history will note more than a few startling prognostications in \\"1984\\". Relegating these books to the Cold War period does not do them justice or adequately account for the many guises that human avarice and greed for power can take.These stories should be mandatory reading - not just in school, but throughout our lives as reminders of how quickly and easily freedom can be replaced with slavery."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"This comment concerns 1984 as narrated Richard Brown. It is not a review of the book.Mr. Brown has such a thick British accent it's very difficult to understand him at times. If you turn it up too loud in an attempt to hear him through his accent, you'll hurt your ears when he hits the hard s's and t's. If you have trouble with British accents, I do not recommend this version."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Countless analyses have been done in a far more complete fashion than anything I could write here. They are both frightening novels about what happens when your nation goes down the road to Communism. &#34;Animal Farm&#34; tells us of the Russian Revolution in the form of a fable with different animals taking the places of historical figures such as Lenin or Stalin. &#34;1984&#34; shows us what a world of the near future might possibly look like if the entire world became Communist. Read them if you have an interest in classic fiction that teaches you a harsh lesson about the evils of Communism. If you're a hard-core Left-wing agitator however, you'll think the books are a crock and will hate them."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"love the item, glad I purchesed it would order again. fast and reliable service and it was excatly what i needed"},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"I actually only wanted 1984, but decided to purchase this because hey its 2 books for the price of 1.The forwards to these books are well done and give perspective to the time period and reasons that George Orwell wrote them.

It was a pleasure to revisit this timeless story, since read the last time I it I was a teenager.History repeats itself throughout the ages."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Read it. These are the books that are being used this very day as as play-by-play guides on how to subvert a people. The most uncomfortable part about re-reading these two great works by Orwell, is that we are worse than we have ever been in the USA. Much worse, than when I was a young lad, and reading these as mandatory homework in school.If you are a young person today, and have not read these books; my first question is why? If you want to understand a lot more about our political situation, read them both. Pay particular attention to &#34;doublespeak&#34; and &#34;face crime&#34;. On a more detailed note, when I first read these books back in the early 70's, the &#34;face crime&#34; thing seemed a little far fetched back then. The technology just wasn't there yet. A few months ago, I was reading about a new technology that will enable computers to examine facial expressions via camera. The computers will pick up what it thinks is a look of nervousness or stress in an individual, and alert the all watching eyes. The first people to use this tech, will likely be the TSA. Wonder why you are being pulled out of the line for further questioning? You may have committed a face crime. Bone chilling.A must read for every citizen on the planet."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"These books are absolutely outstanding and truly prophetic of what came to pass in the communist countries.

Re-reading the parts about the endless wars and constantly shifting loyalties gave me the chills. We're already almost there people."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Reading it once again just reminded me of why this book is a classic.

There was much discussion of how like the (then) USSR's government seemed to parallel the Animal Farm characters and their behavior, and the controls on information in the Soviet Union at that time seemed right out of 1984.It is absolutely astonishing to see the parallels that present themselves in the current US government, and the media (controlling information and disinformation) as well. I would love to see a discussion of what role people see our president in: Squealer or Napoleon. And if he's Squealer, who is Napoleon?Please read, or reread, these books!!! Orwell was warning the world--we should be listening!!"},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"I can't believe I made it through both high school and college without reading these classics. Both of these need to be mandatory reading for all high school seniors."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"I purchased this book after having read Animal Farm some time ago in high school. However I had not read 1984, and the concepts it revolved around fascinated me. After reading the book, I can quite easily see why it is a classic.Orwell paints a splendid picture of a world that we would like to avoid, and in doing so he raises our consciousness to the far reaching implications it has in a modern society. It is a beautifully written reminder about the dangers of conformity, in the face of imposed authority, and dishonest media."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Animal Farm and 1984 are both so well known (and incidentally one could check other editions for more detailed individual reviews) I shall limit myself to saying this about the works themselves: both are very powerful and 1984 ranks among my top books of all time. As for the edition itself, I would suggest to someone who is interested in either of these novels and does not yet own a copy of them to buy this edition. Even if you have a copy of one, I for example had the signet classic of 1984, this is still a good option. You get an attractive hard cover that conveniently has both the novels for a decent price. In addition the overall quality is good. The text is extremely readable due to a nice font size-a big improvement form the mass market editions."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Of all the books I've ever read, Animal Farm is by far the most memorable. George Orwell's insight into human nature is just astounding! In the story, he captures and puts into words the exact thoughts, feelings and emotions many people exhibit when they come into a position of power. Animal Farm should be required reading in all public schools."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Quite simply 1984 is one of the most brilliant novels of the 20th century. The main character, Winston, is an allegory of every low level bureaucrat working within the Stalin regime - constantly asked to numb the senses, dull the mind and commit blatant deception in favour of the all controlling party. Devastatingly moving, the book covers a desolate existence without ever becoming utterly depressing. It will engage you in one of the most interesting stories ever written. The story about the story is as interesting as the story itself. George Orwell, dying of tuberculosis, wrote the story in his final months, culminating in his final flourish and his finest work. One shall always wonder whether we were denied the peak of his talents or whether his imminent death inspired it. Either way, 1984 is a book that shall never succumb.George Orwell demonstrates how to economise length and still wallop the reader with powerful symbolism and satire in the story of Animal Farm. Indeed, the satirical nature of the book is plainly evident to anyone who knows about the Stalin regime and without even a hint of subtlety, the story demonstrates the obvious weaknesses of socialism. Interestingly, I read in Christopher Hitchens' Arguably that the faithful car horse Boxer was an allegory of Jurgis in Upton Sinclair's novel The Jungle, uttering these same futile words \\"I will work harder.\\" The similarities of Animal Farm and The Jungle are also present in the societal hierarchy where to quote Hitchens \\"no honest person can ever hope to win.\\" Animal Farm is an easy read and is deliberately devoid of complex language, seemingly making the worst of dictatorship child's play. It is without argument one of the most important books of the 20th century.This particular packaging, with Christopher Hitchens' introduction and lovely hard covering, adds real value to the reading experience."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"I enjoyed reading both of these George Orwell novels, but found them distressing at the same time, especially 1984. I remember watching the movie on TV fifty years ago, but reading the book has ten times the impact.It's amazing how well Orwell could project into the future and describe so well the very things we are experiencing today, the loss of freedoms, the micromanaging involvement of the government into our daily lives, the Thought Police, control of what words were permitted, constant survaillance in our lives, continually rewriting history to fit the political agenda, Doublespeak, Doublethink, etc.Now, after reading 1984, I found many news items triggering mental images of what was contained in this Orwell novel. It's truely scarry.This book should be on the library shelves of every home in America."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Mr. Orwell has always been a great read.Animal Farm is one of my favorite books. Its satirical look at Communism is priceless and timeless. Unfortunately, for those younger readers who have limited memory of the old Soviet Union, they may find some of the skillfully crafted yet subtle satire difficult to recognize.As to 1984, it is also well worth another visit to \\"Big Brother,\\" \\"newspeak,\\" and \\"Ingsoc\\" (English Socialism of the future time). There is also a wonderful appendix on the grammer of newspeak (the language in which politically incorrect meaning is progressively and deliberately stripped from words).The volume is very handsome and of high quality - a great addition to a personal library."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"I enjoyed this book from cover to cover.

They as classical masterpieces and, more importantly, are simply excellent books. While I would rate both of these books as five stars, I enjoyed 1984 more, maybe because we can start to see some of the stuff in that book seeping into our society today, and it's quite scary to realize that nearly 60 years ago, Orwell predicted some things so closely."},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Animal Farm is a very creative way to show the short comings, brainwashing, and absolute control of the Russian government and of communism in the 1st half of the 1900s. 1984 is a great story that especialy now is important because of todays government. It talks about a controlling english government that is removing people that think and have ideas contrary to what they wish them to be. They also use fear tactics in the media to get the people unquestioningly on thier side. This book, a MUST!"},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Orwell was a socialist and genuinely believed in the ideals represented by Lenin's revolution in Russia. So when Stalin came to power and the dream of communism crumbled to a very different reality Orwell was very disturbed. The novels Animal Farm and 1984 were both written in response to the failure of socialism in Russia.1984 - The novel is always dark. No happy beginning, no happy middle and no happy ending. It follows the story of Winston Smith. He lives in a society in which the government can at any time monitor anyone. Hidden microphones and cameras are omnipresent. He doesn't love the government, which is the only crime recognized - a thought crime. It is important to read this book before throwing around terms like \\"Orwellian\\" and \\"Big Brother\\" It has been so influential on society that it introduced these terms which are now used by people who haven't read the book.Animal Farm - A less shocking variation on the theme of corruption, told in the form of a children's story. It tells the story of animals who overthrow the oppressive farmer and found a government based on the principle of equality: \\"All animals are equal.\\" The pigs are more intelligent and so have the leadership roles in the new Animal Farm. There is a pig counterpart for Trotsky and Lenin and Stalin and every other leader of Russia from the revolution until the 40's. The plot to Animal Farm parallels the history of Russia. Things go from idealistic to very bad, and eventually \\"All animals are created equal, some are more equal than others.\\""},{"Title":"George Orwell: Animal Farm-Nineteen Eighty-Four","review":"Should be required reading.

Big Brother is a metaphor for Big Government, and Big Gov't has only one goal, absolute power over the citizenry. It's a scary vision of what happens when the masses relinquish control over their lives for the crumbs of the ruling oligarchy.

Historical fiction and writing at its best."},{"Title":"The Perfect Joy of Saint Francis","review":"easy to read and beautifully written in novel form, this story of the life of Francis as a true follower of Jesus is perfect.a must read for followers of Francis and those interested in his story and ministry"},{"Title":"The Perfect Joy of Saint Francis","review":"I have read a number of biographies of St. Francis, including:\\"Saint Francis\\" by Nikos Kazantzakis\\"Saint Francis of Assisi\\" by Ivan Gorby\\"God's Fool\\" by Julien Green\\"Saint Francis of Assisi\\" by G.K. Chesterton\\"The Life of St. Francis\\" by St. BonaventureWhile each of these books has its strengths and approaches the Saint of Assisi from a different angle, I have to say that \\"The Perfect Joy of Saint Francis\\" is my favorite St. Francis biography. What I love most about this book is that it beautifully conveys the passion behind the saint - his all-consuming desire to follow, and imitate, our Lord Jesus Christ, regardless of the consequences. Too many modern images of Francis lead one to see him as an eccentric lover of nature who led a pseudo-hippie movement. Yet the real Francis was consumed with one thing - complete abandonment to Jesus Christ. His example has inspired thousands through the ages, and even today there are many who follow his example in a radical way (such as the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal based in New York City; incidentally, the endorsement on the back cover of this book is written by Fr. Benedict Groeschel, one of the founders of that order).\\"Perfect Joy\\" takes its name from the revealing exchange between the saint and his most devoted follower, Brother Leo, in which Francis told Leo that perfect joy does not come from accumulated wisdom, beautiful teaching, or successful preaching. Instead, perfect joy is found in accepting trials without complaint, bearing insults charitably, and enduring sufferings gladly for the love of Christ. This truly sums up the outlook of Francis: the things of this world do not matter in comparison to the glory of following Jesus Christ.If you are looking for one book that reveals the depths of greatness of St. Francis of Assisi, then I recommend buying \\"The Perfect Joy of Saint Francis.\\" You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Perfect Joy of Saint Francis","review":"Great bio of an amazing Saint.

That being said, everything that happens to Francis throughout this story is based off of actual events from his real life. And Felix Timmermans did his best to fill in the parts that history did not record.This book grew and solidified my desire to follow in the foot steps of Saint Francis of Assisi and become a Capuchin Franciscan.

It showed me how to develop patience, cheerfulness, surrender to God's will, humility, perseverance, compassion, austerity, sacrifice, charity, and so many, many other virtues that Saint Francis profusely manifested. This book, so sweetly and affectionately written, was truly a festival for my soul. St. Francis showed me the magnificence of God's grace upon all who develop the habit of depending on Him, praying to Him, following His commandments, and serving Him with love.

Ed. Sept. 1874. Re-Pub. 2007. SC 675/523 pgs. 152 Index 152 pgs. 8 7/8\\" x 6 1/8\\".This has heavy, loquacious prose, characteristic of 19th Century writing style which provided greater specificity in meaning, and, simultaneously instilling a greater rather than lesser wordiness in construction of logically structured thoughts, hereby occasioning some modest rereading frequency by many for clarity.What is especially notable in Darwin's writings was his attempt to provide such completeness of theory as to insure and provide full grounds for one to contemplate his (Darwin's) possession of feelings of insecurity - or, perhaps, by a compelling fear that any understatement might provide weakness of his arguments allowing someone else gaining recognition for his theory. Nonetheless, the works by Darwin are monumental and the work of a genius - especially in the amount of material he instilled into his \`proofs', all without aid of a word processor or computer. I imagine he may have used index cards. He touched only lightly on the topic of creationism, knowing controversy would erupt, but, he nonetheless reserved a room for God; Charles was, himself, a caring, sincere, sensitive person and worldly person.The book is a slow, at times tedious, read; and, after 182 pages, the subject matter turns to \\"Principles of Sexual Selection\\" that deals with the secondary sexual characters: how those arose, became transformed and were progressively modified by sexual selection (sexual choices) rather than natural selection. This subject is taken up systematically by Orders & Classes, from lowest to highest, and finally to the Mammals, Primates, etc. to Man/Woman where virtually everything is considered: -- size, hairiness, strength, beauty, marriage customs, etc. The extensiveness of detail, often appearing minute, in diverse species or subspecies, geographic location, herd size, foods, etc. is awesome - but Darwin supported is writings with intensely scripted references to learned scholars in botany, biology, and anthropology, that, along with numerical support of his data, provides a comfortable bed for his arguments in support of his Natural Selection Theory.Interestingly, even with DNA evidences to support Ontogeny and Phylogeny, there are those who still see only a fabrication of purposeful lies by atheists and non-God Fearing peoples.- finis -"},{"Title":"The descent of man and selection in relation to sex","review":"In anticipation of the 140th anniversary of its publication, and since I was so impressed with hisThe Origin Of Species: 150th Anniversary Edition, _The Descent of Man_ was a natural selection. (Sorry about the pun.) I must admit, I struggled with the book.As with _Origins_, it is dense reading: not only is it non-fiction, but Darwin writes for a 19th century audience in a 19th century style. I can get past this without difficulty, but readers be prepared for it. What I struggled with the most was his disucssion of variability within species as it pertains to \\"race\\" among humans. Again, I make allowances given the time and circumstances the book was written - no one, I would hope, would confuse melanin levels within humans as evidence of species variation today. (DNA coding of the human genome show us that the differentiation between \\"races\\" is less than .001. Therefore \\"race\\" is put in quotation marks, as it is biologically a meaningless term and is instead a purely social construct.) Darwin, of course, did not have the advantage of this science, so I let it slide. What I found myself shaking my head about again and again was his use of culture, anthropology and sociology to illustrate what he saw as sub-species differentiation in humans. For example, Darwin used of regional differences in the height and size of American servicemen in the Civil War as proof of emerging species variation - as if diet and social class weren't equally responsible for these variations as genetics alone. Never mind his exploration of non-Europeans verus Europeans as examples of variation within the human race. _The Descent of Man_ is rife with such examples. Later, Darwin takes his idea of evolution well beyond the biological and alludes to moral evolution as well. No doubt these silly non-biological claims of Darwin continue to please those who seek to whole-heartedly reject his ideas, including Darwin's very real contributions to science. This is too bad, as it serves to muddy the waters of his many brilliant and ground-breaking ideas.To his credit, Darwin gets a remarable amount of information correct, and clearly points succeeding scientists in the right direction. His discussion of the inheritance of mental characteristics, for example, are prescient considering mental diseases like bi-polar disorder that are only recently understood as an inherited trait. Similarly, his looking to primates for an understanding of human behavior continues to this day. (SeeMan the Hunted: Primates, Predators, and Human Evolution, Expanded Editionfor more on this.) Darwin's greatest claim (and sadly, like so much of his work, a claim that is misunderstood) is that humans and other primates share a *common* ancestor. No, Virginia, Darwin never claimed man was descended from a gorilla.Given the historical and scientific significance of the book alone, I would award it 5 stars. For the difficulty of language and the blending of biology, anthropology, sociology and economics, I deducted a star.

In fact this first part tries to show and discuss the superiority of the human species over all other animal species. Since I am not a geneticist I will concentrate on this first part.The first remark I will make here is that he overuses the terms \\"barbaric\\", \\"barbarian\\", \\"savage\\", \\"primitive\\" and \\"primeval\\", this last one being the least reprehensible. This dates the book as a 19th century book. But when we have said that, we can overlook that stylistic element even when it is systematically opposed to \\"civilized\\" meaning the western world of the time.He fundamentally reduces everything to genetics. Everything is explained with a \\"natural\\" argumentation that is to say an argumentation that refers to genetic rules and functioning. His discussion of rudimentary organs, organs that are evolving out of an organism (wisdom teeth, coccyx, etc), and nascent organs, organs that are appearing and have a great use, seems to lead to the fact that the non-use of an organ makes it disappear and a systematic action over several generations is bringing in the organ necessary to do it. In fact the rudiments are typically organs that are not mutating out but regressing because of the absence of use and what he calls nascent organs are in fact the development of some muscles or organs that are there and are used intensively in some environments. His best example is the thin legs of some Amazonian tribes whose men spend their life sitting in canoes. When compared with the legs of a long distance runner we could say the latter has nascent leg muscles and the former rudimentary leg muscles. Ut us not because we eat fat that we develop a gall bladder, but exactly the reverse. The function does not produce the organ but the organ produces the function. (Nothing to see with Montaigne's discussing justice)This idea is essential when he starts dealing with the mental capabilities, moral qualities and linguistic abilities of man. He says over and over again that those things are acquired in some situations in which human beings live or have to live. But yet he seems to more or less imply that some moral qualities like love and sympathy could be the human development of an animal instinct: human love, in spite of what he may say, has little to do with the \\"love\\" (it looks more like dependence) of a dog for his master.But his approach of language is absolutely and amazingly simplistic. First he speaks of the linguistic abilities of some monkeys but does not analyze them. Then he speaks of man inventing language from his attempt to imitate nature, hence reducing the linguistic ability to onomatopoeias. And then he moves to nothing but the great variety of consonants and vowels. But he does not question why man and no other \\"speaking\\" animal has developed those numerous consonants and vowels, and the ability to associate them, and what's more the possibility to conceive words by associating a cluster of sounds to a meaning, and then the ability to build sentences by building up functions that have to come from the social discursive situation in which man is always living.It is this reduction of man's \\"mental powers\\" as he says that more or less prevent him from understanding what moral values and empathy and many other human feelings can be and he never gets close to the real nature of thought. His discarding the belief in god, or any superior being (he does not take into account superior forces) as some kind of unacceptable fancy of some human communities is typical of his inability to understand that the conceptual power he hints at from time to time is the way man will try to explain the world and language will be the tool for that explanation to be built and then to be shared and then to be honored and then to be ritualistically reinforced. God or no god is not the question. Even the canonical Buddhists who do not believe in god believe in the existence of a superior force in nature that governs us entirely because we are part of nature.Thus he can conclude on this subject: \\"the difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind.\\" This is pass&eacute;, outdated and it does not understand that articulated language and articulated language only gives man and man only the capability to conceptualize and hence to develop a thought that no other animal can develop.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID"},{"Title":"The descent of man and selection in relation to sex","review":"The book was excellent.

At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Schaaffhausen has remarked (18. 'Anthropological Review,' April 1867, p. 236.), will no doubt be exterminated. The break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilised state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as now between the negro or Australian and the gorilla.\\"Darwinism concludes that races such as Africans are less evolved and should be exterminated so that the development of the superior races can continue unhindered.Therefore, racism is a logical, and morally justified consequence according to Darwin. One cannot co-opt Darwinism and hold disagreement with the idea that mankind exists in various stages of development according to the theory of evolution. In order to guarantee the evolution of the species, the highest order of man should take it upon himself to ensure his survival at the cost of the lowest order of man.I am not a religious person by the way.

To Darwin's discharge I must say that he wrote at a time where most readers were white males, so he was not expecting women or non-whites to read this book I guess he would be horrified if he saw that we have educated the &quot;inferior races&quot; (or &quot;savages&quot; as he calls them) and that we have also given equal rights to women.)What I find most valuable with this book is that, after reading it, I realize it is the key for understanding the 20th century. I agree with the other reviewers that the 20th century has been mainly influenced by Darwinism. And I add that this happened not only in a direct way, but also indirectly through nazism/facism and marxism/socialism/communism (were'nt Marx and Engels darwinists, and did not Marx want to dedicate his book Das Kapital to Darwin, although the latter refused to have his name associated with marxism?) And was not WWI driven by the &quot;biological necessity&quot; of selection, as the Germans would put it? Darwin's Descent of Man helps understand why the 20th century was the bloodiest ever, with, besides WWI and WWII, the nazi's killing 6 millions innocent Jews (an inferior race according to Darwinism) and the socialists murdering over 100 millions innocents civilians who were not embracing socialism quickly enough. But Darwin's The Descent of Man explains also the differences in the birth policies of the socialist regimes. I now understand why the Chinese, unlike the Russians and East Europeans (white socialists), have applied such self-destructive anti-birth policies: because being Asian, they are, according to Darwinism, an inferior race, thus should disappear at some point to free space for the favored, most superior race (whites.)Darwin's ideas still raise some questions. If whites are the most superior, favored race, and blacks on the contrary the most inferior race, why is it that whites have been strongly decreasing in proportion during the 20th century, whereas blacks have been proliferating? Even worse, whites will probably have become extinct over one or few centuries, whereas humans will be then blacks or hybrids with black blood, or arabic semites, latinos and Asian? Would this mean that whites, although the most evolved, are the most UNfit for survival, and hat on the contrary blacks are the most fit for survival?

Of course, times have changed, our hopefully less euro-centric views have been altered and there has been considerable progress through the generations since the original publication by Darwin, and that makes the progress of human knowledge all the more fascinating, as well as the insight Darwin obviously possessed in his day. This one's a &quot;must-read&quot; for anyone interested in the history of science."},{"Title":"The descent of man and selection in relation to sex","review":"It wasn't until a few years after the publication of The Origin of Species (1859) that natural selection completely overhauled biology as the unification principle widely sought after to explain uniformity and diversity in living things, Darwin had himself uncovered a type of natural selection, sexual selection, mentioned it briefly in Origin but held back on explaining it fully because it would require more work to do so. The result was the 2 volume The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex published in 1871 that spanned nearly 700 pages. Here both volumes are presented in one.Darwin and Wallace had co-discovered natural selection as the main mechanism of evolution. Wallace however had succumbed to supernatural explanations and had largely refused to accept that sexual selection could produce some adaptations. Maybe this was because he thought that some adaptations could be explained another way but Darwin had compiled enough evidence to suggest that sexual selection was responsible for many adaptations and was also thusly more evidence for his theory of natural selection. There was only one way to do this and that was to set about documenting as much as Darwin could on sexually selective traits. It is a mammoth undertaking and is primarily the book that got the ball rolling on explaining these adaptations.As someone who has read this book I am surprised by how it is often wrongly misrepresented by creationists as a work of unabashed racism. Out of the 700 pages I found maybe a few lines that would today require some more elaboration to make the intention clear. That is for today, nearly 140 years since it was written and only 50 years after western civilization had abandoned segregation. Darwin's work is nothing short of 140 years ahead of its time during an era that was still working to abolish slavery. Still we are always going to have some individuals who do not understand this context (maybe deliberately) so reasons are given by way of a 21st century introduction (James Moore and Adrian Desmond in my edition). There is no excuse for the detractors to be ignorant about this matter, an issue that only appears in possibly several lines out of the hundreds of thousands that are here. So let's be done with that and move on to the science.Darwin sets out by indicating homologous structures among organisms classed as different species. During correlation he also introduces vestiges as evidence of our origins. He then turns to mental powers and instinct, especially between humans and other primates, their ability to reason and use tools and awareness. Darwin directly implies that god belief could stem from evolution as does morality. He talks about social structures, especially with insects. He analyzes indigenous peoples (called savages back then) as evidence for descent and compares developments through variations, inheritance and their causes. The important point here is that the ultimate causes are the same for all living things including humans. Darwin looks at parts that we use and do not use, gives reasons for them, treats the topic of erect walking, canine teeth, skull shape, nakedness, our tail bone, brain expansion, our ranking in the animal kingdom, the various races and their extinctions.Darwin then turns to sexual selection as an explanation for a variety of adaptations. He looks at polygamy, variability, proportions of males to females and the question surrounding this. Turning to the animal kingdom he looks closely at colours, dimorphism, structures for holding during mating, musical instruments (stridulating), pugnacity, adaptations for sexual conflict, courting, colour protection and differences in colour between males and females and mimicry. He covers all of these with birds, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, insects and mammals.He expands on them in advanced chapters such as on the topics of building nests, parental care, laws of battle, dancing, seasonal variations, moults, female choice, exceptions to these observations, sex-limited traits, male and female role reversals, absence of weapons in females, weapons with both sexes, vocals, odours, hair, skin colour, spots and stripes.Now that Darwin has firmly established sexual selection he then turns to humans, the differences between the sexes, commonalities, law of battle, mental powers, voice, beauty and marriage, exaggerations, beauty standards, bodily hair, skin colour and the final conclusion that man is descended from some lower form and is self evidence of his lowly origin.Most of the book is devoted to comparing sexual traits between varieties of organisms. There are very clear illustrations (something Origin doesn't have) every few pages. The style is very much fact upon fact upon fact. There is a huge amount of footnotes on every page with Darwin referencing everything meticulously. There are lists of birds after amphibians after mammals after fish after insects. It is a globe sprawling nature walk. We are talking hundreds of pages on observed facts. Darwin even discusses behaviour in relation to animal signalling.His description of sexual selection among organisms vastly outweighs the actual topic of the descent of man and makes it almost seem redundant but the purpose is clear. Once Darwin has established sexual selection with other organisms and shows how the adaptations appear he then applies the same criteria to humans and abruptly we emerge from the picture of an ape-type hominid ancestor. Sexual selection makes it all too evident why we appear the way we do. Ideas that our attributes are based on a divine representation for a sanctified existence have lost. We are shaped by our desires."},{"Title":"The descent of man and selection in relation to sex","review":"A beautiful, historical account of a great naturalist's work. It is important to keep in mind that the book was written 129 years ago, though, since the use of the language would not be considered &quot;politically correct&quot; nowadays.Darwin was someone &quot;who viewed life on earth in terms of an evolutionary framework grounded in science and reason&quot; (taken from the Introduction by H. James Birx). It is difficult to believe that an educated person would misinterpret his ideas as being sexist or racist. Only the ignorant (or a creationist in disguise) would attempt to discredit the work of one of the greatest minds of all times by giving it the wrong label. Reading Daniel C. Dennett's &quot;Darwin Dangerous Idea&quot; (highly recommended) might help to put it in the right context."},{"Title":"The descent of man and selection in relation to sex","review":"How is it possible that anyone could be as ignorant as Rondeltap and give this great classic less than 5 stars?

When we find that the writings of Marx, Kant and many other giants of that Century can no longer instruct us, we shall find this one still penetratingly relevant."},{"Title":"The descent of man and selection in relation to sex","review":"This book takes off where \\"Origin of the Species\\" leaves off. In Origin, Darwin does not present his hypotheses on the origin of man, but in this book he states categorically that the human race is descended from earlier species of apes, which were descended from much more primitive life forms. The book is the work of a naturalist, and it is surprising how perceptive Darwin was, considering that this book was written in 1871. It faced a storm of rejection and tremendous furor. The book caused a storm of controversy throughout the entire world. Darwin sets out his facts as dispassionately as possible, but that did not stop many nations from banning the work. Darwin also clearly states in this important work that man is continuing to evolve. In this book Darwin states that the two main forms of selection that helped to shape the animals and humans the most through time are the theories of natural selection and sexual selection, and he explains the difference between these two often throughout the book. Even though the book is actually quite readable, I found it not an easy book to read. Even now these theories seem too much to be believed in some spots, but I do not argue at all with Darwin's theory. It is in fact the only way that the human race could have evolved. Definitely a must-read for anyone interested in \\"ground-breaking\\" literature."},{"Title":"The descent of man and selection in relation to sex","review":"While Darwin's theory of natural selection was accepted in the 1930s, Darwin's theory of sexual selection remains controversial. In Ernst Mayr's recent What is Evolution? Darwin's theory of sexual selection receives about two paragraphs. By comparison, Darwin considered sexual selection important enough to receive an equal number of pages as he devoted to his theory of natural selection. 130 years later, he's still probably the only evolutionary theorist to make this judgement. Equally, one must wonder that if Darwin had not come up with the idea of sexual selection, would anyone else have done so?This book is not merely revolutionary on a theoretical basis, but also in its thoughts on animals - including humans. 100 years before Jane Goodall \`discovers' chimpanzees using tools, Darwin devotes more than a page to animals using tools. More than 110 years before vets begin to give dogs prozac, Darwin argues that dogs have a sense of humour. His views on animals raises them higher than any modern theorist: his views on humans lowers them to where they are - animals, and thus the title.130 years later, this book is still radical. It is probably the most significant alteration to our understanding of ourselves since Copernicus. Its contents, with its stark views on human violence, continues to make aetheists uneasy. The book is very readable, and Darwin's clarity, sincerity and incisiveness places him above all modern writers. Revolutionary, thoughtful, and warm, it remains more a wonder than a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The descent of man and selection in relation to sex","review":"Although there are many racist and sexist ideas, this was the climate in which Darwin wrote this book. Many of the details are grossly in error, but the book was written over 100 years ago. Many advances in knowledge have been made since then. The basic premise, and the fact that Darwin looked to the African apes as a point of origin for humans is the real beauty of the book. Darwin is many times falsely blamed for &quot;Social Darwinism&quot; which he never proposed nor advocated. Just because someone uses Darwin as a justification for negative ideas and or actions, does not mean that Darwin should be vilified for it. Descent was not a social commentary, but a scientific treatise, and should be treated as such."},{"Title":"The descent of man and selection in relation to sex","review":"This book opened my eyes to the role of beauty in evolution. Darwin notes that it is difficult to accept that 'mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish' share the 'high taste of beauty which generally coincides with our own standard' and that this is an important driving force in biological and social evolution. This thesis is in striking contrast to the ideas entertained in currend evolutionary psychology, where judgements about beauty are considered with respect to their function regarding survival. It contrasts also with much current evolutionary thinking as Darwin is almost entirely concerned with expaining disfunctional, rather than functional, traits in terms of evolutionary theory. The thesis is not developed in full. It is, therefore, even more stimulating to read than if the thesis had been developed conclusively."},{"Title":"The descent of man and selection in relation to sex","review":"A truly outstanding read!I've kept The Descent of Man on my book shelf for over 30 years, unread. I was always too busy to justify the time required to do it justice. Now that I'm writing a dissertation in the History and Philosophy of Science I had the excuse I always lacked for tackling this monumental work. I'm glad I waited.Years as a practicing biologist and teacher have taught me the value of perspective. This is not a book that will teach you the details of human evolution. Read something recent in biological anthropology if that is what you are after. If you struggle with the convoluted sentence structure and wordiness of Victorian prose, this is certainly not the book for you. Try Harry Potter or Curious George instead.I always enjoy reading the negative reviews of books written on controversial topics just to see how many people actually review the subject matter rather than the book. I find it hysterical that 6 of the 7 negative reviews listed here were written by two fundamentalists and the seventh one was so tongue-in-cheek I'd give his review 5-starts just for fun. I found all but one of these negative reviews very predictable, and irrelevant.The Descent needs to be read by anyone interested in what Darwin thought and dared to publically declare. It should not, however, be read outside the context of his letters, and the social milieu in which he lived. It is most certainly anchored in a different age yet bridges that age to our own. Evolution is the cornerstone of all modern biology. Darwin's astonishing synthesis and daring predictions continue to be tested, refined, and corroborated. Seeing \\"only in a glass darkly,\\" he nonetheless illuminated so much that is correct in human evolutionary history. Even thoughs who critisize his quaint use of terms do so from a perspective elevated by his work. I found his writing prescient in light of the bushiness displayed in hominin fossils.If you need a context then read Janet Browne's seminal two-volume Darwin biography. If you need adventure and a Darwinian primer, then read Voyage of the Beagle. But don't stop reading Darwin till you've read this book. The Origin is incomplete without it."},{"Title":"The descent of man and selection in relation to sex","review":"This book contains a wealth of facts, compiled during Darwin's life on matters which were highly controversial at the time. His prior book, Origin of Species, provided the scientific framework for thinking that mankind might, in some way, be a descent from the animal kingdom. For personal reasons, there was some doubt, at the time, whether it would ever be diplomatic to admit such a thing to the human beings themselves, right in their very faces. The title which Darwin placed on this book showed how easy it would be to imagine that the fundamental distinction was closely linked to the question of whom an individual might choose to have sex with, given the great parallels to a wide range of behavior in the animal kingdom. I have looked in this book for evidence that philosophy is a set of ideas adopted mainly in relation to sex, but the philosophy of the fittest for that kind of activity seems to be a bit more modern than Darwin. On a scale of stillborn to born with a brain, Darwin was definitely born with a brain, but it didn't make him crazy enough to suggest that which we may imply ourselves. There are a lot of facts in this book, compared to the number of suggestions, but it shows a considerable amount of thought."},{"Title":"The descent of man and selection in relation to sex","review":"Just as \\"Origin of Species is misunderstood, I believe \\"Descent\\" to be also, although the latter is a more entertaining read. \\"Descent\\" fails to concentrate on man without deviating. It is a book of observations and study. It concentrates on how animal life, has, by sexual selection, brought forth the variety in the species we see today, through millions of years. Darwin covered his beloved pigeons in depth in \\"Origins\\" and continues at length on many other bird species in \\"Descent\\". I agree with him that all the different types of birds we see today probably came from one ancestor of the pigeon. This is called variation of kind. We see this in just about every living creature and flora. The problem arises when the next step is taken, the rise of one species turning into another (reptile to bird). Throughout the book Darwin does admit to this fact, but he still maintains that it must be, with much difficulty. He does hint to nature having some \\"power of thought\\", where does this come from? How does nature make these choices? Why did Darwin focus so on the black tribes: their practices, looks, sexuality, if he did not believe them a lower race? Of course he only hints at this, and his belief of evolving from apes is scant, but obvious. Does not the use of race to distinguish only separate? His theory on idiots as somehow lower is also disturbing. And what of the rudimentary parts and vestigial organs.

(...) when of two adjoining tribes one becomes less numerous and less powerful than the other, the contest is soon settled by war, slaughter, cannibalism, slavery, and absorption.&quot;Make no mistake about it, all I did here was to distill the &quot;formal&quot; hypothesis from a book that's supposedly science. By the quotations above from this book, Darwin's version of Natural Selection theory stands or falls."},{"Title":"The descent of man and selection in relation to sex","review":"Just as \\"Origin of Species is misunderstood, I believe \\"Descent\\" to be also, although the latter is a more entertaining read. \\"Descent\\" fails to concentrate on man without deviating. It is a book of observations and study. It concentrates on how animal life, has, by sexual selection, brought forth the variety in the species we see today, through millions of years. Darwin covered his beloved pigeons in depth in \\"Origins\\" and continues at length on many other bird species in \\"Descent\\". I agree with him that all the different types of birds we see today probably came from one ancestor of the pigeon. This is called variation of kind. We see this in just about every living creature and flora. The problem arises when the next step is taken, the rise of one species turning into another (reptile to bird). Throughout the book Darwin does admit to this fact, but he still maintains that it must be, with much difficulty. He does hint to nature having some \\"power of thought\\", where does this come from? How does nature make these choices? Why did Darwin focus so on the black tribes: their practices, looks, sexuality, if he did not believe them a lower race? Of course he only hints at this, and his belief of evolving from apes is scant, but obvious. Does not the use of race to distinguish only separate? His theory on idiots as somehow lower is also disturbing. And what of the rudimentary parts and vestigial organs. As we progress in our scientific study we understand more on their uses, and there may be much we will never understand.

It is not INTENDED for everyone.Once you realize that it defends highly original ideas about how guitar solos are meaningful artistic gestures, you can appreciate it for what it tries to be (semiotic analysis) and not what you might hope it is (rock criticism).

This book is written by Mike Arthur, who is stength coach at Nebraska and one of the most knowledgeable strength coaches in the nation. This is the same program the Nebraska football team follows and they are known for their strength. People have said the program is too easy. When followed at the proper intensity, this program is very tough. If you play football at the high school level or higher, this book can show you how to meet your athletic potential and become a better football player."},{"Title":"Complete Conditioning for Football (Complete Conditioning for Sports Series)","review":"Complete Conditioning for Football is outstanding. Written by two strength and conditioning coaches from the University of Nebraska, it details every relevant factor concerning physical training for football. Included are position specific drills, lifting programs, and speed programs, as well as information regarding nutrition, goals, and staying &quot;fit&quot; mentally. I especially appreciated the exercise results comparison charts - you can see how you stack up against other high school and college players physically. I've never seen anything like it before. I got so involved, I picked up the book and didn't stop reading til I reached the back cover! Well written and incredibly informative, I HIGHLY recommend this book to any player."},{"Title":"Complete Conditioning for Football (Complete Conditioning for Sports Series)","review":"The book \\"Complete Conditioning for Football\\" is a must for any football player. Inside includes performance needs; conditiong principles; testing, evluating, and goal setting; flexibility training; lifting techniques; speed drills; agility drills; nutrition and rest; and last but not least conditioning workouts and programs.Performance Needs:This chapter includes a performance pyramid which if followed can lead to \\"making the play\\", or success on the football field. It includes character, conditioning, ability, practice, game, and with the top brick, performance. Also it breaks down each of the components, exa. Character- belief, resolve, discipline, courage... and gives a descriptive explanation for each of them also.Conditioning Principles:This chapter guides you in developing and implementing a program to allow you to peak the four athletic indicators of speed, agility, power, and endurance. It breaks down and explains the principles of specificity, overload, and periodization.Testing, Evaluating, and Goal Setting:This chapter outlines step-by-step procedues on how to safely test and evaluate athletes' fitness and athletic abilities so ou can develop the objectives and specifics of your conditioning program. Here it gives some tests, such as vertical jump test, pro agility run test, 10- and 40- yard dash test, 300-yard shuttle run test, and even height, weight, and waist measurement tests. It also gives you percentile ranking charts of all the positions in high school and college. With your test results you can see where you rank among those in the 10-yard and 40-yard dashes, pro agility run, and the vertical jump. Percentile ranks are from 5-100.Flexibility Training:This chapter gives you the proper warm-up routine (high knees, heel ups, ect.), stretching routine (partner stretches), and mobility drills that should be done during the conditioning workouts (warm-ups and stretching before, mobility drills after the workout).Lifting Techniques:Provides valuable information on proper technique of all the lifts, to warming-up, spotters, breathing, and so on and so forth. Strength training exercises include: explosive, complementary, base strenght, and specialty. Not many weight rooms that I know of have the complementary, or \\"ground based jammer\\", so in the workouts in the back of the book give replacements for these lifts if the jammer is not available.Speed Drills:Included are 29 drills for speed (2), acceleration (9), plyometrics (9), and resisted speed (9). Also gives the proper sprint technique especially used for testing the 40.Agility Drills:Included are 58 drills for improving your agility. The drills include ropes (8), bags (15), backpedal drills (11), cones (12), line drills (6), and jump rope drills (6).Nutrition and Rest:Basically describes all the foods you should eat to make it short. This is a chapter you should allow as many people as possible to read, since without nutrition, athletic performance is low. Also gives a grocery shopping list with all the foods listed under the vitamins and minerals it has in them (example: almonds, corn oil, ect. are listed under vitamin e) and a section of drinking fluids and getting plenty of sleep.Conditioning Workouts and Programs:Guides you to building a successful conditioning program. Lists all the speed/agility drills and notes which drills are appropriate for which positions. Included are sample programs in development and peak phases for the positions. Also included in this chapter is the lifting programs for the beginner (base, development, in-season), intermediate (base, development, peak, in-season), and advanced (base, development, peak, in-season). This is an absolutely outstanding weight program in my opinion, with lifting days on monday, tuesday, thursday, and friday.All in all, this is the complete book for any football player looking to get in great shape for the next season. It is mainly a year-round program by giving types of workouts (base, ect.) for each month of the year in which to apply the right workout to. I also recommend the book \\"52-Week Football Training\\" to combine the exercises in the books if you want a more varied program. I suggest taking the time to looking into \\"Jumping Into Plyometrics\\" for a plyometric program to add into your schedule and \\"Play Football the NFL Way\\" for techniques and tips to help you excell in the game of football."},{"Title":"Complete Conditioning for Football (Complete Conditioning for Sports Series)","review":"The Nebraska Strength program is premier in the country, and this book shows why.

The authors incorporated not only the physical ways in which to get better but mental ways as well which are both important for conditioning as well as the successful winning of football games by not only being ready on the outside but also believing and knowing you can do it on the inside. The whole conditioning program is, when performed with the best potential and effort, a challenging one that will more than likely get you the preperation you need. These authors, coaches of the University of Nebraska football team which is famous for this strenghth and conditioning program, first introduce you to factors that build on one another to make a great football player and then give a very complete program of conditioning and training including a nutrition and shopping list for best atheletes to use for great energy. The structure of the book and organization is exceptional and it literaly gives you all the information you will ever need on how to prepare for football in any aspect. It contains specific exersises for speed, flexibility, strenghth, and more, and contains workout plans, inconclusive descripiton, and even helpful football tips in the process.I would strongly recommend this book to any football athelete looking to prepare for football through conditioning at any level because of the very helpful information you will find in this book.

I know I made the right choice by buying this book."},{"Title":"Complete Conditioning for Football (Complete Conditioning for Sports Series)","review":"The good thing about this book was it was scientificaly correct.

Traditional biological land treatment of fuel-contaminated soil can often result in final concentrations that do not meet clean-up criteria. One potential approach for the long-term management of fuel-contaminated soils is the establishment of vegetation, because the presence of vegetation may enhance the biodegradation of contaminants. Vegetation may directly aid biodegradation by accumulating, metabolizing, or volatilizing contaminants, as in the example of vegetation that hyper-accumulates metals. Vegetation may indirectly enhance biodegradation of contaminants through the action of rhizosphere microflora. Rhizosphere microflora are supported by exudates, such as carbohydrates and amino acids, released through plant roots and decaying vegetation. High microbial biomass and high microbial activity are associated with the rhizosphere, which may increase the biodegradation of organic contaminants relative to non-rhizosphere soil microflora. Phytoremediation may be especially suitable for shallow, contaminated soils, especially if it is used as a long-term, low-maintenance, low-cost remedial method.Some investigators, however, believe the beneficial effects of phytoremediation have been over-stated. The effect of vegetation on biodegradation might range from enhancing biodegradation to having no effect or even negative impacts. There is a dearth of quantitative field data on the effectiveness of phytoremediation, especially relative to actively-managed land treatment of contaminated soils. For these reasons, DOD/AATDF decided to fund a field test of phytoremediation. The data from this field test should supply information about the effectiveness of vegetation for the remediation of diesel-contaminated soils. The technology may provide a cost-effective alternative for soils management for the DOD."},{"Title":"We Saw the Sea","review":"As an ex naval officer from the period just after this was written it took me back and I could visualise not only the system but steriotypes and even characters.

De los espejos de obsidiana de la urbe totonaca de El Tajin a los espejos ibericos de Cervantes y Velasquez, el de la locura y el del asombro, un intercambio de reflejos ha ido y venido incesantemente de una a otra orilla del Atlantico. (Excerpted from the back cover of the book).Such reflejos are the subject of the book, which is listed as an essay (ensayo) among the works of Mexican author Carlos Fuentes, but which should really be classified under the subject of History in that it traces the development of the Spanish speaking people from prehistory to modern times.The book consists of 18 chapters as follows: \\"La Virgen y el Toro\\" (the Cretan and Greek roots); \\"La Conquista de Espana\\" (by Cartage and Rome); \\"La Reconquista de Espana\\" (by the Barbarians, later by the Moors); \\"1492: El Ano Cruzal\\" (the expulsion of the Moors by the Catholic kings, and the discovery of the New World); \\"Vida y Muerte del Mundo Indigena\\" (the natives of North America, Cortes and Moctezuma); \\"La Conquista y la Reconquista del Nuevo Mundo\\" (the conquest of the New World, the new towns, the universities, the new religion); \\"La Era Imperial\\" (the problems with the administration of the New World, the defeat of the Spanish armada by Francis Drake); \\"El Siglo de Oro\\" (literature and art in imperial Spain - Cervantes, Calderon de la Barca, Velasquez, Tirso de Molina, Francisco de Zurbaran); \\"El Barroco del Nuevo Mundo\\" (problems and unrest in the New World, Aleijadinho, Juana Ines de la Cruz); \\"La Epoca de Goya\\" (Melchor Gaspar de Jovellanos and Francisco de Goya y Lucientes); \\"Hacia la Endependencia: Multiples Mascaras y Aguas Turbias\\" (the unrest among the Creoles and the desire for independence); El Precio de la Libertad: Simon Bolivar y Jose de San Martin\\" (the expulsion of Spain from Latin America); \\"El Tiempo de los Tiranos\\" (Juan Manuel de Rosas in Argentina, Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia in Paraguay, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, Benito Juarez and Maximilian and Carlota in Mexico); \\"La cultura de la Independencia\\" (Latin America looks back at Spain while neglecting the local Indians and blacks, Argentine gaucho Jose Hernandez and his poem Martin Fierro, Cuban writer and patriot Jose Martin, Mexican cartoonist Jose Guadalupe Posada); \\"Tierra y Libertad\\"(The Mexican revolution of 1910, Emiliano Zapata and Pancho Villa); \\"Latinoamerica\\" (the general situation and problems of modern day Latin America); La Espana Contemporanea\\" (the general situation and problems of modern day Spain); La Hispanidad Norteamericana\\" (a very interesting chapter providing statistics on the total number of Hispanics as well as the number of Hispanic illegals in the United States, describing the invaluable contribution of the Hispanic people to the US economy and more).El Espejo Enterrado may be listed as an essay, it may be classified as a history book, yet it is more than that, because Carlos Fuentes is more than an essayer or a historian. He is a multifaceted artist who sees and describes reality in a more comprehensive as well as captivating manner than the average essayer or historian would. He does not just give the description of the events that shaped the history of the Spanish speaking people, he makes them interesting, he makes the reader want to learn more. For example, by discussing the individuals whose thoughts and actions influenced the decisions of the Spanish speaking people (e.g., Jean Jacques Rousseau and Napoleon); by relating the major events from which those related to the Spanish speaking people developed (e.g., the Renaissance, the French Revolution, the American Revolution); or by describing the works of the Spanish speaking artists who reflected the periods during which they lived (e.g., Don Quixote, La Vida Es Sueno, Las Meninas, La Maja Desnuda. Hence with this book, the reader will learn more than the history of the Spanish speaking people, he/she will meet (again) some of the great thinkers of the Western world, he/she will be reminded of the history of the Western world, he/she will learn about the products of the most illuminated minds of the Spanish speaking world. He/she will also discover about many word origins, (how many among you reading this review know the meaning of the word Saragoza, the origin of the name Malinche, the identity of the woman from whom California got its name, the reason why they call the turkey guacolote in Mexico). And he/she will acquire an awful lot of useful information which would otherwise not be easily available all in one book, for example, the real significance of Goya's Saturn Devouring his Children\\".This is a book that, once started, cannot be put down. A book that many will wish will never come to the end.Available in Spanish, as well as English with the title The Buried Mirror - Reflections on Spain and the New World, a must for anybody who is interested in history, in the works of the creative mind (including its author's) and the origin of things. Perhaps a must for just anybody interested in expanding his mind, whether or not of Hispanic descent."},{"Title":"El espejo enterrado (Taurus Bolsillo) (Spanish Edition)","review":"&quot;EL ESPEJO ENTERRADO&quot; ES UN LIBRO QUE NO PUEDES DEJAR DE LEER.

If you are looking for a treatise that starts in the 60's and ends with the current year forget it-time, space, connections, ruminations all come when they come unsequenced. It tends to disorient you at first but you soon realize that that is what the author wants. With the disorientation comes a clearer look at a time and place that will never be repeated-Salt Lake City, Utah in the 60's and 70's. For those of us who were there it makes our hearts and minds ache to remember those times. For those of you who weren't it is a way to feel one person's take on the time of our life. The Bastille family lives in everyone who is uncomfortable with authority, whether that authority is smug and self righteous or simply uncontrolled and without a face. For us the face was Richard Nixon, the Dulles brothers, dead Kennedy's, dead Malcom, dead Medger, dead/live soldiers etc-all interchangable and all calling us to do our best to make the world right. Only time will tell if the imposed authority will triumph. At least in the Bastille Family reunion it does not and the sweetness of our fellow humans shine from every word. Thanks Richard for taking the time to welcome us home.

It also captures the spirit of the entertaining and informative \\"Wobblies! A Graphic History of the Industrial Workers of the World\\". For those not familiar with the Wobblies, some brief background information may be helpful.The IWW was created at a convention in Chicago in June 1905. In attendance were some of the leading figures in the American labor movement, including Big Bill Haywood, Eugene V. Debs, Daniel De Leon, and the above mentioned Mother Jones to name a few. The disparate groups who came together to form the IWW shared two common bonds: a disdain for the elite, seemingly pro-capitalist craft unions that made up the American Federation of Labor (AFL); and a belief in the necessity of \`the class struggle'. Membership in the IWW was open to all workers. This stood in stark contrast to the tough entry requirements of the AFL's craft unions. The IWW, unlike the AFL, welcomed both women and racial minorities into its ranks. As a result, the IWW may be said to have created the first \`rainbow coalition' of American political thought. There were socialists, anarchists, communists, syndicalists, and just about every type of \`ist' one can imagine in the IWW. Membership grew rapidly in the early days of the movement and the IWW became much feared by the corporations they did battle with and loomed large in the public imagination. John Dos Passos captured the IWW beautifully in his landmark USA Trilogy. At the same time, the fragmented ideology of its membership resulted in quite a bit of internal strife and the somewhat anarchic nature of the IWW as an organization created some difficulties for it. The IWW's growth reached its peak in the days leading up to the 1917 entrance of the United States into the First World War. The war and the subsequent \`Red Square' following the Russian Revolution led to a series of federal legislative and judicial measures that hampered severely the IWW's organizing activities.\\"Wobblies!\\" is at once both an entertaining and informative graphic history of the IWW. This is not a full blown, chronological history. Edited by Paul Buhle and Nicole Schulman, both of whom have deep connections to what may be called the American Left, Wobblies! consists of a series of illustrated vignettes of notable events in the history of the IWW. Virtually all the writers and graphic artists who contributed to Wobblies!, perhaps the most well-known being Harvey Pekar, have roots in or sympathy with contemporary radical political action groups. I found the simple story lines to be coherent and I found the graphic artwork to be excellent.The stories seem a bit random and the narrative lacks a certain element of continuity at times. Yet these elements struck me as being fully consistent with the rather chaotic nature of the IWW itself and I found it to be amusing rather than annoying. Further, as its title indicates, this is a graphic history. The reliance on graphics seemed to be an appropriate vehicle to tell the story of the IWW. Significant portions of its membership were immigrants who either did not speak English or who were illiterate. The IWW relied heavily on oral (songs) and visual (street theater) means to promote itself. With that in mind the use of graphics to tell the story of the Wobblies seemed perfect.The year 2005 marks the centenary of the founding of the IWW and this book may be viewed as an admittedly admiring commemoration. Having said that, it should be noted that the fondness the contributors have for the IWW does not lessen the quality of the graphics or the quality of the breezy, informative narration. This book may only find favor with readers politically pre-disposed to the IWW. In a sense that would be a shame. I think the graphics and the information contained in Wobblies! could appeal to a wider audience who either like graphic artwork generally or who are interested in a work that happens to tell some stories in a compelling manner of a by gone era."},{"Title":"Wobblies!: A Graphic History of the Industrial Workers of the World","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable books on the hidden and suppressed labor history of American workers. Made all the more enjoyable by the variety of people's artists/cartoonists that have contributed to what is surely a labor of love. This is not what you're going to be taught in schools or colleges. This book portrays clearly that long memorable struggle for dignity among the working class that continues to the present day.The Wobblies held to a grass roots approach of organizing workers, prefering \\"crude vigor to polished banality\\", a system of priorites too little seen in these waning days of capitalism. Each young person, parent and school should have this information available to them, for any soul not born with a silver spoon wedged in their mouth will come away from this history with a lump in your throat and a new spring in your step. In light of encroaching globalism (that is no friend to worker's anywhere) this is a handbook to inspire and encourage a new generation to take control of their own destiny.Solidarity Forever!P.S.- Check out the recordings of Utah Phillips, the modern troubadour/sage of the Wobblies."},{"Title":"Wobblies!: A Graphic History of the Industrial Workers of the World","review":"As a youth activist, organizer, and scholar, I find Paul Buhle's \\"Wobblies!\\" to be a refreshing and unique reminder of the revolutionary tradition of the Industrial Workers of the World.

A Graphic History Of The Industrial Workers Of The World is an amazing history of the Industrial Workers of the World, an organization known for its eclectic and controversial affiliations as well as its strong stand against government and corporate exploitation. Wobblies! is particularly remarkable in that it presents its vivid anecdotes about everything from wartime witch hunts, government prosecutions, mob lynching, Mexican peasant revolts, the bombing of IWW figures and much more in comic book format. Black-and-white comic-style stories by a wide variety of artists, from vintage political cartoons to unfolding true tales of modern history, fill this superbly edited and presented overview of the Wobblies. Presented in an absorbing manner that invites the lay reader to peruse from cover to cover, Wobblies! is highly recommended especially for school and public library history shelves."},{"Title":"Wobblies!: A Graphic History of the Industrial Workers of the World","review":"WOBBLIES! is truly a wonderful, unique piece of work. The book tells the story of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, better known as the Wobblies) through a collection of over fifty graphic stories (i.e., comics) produced by some of today's most exciting progressive artists/writers (Harvey Pekar, Mike Alewitz, etc).The individual works are incredibly diverse, linked thematically into six chapters: (1) \\"Early Days\\" (founding convention, Big Bill Haywood, western miners, Mother Jones...); (2)\\"Lawrence and Patterson\\" (the most famous strikes the Wobs led); (3) \\"Wobblies Far and Wide\\" (Joe Hill, free speech fights, itinerant Wobs (or, hoboes); (4) \\"Repression, Martyrdom, General Strikes\\"; (5) \\"Beyond Martyrdom\\" (focusing on the often neglected Wobbly history of the 1920s); and (6) \\"The IWW Lives!\\" (the Wobblies up to the present).As a special treat, there is a collection of original IWW cartoons and illustrations at the end (indeed, this book carries on that very special wobbly tradition).This is a wonderful book that couldn't be more timely-- being released on the centennial of the founding of IWW (one of the best comics in the book depicts the founding convention of the Wobblies in 1905). Because of its graphic/comic form, it will surely help popularize the IWW to a new generation-- at a time when this is needed more than ever. (And, on top it all, it is a very *FUN* read-- highly recommended)"},{"Title":"Wobblies!: A Graphic History of the Industrial Workers of the World","review":"The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), also known as the \`Wobblies', is 100 years old in 2005. In celebration, Paul Buhle, Nicole Schulman and comrades have brought together an illustrated history of the Wobblies. The IWW was considered by many as the most dangerous labor organization in the 20th century US. Their ideas and organizing style spread well beyond the borders of the US into Canada, into the revolutionary milieu of Mexico, and much of the industrializing world. The IWW was primarily influenced by left anarchist thought. It sought to organize all of the working class across sectors and regardless of sex, race or nationality. Bourgeois interests feared the Wobblies because of their inclusiveness. The IWW embraced the strike as the primary tool to better the lives of the working class, improve working conditions and pay. They were fiercely in favour of free speech, especially during World War I, and opposed all interstate wars. Unlike the AFL in many ways, the Wobblies paid for their militancy with beatings, unjust prison sentences and murders but left many powerful models for action and organization including the sit-down strike and the basis for the CIO. During and after the World War I, the federal government, local police authorities, corporate thugs (i.e. Pinkertons), and even other members of the working class attempted to destroy the Wobblies but their ideas persisted. While they never returned to their pre-war strength, locals were maintained. Their actions and ideas fused with the civil rights movements to provide examples for sixties' activists and, today, the economic justice movement.Wobblies!: A Graphic History of the Industrial Workers of the World primarily employs comics to show some of the organizational lineages and successes. The text highlights the careers of some of the Wobbly legends: Lucy Parsons, Joe Hill, Big Bill Haywood, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Richardo Flores Magon, and Frank Little. More importantly, its labor struggles are documented from the Ludlow strikes to Lawrence and Patterson strikes to Butte to Centralia to Naranja, Mexico; the free speech movement during the Wilson Administration; and the IWW's ongoing direct action agitation to this day. The comic is a particularly powerful form for communicating some aspects of Wobbly history because it makes a strong and immediate impact on the reader, but also because many Wobbly cartoonists have influenced popular culture through to the present. This inspired volume is a testimony to the craft, intelligence, wit, and solidarity of the thirty-plus artists who contributed graphics for it. The same is true of folk music noted with frequency within the book with references to the songs of Joe Hill and other Wobblies who inspired Woodie Guthrie on through to Utah Phillips and Ani DiFranco. This is an excellent primer for anyone interested in the IWW as well as those who think that another world is possible and want to organize, educate and agitate for it."},{"Title":"Wobblies!: A Graphic History of the Industrial Workers of the World","review":"The history uses many cartoonists, many cartoon styles. Text outside the cartoons is minimized. Footnotes are light. But compelling reading as an introduction to the Wobblies, from their beginnings to this 2005 publication. A lot of information despite (or maybe because of) the cartoon format.These are not neutral presentations. You may wonder whether our government and corporations really mistreated workers in this way. That many jailed, that many killed? This is within the past 100 years. If we're not careful, whatever progress workers have made since the Wobblies began may be lost.Read this great intro and get charged up. Then, by all means, seek out other sources to check what you've been told here. Section six of this book, \\"IWW Lives\\", alerts us that, although smaller than in the past, the IWW is active.

As for the IWW, they were the most successful radical labor movement in the history of the US. You aren't going to learn that in a high school classroom but we can learn a lot from the history of the Wobblies.

The range of authors and styles is rich and diverse, dwelling in different episodes of workers rights through the years, also reaching recent times but with an emphasis on events during the turn of the XX century and the following decades.With plenty of activist notes of struggle, defeat, and accomplishment, the book offers a cogent and important sense of the labor movements in the USA and their influence, often forgotten and ignored by mainstream voices."},{"Title":"Wobblies!: A Graphic History of the Industrial Workers of the World","review":"As a historian of the IWW, I bought this title hoping for something new and insightful.

FairThe 'Foreword' is dedicated to Okey L. Patterson, Governor of West Virginia. Warden Orel J. Skeen felt that a condemned prisoner was not guilty and called the \\"Court of Last Resort\\". Robert B. Bailey was convicted of murder by an eyewitness even while he was arrested drunk several miles away. The Governor commuted Bailey's sentence and called for a new investigation of this case. Not every governor would give up a few hours of his holiday to review the evidence on a closed case.John Carver Billings II visits the Cool & Lam agency. He first danced with Morrie, then was dumped by her. He then spent the night with Sylvia and Millie. Morrie has gone missing, and Billings II wants them to find Sylvia and Millie to establish his alibi. Lam sees problems in his story, Cool only sees his money. But who is John Carver Billings II? So Lam starts his investigation to track two unknowns on behalf of another unknown. And he succeeds, so the client is happy. But Lam know this \\"paper trail\\" was left for him to find! So Lam goes back to the motor court to re-investigate, and finds a clue that brings him to San Francisco, and he finds out more about that night, and more about the Billings. Then Lam finds information about a hit-and-run accident. Also about the discovery of the body of Morrie (Maurine Auburn), shot twice in the back.Lam warns Millie about her life-style choice (Chapter 4). It won't work in the long run, she's only \\"a cog in the economic and social machine\\". Millie cranes action, variety, and luxury. In Chapter 11 Lam reads about a wealthy mining man who has gone missing, and goes to interview his wife. Lam learns something about George Bishop, the first link to the Billings. He gives advice to Mrs. Bishop. Lam surmises the connection between Billings II and the need for an alibi. Billings I tells Lam of the mysterious mining operations of George Bishop (Chapter 12). And so we find out about the puzzle of the body in the yacht - it isn't there! Lam tells about a test for bloodstains. Would there be bloodstains if the carpet was brand new? Then Lam gets information from the accountant (Chapter 14). More facts are discovered by Lam in talking to Mrs. Bishop.The police search of the crime scene found the murder weapon and the fingerprints of Billings (Chapter 16). Lam describes \\"The Green Door\\" and its adjoining shops. Lam investigates to uncover more facts, only to be trapped and threatened for a while. A phone call to \\"George Granby\\" serves as a deus ex machina to end his predicament. And so this puzzle is solved in the police station (Chapter 19). The Billings are freed. Lam's return to the home office is played out for its comedic value. Note the modern touches here (college basketball). The bonanza in the gold mine stock sounds like insider trading.

I usually finish a book once I crack it open, and I really tried with this one but it was a no-go.SEP is one of my favorite writers for her fun, witty books. I guess that was what I missed here - there wasn't much fun. The story had angst and wrong choices gone really bad. Sure, eventually there's a happy ending with the right guy, but the journey was pretty much of a downer. Again, I look to SEP for fun and wit."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I have to admit Susan Elizabeth Phillips is my all time favorite author. With that being said, I will NOT recommend this book to anyone. It is almost as if another author wrote the book. It's not a romance. It left you feeling crappy and almost upset. Don't waste your time with this book. Read Ain't She Sweet or Dream A Little Dream, those books won't disappoint you."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I've read all SEP other books and once I started one, I could not put it down. But this one, I had to make myself keep reading in hope that it would get better. According to my Kindle, I was over 65% through the book before it seemed that SEP came to the party! The female lead was a doormat for most of the book and the male lead should have been on medication. The research was good, very tedious and boring to read through. SEP books have always been entertaining and funny, with fun characters...these characters seemed to have a heavy veil over them, and you had to wait and wait for them to be seen. I suppose SEP was trying something different, but I think it fell flat. Sorry, cannot recommend this to others."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"Like many reviewers of Susan Elizabeth Phillips novels, I've read all of her stories. What separates Hot Shot from all of her other wonderful works is how each character is so remarkably fleshed-out. Although labeled a romance novel, this book elevates the reader beyond torrid love scenes to a higher dimension, where the characters are defined by their personal fortitude, creative ambition, intuition and intelligence, instead of their exuberance in bed. Hot Shot is beautifully and creatively written and while it's somewhat of a departure, in my mind it best celebrates the essential strength of women, the central theme of all Susan Elizabeth Phillips novels."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"Great story with the dawn of the computer age as a background. Susannah Faulconer is a complex character and the circumstances surrounding her childhood and early adult life formulate the events of a fantastic plot. I really enjoyed watching her grow into a strong, independent business woman. Since I do not want to give the story away, but I do want to stress the great storyline, suffice it to say, \\"Hot Shot\\" is a well-written story centered on the growth - personally, professionally and romantically of a woman in a man's business world in the late seventies, early 80's. The character of Susannah Faulconer is supported by a cast of complex individuals; her half-sister, Paige and their sibling rivalry, her staunch fiancee, Cal, Sam, Mitch and who could ever forget the computer wiz of the century, Yank. If you enjoy fiction, romance, and mystery, centered around the corporate world, you will really want to read \\"Hot Shot.\\""},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"First off, I'll say this is a good book. It's an interesting story and shows over the course of the novel how one woman matures, grows and finds her own identity through her relationships with three men in silicon valley during the personal computer boom. I don't consider it a romance in my book because the majority of the book focuses on the main character's love, chemistry, and sex scenes with the man she marries and then divorces. That being said, I would have enjoyed it much more if there was more development between her relationships with the other two men, especially the man she finds happily ever after with. It's very predictable in a way SEP's wants it to be, but still manages to be satisfying but not in a swept up sort of way. This is more like Honeymoon than any of her other books which focus on a one to one romance."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"It's true, this book is an early SEP and quite different from her football and more current books. But I still absolutely LOVED it. There's just something about SEP's writing that sucks me in.SEP has written about lots of things I wouldn't normally read about... football players, golfers, people in the circus, and now computer geeks. This book is written about the time when technology and computers were busting at the seams. Would I ever think I would like a book reading about Apple and IBM fighting it out? No, definitely not, but SEP made me like it.I'll admit, there were a few times when she talked about computer stuff and I skimmed. I'm guessing SEP was really excited that she had learned all that computer stuff so she wanted to include it. Probably could have done without it, but at least I learned things and it promoted a good conversation with my husband the computer geek. ;-)And though many people say there's not enough romance... there is! Please don't read the 1st half of a book, give up and then give it a bad rating. The true love story in the book was found in the end, and it was funny and sweet.This book was not as depressing as Honeymoon, but not quite as ... funny (maybe?) as her recent books. She still did an amazing job making characters you care for with depth, and a bit of humor.

Hot Shot is one of her earlier works, and I agree with another reviewer who said her writing has changed since that time. This is a well researched novel about the beginning of the PC age. She really shows the emotion and drive of the early pioneers in this industry. Susannah is a likable character and the reader sees her mature through the story. It has some very tense and heartwarming moments.SEPs more recent novels have better banter and more romance, but this book has very well written characters.

It is also a story of female empowerment."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"The four main characters were unique, special and strong in four very different ways.

That being said, if you're looking for a snappy romance, this probably isn't what you want.

Especially since I really enjoyed SEP's other books like First Lady and Kiss An Angel. Her writing style is definately different with Hot Shot. It is more factual and there wasn't enough humour in it to hold my attention for long. It took me three days to finish the book when I usually can finish SEP's books in one day. That's how boring it was!"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"If you love SE Phillips' later works, this is not the book for you. Yes, the information on the birth of the PC was interesting, but the characters were not engrossing. I just didn't like any of them. Too bad."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I hate to contradict the previous reviewers, but I did not find this book half as good as they said it is. And I had to give it up half way through it as a good gesture to myself! I think you've got to be terminally bored to stick to it till the end. The characters are so flimsy, the plot line so unimaginative, it is not worth the while."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"This book was definitley a slow stater, but once it picked up, I couldn't put it down! Watching \\"Suzie\\" grow after she left a family that was holding her back was a lot of fun. She starts out timid and shy but becomes a strong woman who is enjoyable to read about.There were several parts that got under my skin - specifically the parts with her pain-in-the...husband, but she overcomes the obsticals that are in front of her and, true to most romance novels, finds the happiness she deserves."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"As a frequent flyer, SEP books help me thru bumpy takeoffs and landings. Not so this one. This book didnt get me interested until Mitch appeared on the scene. I hated Sam and wanted to slap 'Susie'. But here I was 35,000 feet over nowhere so I finished the book in 3 hours. There was no clever banter back and forth as there is with her other books. Mitch came close. I give SEP an \\"A\\" for research on the computer business and will continue to seek out her other books."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"Hot Shot contains classic SEP scenes, full of snappy dialogue and sizzling tension, but it's short on romance. The heroine and hero appear to be romantically involved almost as an afterthought, as most of the book centers around the birth of the computer. While interesting, the novel reads more like Judith Krantz than SEP through most of it, and the endless inclusion of technical jargon grows tiring by the end of the novel."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"Hot Shot delves into the world of computers while watching a woman grow up in a dog-eat-dog world. Born into a blue-blood family, and raised to be a doting daughter to a powerful businessman, Susannah Falconer didn't discover herself until she was at the foot of the alter with hundreds of San Francisco's society looking on....Hot Shot is laced with a wide range of characters that never cease to entertain with wit, love, and painful heartbreaks. Set against the building of a new age--&quot;the computer age&quot;--this book is a must read of love and the courage to shoot for your dreams.--&quot;Siena Fields&quot;"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"Hot Shot is one of my all-time favorite books by Susan Elizabeth Phillips. I tend to prefer her early works because they seem more daring with more depth into the background of the characters and the complexity of their personalities and motivations.Hot Shot features a fascinating cast of characters whose lives become entangled. Set against the backdrop of the birth of the computer industry (with references to its real-life pioneers, Steve Jobs and Apple Computers and the Hewlett-Packard duo), Hot Shot features three memorable leading men: Yank, the enigmatic, introverted and brilliant tinkerer/engineer; Mitch, the conservative divorced businessman who has tasted success, but yearns for a new challenge; and Sam, the anti-establishment renegade and crusading and charismatic pied piper who has a vision of a brave new world that will blow the stuffy computer corporate-types right off the map.Sophisticated, reserved Susannah is the link between the three men. She has lived her entire life seeking approval and being defined by her domineering father Joel. As the book begins, Susannah is about to become a trophy wife to Cal, a Joel-like clone, hand-picked by her father to be her husband and eventually his successor in his electronics empire.Hot Shot is a story about the dynamics of relationships -- friends who become business partners; sisters who are rivals; the imbalance and emeshing pull of a father-daughter duo; a first love with skyrockets of passion; a marriage that starts off rocky, finds its rhythm then faces bigger challenges; and friendships, loyalties and betrayals. It is also a quest of sorts for the players - who pursue a goal and a dream in order to prove themselves. It is that quest that transforms all four characters. As Susannah, Sam and Yank grow up and achieve success, their idealism is tested, while straight-laced Mitch learns to take risks.Most of all, it is Susannah's story. After years of living her life within the restrictive confines of what other people want her to be, Susannah slowly gains confidence in a corporate world surrounded by strong men, and she begins to define herself on her own terms as she overcomes obstacles along the way.I love this book for the depth, vulnerabilities and flaws of its characters. Sam, Yank, Mitch and Susannah are a bit like Dorothy and her new-found friends in Oz, linking arms and charging off to see the Wizard, dreaming of the Emerald City. As the years go by, they fill holes within each other and emerge stronger and better people because of their relationships. The supporting characters - Susannah's father and sister and Sam's mother, adversaries at first, are interesting too, as their rough edges are softened through time and they become allies.First published in the early 1990s, Susan Elizabeth Phillips not only crafted dare-devil characters, but she was willing to take a few risks of her own, allowing the story to take twists and turns and deviating from the typical romance genre formula.For me, this story has withstood the test of time because of the strong personalities, their idiosyncrasies, the journey they all take together and especially the unexpected turns. Like the best stories, the ending provides a nice arc. I love the sweet and poignant message in the final passages: \\"Remember your roots.\\" It's a message of hope and renewal and it's easy to imagine new and exciting chapters ahead for the four people who we come to know so well.I reread this book every year or so and never tire of it - probably because it is unique in a sea of stories that are so often redundant."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"Hot Shot is an interesting book. However, if you are looking for a funny romantic novel, this isn't it. I would not even categorize Hot Shot as a romance novel. It's a book about a woman's journey to self awareness and self appreciation. The romance is secondary to the story.It's obvious that SEP put a lot of effort into researching the back story, and I really wanted to like this book. However, I thought there were too many characters and side-stories, disrupting the pace of the book. I've read over 10 of SEP's novels and this is the first one I did not really enjoy.With that said, this book is still better than some of the formulaic romance novels out there. I wavered back and forth between giving this book 2 or 3 stars. I gave it 2 stars because I didn't find the story compellinge enough, and it took me awhile to get through the book."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I was a systems administrator in the early eighties so I love to read about the history of computing. I read Hot Shot a number of months ago, and re-read it recently. I am now reading the Bio of Steven Jobs. The Character of Sam is absolutely Jobs, that was clear to me months ago, however, there are details in Hot Shot that were not known about Jobs before the bio came out. Not only that but Wozniak, the genius who came up with the concept is described with the same wording as Yank. Heck, Woz's description of himself, could be used as a character description of Yank.The descriptions of the burn boxes, the soldering processes that Susan uses are so on the money, that I flipped back to Hot Shot to reread the description. The depiction of Job's outbursts, the zinging highs and telling everyone that they are either geniuses or s**t are laid out in the character of Sam that the hair on the back of my head stood up-Hot Shot is eerily prescient about the building of Apple. The descriptions of the Home brew computer club is almost word for word as described in both books. I'm not sure what to think about this, whether Ms. Phillips had access to these guys, or whether she is just a genius of observation of bits and pieces of information. ANYONE who is reading about Steven Jobs should immediately pick up a copy of Hot Shot. It is truly astounding.I am hooked on Phillips books, that is true, but this blew me away. Kudos to the author! Readers, pick up this book."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"In all romance books I've read so far, the protaganists are easily identifiable from almost the first page. Not so in this book. Susannah goes through an awful lot of life until she finally finds her true love.But all SEP's books are five stars, and this is no exception.What I liked:1. This book is unbelievably well written, as are all of SEP's books. The book flows naturally, the words just pull you in. The descriptions are unbelievable, and the dialogue snappy, precise and - believable. (Okay, Susannah must have an IQ of 160 or so, but still.)2. The author does a great job in setting up Susannah's life in such a way that we can see the complexity and growth of her personality. We see her evolving from an abused five year old to the Susannah at the end of the book. And SEP makes us understand exactly why she made the choices she did, and as Susannah explains - each choice was the right choice at that time. Those people who are upset at Susannah for marrying Sam are missing the point - she had to marry Sam at that point in her life - not, of course, because that's the plot - but rather because this part of her life was necessary in order for her to grow into the person she ultimately became.3. Unlike some other books that I have read, where the heroines go through all kinds of psychological trauma in an extremely unrealistic manner, Susannah reacts exactly the way a real person might in real life - albeit a really spunky person - in other words - a heroine. Every scene, every word, every reaction - is extremely realistic. Of course, most people would NOT react as well as Susannah - which is why she is a heroine, of course! But in alot of other books, when I finish it I think - oh, this would never happen in real life. People just don't react that way. I NEVER felt that way in this book.4. Uh, did I mention I loved Susannah?What I didn't like:1. This book was so long, and so detailed, it took me forever to get to the end. But then again, more of SEP's wonderful writing to enjoy?2. I wish the ending was a little longer. I had a hard time picturing Susannah and (blank - I don't want to give away the ending) together, because there is so little interaction between them in the whole book. (What you're getting is their thoughts and feelings - but there is a big difference between fantasy and real life.) I just wanted to see them together more, that's all. I guess I just want more SEP!"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I found this book confusing. Although, SEP tried to speak in layman's terms, I still was completely confused. Maybe I'm an idiot but, I think she went into too much detail on the pioneering age of home computers. However, I did enjoy Susannah's character. You could almost feel what she most have been going through when she jumped on the back of Sam's Harley and didn't look back. Going to an exciting new world yet being scared out of your mind. How terrifying!! She held together w/ dignity and an uncanny spirit that she never let go of. She sure did show them in the end!"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I'm not into technology, computers or even how it all got started but I really loved this book. I loved the way Susannah's character evolved from being an insecure person to running a business empire. From the beginning Mitch was my favorite of the male characters, I could relate to his suffering and the strength it takes to start over in live. The chemistry between all the characters was great. Paige and Yank's story was a very nice surprise. All in all I have loved every single book that SEP has written."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"After reading most of her books in one night, I forced myself to finish this one, hoping it would pick up. It didn't. I am not a romance book reader by nature, but found her other books hard to resist. I have read all of her books in less than two weeks. I am glad I ended with this one, or else I don't think I would have read the others. Do yourself a favor and pass this one in her collection by...."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I read all of Susan's books (some couple of times) except the last one published, till I discovered Francine Rivers' books that changed my life for eternity. Oh Susan, I wish you would read Francine River's books too and understand what I am trying to say and become a new type of a writer. Then I would read your books again."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I've read several books by Susan Elizabeth Phillips and of them, HOT SHOT is my hands-down favorite. I found the characters rich and fascinating and I loved the backdrop of the birth of personal computers. And this is coming from someone who is just barely computer-literate!Susannah's relationships with the pirate, the nerd, and the stuffed shirt are great. Her growth in the book from Daddy's girl, to rebel, to woman is wonderful. Also interesting is the evolution of her relationship with her sister, Paige. Anyone who wasn't touched by Joel and Angela's pilgrimage to Elvis' funeral in August, 1977, must have ice water flowing through her veins.But the distinctiveness of the book is its exploration of the birth of personal computers. It was fun watching SysVal duke it out with Apple. As an aside, I thought the battle for Susannah at the end was one of the most hilarious scenes I've read in romance fiction. Don't miss it!I haven't read another book by Susan Elizabeth Phillips that I've enjoyed as much as this one. Try it!"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"This was one of her first books and it shows her writing style changed quite a bit. I enjoyed this book it was interesting and it reminded me of a &quot;Judith Michael&quot; book so I actually understood the flow of the story with the long absence of romance between the 2 characters. I was lucky enough to have read this book early on in my SEP reading so therefore I wasn't to dissapointed.This book is not &quot;light&quot; and &quot;humorous&quot; as her others but it is a keeper if you like to see an author's growth. She did a tremendous amount of research (you can tell) about the beginning of the Computer age and Silicon Valley which was much appreciated and I think the romance was just thrown in because that was what she writes. All in all not a bad book just not something to pick up if you just finished reading &quot;It Had to Be You&quot; or &quot;Nobody's Baby but Mine&quot; this is a different style all together.Happy Reading"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"This is the first book by Susan Elizabeth Phillips that I've read.. and I've been searching for a book that's as good, ever since.I was amazed by the increadible research that SEP must have done to write such an indepth look into the beginnings of a computer company and how it affected the main character(s) lives. Of course, I'm sure she got the idea from the lives of Steve Jobbs and Bill Gates. But adding a female to this combination was the perfect ingredient.Susannah is an incredible heroine, one I could relate to, and I was sad when the story of her life was over. Her relationships and hardships were very real, and I found myself eatting up every page.. wondering what would happen next.You'll also find one of the most well-written flashbacks of a character's life when you read the story of Mitch's childhood. I feel like I could read a whole book just on him.Read this book.. it's not a typical frivilous romance novel.. You'll enjoy the story, but be prepared to get angry, cry like a baby, and burst out in laughter. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I've read almost all her books and never thought I'd ever give her less than five stars but this early SEP style is a little different than what I am used to and I prefer the style of her later books. Of course, SEP at worst is still great when compared to alot of what is out there in the mainstream romance category.Not that this book is bad in ANY way. It reads well as I would expect from SEP but it's not my idea of what I want to read when I read for escapism/fantasy. It had a little too much real-life senarios for my taste.I also don't want any confusion about who the hero and heroine is supposed to be. It's been over a month since I read Hot Shot and I still get an uneasy feeling when I think of Sam and what he did to Suzi. Guys like that exist in real life, I don't want that in my fantasy. I want to feel good and warm and happy. I want happily ever after with the same guy in my romances. Nothing dark is welcome there. I also thought Suzi should have woken up and smelled the coffee a long time before she did. And that was ONLY by accident! How long would she have kept her head buried in the sand? I prefer my heroines a little stronger. And her running away for as long as she did did not impress me either. I understand and I might have done the same thing but Suzi is my heroine, not me. I want my heroine to do all the gutsy stuff that I could never do, that's why I read FICTION.As usual, all of SEP's characters are well drawn and you still get a good story written very skillfully. Her writing is one of the best in her field and she doesn't fail here. Don't get me wrong, there is a happy ever after - but with a twist. I also loved the part about when she was a little girl and how she looked up to her step-father as the golden prince who came to rescue her. That and Suzi's ever-lasting devotion to her step-father and the way that SEP explains it all is the SEP I know and love!But I also agree w/other reviewers when she got detailed about the computer field. It is interesting, just not what I want in my romance. Obviously, I have conflicting feelings about this book. If you're like me and label yourself SEP's number one fan, then by all means, go get this book and read it.If you want to read a short saga about a high-class young woman growing up and changing into a more confident woman during the computer revolution in the silicon valley before silicon valley became a household word and about the three men that shaped her life, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"SEP is one of my favorite romance authors - I was hooked with &quot;Nobody's Baby but Mine&quot; and &quot;Lady Be Good&quot; - so when I was looking for more of her books to read, the reviews I found here convinced me that I had found another winner.I couldn't have been more surprised and disappointed by how truly BAD this book is. It lacked all of the wit and sparkle of her other writing and the characters were completely without depth and failed to capture any of my sympathy. (I actually actively disliked both Susannah and Sam for the first half of the book. I grew resigned to Susannah but still couldn't see what she saw in Sam, an arrogant and vulgar jerk.) As one of the other reviewers here noted, SEP probably did do a tremendous amount of research for this book. But her research overshadowed the romance of the story entirely. If I had wanted to read about the history of microcomputers I would have gotten one of the books that SEP suggests in her acknowlegments.And where exactly were the editors of this book? One of the first rules of fiction is &quot;show, don't tell&quot; but this book consists of LONG passages of tedious narration and flashbacks when a few well done scenes could have conveyed the information much more effectively. In other cases, repetitive phrasing such as &quot;electronics permeated the air&quot; and &quot;a public relations nightmare&quot; was used over and over on the same page, which just smacks of amateurish writing. The only time I actually laughed during the book was when Mitch and Susannah were speaking. Mitch asked Susannah to let him use a video game before her and she refuses. His reply is, &quot;at least I don't have to beat off Yank too.&quot;I would have given &quot;Hot Shot&quot; NO stars if I could have. I am a lone dissenting opinion here but if you are a fan of SEP's later work, I suggest you give this one a miss. If you simply must read it, check it out of the library and please, please, please let this title fade off into &quot;out of print&quot; land..."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I had read SEP's Chicago Stars series and absolutely loved them, so I bought several of her older books. Although I HATED Fancy Pants (way too dark for me, too much back story, etc.) I decided to pick up Hot Shot. It was extrememely well written, and since I'm a Mac fan, it was interesting and entertaining to read how Apple and the personal computer industry came to be in the 1970s and '80s. But the story, although very good, left me feeling very uneasy about halfway through the book. When Susannah leaves on Sam's motorcycle, it was like the heroine leaving with Prince Charming and riding off into the sunset, only to discover that Prince Charming lives with his mother, and is a whiner, and eventually a cheat. On the other hand, I felt, along with Susannah, those same emotions of betrayal, lonliness and the like throughout the book. And Yank, Paige and Mitch were great characters. It's a good book, but if you're looking for something lighthearted and fun, this isn't it. However, if you're after an emotional rollercoaster, this is one of the better reads."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"It's been about three years since I've read this book, so I won't go into the nitty-gritty of the plot. I'll just tell you why this book has stayed in my memory all this time, despite the fact I don't read much romance, and even less contemporary romance.The basic story is that Susannah, a restless debutante in the late seventies, flees her society wedding on the back of a Harley driven by a sexy entrepreneur she's known for only a few weeks. The biker, Sam, is starting a computer business with his two friends, a straitlaced businessman and a \\"geek\\". Susannah and Sam are joined at the hip for years, but then his dark side comes out, and Susannah begins to see the jerk he really is--and realizes that the real Prince Charming is right in front of her eyes. Her party-girl sister, Paige, also finds love in an unlikely quarter.Here's what I like about this book, which I think is the same reason other reviewers are griping about it. It's one of only a handful of romance novels in which the \\"alpha male\\" macho jerk doesn't win the lady in the end. Most romances have the heroines falling for these violent, promiscuous, impulsive men, and end with the couple riding off into the sunset together, and supposedly this jerk has changed his ways. Come on, we all know most of those couples will be in divorce court in a year, when the woman realizes that the man is *still* violent, promiscuous, and impulsive. The guy with the attitude and the flashy clothes is not always the best catch, and this book is a wonderful illustration of that. It *begins* with the heroine riding off with the macho man, and then we get to see what happens next.I also liked the detailed research that went into this book's Silicon Valley setting. Some readers complain that the computer history is too detailed, but personally I prefer novels where the setting is more than a painted backdrop and a trunkful of costumes; novels where the background becomes real. But that's just me."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"Though this is not a typical SEP book, I loved it! This is a wonderful story that grabs the reader right from the start and doesn't let go. The author has created well drawn, interesting characters with her usual style and talent. The complex story centered on the development of the personal computer in Silicon Valley is woven in a seamless fashion and includes intrigue, betrayal, suspense, humor and yes - passion. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"If you like Nora Roberts style of romance, then you will love this book. Susan takes a new view of Pirates of Silicon Valley. After all the stuff my Info Tech class made me read on Steve Jobs (of Apple computers) I see where she modeled Sam from.I loved the characters. If you have the patience to stick out the book, you will too. Usually, SEP uses humor and situational comedy to hook her readers, but here she tries something different. That does not mean it's bad! I almost didn't read it after a few of these reviews, but I am glad I took the time.As usual, I am upset that's the end of the story, I want to keep on reading about Susanah and hear how the rest of her life turns out."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I think this is one of the best romance novels of all time: smart, sophisticated, funny, touching, complex, and fascinating. Susannah's character arc alone is worth the cover price, but Phillips finely drawn cast of supporting characters makes every page a treat. It's just a wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"As a \\"20-something\\" I had very mixed feelings about this book. I both like and hate this book. I cannot decide which emotion is stronger. I have read many of SEP's other books. This one was VERY different. While the others are essentially the same book, this one is not. In fact, only the title and the cover art even hint at it being written by SEP. Overall, I thought it was an odd mix of serious themes and somewhat idiotic characters. The book is broken up into two very different sections. I felt as if \\"Suzie\\" and Sam were meant to be couple, but it never felt right from the start. Essentially, they burned each other out. I think that SEP was trying to break out of her \\"traditional\\" novel, but I still found this one predictable. I don't think she succeeded at stepping out of her genre. That being said, I think that older readers would appreciate this story more than I did. However, I typically by SEP novels because I know what story I am going to get. I like the repetitive, predictable nature of her other novels. When I want intellectual stimulation, I turn to other authors and genres entirely. While I appreciate her attempt, I think she should stick to her lighter stories that she has perfected."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"This is one of Susan Elizabeth Phillips first books. I own it in paperback & couldn't resist getting it on Kindle too. The story takes place back when Steve Jobs & Steve Wazniack were first building their small computers in the garages in California. It's a little dated now, but is still a great read! Any fan of SEB will love it!"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"4.5 out of 5 stars! Okay .... originally this book, in it's hardcover/paperback formats, was written in 1991 so most of the book is based in the 70's and 80's which is when women were just coming into the work force (more so then before) and taking on bigger roles that others might not have been ready for them to do. Plus, this book (based on what the author writes in her 'author's note') is based prominently on fiction, about the IBM's and Apple's of that time period (how they all got started -- etc.) while set in her non-fiction world. It kept me captivated! In addition, I LOVED the relationship Susannah had with Sam, Yank, & Mitch!! However, I will admit throughout this book there are twists that I really didn't expect to see, and I wish I had some tissues with me when they did come around.My only problem with the book was that even though I loved the relationships that were written between all of the characters, I think there should have been a bit more about Susannah and the man she is with towards the end. Since the story gets them together but you really don't get to see their relationship bloom more so then what is provided already in the book. *shrug* But that could be just me.Anyway .... I recommend this book for those who like fiction and non-fiction type of books mixed together, along with those whom have read the other books of Susan Elizabeth Phillips before since this one is one of her first books, and is GREAT right along with the rest!!Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a few teasers on my blog)"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"Overall, I enjoyed the book. It seemed to drag on at times, but I was satisfied at the ending.I read \\"It Had to Be You\\" just before I read \\"Hot Shot\\", and it was much better."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"Susan Elizabeth Phillips has done it again! This book is an awesome look at the creation of the laptop computer through the eyes of an independent female who follows her dreams. Not only does the book show the character development of what one believes to be a dependent woman subservient to her father's rules but it shows how when an individual works hard to pursue her dream how it can come true. Of course there's the \\"evil\\" jilted man who will stop at nothing to be sure that she doesn't succeed. The setting is from a garage in Palo Alto to the sunny shores of the Greek Islands and back again to Silcon Valley by way of Boston. If you haven't read any of Ms.Phillips books then you are missing a real treat. Having met Ms.Phillips a few years ago I find her characters to be as delightful as she is."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I'm mostly a fan of the \\"Stars\\" series, but this book has SEP's magic, you simply can't put it down! Only SEP can create such fun, and lively characters. Example\\" Sam Gamble's mother \\"Angela\\" is a real piece of work; dresses like a hooker. However She seems to be very down to earth. Right now I can't wait to see if Susannah's venture turns out. You will not be dissapointed--a must read!"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"My first Susan Elizabeth Phillips novel was Ain't She Sweet, and I was immediately blown away. In its complex, brilliant pages, she took the romance genre and used it to launch a beautiful rumination on love, regret, family, community, and memory. In short, she created a great book, not merely a great romance novel.Since then, I've read most of Phillips' books and have enjoyed them immensely, but I've also been a little disappointed. While they were all fine novels, filled with great characters and wonderful humor, they were also a little rote. The plots seemed obvious, the complications a little too simple. In short, while they were great romance novels, they weren't great books and I have often felt like Phillips is skating by on her amazing ability to tell a story, and ignoring her own potential for truly great and revelatory fiction.I just finished Hot Shot and was again amazed. I'm not sure if it's a great romance novel -- it was unclear who Susannah, the main character, is going to end up with, and the plot often slides away from romantic entanglements -- but it is certainly a great book. While it lacks some of the polish and much of the humor that characterize Phillips' later novels, its depiction of good people trying to discover themselves is simply outstanding. Bottom line, this book is a gem that shows the kind of work that Phillips is capable of writing, but all-too-rarely does."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I enjoyed this book, but it isn't one of my SEP favorites. That said, it's definitely worth your time!"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I read this book more than 4 months ago and, after having the story pop into my mind so often, I just had to write a short 'n sweet review about it. Overall the story lines and the characters are amazing and the way that the author manages to weave together a story that spans such a large spread of time is fabulous.But the reason it pops into my head is that the story itself, the idea of showing the personal relationships and the working relationships of a fictional team of misfits who revolutionize the computer age with the development of the personal computer is ingenious!!! It was so well done. It has me wondering about the real developers of the technology and about their personal stories. You just have to read this book!"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"\\"Hot Shot\\" is a good romance book, fast read and I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read these kinds of books. I haven't read this author before and intend to buy more of her books."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I am a firm fan of Susan Elizabeth Phillips writing. I get all wrapped up in her storytelling and always feel warm and glad to be alive after every story. But Hot Shot is so different from her other books that I've read. It too is a romance but it is so much more. It is probably the first romance i read that the 'hero', Sam, turned out not to be the love of her life... it kinda threw me in a loop there for a while. Flawed heroes seem to get their acts together before 'the end' in romance novels and he kinda did too, but not in the way i expected. It threw me in a loop but in a good way. Suzi, Paige, Yank, Mitch and even Sam were alive and real and I loved them all. Incredible... brilliant! A touch of realism in my fantasy world was so unusual but it was spun so brilliantly that it fit right in. So i can't get my mind together on which SEP novel i like the most... but Hot Shot is definitely in the running."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"This book is one of my absolute favorites! The characters draw me in and allow me to read it time and time again. Mitch is a wonderful character, and I love how Susannah and Yank and Paige and Mitch fit together. A wonderful, funny read!"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"Ok, so let me start by saying that I do enjoy SEP's books as a general rule. I like to put the audiobook versions on my mp3 player and work out to them. Her books are fun, easy, and light-hearted, with a definite trend to most of them. Most. This book broke that mold in the most pleasant way.Before I started this book, I read some of the reviews, and was a little apprehensive. I had read Glitter Baby, also an earlier book which didn't follow the usual SEP formula, and I HATED it. I know some reviewers felt the same about this book, but I couldn't have disagreed more. Each character in this book was distinctly developed and complex. In most cases, writers don't take the time to give layers to the perceived villain in a story. Not Susan Elizabeth Phillips with this book. Even during her rough period with her father, you see how incredibly human he is. I can honestly say that the scenes with her father evoked serious emotions for me. They were written so well. Also, watching Susannah develop from a timid young adult, to dipping her toes in the rebel pool, and on to womanhood was done gracefully.I can picture Sam in my mind's eye, and can practically feel his energy jumping off the pages. I have no idea how she managed to make pages of dialog and description charismatic, but she did with Sam. Mitch came across as solid and steady as could be, but I wish I could have seen more of his feelings early on. Yank was a character I could have read a whole book about. He has to be one of the most like-able and unconventionally sexy men she has written.I suppose if I have any issues with this book, it would be that I would have liked to have seen more of the Mitch situation in the early stages of interest. I also would have liked to see more of Yank. I can tell you that this isn't a book that focuses primarily on the romance, but a fantastic read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"first book i ever read of MS SEP and i loved it... out of all her books this and heaven texas is the best. Book tells the story of Susanna falconcer and her struggle to find her mark in the world. ALong the way she she forms a business partnership with three men that will change her life forever. Two of these men become her lovers. however, one of the two is destined to be her true love."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I have read every one of Susan Elizabeth Phillip's books and Hot Shot took me the longest to find. When I finally located it at a bookstore a few weeks ago, I was slow to start it. It didn't look the same as her other books. However, once I began I couldn't stop. I raced through the book in two days and became totally wrapped up in the story. Susannah is a beautiful and deep character who reminds me of myself. She discovered such strength and overcame incredible obstacles. The three men in her life after she runs from her wedding are very realisitc. They have flaws, but, in all they are strong people who help Susannah to grow into her own person. I would absolutely reccomend this well-researched and facinating book to anyone. Instead of another romance, this is a story about personal growth and is an inspiration to every woman who is still finding her place in the world. My only regret is that this is the last available book by Susan Elizabeth Phillips that I haven't read."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"Nobody can say that SEP takes it the easy way out. Every one of her books is written with love and care. In addition, &quot;Hot Shot,&quot; is just wonderful! Watching Suzanne's growth is painful and emotional as she shifts from suppressed daddy's girl to corporate leader. Yet I just wanted to root for her the whole way. It was especially interesting to see how Suzanne and Sam fell in love and then grew out of it. The relationships twist and turn and show real growth. It's not like the typical romance where the hero and the heroine fall in love and stay that way forever. Moreover, Paige was an interesting addition to the story. I couldn't help disliking her at the beginning, but she too was a little girl suffering inside. And Yank, oh Yank, what a sweet dweeb. But he has a happy ending too. I only wish that there had been more written on Suzanne and Mitch. I didn't want this book to end. As for the ending, it is sheer wit!"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"This is definitely my favorite novel by Susan E. Phillips. I finished this book the day after I purchased it, and have read it over and over again. Hopefully she'll come out with a sequel!"},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"OK, Susan Elizabeth Phillips is one of my favourite authors - her books are a \\"go-to\\" when I just want to enjoy a good read and be put in a good mood. I have given 'Hot Shot' an \\"I liked it\\" rating, but unlike some of her other books, it definitely wasn't an \\"I loved it\\" experience. Most of SEP's characters & story lines grab me and pull me into the book, but not this one. But, looking on the brightside - it made it easier to put the book down at a sensible hour, turn out the light and get some much needed sleep."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I will start off with the fact that I do like SEP's books. Some more than others. The Chicago Stars series are my favorite. In fact, when it comes to choosing one.... I really can't. Each of those books touched me in a way that I cannot really describe.When I grabbed a copy of Hot Shot from my local library, I was hoping for something that offered the promise of that simple synopsis the back cover offered.... A runaway bride on a back of a Harley-Davidson, three completely different men, and a journey of self-discovery. What I did manage to read is a story more based on the birth of the personal computer and less character attachment. It was moving, it even had some funny parts, and it taught a lesson, but it was filled with far less depth that is could have had.This book came in two parts... The introduction of Susanna Faulconer, a child left behind in an abusive environment to be raised by a painfully vicious grandmother, to be saved by her stepfather. That introduction of her painful start moved me. Especially the warmth and kindness of her stepfather who takes her away from the misery to warmly place her in the fold of a new family and a younger sister. Her mother was bitter and that was hard to read about. The journey she takes to be the perfect child because of the love her stepfather had given her is completely believable. It is upon meeting Sam Gamble, that I felt it was a stretch. Falling in love with a bad boy visionary is even believable, but the events that followed their initial meeting I felt was odd. Sam was a bit of a flake and I could not see them getting married at first, but accepted it nonetheless. While the additional characters ranging from her ex-fiance, her family and her friendship with Yank and Mitch pulled the story together, I felt that there was way too much emphasis on the challenges of creating a silicon-based empire from nothing but a vision for the future. I almost stopped reading this book half-way through.By the time the second part of the book took off.... I was hooked. There was more emotion, more action, and far less history of the personal computer. The only part that disappointed me was the lack of story between Susanna and Mitch. Their story was cut short compared to the overwhelming story of Susanna and Sam.There should have been more balance for character story than non-fiction information about the rise of the personal computer. In closing, while my review is not the highest nor is it the lowest, you have to take into consideration the notion if you are looking for a quick, happy ever after story with light banter, humor, or strong imagination.... this is not the book for you. If you enjoy the blurred lines between fiction and non-fiction with a story that borders more on the non-fiction knowledge with believable emotion that moves at a fact pace.... then this is the book for you. I just happened to feel that it was not the best fit for me at this time."},{"Title":"Hot Shot","review":"I have read all her new books out over the last few years and just loved them, so I wanted more, so I started to read some of her old books,This one I have enjoyed but a little long winded, but will not stop me from reading now all her old ones, she is a better writer now but I still enjoyedthe older ones ."},{"Title":"Property Loss Adjusting: Two Texts and Course Guide","review":"This is a worthless book!

Gimme my money back!"},{"Title":"60' 6'' and Other Distances from Home: The (Baseball) Life of Mose YellowHorse","review":"I was very impressed by the author's creative way in which he presented this biography.

It's both entertaining and informative."},{"Title":"60' 6'' and Other Distances from Home: The (Baseball) Life of Mose YellowHorse","review":"I don't normally read sports biographies, however, a friend of mine, aware of my interest in American Indian history, recommended this book to me after she'd had the priviledge of attending one of the author's readings. Fascinating indeed! The life and legend of Mose Yellowhorse is told wonderfully and passionately through the talents of Todd Fuller. This book is an amazing journey from start to finish. Take it from me, I could not put the book down!"},{"Title":"60' 6'' and Other Distances from Home: The (Baseball) Life of Mose YellowHorse","review":"I read this book when I was writting a graduate Thesis for baseball history. Good read to get information. Understand that he wanted a unique way to set up book. Maybe only drawback if reading for information. Is good that it includes oral history of the man, statistical history and analytical history. A good read for entertainment or historical review."},{"Title":"60' 6'' and Other Distances from Home: The (Baseball) Life of Mose YellowHorse","review":"Through Fuller's careful research and beautifully written poetry, we get a unique, intriguing, and entertaining biography on the life of Mose Yellowhorse. As a proud member of the Pawnee Nation, I highly commend Fuller for his dedication to see this work to its completion. For without him, Mose's story would have remained untold and what a shame that would have been for Native American history, Native American sports history, the Pawnee Nation and for Mose Yellowhorse himself....1) This book is about the first full-blood American Indian to play baseball in the major leagues. That he accomplished such a difficult thing in an era when not even African Americans were allowed to play in the majors, is something that all American Indians should be proud of (not just the Pawnee). 2) From this book, Non-Native society learns that Indians DO exist, not just in the historical sense but in contemporary, everyday existence. Non-Native society learns that Indians CAN accomplish great things, such as, playing major league baseball. 3) It could be that Yellowhorse's own words are absent from this book because he passed away nearly 40 years ago and also, it states very clearly in the book that Yellowhorse left no journals or other writings behind. (Possible explanation for that \\"emptiness,\\" I don't know)."},{"Title":"60' 6'' and Other Distances from Home: The (Baseball) Life of Mose YellowHorse","review":"What the author has done in this work is bring together varied perspectives--from Native to non-Native--in order to tell the life story of a neglected, yet historical, Indian ballplayer. (I had never really heard of Mose YellowHorse before reading the book.) That someone has finally taken up this task is admirable, and the author does it with as much research, creativity, and passion as can be mustered. For that, I think he is to be thanked. As a baseball fan, I was intrigued to read about such accounts involving Ruth, Cobb, etc. To include well-written and balanced poems alongside cartoons, tape transcripts, and letters is quite a feat. I first became interested in reading this book after reading consecutive strong reviews in Booklist and the Native American Times."},{"Title":"60' 6'' and Other Distances from Home: The (Baseball) Life of Mose YellowHorse","review":"Todd was my English Comp teacher in college, good guy, made me believe I could write and I havent stopped since. I was so proud when I read this book."},{"Title":"60' 6'' and Other Distances from Home: The (Baseball) Life of Mose YellowHorse","review":"Save your money and your time. I recommend leaving this potshot at the Native American non-fiction genre in the pile of unread books next to the rest of the myth-and-legend creation stories written and edited by &quot;white&quot; authors where it belongs. The problem is not Fuller's overambitious and sometimes nonsensical prose, the lack of basic evidence to support much of what he deems factual within the text itself, or the fact that Fuller himself presents fuzzy portrait of the man he is trying to recognize. The words of Yellowhorse himself are absent from this book; in that emptiness, there is little left that furthers the recognition of the integrity of Native Peoples in history, aside from that which has been outlined being of great importance in conventional, non-Native society."},{"Title":"Benthem Crouwel 1980-2000","review":"This book is a comprehensive monogrpah of the renowed dutch architectural practice. Starting from single houses in the early years to the recent XL projects such as high rise office building and airport, most of the major projects are covered. Some of the photographs are very interesting as the photographers play around with reflection on glass, local people (e.g. cleaners on maintenance walkway, yuppies on motocycles), etc. in the architectural shoots, which are very rare in the architectural publication. However, due to the large no. of projects and large sized photographs (each of which usally take up one page, if not two), the selection of drawings and photographs are very limited, not to metion the architectural detailing of the projects which are very appealing. For example, there are few photos and drawings for the very interesting high-rise office building which was built over a running highway. The coverage on the airport complex project is also very limited. When compared to the recent monograph publication on dutch architects, e.g. MOVE of Ban van Berkel, SMLXL of OMA, etc., the coverage of projects, touch with the architect as well as graphic design of this book are relatively not appealing.Consequently, as a mongraph of Benthem Crouwel, it is a valuable publication waited for long time."},{"Title":"Breast Cancer Treatment... the decisions are YOURS","review":"A must-read book by a health care professional with breast cancer.

If anyone was looking for a woman to help them with the fight against doctors, insurance companies, and the other various trials of breast cancer, they should look no further! Jean's experience with politics and her own firey personality are perfectly suited to take up the torch for those facing the difficult decisions accompanied with a diagnosis of breast cancer. I believe after reading this book, that Mrs. Duffy is the ideal woman to look to for a new advocate, and voice, in the breast cancer arena."},{"Title":"Breast Cancer Treatment... the decisions are YOURS","review":"\\"Breast Cancer Treatment...The Decisions are Yours\\" is a thought-provoking personal story of a woman's fight to choose her breast cancer treatment. Jean MacPherson Duffy wrote the book in a conversational tone and explained the medical terminology you often hear in the doctor's office or in medical journals so that most any reader could understand it. I found her message helpful and empowering. She lets us know, through her own first-hand experience, that women have choices in their breast cancer treatment, and she encourages us to research everything. This book reads quickly, and leaves you wishing that you could sit down with the author, have a cup of coffee, and hear more of her wise counseling."},{"Title":"Complete Works of James Whitcomb Riley","review":"this is a wonderful read especially &#34;When the frost is on the punkin&#34; and &#34;the Ragedy man&#34;"},{"Title":"Complete Works of James Whitcomb Riley","review":"I was thrilled to be reunited with this poet.

He was also very strangely conservative ... opposed to gay marriage, seemed to really despise women (or at least have old-fashioned thoughts on them). It's a brave memoir for the time, maybe, but I'm not sure if it's really great for broadening straight people's views on bisexuality."},{"Title":"Half Straight: My Secret Bisexual Life","review":"I read this book when I was first coming out. While I don't recommend \\"Tom Smith\\" as any sort of a role model, the book helped me by ripping off the cover of what had been, from my perspective, an entirely concealed world of exceptionally common and abundant guy-on-guy sex. No one likes to discuss how much sex is actually going on and I think a frank admission of the fact that people like sex and indulge in it vigorously is healthy for our society. Seeing how common guy-on-guy sex is even for men who otherwise seemed quite ordinary or \\"normal\\" helped me to come to terms with my own homosexuality. I began to view homosexual sex as a normal, commonplace event, as opposed to a strange, removed, \\"othered\\" experience. Tom lived a very active, multi-partner sex life which he effectively concealed over decades from his family and open society. He seems fairly honest in recounting his story and he grows somewhat as a result of telling it. I don't really think that he confronts that split in his personality effectively, however. At the end, he remains closeted, pretending to be faithful to his wife while engaging in regular sex with multiple partners. His journey is interesting and lively. It is also entirely sexual. Tom's capacity for love seems about as stunted as his libido is indulged. In the end, his story was an example of the sort of dishonest life I didn't want to live."},{"Title":"Half Straight: My Secret Bisexual Life","review":"This is the only book I've read (and I've read at least a dozen of them not only in English) in the subject which really puts you in the life of a married bisexual man, as hundreds of thousands in America today.

What most folks in Oneness circles don't know is that Oneness Pentecostals have not always taught that the \\"water and the Spirit\\" of John 3:5 equates with water baptism and Spirit baptism as mentioned in Acts 2:38. There are many Oneness Pentecostal pioneers and authors such as Howard A. Goss, the first General Superintendant of the United Pentecostal Church, John Paterson, Andrew Urshan, and C.H. Yadon, and others that repudiated such a position.These men taught that people were baptized because they WERE believers and partakers of eternal life and saved NOT to make them believers or obtain salvation.

Sherlock Holmes actually gets a few pages but most get one or two paragraphs. There is a corresponding chapter \\"Rogues ...\\" on the famous bad guys. Again, most get a few paragraphs. The chapter \\"Cases\\" provides a short plot summary, minus spoilers, of what they regard as the best mystery/crime/detective novels (and short story collections) up to about 1975. The final chapter is \\"Movies\\", which provides a plot summary of what they regard as the best movies of this genre, up to 1975. Finally, it has a very detailed index - about 70 pages, listed by author.

I am a very big Tom Cruise fan, so I decided to take the risk.I was a bit shocked to find out that the customer review on this website that claimed that Cruise had made punnish errors in reading movie titles seems to have been entirely fabricated. I don't understand why something like that isn't removed from the site.The book was ok. I learned some things about Cruise's career. There were some nice photos. Still, it wasn't an adult book. I would have liked something more meaty and in depth. I guess that would be hard to write, since he's not a person who likes to reveal intimate details about himself. I suppose eventually some person in his entourage will start talking and we'll actually find out something about him. We'll just have to be patient.This would be a good book to give to a child who is dyslexic and feeling discouraged about learning to read, though."},{"Title":"ISIS","review":"I was really excited when I found out that Douglas Clegg was writing a book about Isis. I wanted to know more about her character. This book is incredible. The illustrations are haunting and beautiful. The story itself is fascinating and sends just the right amount of chills up your spine. I'm very interested in world mythology, so I really liked seeing the Egyptian myth about Isis and Osiris worked into the storyline. Douglas certainly knows how to describe everything so you feel as if you are there inside the story. I'm sure that just like me you'll read it in one sitting. This is definitely a great book to read to older children by the campfire or even make it a tradition to read together every Halloween.

When she had returned, she brought him with her and held his hand as they emerged from the winding caves into the sunlight. But when others saw the couple, they cried out in terror--for her lover's eyes were black as pitch, and he had no mouth upon his face, just a seal of flesh as if he had not formed completely upon his journey back to the land of the living. The villagers knew he was not meant to be among them, yet the Maiden would not allow him to return to the earth.\\" - From IsisI can't remember the last time I read such a truly spooky book, in the classic sense of the word. Maybe Stephen King, circa the 80's (when he was stoned and wrote great horror)?When I first held this slim volume by Douglas Clegg, only 111 pages, I honestly wondered, \\"Can someone really tell a good scary story in such a short time?\\" Since I knew I'd finish Isis within an hour or two, I figured I'd pass a Saturday morning with this illustrated hardcover book.Let me start off by saying that I have never read anything from Douglas Clegg before; in fact, I had never heard of him before I picked up Isis. So I had no expectations, really. Just curiosity at what an author can do in 111 pages.After finishing Isis...wow. It's hard to put in words how the tone of this book sucked me in and below its undertow of dread. I truly felt \\"haunted\\" while reading it, and even afterward.Isis is how great horror should read (in my opinion). I gave up horror novels a long time ago because gratuitous violence and shock value of modern horror began to replace erudition, atmosphere, and gradual dread employed by masters like Poe, Hawthorne, Kafka--even early King and Koontz.Ah, but Douglas Clegg's creepy (yet heartbreakingly compelling) Isis has reawakened in me a desire for classic horror; in fact, I look forward to reading other books by this author!If you enjoy classic horror that explores themes such as life after death, premature resurrection, forbidden rituals, and the yearning to preserve life at all costs, you'll no doubt fall in love with Isis.Well written and gripping, Isis delivers delicious chills (especially during the month of Halloween!), and rewards the reader with a highly satisfying tale of the supernatural.-- Janet Boyer, author of Back in Time Tarot"},{"Title":"ISIS","review":"With this novella, Clegg adds yet another layer of depth to the Harrow mythos that he has created over the years. Here we're given a gothically-toned glimpse into the early life of the girl who would become Isis Claviger.Raised with little influence from either of her parents, we're shown the events that lead to a young girl's introduction to the Occult. Warned never to visit the depths of her family tomb, and never to toy with the rituals that haunt her family's past, young Isis grows to adolesence in the mysterious manor belonging to her eccentric grandfather. Following the accidental death of her brother Harvey, Isis learns the meaning of sadness and lonliness, which lead her to overcome her fears and reach out to the world beyond that she may know her brother once again.Told in a style that will both provoke and chill, this novella competes with The Necromancer for the place of my favorite of the Harrow tales. Excellent as a standalone that can be enjoyed in an evening or two, but essential to any collection of the author's other works."},{"Title":"ISIS","review":"The Villier family's homestead is situated right near a burial ground.

Though, Harvey and Spence could not be more different from each other than night and day. Harvey is the sweet one and Spence is the evil one. Iris and Harvey get along with each other. They are very close.One day a tragic accident befalls Harvey and Iris, leaving Harvey dead and Iris gaining the ability to communicate with the dead. Iris longs to bring Harvey back from the dead but is she willing to pay the price?While the story had some paranormal elements to it, I was hoping for more. I found the characters were interesting. This is a quick read, which I actually wished had lasted a bit longer. The illustrations in this book are detailed and wonderful. I would have liked to seen Iris use her new learned ability more. It was like she had it, used it and that was it. Overall, a pretty good book."},{"Title":"ISIS","review":"Iris Catherine Villiers is part of an unhappy home. Her father is somewhere at war, her mother is depressed and keeps to herself, her grandfather (known as the Gray Minister) shouts ominous Biblical passages from inside his room, and her governess hates her. Harvey, one of twin brothers, is the only person who cares about her. Their closeness is wonderful, and they often call themselves ISIS and Osiris, after the legend. They go on adventures together at Belerion Hall, their Cornish estate, and that is where they learn some creepy things about the Tombs from their gardener. Old Marsh's warnings go unheard when tragedy occurs one day. In her torment, Iris discovers that she can summon the dead. But as Old Marsh says, there is a big price to pay. Eternal damnation might be in the cards for Isis and Osiris.ISIS (which I think it's set in Victorian times) has the subtitle of \\"A Tale of the Supernatural,\\" but that is an understatement. It is in fact quite a spooky gothic story, and it deals with the consequences that come from good intentions -- or rather, from selfishness. It begins with an ominous tone, and it ends with sheer horror. There is symbolism and foreshadowing. Douglas Clegg sure knows how to write a don't-turn-off-the-lights/don't-read-before-bedtime type of story. My one complaint is that this is very short. At 113 pages, it is a novella and nothing more. Still, it is definitely worth reading. I think I will try Clegg's other efforts after reading this gem. Highly recommended, a perfect read-under-the-sheets book for the harvest/Halloween season."},{"Title":"ISIS","review":"[This review is based on an Advanced Reading Copy]Isis by Douglas Clegg is essentially a short story about a young girl named Iris Villiers who seeks knowledge about local legends in order to bring the dead back to life. Iris and her family live an idyllic life near Cornwall, England. Their home is an old mansion called Belerion Hall which unfortunately is situated near the family tombs. The locals warn Iris that dark forces stir within the tombs and that they're best left alone. After a tragedy strikes, Iris delves into forbidden rituals in efforts to reverse the loss which has occurred. Here are my thoughts on Isis;Pros+ Beautifully hand drawn black and white illustrations accompanying the current scene. Cover art is also excellent.+ Adult themed story+ Cleverly depicted lessons about love and life+ Bleak and eerie atmosphereCons- A bit too short- Predictable story- Not really scaryWhile the story is short, the tone of it is set very well. The author does an excellent job at creating a bleak and gloomy atmosphere. It's also very clear that Iris' love knows no bound which is a key part of the story. Isis was an enjoyable story and worth spending an hour or two reading. Just don't expect it to last very long."},{"Title":"ISIS","review":"If you love the classic horror tales of old this is the book for you! It reminds me of Poe in many ways. It is beautifully written and full of the irony that good horror always has.A young girl makes a wish to bring back her beloved brother and her wish is granted. Though that may seem like a happy ending, Clegg doesn't rely on the predictable to complete his tale, which I really love. The book is appropriate for younger readers, those who would appreciate Poe or maybe even Twilight Zone. It's a novella and can easily be read in a couple of hours."},{"Title":"ISIS","review":"The novella concerns a young girl living in a manor in England with her family. After a horrible tragedy, the young girl tries to call up the forces of the dead to solve her life, and to see a loved one again. As the book says numerous times 'death has a price', and she finds out deaths price in a fairly gruesome way.It was marked as a suspense, though to be honest I didn't find it all that scary. A younger audience would probably be more frightened by the cautionary tale.Regardless, I thought it was a really interesting little story. It was imaginative and there were some great supernatural elements. As I said, I didn't find the book to be scary, however it was thoroughly entertaining. It was also beautifully illustrated throughout. The whole novella was actually quite visually beautiful.So, while a younger audience might be frightened by the story, I think an older audience would appreciate this novella as an unusual fairy tale about consequences and death. I absolutely recommend this novella."},{"Title":"ISIS","review":"I don't know much about the personal religious beliefs of Douglas Clegg, but if he's not a Pagan, he sure does a good impression of one. The last book I read by this author wasMordred, Bastard Son (Mordred Trilogy), and I was impressed by the poetic retelling of Arthurian legend. He breathes life and poetry into age-old Celtic legends.Clegg revisits one of the old Arthurian stomping grounds, Cornwall, in more modern times in 'Isis.' The novella centers on Iris, the daughter of an American actress/singer mother and a British father. Iris and her three brothers, including twins Spence and (Iris' favorite) Harvey, were raised on Long Island before their father moved them to Cornwall to be near his own aging father. Through groundskeeper Old Marsh, Iris learns the ancient legends of her seaside home. From her grandfather's library, she learns an ancient spell for bringing the dead back to life. She never thinks to use it until the thoughtlessness of Spence and an evil governess causes a terrible accident. Harvey falls from a window and is killed. At that moment, a \\"window\\" opens up inside Iris, and she is linked to the world of the dead. Clegg incorporates the ancient Egyptian myth of Isis, who resurrected her brother (and lover) Osiris from the dead after their other brother Set killed him. The most beautiful part of this eerie tale, though, is Clegg's description, via a resurrected Harvey, of what the Cornish call the Isle of Apples (Avalon), the land of the dead. But just as J.K. Rowling warned in \\"The Deathly Hallows\\" inThe Tales of Beedle the Bard, Standard Edition, those brought from the land of the dead do not belong in this world. Iris should have listened to the old legends."},{"Title":"ISIS","review":"I won this book in a contest.Isis is the first work I've ever read by Douglas Clegg and I have to wonder why it took me so long. Isis is a classic style horror story, part darkness, death and depression, and part fairy tale. Gorgeously written it's the tale of Iris Villiers, a girl who grew up wandering a land haunted by ghosts and legends, who by all means should have known better than to breach the veil between the living and the dead.Short (about 100 pages) Isis is full of barely restrained raw emotions, sadness and love. Also peppered between Clegg's stunning style are illustrations that match the tone of the book with their classic fairy tale style and simple black and white morbidity.It's hard to review such a short tale without ruining the plot, so I'll leave it at this: Isis is not to be missed, a haunting tale that crosses genres and trends and is sure to be just as appealing years from now."},{"Title":"ISIS","review":"This is a quick-and-classic little horror story that one would not guess was modern save for the listed age of the author.In the style of Lovecraft or his peers, it's written in a very Victorian fashion. Very formally, stiffly. It's both charming and derivative--but aren't all the best horror stories from the Victorian era, when we could still be terrified by the certainty that the dead could come back?This tale is relatively short--a quick little read that doesn't stay with you much longer than it takes to get through the book. The author tries to construct scenes of the life before all incidents, but the voice he chooses to use (a girl, first person--not unusual for a Victorian style at all) fails to set quite the proper tone--though the naivety does serve to further some plot points toward the end.Overall, a grim, charming little story without much to it. It explores less of the shocking or gruesome sort of horror, and more the existential life-and-death sort of horror. It's not something that would scare anyone today, but it does have a pleasant eeriness."},{"Title":"ISIS","review":"Isis by Douglas Clegg is a very quick read at only 111 pages. It is the story of Iris and her twin brother, Harvey and Spence whom live with their mother and move to their grandfather's house. Their father is said to be off in the war and so he is never there and the mother has a nanny/tutor to help take care of the children. As the story progresses, tragedy strikes and Iris makes a decision, one that can only lead to madness. There are a couple of sub plots added to enhance the eerie feel of the setting such as the Maiden of Sorrow and other tales told by the Gardener.The flow of the novella is smooth right to the end. Everything meshes together nicely making for an enjoyable read. The only thing added to break things up is the artwork which of course I had to take the time to admire. (The artwork can also be enjoyed at [...]. Just click on the Isis game).Since this is only a novella, the pacing was rather quick and the back story is quickly set and everything moves from there. I was able to get through this in one sitting, but enjoyed every minute of it.One thing that Mr. Clegg is great at is his characters. Each character has their own voice and depth. I was able to connect with each and every one of the characters. Even the side characters were unique in their own way and an integral part of the story, so much so that they felt just as important as the main characters.Some criticisms1. Well, only one and this is very minor, but I was hoping for a bit of a longer tale. To me a story that is only 111 pages long and has many illustrations, barely makes it a novella.Some positives1. As I mentioned before, Mr. Clegg knows characters and how to give them depth and believability. Also the character development was spot on.2. When it comes to supernatural horror, you can do no better. There is a definite Lovecraft style to Mr. Clegg's stories except Mr. Clegg adds a more human element to his, greatly enhancing the style.3. For as short of a story as it is, there was enough background information given about the characters and the surrounding area to give the book a multi dimension feel and yet not take from but add to the story itself.Overall, even though I may wish for a longer book, Isis is a very well written and thorough supernatural horror novella. Of the declining horror genre and limited stories published, Mr. Clegg still shines with a blindingly bright beacon showing that horror fiction cannot be counted out yet. If you are looking for a quick horror read, I highly recommend this one. Fans of horror will not disappointed with this one at all.-Dimndbangr"},{"Title":"ISIS","review":"This is a prequel of Douglas Clegg's HARROW books, which I didn't realize until after I read the book. ISIS is a novella, being only 113 pages long, but it's quite amazing.It is the story of Iris and her brother, Harvey. They grow up together in a very dysfunctional family - before there were even any such things as dysfunctional families. Iris's father takes off; her mother is depressed and is an alcoholic. She has an older brother who she never sees and twin brothers. One is very selfish and the other is very kind, and that one is Harvey.Iris and Harvey are fascinated with the Egyptian myth of Isis and Osiris. The story is a take off of that. When Harvey dies saving Iris, she defies all to get him back.I enjoyed this short book but have to admit that I needed to read it during the day because it scared me.

Later Egyptian myths told of the Nile River flooding annually as a result of the tears shed by Isis over the death of her husband, Osiris. The occurrence of Osiris' death and rebirth was relived by the Egyptians each year through rituals.The upcoming novella by novelist Douglas Clegg entitled ISIS is a classic supernatural tale that follows the Egyptian Isis legend while also involving a story of family, beauty, youth, love, death and resurrection. Young Iris Villiers is uprooted with her family --- parents and three older brothers (two of them being identical twins) --- from their home on the Long Island Sound to Belerion Hall, the home of Iris' Grandfather along the rocky cliffs of Cornwall, England.With Mr. Villiers being called away to service in Burma for the British government, Mrs. Villiers is left to raise her children alone. The oldest son, Lewis, is rarely home as he has left to begin college. The twins --- Harvey and Spencer --- remain at Belerion Hall with their young sister, Iris. Iris is a highly imaginative and intelligent young girl whose deepest relationship is with her older brother, Harvey. They make the most of life in Cornwall as Iris and Harvey engage themselves in imaginary games including those where they pretend to be famous trapeze artists on their backyard swing. Of particular curiosity to them is Old Marsh, the gardener at Belerion Hall. He warns them of the old ruins found along the sea cliffs called the Tombs. These Tombs are actually old burial grounds in the form of a mausoleum consisting of underground burial chambers.Old Marsh recounts age-old tales of those who sought to make pacts at this sight whereby the dead could be returned to them. However, he sternly warns that this does not come without a price. The Villiers family, in an effort to keep them active and amused, participated in local charity theatrical performances for the Ladies' Club. This particular summer-time performance finds Iris playing the role of the Goddess, Isis, and her brother Harvey cast as the legendary, Osiris. Harvey finds it difficult to overcome his fear of being entombed in a casket during the performance --- but Iris and his mother get him through it.Iris' mostly care-free existence takes a turn for the worse when she loses her Governess and tutor to marriage and gains a replacement in the form of Edyth Bright (or Edyth Blight, as Harvey referred to her). Edyth's tactics with Iris are often cruel and she resents her for this. To make matters worse, Iris discovers that Edyth has begun a secret love affair with her brother, Spencer. The most crucial moment of this story finds Iris walking in on the young lovers and eventually getting into a confrontation with Edyth in an upper hallway of Belerion Hall. During the altercation, Iris falls backwards through an open window and is saved only when Edyth grabs hold of her leg. Quickly losing her grip and screaming for help, Harvey and Spencer come to Iris' rescue. Harvey gets a firm grip on Iris and tells her to close her eyes and re-enact their imaginary trapeze act. Unfortunately, Harvey loses his balance and he and Iris plummet to the hard courtyard below. Since Harvey wrapped himself around his young sister, he took the blunt of the impact.This tragic accident will cause Iris to walk with a permanent limp. More importantly, she must live with the fact that her brother and rescuer, Harvey, perished in the fall. Iris tries to move on with her life but cannot find any joy without Harvey. She finds herself returning to the Tombs along the cliff-side and recalling the legends Old Marsh had shared. Like many other characters from classic horror fiction who are dealing with death and loss (Mary Shelly's \\"Frankenstein\\" and Stephen King's \\"Pet Semetary\\", to name a few) --- Iris finds herself filled with so much grief that the possibility of defying nature and resurrecting her lost brother, Harvey, seems to be the only thing she can do to find happiness again. Alas, as Old Marsh has warned her, this act does not come without a price.What Douglas Clegg has accomplished with the writing of ISIS is to create a supernatural tale that is emotionally involving while at the same time giving the reader a story that pays great homage to many of the most classic horror stories ever created. Accompanied by terrific and haunting illustrations by artist, Glenn Chadbourne, ISIS is a story that will resonate for those readers of gothic romance tales as well as sating the appetite for fans of horror & supernatural literature right in time for the Halloween season."},{"Title":"ISIS","review":"a beautiful book but not one that i particularly enjoyed. it's not clegg's usual format. i like him very much and have most of his books."},{"Title":"ISIS","review":"Iris Villiers is a young girl--lonely and isolated--in the family estate.

Snowden examined the ancient Mediterranean world--a highly pluralistic, interracial world--to learn how significant the concept of race was at that time. His compelling and creative use of human representations in art, and of the stories that ancient people told about eachother show that race--while seemingly all-important today--was insignificant to them. He identifies (among others) Egyptian, Greek, Hellenistic, and Roman art in which &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; people stand side-by-side as soldiers, military officers, political rulers, spouses, athletes, guests at feasts, mythic figures, etc. While ancients recognized the physical differences which we use as racial identifiers, they did not seem to draw the same invidious distinctions or make the same social uses of race which Europeans around the world have made over the past 500 years. I regularly refer to his findings in 2-3 of my college courses to raise questions about the naturalness and inevitability of our current racial assumptions.

Much of the Snowden's book focuses on the relationship between Ethiopia and Egypt. Ethiopians and Egyptians did not always get along, indeed wars were fought between the two, but their struggles were not based on racial differences. Snowden claims that the skin color of northeast Africans gradually lightened as one moved down the Nile.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Snowden's brief book was his description of Nubian culture. Snowden presents a vibrant society with its own distinct civilization that affected the Egyptians as much as the Egyptians affected it. Indeed, Snowden indicates that the civilization south of the first cataract was politically stable in comparison to the turmoils that faced other areas in the Mediterranean.The main idea of the book is that whites and blacks got along in the Greco-roman world. Of course the Greeks and other \\"white\\" peoples were interested in the \\"black\\" peoples and their customs, but the racial difference did not cause the whites to look down on the blacks. Snowden discusses the many ways in which blacks and whites worked together, especially in fighting along side each other. He also claims that mixed marriages were common, even in Greece, and that mulattoes did not hold an inferior social place. Even in the beginning of the Christian era, there did not exist racial tensions; blacks had access to the same salvation that the whites had. If anything, Snowden argues that blackness was viewed as \\"highly positive\\" (58)."},{"Title":"Before Color Prejudice: The Ancient View of Blacks","review":"Before Color Prejudice: The Ancient View of Blacks was very imformative.

It tells of a time that I, and am sure many others, are unaware of.

It describes the ageless meaning behind racism and how it is a way for one to hold one group of people down in order to uplift you and whatever group you belong to. This book does not paint the broad brush of generalizing all whites as prejudice, but that a substantial number of whites became prejudice over time so that such things as: black slavery lasting over 500 years while no other ethnic group was so wholley enslaved. Or how the world had designated at one time that regardless of where the black man was at he was a slave until proven otherwise.

For college students in communications who are interested in the theoretical development of the field, this book is useful for obtaining knowledge not just on theories and research methods, but also on the scientists themselves. Things get off to a rather surprising start with coverage of Charles Darwin, Sigmund Freud, and Karl Marx. These guys didn't just do biology, psychology, and politics (respectively), but indirectly influenced communications studies in important ways. The book also covers the breakthroughs by communication scholars such as Wilbur Schramm and Paul Lazarsfeld. However, there are some real weaknesses arising from Rogers' construction of the biographies, which have a real impact on readability and intellectual usefulness. Basing each chapter on the works of a single theorist (or school in one case) left Rogers with the awkward problem of how to cover other theorists and theories that don't quite fit into his methodology, making the chapters generally very long and inconsistent.For example, a short section on the great media theorist Walter Lippman is forced into the middle of the chapter dedicated to the arguably less influential Harold Lasswell. Meanwhile, some sections lead to suspicions of academic favors and favoritism. The Freud chapter contains a lengthy discussion on a group of researchers called the Palo Alto Group, whom Rogers describes in great detail before concluding that they were only tangentially connected to Freud's theories and had no real influence in the long run. So why are they in the book? And the exasperated reader will often cry \\"WRAP IT UP!\\" at Rogers' severe lack of brevity, with the grand prize going to the interminable and meandering 66-page chapter on the Chicago School; while all chapters generally go off on tangents and exercises in intellectual minutiae. Overall, it's good to know about all these influential theorists if you have an interest in the field, but it's not so useful slogging through dozens and dozens of pages on the (usually) unexceptional personal lives of academics and how much they were/are worshipped by other academics. This book is still very important for those in the field, but prepare for an inconsistent and very verbose read.

Lampedusa's straighforward approach to his material creates a moving and graceful story of the decline of a family and, by extension, an entire world.The book has the feel of antique furniture -- solid, serious, elegant. It's not for everyone -- don't look for surprises or verbal gymnastics but rewards a reader who likes beautifully crafted, thoughtful prose."},{"Title":"Leopard","review":"Published first in 1957, the year of Giuseppe di Lampedusa's death! That was only six years before the acclaimed film by Luchino Visconti was released. But Il Gattopardo is ineluctably a 20th C novel masquerading as a 19th C Romance, in style as much as in setting. I insist on telling you this because, if you didn't read the preface or look at the back of the title page, you might well be dangerously startled when Lampedusa first breaks the frame and refers to events of his own lifetime. That doesn't happen until a third of the book is finished; until then there is no 'narrator' in sight. Thereafter, however, Lampedusa inserts his \\"I\\" at judicious intervals, calling the reader away from the Sicily of the 1860s with metaphors of modernity. Eventually he even mentions the atomic bomb.Possibly some readers will be annoyed by Lampedusa's occasional first-person anachronism, but I don't think they were an accident or an error of style. They're a significant clue as to the intention of the novel, which isn't simple nostalgia. Lampedusa doesn't whitewash his setting or his characters; Sicily in the 1860s was a land of grievous poverty and economic stagnation, a society still bogged in feudalism, and the aristocratic families that supply nearly all the characters in Il Gattopardo were decadent, besotted with themselves and their possessions, reactionary, indifferent to the misery of their society. Their highest aspiration was to hang on to their luxury and privilege as long as they could, at least their own lifetimes, and let the next generation fend for itself. Only the central figure, Prince Fabrizio Salina, gets much respect from his 'creator' Lampedusa. His flaws and follies are the same as any other of his class, but his vitality and his inward perceptions of his milieu exalt him above the stagnant morass of his insular society. It's not mere words, on Lampedusa's part, to depict the Prince's fascination with astronomy. Salina is, for this author who might be his great-grandson, as genuine a hero as historical reality allows.The plot of Il Gattopardo is rather loose. It's the era of the Risorgimento, the unification of Italy with Garibaldi as the charismatic revolutionary. Prince Salina imagines himself, correctly as it turns out, as \\"above the fray\\". His preeminence will remain untouchable and his Sicily, with all its failures and inequities, will remain eternally the same. His wealth is being eroded by energetic and unscrupulous lower-class parvenus, but he disdains to resist them; such has always been the case, a process of revitalization. The Prince's nephew, a charming and talented fellow whom we see only as the Prince sees him, is an enthusiastic Garibaldino and an avatar of the Sicily-to-be, but his uncle's affection for him is stronger than any political discord. Eventually a love story unfolds, between the nephew and the beautiful daughter of the Prince's polar opposite, the up-and-coming parvenu \\"Don\\" Calogero. That romance is in effect the structure of the novel, but the heart and soul of Lampedusa's tale is the complex depiction of the personhood of Fabrizio Salina.If it's not nostalgia, then what is it? I think it's a celebration of \\"tempo perso\\" -- temps perdus/lost times -- a monument of their beauty as well as their infamy, intended to rescue them from oblivion. In that mode, it reminds me of the extraordinary Squarcialupi Codex of 15th Century Florence, an opulent illuminated volume containing the best music of Tuscany's distinctive indigenous composers, whose style was already utterly out of fashion, displaced by the arrival of the Franco-Flemish polyphonists in Italy. The redactors of the Squarcialupi Codex had no expectation of reviving the music of their greatest native composers like Francesco Landini, nor even to encourage performance of it. They meant forthrightly to immortalize the accomplishment by wrapping it sumptuously in museum shrouds. Il Gattopardo strikes me as having the same intention, not to replay the 'music' of pre-modern Sicily but actually to inscribe it in the museum of literature before its image faded from human memory.[This is a repeat of my review of the Italian edition available on amazoon. I can't address the quality of this translation, but the novel is already a 'must read' classic of literature. If you can't read Italian, obviously, a translation is the only recourse.]"},{"Title":"Leopard","review":"This would be a perfect production, if only Naxos had double-checked for proper pronunciation: one jarring example was David Horowitch's mispronouncing the character Don Calogero as Don CaloJAYro, rather than CalAHjero.

They also attempt to explain the various rationale and motivations of the artists themselves in creating the artforms that they did. These attempts will of course remain points of controversy, for it is difficult, and the authors cannot claim with certainty, any correlation between the artforms and the political, personal, and social philosophies of the time periods discussed. But the author's speculations on these reasons entice readers to form their own, and this enhances the didactic quality of the book.In the discussion of the Gothic era, for example, the author (Robert Suckale) claims that the art of this period was to be contrasted with that of the Middle Ages, which exclusively produced works that protrayed life in the hereafter. A sharp boundary would be difficult to draw between the Gothic and Middle Ages though, so it should be concluded that his statement is one that could be characterized as dealing with \\"averages\\" over the works produced. Certainly some exceptions or deviations could be found in the works of the Gothic era as well as the Middle Ages. It might be perhaps more precise to classify time periods in art relative to the techniques used rather than the content, especially when comparing two points in history that are separated by a relatively short time scale. Therefore it is easier to accept that art at the end of the Gothic period was very different in content than the beginning of the Middle Ages, but as one shrinks the time scale separating these endpoints, the distinction becomes more difficult.in addition, Suckale emphasizes the role of the artist as architect in the Gothic period, with geometrical considerations viewed as \\"natural\\" and therefore subject to the dynamism displayed by nature. This lead to complex mathematical configurations coupled with intricate non-geometric components. The \\"fresco\\" technique had its origin in this time period, and Suckale takes the reader through the process of how this was done, it requiring the artist to work very quickly. The ramifications of the Black Death on commerce at the time influenced art dramatically, Suckale argues, and resulted, interestingly, with an explosion of both religious and secular works of art. The survivors of the Black Death were those of the repentant and those who felt life was short and must be enjoyed to the fullest. Suckale also explains the switching by artists from the pattern book to the sketch book, resulting in more originality by the artists.Manfred Wundram follows in the next article with a discussion of the early Renaissance period, which can be characterized he says by emphasis on portraiture and landscape painting. He claims that fine art is a means of expression of humankinds general cultural and intellectual history, and that religious and political conditions play a major role in shaping the art forms of a particular era. Art intepretation, he says, cannot happen without visual evidence. Any attempt to do so is mere speculation. These comments are to some extent convincing, but the interpretation of all art, regardless of the time period in which it was produced, should be left to the mind of the observer, in whatever framework such an observer chooses, be it a modern viewpoint or one that is actually attempting to relate the artwork to the time period in which it was produced. Pure speculation in the appreciation of art is thus permissible and is to be encouraged.Wundrum continues his analysis in the next article on the Renaissance and Mannerism, in which he argues, painting reached an absolute zenith. Readers preferences may prohibit an agreement with this characterization of the Renaissance however. In the artworks displayed in this article, a good example being the Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist, one can see what Wundrum describes as color modulation, as the gradual dissolving of outlines. Wundrum also discusses in detail the origins of the term Mannerism and its problematic use in describing some of the art in this time period, and as being a transition between Renaissance and Baroque. And interestingly from a modern perspective is the exaggeration and deformation of the ideal human figure which took place under the category of Mannerism, supposedly according to the author to make more of an expressive impact.In the next article, Andreas Prater takes the reader through the Baroque period, the art in this period reflecting the ostentation and exuberance of the times. He argues that the art of this period is very difficult to define and characterize, and he summarizes the attempts to do so in detail. Illusionism and distortion of reality he says, are characteristics of the Baroque period. This is not readily apparent in the artworks displayed in this section however, unless one view angels, unicorns, etc as a distortion of reality, and not merely a flight of fancy on the part of the artist. In fact a certain degree of optimisim is present, a good example being \\"Seaport at Sunrise' by Claude Lorrain.Hermann Bauer continues with the Baroque period but from the standpoint of the Netherlands in the next article. The paintings seem more naturalistic in this case, the landscapes more serene, with an overabundance of earth tones. The \\"Honeysuckle Bower\\" of Peter Paul Rubens has to rank as one of the most impressive studies in detail ever put on canvas. Rembrandt's \\"Slaughtered Ox\\" is characteristically post-Modern.Eva-Gresine Baur ends the book with an article on Rococo and Neoclassicism. The use of pastels characterizes this period, argues Baur, and she describes these methods in detail. She characterizes the art of this period as a repression of fear, and without agreeing with this statement, the artworks listed do seem to exemplify a certain degree of escapism."},{"Title":"Masterpieces of Western Art: A History of Art in 900 Individual Studies (Jumbo) (Slipcased) 2 volumes","review":"For it's great content.

Who ruled and who were ruled? History is written by the historians but nevertheless, rulers strongly influence the historical writings. This is especially true in India where a minuscule minority ruled over the majority for centuries. Majority of the people were strictly barred from the opportunity of education till 150 years ago. Injustice has been done to the untouchables while writing the history of the independence of India. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar's name is often omitted or finds only a terse mention in the books of history. He alone fought to get human rights for the Indian masses comprising backward classes , scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. He awakened the masses , made them aware of their pathetic conditions , infused the spirit of self respect and social equality. As the chief architect of the Indian constitution , has been singularly responsible for the firm establishment of modern political and social values in India. Dr. Ambedkar's followership is has surpassed that of Gandhi and Nehru. This is evident on his birth and death anniversary. Yet, this is not reflected even today in the historical or contemporary writings. This is a glaring anomaly in the writing of modern Indian history. The book \`Dalits and the Democratic Revolution : Dr. Ambedkar and the Dalit Movement in Colonial India' by Gail Omvedt is exceptional in this respect. This book brings out several veritable socio-political facts hitherto unknown to the intellectuals as well as to the common citizens. This book clearly highlights the fact enunciated by Dr. B.R.Ambedkar that the untouchability was basically a political problem rather than a social stigma. The role of Dalit movement under the leadership of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar as the harbinger of the new social order based on liberty, equality and fraternity in modern has been brought in light like never before . It was a fight against the advocates of the old social order of the caste based inequality as well as the relative reluctance of British to promote social reforms. The author has a holistic understanding of the historical conflict of Bramhnical and non Bramhnical ideologies. This has enabled her to present the entire subject in a proper perspective. This book is a must for the students of Indian sociology and Indian polity. Above average intellectual lay persons will find this book useful in analyzing perplexities of the contemporary politics as the genealogy of the current political problems can be traced in the failure of National political parties in honoring the political aspirations of the Dalits raised by Dr. B.R.Ambedkar."},{"Title":"Dalits and the Democratic Revolution: Dr Ambedkar and the Dalit Movement in Colonial India","review":"Reading this book tells Ambedkar was a great scholar.It all describes about how dalits , called lower caste people are treated.

In the introduction to \\"Do\\", Sloane says that he found these tidbits in old almancs from the 1700 and 1800s. The \\"Do\\" section consists mostly of household hints, recipes, and tips to use for constructing things from that time period. Some readers may actually find a few of the tips useful, others may be useful for historical society people who are trying to recreate things, and still others may seem just a little strange. For example, I really can't see the modern reader agreeing that an \\"air bath\\" (walking around without clothes for a half an hour) will make one clean. There also is the problem of trying to recreate recipes from the colonial era. They're notorious for not giving much detail as it was assumed people had greater culinary knowledge back then. For example, I don't know when a potato is \\"three fourths boiled,\\" but I'm sure most colonial housewives did. Mostly, I found the \\"Do\\" section interesting for the historical value.Although I liked both sections, I preferred the \\"Don't\\" section. It starts off with Sloane's introduction from 1968 where he seems to be criticizing the \\"mod\\" style of dressing from the late 60's- I thought that was hilarious! A lot of the \\"don't's\\" are generally about manners, and many seem to be directed at people who can afford servants and attend formal dinner parties, but there is also advice that was directed at humbler folk. And, as the author points out, some of the advice still is relevant today as basic manners never go out of style.One of the best things about the \\"Don't\\" section is Sloane's humorous sketches that illustrate some of the advice. It's too bad there weren't more of them though. Also, there was the chapter \\"In Speech and Writing\\", in my opinion the best part of the book. Much of it focused on \\"Americanisms\\" and why certain things we say are incorrect. Many of these \\"Americanisms\\" are things that have made their way into our language now and we don't think twice about them. In fact, I've probably already used several of them in writing this review (such as \\"a lot\\")! Other ones sounded obsolete but brought back memories- such as using the word \\"through\\" for finished- I remember elderly people using that one when I was a child, but I haven't heard it in a long time.Overall, it is a fun book with tidbits that you probably won't find elsewhere, with some great illustrations to boot."},{"Title":"The Do's and Don'ts of yesteryear: A treasury of early American folk wisdom","review":"This is a sweet gem of a mini-coffee-table (old tea table?) book by the master of American folkways historianship and illustration (young Sloane crossed the country from New England to Taos and parts West in a Model T Ford in the 1920's, as an itinerant sign painter!).The Do's are mostly old-time practical household how-tos; the Don'ts, amazing retro social customs and taboos, many of which will raise a smile -- or elicit a squirm -- from the modern reader.DO acquire all of Sloane's more heavily illustrated books if you're the least interested in the America our grandparents only heard about from theirs; the series constitutes an ongoing revelation.This title has only a couple dozen smaller illustrations in the superb roughhewn Sloane manner.

Far too little known today, Gaboriau is remembered in France as the 'father of the roman policier' and indeed many believe he can lay claim to having invented the modern detective novel. Directly in the tradition of Vidocq, but further influenced by Poe and probably Eugene Sue (whose The Mysteries of Paris had been one of the sensations of 1843), Gaboriau created the police detective Monsieur Lecoq. He appeared in not one but five novels. In the first, L'Affaire Lerouge (1866) he takes rather a back seat to the consulting detective Father Tabaret, whose methods Lecoq adopts, but in the later novels he takes centre stage. In fact you can see the character evolve from book to book - Crime d'Orcival (1867), Le Dossier no.113 (1867), Les Escalves de Paris (1868) and possibly the best Monsieur Lecoq (1869). These books are less easy to find today.Le Dossier No. 113 (1867) (&quot;File Number 113&quot;) is the most disappointing of Gaboriau's books. It does not start out with a detailed look at a crime scene, followed by deductions. H. Douglas Thomson compared it scornfully to a Hollywood thriller. It is also slow moving. It does have a great title, and the inside look at a French bank in the opening chapters is moderately interesting. It does show some features in common with Gaboriau's other fiction: the look at young men's mistresses recalls L'Affaire Lerouge; the wily persistence of the young bank clerk in evading police investigation anticipates the murder suspect in Monsieur Lecoq; and the construction of the puzzle plot contains features that will be expanded in &quot;Le Petit Vieux des Batignoles&quot;, which contains one of Gaboriau's most complex plots.

The poignant accounts of the Powells' journey through submission and respect in marriage, raising teens with understanding and maintaining bonds and wisdom from grandparents and ancestors will help all Christian households navigate the rigors of raising a world-changing family against a pulsing, flashing landscape of sin. Single parents also will find practical ways to keep their families dining at God's table--even if all the seats aren't occupied.At almost three hundred pages, Soul Food and Living Water offers enough to keep readers consumed for a long time. Each part of the book-individual spiritual relationships, marital intimacy, parenting and cultural heritage through extended family-could have easily comprised a book of its own. In an attempt to encompass all aspects of family, some subjects are probed more deeply than others, most notably marriage, understanding the influences of hip hop culture on teenagers, creating a home of peace and order and specific suggestions on dealing with family problems. The book is worth buying for these passages alone.The editing team at Moody can be commended for maintaining the voices of the authors as well as many references to African American culture, such as the principles of Kwanzaa and the spiritual significance of cultural gatherings like Friday night fish frys and other get togethers. Focus on the legacy of endurance found in African-American culture will leave the targeted reader uplifted and satisfied. The cover shot and images throughout are positive and appealing as well.

Mr. Galbraith in this volume proves that it is. He begins with the world of advanced technology highly specialized manpower, and the five or six hundred giant corporations which bring these into use. He shows how these firms supply themselves with capital, how the men who comprise them are motivated, how organized intelligence has replaced ownership as the source of power in the modern enterprise. He shows how the market has declined as a guiding influence in economic life, to be replaced in substantial measure by planned decision as to what will be produced, at what prices and for whom.Government in the industrial state, Mr. Galbraith makes clear can be understood only in light of the needs and goals of modern large-scale organization. And this profoundly shapes the prospect for trade unions, political parties, education and the larger culture itself. Only as we see the goals of the industrial system in a clear light will we avoid the danger of subordinating too much of life to their service. Only then will we exploit the opportunities inherent in well-being....The publisher's description goes on to herald The New Industrial State as Galbraith's \\"most important book.\\" The implicit comparison is with his earlier and immensely popular work, The Affluent Society. But the two books are quite closely related, as Galbraith mentions in the foreword: \\"I must again remind the reader that this book had its origins alongside The Affluent Society. It stands in relation to that book as a house to a window. This is the structure; the earlier book allowed the first glimpse inside.\\"And indeed, that is largely the truth. This book provides a framework for understanding Corporate America; its real and public purposes, its organization, history, strengths, and weaknesses. Surprisingly little of the book seems aged (of course the book exludes all mention of the last forty years, and the Soviet references seem a bit antiquated), and much of it, with minimal substitution (e.g. \\"War on Terror\\" for \\"Cold War\\" as the bogeyman for justifying the massive military outlays which feed the industrial system) is eerily applicable to the early 21st century.All of that said, this book is not for everyone. It is quite dense (especially the first third), and most of us will need a dictionary close at hand. This is a book which requires hard thinking and more than one reading. But if your purpose is to understand the type of economy we really live in, your efforts will be richly rewarded."},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"John Kenneth Galbraith didn't respect the literary conventions of economics. He didn't express himself in math, he made sweeping generalizations about society (not always backed by strong evidence), and he freely drew on the insights of history, sociology, and politics, paying little heed to interdisciplinary boundaries. For that reason, many economists looked down their noses at him. And for that reason, his books are still in print and enjoyed by readers decades after they first appeared. Galbraith was more than an economist. He was a great social critic, a great debunker of cant, and a superb prose stylist. He was the Veblen of post-World War II America.He was at the top of his powers when he wrote \\"The New Industrial State\\" in the 1960s. The book came as close as anything did to summarizing the Galbraithian \\"system.\\" Parts of it are outdated, such as the assertion that financial markets have little influence on big corporations, or the strained argument that the American and Soviet economic systems were \\"converging.\\" Other parts, however, are as relevant today as they were 40 years ago, such as the critique of advertising and consumerism, or the analysis of how our gigantic defense industry shapes policy and influences the Pentagon. In a time when the Federal Reserve is bailing out banks and scrambling to protect the economy from the miscalculations of the financial sector, it's good to be reminded that the private sector looks to government to keep the economy on a even keel, no matter what the official ideology of the private sector may be.Most of all, \\"The New Industrial State\\" displayed Galbraith's genius for stepping back and asking big questions. These continue to haunt economics, even though textbook writers bury them in footnotes. Why DO we treat GDP is an adequate measure of social welfare? Why DO we choose to consume higher productivity in the form of goods rather than leisure? Why DOES our pedagogy emphasize \\"perfect competition\\" when the economy is dominated by big firms? Why DO we assume that workers and managers are motivated solely by pecuniary considerations? And on and on.\\"The New Industrial State\\" is a trove of intellectual riches, expressed in masterful and witty prose. Every undergraduate economics student should read it. So should every educated citizen. It's a 20th century classic."},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"This is a superb book. It is a book, however, that has become dated. Its datedness should not dissuade potential readers. The datedness of \\"The New Industrial State\\" has only changed the books relevance and importance. When the book was first published in 1967, it accurately described how the then modern corporation functioned, its power structure, and the motivations of individuals who guided the decision making and development of the corporation.This book should be understood to be part of a publication trilogy, starting with Galbraith's \\"Affluent Society,\\" \\"The Industrial State,\\" and \\"Economics and the Public Purpose.\\" In my opinion \\"The Industrial State\\" is the apex of the series. It is however, the most technical of the three books. The \\"Affluent Society\\" being the most accessible.For economic academia the book was revolutionary, because it radically challenged microeconomic and macroeconomic textbook accounts of markets and market adjustments. Microeconomics was challenged on several fronts. The most important being the motivation of the \`power brokers' of the (then) modern corporation, what Galbraith called the \\"technostructure.\\" The technostructure is a complex and imperfectly defined \\"collective\\" of (especially) \\"technical\\" and \\"specialized\\" staff members at the midrange management level. It was the decision making of the technical and specialized staff members who really determined the development direction of the (then) modern corporation. This is revolutionary because the motivation of these staffers, or technostructure, was not one of profit, but instead \\"identity\\" with the group/staff and corporation and (marginal) \\"adaptation\\" of the company's goal toward their own.At a macroeconomic level Galbraith argues that it was not his beloved Keynesian interventionism which stabilized the post-WWII economy, but the massive capital contracts the U.S. government had with industrial capital (e.g. steel, rubber, chemical, etc.), mainly though the Pentagon and NASA. These contracts allowed for industrial companies to build inventories without worrying about sales or the business cycle.Galbraith argued, the (then) modern corporation is mainly concerned with its own stability and longevity. Stability and longevity required the corporation to become as enormous as possible. The enormity of the corporation's size required \\"planning\\" become its primary development activity. The planning goes on (1) between technical and specialized staffers and midrange and upper-management, e.g. human resource planning for internal consistency; (2) for research and development and technological growth; (3) for price stability, marketing, and reliability in demand, establishing external stability and consumer relevance; (4) for balance within the corporation, via collective bargaining with worker unions and predictability of payroll costs; and (5) for contracts with the State.Small business and entrepreneurial corporations far outnumbered the several 100 enormous corporations. The actual economic and business activity was dominated by the minority big/enormous corporations. This meant the American system was dual in institutional structure. One sector where big business predominated and the dynamics of \\"planning\\" ran supreme. The other where small business and the dynamics of the profit motivate ran supreme. This was a situation that businessmen well understand, but that policy economists and politicians failed to appreciate the full relevance and policy implications.In its fortieth anniversary publication, the institutional structure of the American economy has radically transformed. The technostructure is still necessary, but its power has been greatly, perhaps absolutely, diminished.Technological shifts and socioeconomic policy shifts have moved history and the world beyond Galbraith's \\"The New Industrial State.\\" However, the book's importance has not been diminished, but merely shifted. The book's importance is no longer in describing the institutional structure of American capitalism, but understanding from were the now current system evolved.To draw a Darwinian metaphor, \\"The New Industrial State\\" is the missing link between the \\"just-in-time\\" production corporation and the entrepreneurial capitalists of Adam Smith (1776) thru Karl Marx (1867). \\"Just-in-time\\" production corporations contract significant portions (if not all) of their production from subcontractors. The prevailing role of the \\"planning\\" of The New Industrial State has been demoted. The corporation does not have to plan because a subcontractor can almost always be found, the subcontractors planning is only as long as the contract with a Wal-mart, or some other mega-corporation. This institutional shift toward \\"just-in-time\\" production does not make the technostructure obsolete, but it does diminish their power role within the corporation.It will be Galbraith's \\"The New Industrial State\\" which will allow us to fully understand the \\"Post-Industrial State.\\"The \\"New Industrial State\\" should receive a wide and new generation of readers. It is an important book to understand a previous era, and a specific relationship between citizens, workers, business, and the public sector, a type of symbiotic embeddedness between each group. It is also an important book to understand how that specific relationship has be reconfigured, generating a type of disembeddedness between citizens/workers and business/public sector. \\"The New Industrial State\\" helps us understand why big moneyed lobbyists have come to dominate Washington, and how it could be, and was, different."},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"John Kenneth Galbraith's \\"The New Industrial State\\" is a hallmark in economic thought. His work is both an extension and reformulation of his previous work \\"The Affluent Society\\". Galbraith spots fundamental contradictions throughout the modern field of economics. As always Galbraith is willing to attack all economists, liberals and conservatives alike, in search of the truthIn \\"The New Industrial State\\" Galbraith begins by looking at the modern composition of production. With small exception the mature corporation has become the central producer in the industrialized world. The mature corporation no longer seeks to maximize profits. It seeks, first, survival and, second, absolute growth. This means that corporations are held to maintain a minimum set of profits in order to prevent external influence on future decisions. Maximizing profits, and therefore increasing risk, is discouraged because with greater risk comes a greater chance of failing to maintain a minimum level of profit. After a minimum level of profit has been achieved it is the goal of the mature corporation to grow. By growing it gains greater influence over the economy and society at large.The reason for the rise of the mature corporation is because of technology. As production processes become more complex a greater need for planning becomes necessary. Without control of supply and demand it is extremely difficult to plan for a long production schedule (ex: 5 years). If, say, disposable income or consumer desires were to change then the mature corporation would fall into risk of bankruptcy or, at the very least, external finance (which threatens autonomy).In order to minimize risk the mature corporation must try to control supply and demand. The control of supply is done through a large degree of bargaining power with suppliers of material and through the use of unions. (Ironically, unions have become docile to the demands of the mature corporation and further its will.) In order to control demand the mature corporation relies on the government to stabilize aggregate demand. On the micro level the mature corporation manufactures artificial wants through marketing and public perception. While the mature corporation does not exhibit complete and total control over supply or demand they control both to a large extent.The reason why the mature corporation can exhibit such behavior is because of the division between management and ownership. The stockholders in a mature corporation have no input on management's decisions. The board of directors, indirectly chosen by management, choose the mature corporation's management. The traditional hierarchy of management is blatantly false due to the needs of teamwork and division of labor. Instead what is created is a \\"technostructure\\". It is the (headless) technostructure that inadvertently controls the economy. Very little of the United State's economy can be considered market based. The vast majority of the United States is a planned economy.According to Galbraith, \\"Increasing it will be recognized that the mature corporation, as it develops, becomes part of the larger administrative complex associated with the state. In time the line between the two will disappear... Though this recognition will not be universally welcomed, it will be healthy.. the autonomy of the technostructure is, to repeat yet again, a functional necessity of the industrial system.\\" (CHXXXV p.393)"},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"Not an excellent economist.

It stands in relation to that book as a house to a window. This is the structure; the earlier book allowed the first glimpse inside.\\"In the first chapter on \\"The Imperatives of Power,\\" he states that \\"Technology... leads to planning,\\" and ultimately \\"will require the firm to seek the help and protection of the state.\\" This is because the state can absorb the major risks, and guarantee a market for the product. (Pg. 20) Thus, in the areas of the most exacting and advanced technology, \\"the market is most completely replaced,\\" and \\"The fully planned economy ... is warmly regarded by those who know it best.\\" (Pg. 31)He invents the term \\"Technostructure\\" for the loose organization of those who bring specilialized knowledge, talent or experience to group decision-making. (Pg. 71) Mature corporations are run by this technostructure. He then opines that decentralization in Soviet-style economies does not involve a return to markets, \\"but a shift of some planning functions from the state to the firm.\\" Rather than both Soviets and U.S. returning to the market (which they have \\"outgrown\\"), \\"There is measureable convergence to the same form of planning.\\" (Pg. 108) (Obviously, this was written before 1989-1991.)He asserts that \\"Much of what is believed to be socially important is, in fact, the adaptation of social attitudes to the goal system of the technostructure.\\" (Pg. 163) The technostructure favors prevention of losses, over profit maximization (which \\"invites risk of loss\\"). (Pg. 168-169) He further argues that \\"Firms spend money to take business away from each other; all cannot succeed so the result is a standoff. The only consequence is that prices are higher and profits are lower than if by some act of government or industrial statesmanship the struggle were curbed.\\" (Pg. 203-204)He argues passionately that where there is a conflict between industrial and aesthetic priorities---e.g., defending the landscape against lumbermen---only the state can rule that \\"some patterns of consumption...are inconsistent with aesthetic goals.\\" He concludes ironically, \\"That one must pause to affirm that beauty is worth the sacrifice of some increase in the Gross National Product shows how effectively our beliefs have been accommodated to the needs of the industrial system.\\" (Pg. 350)There is much more in the book, of course; though more than 50 years old, Galbraith's arguments remain challenging and thought-provoking, and will be of considerable interest to modern progressives."},{"Title":"The New Industrial State","review":"Whether you agree with his political views or not, John K.

If such would be offensive to you, please stop reading here.Due to the nature of the the content and its subjects, this material would not be able to achieve an &quot;R&quot; rating for a motion picture. I would certainly have discouraged my daughters from appearing in these scenes.If you are not familiar with Jock Sturges, he presents a most unusual oeuvre. His subject is the physical, emotional, and psychological development of young girls. He portrays his subjects usually in nudist camps where they can be displayed more fully. Many of his models have appeared in his work since quite young ages.The images are usually taken outdoors with a large format camera, and are posed to create quite complex compositions. At the same time, he wants you to notice nuances in how the bodies are changing, the emotions are developing, and what the personalities are like. He uses the interaction with nature and the other models to bring out the point of each photograph, and lets time provide the rest of the perspective by repeatedly showing the same models over the years. In this work, you will usually see a model over 2-3 years.The images are very well reproduced on gorgeous paper. I found the duotone images generally better than the color ones, but the color images had a reason for being that caused them to be useful. They pick up the strong color of an eye, or show the connection in skin coloration with a sibling or parent.Beyond the natural beauty of the human form, you will find yourself impressed that the young people are pretty comfortable with the camera. I liked the poses where the teenage rebellion and awkwardnesses were showing at least a little.You will also be interested to see genetic influences as two sisters stand near one another, often with their mother. That creates a reflection of inner beauty that is quite remarkable.The drawbacks of this book's images come in that some scenes are so carefully constructed that they seem artificial and abstract, which steals humanity from the models. Also, the book contains no essay to explain the work. Some would benefit from some words to help them &quot;see&quot; what is contained here.A potential benefit of this book could be in helping female adolescents become more comfortable with their own developing bodies. That would probably have to be based on some private viewing.Here are some of my favorites:Vanessa, Miranda, Maia, Camille, Cecile, Charlotte, Cyrielle and Mylene; Montalivet, France, 1999Maia, Vanessa and Miranda; Tuscany, Italy, 1999Vanessa (holding herself version); Tuscany, Italy, 1999Arianne; Montalivet, France, 1999Lotte and Nikki; Montalivet, France, 1999Nikki (on haunches version); Montalivet, France, 1999Lotte, Vera and Nikki; Montalivet, France, 1999Lotte; Montalivet, France, 1997Cecile (2 -- clothed and unclothed); Montalivet, France, 1999Antoine and Thiery; Montalivet, France, 1999Sara; Montalivet, France, 1998Alice; Montalivet, France, 1996Gaelle; Montalivet, France, 1996Adele; Montalivet, France, 1999Lotte, Alice and Nikki; Montalivet, France, 1996Allegra and Karuna; Northern California, 1998Misty Dawn; Zurich, Switzerland, 1997Trea; Northern California, 1983 and 1998Leela and Nina; Palm Beach, Florida, 1998Allegra, Northern California, 1996After you have communed with nature through these photographs, I encourage you to think of how you can enjoy being outdoors with your family in ways that will create relaxed relationships.Cherish the innocence of youth!"},{"Title":"Jock Sturges: New Work, 1996-2000","review":"I was a little hesitant to order this book because of the price, even though I love Jock Sturges' work, but when it came in the mail I was surprised that it didn't cost more.

I am so impressed by the lighting and shadows and use of color and exquisite beauty of the models. I can't say enough about it. What a treasure!"},{"Title":"Jock Sturges: New Work, 1996-2000","review":"This is a beautiful tome of mostly B&W; photos (1 per page) of young female European nudists. Many of the pictures were taken at the beach, and capture an elegance routinely missed in everyday life. Sturges has stayed in contact with the models over the years, and the result is a timeline of their youth. He is an immensely talented photographer and if you appreciate the nude female form, you will undoubtedly agree.That being said, the photographs display a natural sexuality. There is merit to the observation that the subjects are typically teenage girls, and one might ask why that is. I believe he is merely accentuating the beauty that is present in female youth. Unlike David Hamilton, whose photos seem intentionally sexual, Sturges is not adding anything that is not already there. He does not overtly pose the subjects; he just captures them. The girls appear comfortable instead of vulnerable. (Not to criticize Hamilton, but there is a material difference.)The layout and paper quality were exceptional, and the binding seems robust. All in all, a great collection for your coffee table. But perhaps that depends on the company you keep."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges: New Work, 1996-2000","review":"VERY little to complain about in this book. Scarcely anything that could be considered objectionable by anyone willing to accept nude photography. Most of the photos date from 1996-2000, (one '83 and one '95),and are generally of girls or young women mostly nude but a few photos of clothed people. I liked the way Sturges handles light in almost all of his photos, composition did seem a little stilted to me in a few of them. I think it's great that he was able to use the same subjects over the years, obviously the man can get along with people. The color photos were welcome, showing the man is willing to vary his medium and well capable of doing so. One improvement over his last, self titled, book is the inclusion of his subject's name,location and date on the opposite page, much easier to follow than a separate sheet as that last book was presented."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges: New Work, 1996-2000","review":"Jock Sturges's latest offering is bigger than its predecessors, towering over everything else on the shelf (on which it balances more precariously than one might like.) It's more handsome than previous volumes, the halftone dots virtually invisible, the finest of details readily discernible. And it features a handful of color pictures, all of which are absolutely gorgeous, the palettes just heartbreakingly lovely.But perhaps most noteworthy thing about New Work 1996-2000 is that Sturges's cast is all grown up. Unlike his previous monographs, this is not so much an exploration of adolescence as a celebration of adolescence successfully navigated; these are now women in their late teens and twenties who radiate beauty and strength. So the themes are somewhat different from those of, say, Evolution of Grace, but the work is just as brilliant. This is a must-have."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges: New Work, 1996-2000","review":"The print quality of this book is breathtaking. I couldn't believe how much more large format and quality printing could enhance an already beautiful body of work-this is an extraordinary book. I enjoy the blending of what is essentially documentary in nature with an exquisite sense of aesthetics. This is no Hamiltonian romanticism/eroticism, and that is why this is precisely, in my estimation, a more real, valuable and important body of work.Since I had not reviewed his other books in a long time, I've went back to them over and over again since I bought New Works. To see the evolution and metamorphosis of Misty Dawn and all the other subjects is a wonder to behold. I hope that Sturges continues with his quest, but I would also like to see books that present one subject/family at a time. That way, this mystical evolution/metamorphosis of his subjects can best be presented.I hope he continues to enrich us and our culture with his work. More importantly, I pray that the Ashcroft nomination as Attorney General won't impede nor bode ill for his continued success."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges: New Work, 1996-2000","review":"This book is huge- overall 14.5&quot; high by 13&quot; wide..beautiful work, and even better printing than the last volume! Heavier paper, higher res- it's possibly the best-printed monograph I've ever seen, barring limited edition press runs. It is an extraordinary printing achievement, and I commend Scalo for it. Very much worth the money, and now all I have to do is figure out how to fit it into my book shelves..which are only 12&quot; high..guess it's a coffee table book..too bad I never have the vicar over for tea:-) The book has 88 images total, only one of which has been seen before- and that one only in Evolution of Grace (an extremely rare, Japanese-only book), an old pic of Trea from 1983 juxtaposed against a beautiful new shot of her 15 years later as a teenager). Which brings me to my point..summer is ending, in one sense, and you can feel it in this work (as in Jock's Ireland work, not yet collected in a book). His most beloved models are growing up, and his loss of innocence in the intervening years since his raid means that the images will never again be quite the same, as the full awareness of all those people who want to punish him or think ill of him for taking beautiful photos can't be escaped. Instead, Jock (and us his readers) must learn appreciations of new aspects in the work- the use of large format color for one, and the stronger emphasis on portraiture and formal layout. These models, mostly mid-teens or older now, look directly and challengingly at the viewer in almost every image. They too have lost a certain innocence since the first collaborations, and perhaps are now trying to impose their personalities, their force of will and belief in what Jock does, upon our minds. The images are still beautiful and compelling, but in a new way. If their lifestyle and Jock's connection with it had never been so brutally attacked by Randall Terry and his ilk, perhaps this change would never have come about. Whether or not you will find it as appealing as the lost innocence, and the illusion of a simple, sensual and perfect growth from childhood that defined the earlier work is up to you."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges: New Work, 1996-2000","review":"As I wrote before in my reviews of \`Last Days of Summer' and 'Radiant Identities'*, Sturges depicts the essence of freedom and a way of life many of us (sadly) have forgotten or never discovered.What's not to like here? The photography is wonderful and unsurpassed, the binding and printing are high standard, the size is generous and the subjects are gorgeous. This beautiful book is worth every penny!Of course there are always narrow minded people who might object to the contents of this book, probably the same people who'd object to the Venus the Milo, or 'nude paintings' in a museum. However, for any intelligent and open-minded person there is nothing to object to, just Great Art to enjoy and a valuable lesson about life as it's meant to be.If you can dig that, you will certainly enjoy the book. If you are still in doubt, do yourself a favour and buy it, and if you give it half a chance, it will enrich your life and broaden your horizon. In a way, you can't afford NOT to buy it...* Please, see there if you want to read more of my reviews about Sturges' work."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges: New Work, 1996-2000","review":"Jock Sturges' current book, entitled 'New Work' would be better entitled 'Latest Work'. There is nothing really new here apart from a small number of photographs in color. This is Sturges as we have come to know and admire him, although the work itself seems less inspired than previous efforts. The book however shows the total commitment of the publisher. It is wonderfully designed, the pages are in a VERY large format and the photographs are reproduced wonderfully with exceptional tonalities. Some of the problems with his earlier books with photos crossing the fold are absent here. Sturges deserves such treatment."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges: New Work, 1996-2000","review":"This is a gorgeous new book from Sturges. It's published by Scalo, the same folks that gave us Sturges' last book in 1996. The plates are the same quality in this new book, in other words super. They are sharp, clear, and show off the 8x10 format well. Anyhoo, the first thing you notice about this new book is the size. It's HUGE at 14 1/2&quot; by 13&quot;! It really stands out at you. I think it was wise to get a larger format for these photo's. It gives the photo's space, which really brings out the scope of Sturges' work. The photo's themselves are fairly varied and show that Sturges continues to grow as a photographer. The family shots are lovingly done and show the amount of trust these folks have with Sturges, which is obviously vital. The inclusion of color photo's is brilliant! They really stand out against the moody B/W's throughout the book. Overall I'd say this book is well worth the..price tag and a must for any fans of great photography. Thanks Jock!"},{"Title":"Jock Sturges: New Work, 1996-2000","review":"simply breath taking. I definitely prefer Sturges over Hamilton.

But, but I did very soon see that this was painstaking beautiful. This is probably the shortest period of transession in the whole of our lives and the least documented. Why? Well in short I guess its because some people have mounted the worlds consience on their shoulders. So how glad cant we be, we adult non-perverted sane human beings who would never look upon the naked childs body as anything else then what it is, beautiful, that theese photographers exist. Jock Sturges and David Hamilton in the breech. This book with its light seriousness captures the essens in youth, everything we ever was; innocent but still aware. Lights and shadows in a harmony almost never seen and i do have gone through a few.So for thoose who but this book I almost can guarantee You a very nice time infront of the fire \\"reading\\" theese pictures."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges: New Work, 1996-2000","review":"For all those who enjoy photography books of young females, this is a GREAT BARGAIN to get such an outstanding work-- with a list price...-- for what price amazon.com currently charges! The photography is OUTSTANDING! Also this is a SUPER SIZE BOOK with very large pictures. Jock Sturges does such a great job of showing the nude female form, regardless of age, as an expression of pure beauty! Their is not one erotic suggestive pic in the book. All pictures are of a very sharp resolution and celebrate the female form!This is a MUST OWN BOOK for those who like to collect books of this nature---due to the generous price discount, giant size of the book and pictures, and the overall sharpness and beauty of the pics!NOTE: You may want to hurry and purchess this hardcover edition! I could not find the hardcover edition of JOCK STURGES by JOCK STURGES anywhere on the net--only softcover is available.

The mix of innocent eroticism and sterile nudity is disturbing and encouraging at the same time. As in most of his photos, the subjects have been posed by the photographer, but it has never been so obvious as in this new batch. The poses are identical to those in previous collections. While still powerful, these images are not as fresh and the subjects seem to be less spontaneous. They have lost the joy of life and look like they want to be elsewhere."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges: New Work, 1996-2000","review":"It's wonderful to see a modern master overcome adversity and continue his art.

I actually own 9 B&amp;W prints, 16x20, and the sharpness and use of light is incredible. This book has tremendous quality reproductions, and since they average about 9x12, it is the closest some will ever come to owning a print. There is one print from 1983, so perhaps the title is not completely accurate. This book also has the first color prints I have ever seen, and is a pleasant surprise, since I thought he only did B&amp;W."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges: New Work, 1996-2000","review":"This book still has beautiful models in it but is a little disappointing.

I am, however a little disappointed--perhaps a little disapointed with life and how a woman fades with age at times. The heart beating leap of some of Jock's other pictures and how the person fades got me a little bummed. Perhaps it is the novelty that has worn off even with this new volume. I was looking forward to seeing how fanny has aged throughout the years and she has lost the vitality that was shown in some of the previous works of jock sturges. Also there was only one picture of Marine and how she has grown (since the Last Day of Summer), and now she looks man-like (and only one picture of her shown in this whole volume).I did give this book 3 stars and feel that it is important to have--being a fan of jock sturges. Perhaps I am ambivalent as it seems that I am writing this."},{"Title":"Before the Gates of Excellence: The Determinants of Creative Genius","review":"The first two chapters review theories of, and research into, creativity developed in the 20th century.

With the body count for the Vietnam War on Cronkite as her background music, Brody leaves her home in a Long Island suburb to single-handedly save the world. She packs her red suitcase and heads into the unknown, stopping for episodes at White Panther collectives in Chicago and Ann Arbor, Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, and finally, Europe, where she hopes to attend the Vietnamese peace negotiations. Its rich detail, humor, and awareness of self and world make Red Star Sister a fascinating memoir.Brody gives readers a strong sense of the euphoria felt by radicals in the 60's and early 70's. She explains how the goal was to off the pig, and &quot;the fashionable rhetoric encouraged kids not to trust anyone over thirty and, furthermore, to kill our parents&quot;. Adults represent the death culture, and hippies idealistically set out to recreate Woodstock all over the world, where love and community would reign over war, napalm, and lies.Brody's use of detail and allusion is effective in illustrating the counterculture atmosphere. She evokes the music of Phil Ochs and Country Joe McDonald, political role models Che Guevara and Mao Tse-tung, and of course, her literary heroes Doris Lessing, Joan Didion, and Anais Nin. With enjoyable candor, she recounts her experiences with hashish, Yellow Sunshine, and free love. Even as a young person born a decade after this time period, I still get a powerful sense of what the world was like for the radicals.In the midst of revolutionary zeal, however, Brody presents herself as a character with an undeniably human side to which I can relate. She is plagued by concerns that any young woman might experience--&quot;I would wonder if I was a coward,&quot; Brody says. She engages in free love still wondering, &quot;Does he just like me because he can have me? Does he even think I'm pretty?... Is it counterrevolutionary to want to be pretty?&quot; I have no problem sympathizing with Brody as she blunders through her early life.In this tension between counterculture hero and regular girl, Brody holds a naive enthusiasm that manifests itself in a passion for the romantic and the literary. She takes solace as she wanders the streets of France, broke, in the fact that &quot;I felt, despite my discomfort, emotionally pure, careless and thoughtless, down and out, a little crazy, and awfully literary&quot;. The irony through which the older Brody frequently views her youthful romanticism adds humor to the narration and conveys a well-rounded sense of self.Brody's memoir is more outward-looking than what one might expect from an author writing for the &quot;me generation&quot;. She admits early on that &quot;I'm sure brats abounded as they do in every age,&quot; and presents a balanced account of her youth by describing the bad drug trips along with the good ones. Brody does not proclaim that she and her comrades were the ultimate saviors of society, or that hers was the only valid experience to be had during that time. Instead, she says, &quot;I offer you one woman's point of view&quot;. Fortunately, Brody has an interesting perspective and a talent for poignant narration."},{"Title":"Red Star Sister : Between Madness and Utopia","review":"This novel is the unequivocal history of both Leslie Brody, and to a larger degree the counterculture movement of the 1960?s and 1970?s. Leslie relives her experiences of many of the major events during this time period including Woodstock, the Chicago Democratic Convention, the underground high school press and the &quot;San Francisco Peace Treaty&quot;. With utter fascination at the woman that she was before, Brody goes over her experiences with as much interest into who the girl in the picture and write the poems is.For the novice Vietnam War reader, or even one who would like to learn what the Vietnam War stood for in the protest marches, there is no better source of information than The Red Star Sister. Without first hand accounts of the actual motives of the protest movement, hippies would be smudged into history as a group full of drugs and free loving. However, this book shows the utopianism that hippies everywhere were seeking, a state that had peace and no need to attack other countries.Red Star Sister gives a breath of fresh air and reason to the hippie movement and is a must read by all people who did not go through what she has, which is roughly 99% of the population. If you are interested in reading a well-constructed and fair version of events that took place during America's hippie movement, then you must look no further than this book. However, if you ardently believe that the Vietnam War was the correct American foreign policy and the thought of the protest movement makes your stomach curl, then this book should be passed over. Either way, one cannot argue that Leslie Brody lived a truly remarkable life."},{"Title":"Red Star Sister : Between Madness and Utopia","review":"Red Star Sister promises no more than \\"one woman's point of view\\", a glimpse at a period in our shared history that was marked by turmoil and upheaval, but strife and idealism. This one point of view is more than enough to give the reader what Leslie Brody hopes for, namely a glimpse at an \\"often shadowy, anxious time\\", and through the retelling of the events therein, she hopes for herself a chance to recapture the utopian image of self and society that drew her generation together while they were being rived apart by the events of the day.Brody takes the reader through her childhood on Long Island, replete with insecurity stemming from her middle class upbringing to reprimands for her defiance and intelligence at the local public schools. Through a surprisingly personal and unflinching recounting of her teenage years, through her mother's death, her anger towards her father and the men in her academic life, and her ever increasing political awareness, Brody prepares the reader, through recollections and journal entries, for angst filled state of mind that could take a young hippie girl from Long Island to a White Panther commune in Chicago where she was trained in the art of guerilla warfare, should the ideal for society need to be defended, with force if need be. The ever pressing war in Southeast Asia translated into an intensely individual war at home, as Brody struggles to retain her idealism and even sanity as she comes to grip with her dreams clashing with reality.In the end what has been offered here is an unapologetic glimpse into the mindset of a woman who shared the life of a generation, without the recriminations or glorifications to be had within the memoirs of contemporaries, done, perhaps, as much for her own sake as that of the reader she takes with her on the journey."},{"Title":"Red Star Sister : Between Madness and Utopia","review":"This is the autobiography of a feminist \\"hippie\\" from the 60's whose witty writing style portrays her as a woman who does more than blindly preach against the Vietnam War. Readers of this book will find out that she is a true American. Brody, who grows up in a Jewish family, integrates Yiddish into her dialect. As soon as I read the word \\"zoftig\\" and \\"vildechaya,\\" I felt connected to her through the culture we've shared. This culture connection, by the way, is a timeless generation bridge. It was as though I understood where she was coming from because she had the same grandmother, the same self-awareness, and similar prejudice problems as many Jews know quite well. Red Star Sister, in this respect, is timeless.My favorite anecdote of the story was her experience at Woodstock. This is because I could picture my mother somewhere in the crowd, while everyone at the concert was thinking and talking about the same things- either peace, drugs, love, or absolutely nothing at all. Of course we have all read about these things in other books that are probably better publicized. But the reason why this one is so good is that she developed my trust first. Brody captures me with commonalities of religion, language, and crazy-but-thought-out actions.I would especially recommend this book to women who want to read about themselves or read what they could have done if they wanted an exciting, politically active life. This book combines the location changes of the James Bond series, the class struggles and racism issues of Their Eyes Were Watching God, a witty personal perspectives like that of Virginia Woolf, and an effective writing style like Tim O'Brien. Brody shows herself as an American with the type of patriotism we are lacking today. The passion that comes with patriotism."},{"Title":"Red Star Sister : Between Madness and Utopia","review":"This is the autobiography of a feminist \\"hippie\\" from the 60's whose witty writing style portrays her as a woman who does more than blindly preach against the Vietnam War.

She took a big social risk in writing her book because she took the chance of getting ridiculed because of her past. Anyone who reads this book will have a different opinion about it, but mostly it could be expected that they would respond positively to it, and praise her for a job well done. While reading a novel written as an autobiography, the reader feels as if he or she were in the position of the author because everything is told first hand, so it gives the feeling of reality and truth. That is how people would feel if they read Brody's book, she makes people feel as if they were experiencing everything she had; they would feel like war protestors from the 60's.Because she writes the truth, as she understands it, readers may think that her reality is being forced upon them. Except she states clearly in the book \\"I am writing this the way I remember it. I do know I'd have to be some kind of zealot to believe that what I say is the only truth\\" (5). She is writing what she knows, and whether or not that is the truth for others she does not know, but this book is her recollection of the past in the way she experienced it.As well as the narrative style and her opinion of truth, she represents an image of independence to women who read her literature, just as the women in the novels Summer, Their Eyes Were Watching God, Jane Eyre, and Wide Sargasso Sea. Brody is a woman of defiance and she differs from these other women in that she does things on her own and is independent from the beginning of her life. She may hold men on pedestals, such as Tim Lowenthal, just as Charity held Lucius on one. And her love life may be just as confusing as Janie's. Or she may have the same rebellious attitude as Jane does, and like part of the title of her book, she may have madness like Antoinette but she is the only one of all of them that obtains her independence as a child, and is not afraid of it. She is proud to be different because being normal is too boring. This image she portrays allows women to see themselves as independent and be proud of their unique or different qualities. She helps women to find their truth in life, by finding their independence.Since part of the title of her book says \\"Between Madness and Utopia\\" she clearly does not think that anything can be the same or have just one meaning or truth. By definition madness and utopia are opposites and so somewhere in between the confusion and agitation of madness and the perfection of utopia, there lies the truths that people understand and comprehend as their own. Through her book she explains the truth that she knows; she explains the places between madness and utopia where she found her truth."},{"Title":"Freddy and the flying saucer plans","review":"All these stories by Mr Brooks are fantastic.

This time it worked.I am very excited to be free of glasses after 66 years, though I have to be careful about putting on protective glasses when I work in my woodworking shop.The book itself is of course dated and very technical, but I wanted to go to the source, since there are a lot of newer books using the method.WoodJack"},{"Title":"The Bates method for better eyesight without glasses,","review":"I was around 15 years living in India at that time with a -5.0 diopters prescription in both eyes in 1978. My father had bought this book from the store in India-an Indian reprint of the same book. I was wearing soft contact lenses at that time because it could prevent further progression of myopia and for cosmetic reasons because I was young. I have read the book from cover to cover and did whatever simple exercises I could like reading the book without glasses or bouncing a ball and focusing the movement. The hope in it became really real in 1980 when I was accompanied by my parents to one of the centers in Southern India's Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry which was propagating the Bates technique. There were people coming there year after year to have their techniques reinforced AND removing glasses. The center was accepting voluntary donations to run it. In the floor of that house they had all the things that were needed and mentioned in Dr. Bates book. One had to spend about 1.5 hours there to use everything that was in the facility with instructors to help. Since Pondicherry was a city on the beach, many people took their vacations to come there. My own experience: within merely four days, I could read the very last line on the Snellen chart which was a -2.5 diopter reduction. On returning I had to change my contact lenses to the decreased refraction. However, if one does not maintain the exercises, we go back to our old habits of reading faultily by habit and it goes back to where we started again. The benefits are usually immediate and then it is known to plateau before coming down again. The easiest way to incorporate the technique is to play tennis or ping pong without glasses which I have also done and then rest the eyes. One can also read without glasses if the book can be focused on using blinking and focusing one word at a time and without scanning. It most certainly works, so much so, that my parents had wanted to start these similar type centers in the USA, my mom and I at the least being medical doctors and my dad being naturalized in our environment. My father has since passed away. This book is least likely to cause further harm and uses principles of physics appropriately and $10 is a very small price to pay for eye health. I did NOT practice it thereafter and my faulty eye habits worsened my myopia again. At this time I have had LASIK and my vision is 20/20 from TLC. However, I wish to maintain eye health and incorporate proper techniques in my life yet again. I would also like to recommend to my friends who have similar problems and are not able to stabilize their myopia with a -0.25 increase every time they see the ophthalmologist. So on searching for this book I am so happy to find that it is still in print and available. My copy from India is treasured by me and has been with me through the years through a heavy academic load. It benefits to incorporate eye exercises as much as physical exercise in one's daily routine will be the long term solution. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

It seemed such a beautiful thing to naturally get back perfect eye sight. This will only work for people that are just starting to realize that their sight is becoming worse - if you've already worn contacts or glasses for a while this will be tough. It requires you to throw out your glasses/contacts and do exercises on a daily basis. I brought this up when I went to my eye doctor and he mentioned that he's considered quite laughable in today's circles. His method is also a lot about fragmentation as opposed to seeing more clearly. It is complicated after all. I did expect much more from this book, but I assume there is a reason that this method isn't famous today. Today's society won't work with this."},{"Title":"The Bates method for better eyesight without glasses,","review":"I gave this product 5 stars because I have nothing yet to criticize them over. I am skeptical after reading online that these exercises do not work, but I have been lied to before by the medical industry.I am having the book delivered to me, and I also ordered the pin-size glasses from the Bates Method website today, so my friends can laugh at me when they see me wearing those things.I will update this review and the number of stars by December 1st 2012. I am nearsighted, and just received new prescription glasses, so if there is significant improvement will be reported. I will not praise this product if I \\"think\\" it was working, or if I experience very little improvement by December. I know how people \\"want\\" to believe that they improved, but I am not such a person, as I hate blowing money. I always hate reviews where people \\"think\\" it was working, or how they are recognizing shapes a tad bit better than before, and calling that success. I hope to give a detailed report by December.I will be receiving an eye chart that I will use before I begin the method. I will see what line I cannot read, and will put the chart away until December 1st, so that I do not make myself think I can see the letters I came to memorize from repeated testing of myself. I will only test myself once this month, and then again in December. I'm sick of all the money making bull out there, so I will give this my full commitment, and will see how it turns out.Be back December 1st.First Update: I received the Pinhole glasses yesterday (9/26/12), and I ordered the Kindle version instead of having a book delivered to me. 9/27/12 is my first day of giving this method my complete commitment. The pinhole glasses are freaking me out, as I am not sure how they really work. I looked at my computer screen without my prescription glasses on and everything was blurry. I put on the pinhole glasses and I was able to read the computer screen clearly. I then purposely sat at a distance that even squinting my eyes would not be able to make out the words typed on the computer, but putting on the pinhole glasses cleared everything up. Very bizarre! I will review the actual results 12/01/12, as I am not walking around with pinhole glasses."},{"Title":"The Bates method for better eyesight without glasses,","review":"I was given this many many years ago.

I once had a period in my life during which I didn't need to have my glasses on and I was able to practise every day. I gained such an improvement in my prescription that - when I returned to the eye-doctor - I was for the first time qualified to drive without glasses, and, though my eyesight is still not perfect, I have never worn spectacles since.Expect immediate effects, which might seem quite dramatic.

If your doctor said you had to wear a crutch forever because of a strain due to excessive and improper use of a muscle , you'd call him a quack. But most of us pay big bucks to get good vision and it's nothing more(in most cases) than a case of eye strain caused by poor vision habits. Your eye doctor won't tell you to use this book, because he gets paid twice over to get you to wear glasses(or something even more expensive). My biggest problem with nearsightedness came from always looking at near objects such as the ground and never allowing the muscles in my eyes to stretch and see things like the horizon or clouds overhead. And when I finally did chose to stretch these muscles it was like trying to get into a crossed leg yoga position. The lenses in your eye are controlled by muscles and they need to be stretched and tightened.Buy this book for everyone you know and love and tell your eye doctor either to get another sucker or find a new job."},{"Title":"The Bates method for better eyesight without glasses,","review":"This is certainly the classic and authoritive book on bates' eye improvement.

This method does require perseverence, but that's a small price to pay for being able to see better."},{"Title":"The Bates method for better eyesight without glasses,","review":"What is Presbyopia?Presbyopia (aging of the lens in the eye and the muscles that control the shape of the lens) commonly occurs after age 40, when the lens of the eye becomes more rigid and does not flex as easily. The result is that it is more difficult to read at close range. This normal aging process of the lens can also be combined with myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism.Presbyopia is a refractive error, which results from a disorder rather than from disease. A refractive error means that the shape of your eye does not bend light correctly, resulting in a blurred image.Symptoms: Near objects appear blurred. Difficulty seeing objects up close.The symptoms described above may not necessarily mean that you have presbyopia. However, if you experience one or more of these symptoms, contact your eye doctor for a complete exam.TreatmentPresbyopia is commonly treated using corrective lenses, such as eyeglasses or contact lenses.HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED:A few months ago I came down with case of sinus infection and I noticed that I had difficulty reading up close. Words looked blurry up close. This was normal with sinus infection. However, it continued to be the case after I got well.I have been told over the years that after the age of forty to expect my eyesight to decline and have difficulty focusing up close. To my ophthalmologist's surprise when I went for my annual eye exams at the age of forty and after, I did not have any problems reading up close. Now at 46 after this sinus infection I continued to see blurry up close or in poor light.When I went for my annual exam my eyesight was still fine and could read fine print at 15 inches away. My doctor did not see any need for corrective lenses, however advised me to get magnifying glasses if I have problems reading up close. I did notice something strange though. At nights before sleep when I was lying down reading a magazine or a book without thinking about my vision, I would be holding it up close and reading without any problem. However, if I thought about it, my vision was not as sharp as it was just a moment earlier. Now if there was a structural problem with my eye, such as hardening of the lens, why was my sight not blurry when I was relaxed in bed reading up close?One of the improvements in my health after recovering from pain and disability was that I no longer needed corrective lenses. At that time I read Dr. William Bates's book Better Eyesight Without Glasses and realized that tension can seriously affect eyesight. That's why by all the effort I had put in to overcome tension and recover from back pain had also brought improvement in my eyesight. Dr. Bates rejects the conventional diagnosis that states Presbyopia is due to hardening of the lens.So I decided to apply my rapid recovery plan and improve my vision. I began with visualizing my vision becoming better. I typed and printed the following, I can see like a microscope. I can see like a telescope, in various font sizes, from small to large, and posted it on my bedroom wall. I made a plan to read it from various distances and reward myself as my vision improved.As I proceeded with my recovery plan, I noticed that my vision was getting worse and things that I could see at say 15 inches were looking blurry as well. But I reasoned that my subconscious was playing a trick on me by making things worse.Then suddenly it dawned on me: when my vision first improved it was not due to any particular effort on my part. It simply happened on its own. I searched through my library for Dr. Bates's book and read it again. He states that we see with our brain. The more relaxed the mind the better we see. He also disregards Presbyopia as an old age problem. He attributes it to tension which is misdiagnosed and made worse with use of glasses.So I focused on relaxing my mind more and not forcing my eyes to read up close. I also imagined how it would feel to have a Haagen-Dazs ice cream bar as a reward for better eyesight and did the eye and mental exercises Dr.. Bates recommends. He recommends exercises to relax your mind and eyes, such as covering your eyes with your palms and imagining the color black.The book also comes with an eye chart for daily eye exercises. Shortly after my eyesight improved and I could easily read up close. I have noticed that any time now I don't get enough sleep or am under stress the first thing that happens is my close up vision changes. But it also improves when I realize it.Why does this happen? It could be partly programming or conditioning by the optometrists and ophthalmologists who tell us over the years that after forty expect problems with your vision. It could be the way our subconscious responds to tension after forty. It could be that initially it was due to sinus infection but became a conditioned response.Regardless of the causes, if you are not using corrective lenses, get Dr. Bates's book and save yourself from need for glasses. Stay informed. Stay well!"},{"Title":"The Bates method for better eyesight without glasses,","review":"I bought this book thinking it would help me get rid of my glasses. Well, I don't want to make it sound like I'm really slamming this book, it really was a great book. Dr. Bates really was a revolutionary opthamolagist, however this book didn't go about explaining how to go about doing some of these &quot;exercises&quot;, or not as much as I'd have liked it to. This book, however did explain the eyes and why the eyes go bad, and it all makes sense if you keep an open mind about it. If you really feel like curing your eye problems, you may want to look elsewhere, though this book is a good starting point.

I FEEL THAT IT MIGHT WORK FOR DISTANCE, BUT NOT FOR READING."},{"Title":"The Bates method for better eyesight without glasses,","review":"I would recommend people look up the excellent Wikipedia article on the Bates method. From reading this unbiased, informative article you will see that natural vision improvement just does not work. By 'work' I mean improve your vision to 20/20. It provides scientific explanations for the flashes of improvement that people experience, as I did. These are transient spasm of the ciliary muscle, \\"blur adaptation\\", constriction of the pupil, a learned ability to interpret blurred images and a contact lens-like effect of moisture on the eye. So yes, people do report some improvement. It gives them false hope. But you will never improve to 20/20 vision.To try and get the maximum improvement I went without glasses all the time. Because I couldn't see anything it knocked my confidence, I couldn't make eye contact with people. I was determined to improve my vision because I thought that it was my short sightedness that was holding me back and making me unhappy. I was young and vulnerable. I believed these frauds. I wasted months and years of my life because of the Bates method/eye exercises.Those who seek out natural vision improvement are normally unhappy people, looking for reasons for why they are unhappy. So I would advise people that if you are unhappy do not think natural eyesight improvement will make you happier. It won't.There are those who believe, as I did, that there is a conspiracy to hide the truth so that the optical industry carries on making money. There is no conspiracy. There have been studies done and it just doesn't work. I do believe that near work and near play, such as computer games, particularly in childhood while the eye is growing and forming, causes myopia. But I disagree that once the eye is in a certain shape, which is the cause of the myopia, you can do anything to change it.I despair that this book has got so many 5 star reviews. It is very likely that these people have experienced the momentary improvement in vision, as explained earlier. Note that none of them say they have got down to 20/20 vision.So, I must reiterate, don't waste your life following these unproven and damaging set of ideas."},{"Title":"The Bates method for better eyesight without glasses,","review":"This book is well written, so that any layman can understand and use the info. it contains.

She is also extremely talented, smart, a savvy business woman and appears to be geniune and sincere. At least she carries herself with dignity and class at all times in the public eye, which is much welcomed in light of all of the recent Britany Spears drama due to her inability to wear undies and stop boozing and partying while her 2 babies sit home \\"motherless\\". Beyonce was happy for Jennifer Hudson when she won the Oscar.

Yamila and Marisa are memorable to me, but Beyonce isn't. I recall several African covergirls but no Asians, and that isn't real racial equality. Asians Audrey Quock and Aline Nakashima are more attractive to me than Africans Beyonce, Tyra Banks and Naomi Campbell who have been \\"SI\\" covergirls, while the Asians haven't.

I give this book five stars not as a literary composition but as a highly intertaining account of how things really were in the heyday of the wild west. It is fast and easy reading, written in colorful language as it was spoken. As you read Harkey's writing you are soon magically transported into another era that will never return. You find yourself not just reading about his exploits, but living his experiences with him. I feel as though his unique unsophisticated writing style has expanded my own life experiences to include an important part of history that occurred long before I was born. Not many writers can do this.If you want to actually experience the old west, read this book."},{"Title":"Mean As Hell","review":"given the title, i was prepared to be unfavorably amused by this book but wound up thoroughly charmed by the direct and often witty descriptions and characterizations by this bona fide turn of that century wild west lawman, who, one must assume, was just as tough and unyielding as the 'hard cases' for whom this work is titled.harkey's plain style and simple accounting of the events develops a remarkable bond of trust with the reader, and i came away almost with a casual sense of familiarity with some of the most savage and desperate bad men produced by that savage and desperate era.recommend it very highly for anyone who would like to get a highly entertaining -- but pretty much unvarnished -- picture of life on the edge at that time."},{"Title":"Mean As Hell","review":"A fun vacation read.

I bought 6 copies. One for each of my Zumwalt relatives (Father In Law, Brother In Law, Sister In Law, one for each of our two kids and of course one for us.) . Keeping in mind I married a Zumwalt girl. If you remember from the Chapter titled &quot;Mean as Hell&quot;, Mr. Hall was killed by Mr. Zumwalt. That was my wifes Great Grandather. What was not made clear is that the Hall brothers were friends with the Zumwalt brothers. Due to some cattle rustling talk, the Hall brothers threatend to kill the Zumwalts on sight. There was a confrontation and needless to say it wasn't the Zumalts to hit the ground. Irony was that Hall was wearing the shirt that Zumwalt had bought him on his last birthday...The Zumwalts lost their ranch in the resulting trial..cost of courts/legal/ and lawyer fees. Mr. Zumwalt was aquited as the bottom line is Hall's threat ,as well as, went for his gun first..That was the way it was back then.From my understanding Mr. Zumwalt had informed Mr. Harkey that he was a liar and to not cross paths with him again or he would live to regret it.Over the years, I listen to this story over and over and never tire.

I found that I was very familiar with the places mentioned in the book as well as some of the people. Good read whether you are from Carlsbad, New Mexico or not.

I still have family in New Mexico and therefore it is easy for me to connect with the author.Having said that, this book is just a fun read if you are interested in the culture of the American west in the late 19th century. The author is not really a writer, and it shows in the way he writes, but if you imagine an old man sitting on a porch spinning tales about arresting the man who shot Billy the Kid or how he and his family were trapped inside their cabin for several days by Indians, it becomes a relaxing and fascinating read that offers real insight that is lacking in movies and documentaries.This is unfiltered, unproduced history and it is worth the read.

I was not to be disappointed.Geoffrey Bennett was a distinguished naval historian who had previously served in the Royal Navy for 35 years. From that background he was able to bring an understanding of naval matters to his work which is rarely found elsewhere. I have yet to be disappointed with anything written by this author.Indecisive encounters are just like any other contentious subject be it war or even football. For example, few Germans would agree that \\"that\\" goal scored by Geoff Hurst in 1966 actually went over the line. On the other side of the coin, few Englishmen would disagree that it was a perfectly good goal.It is the same with the Battle of Jutland. If we add up the combined tonnages of all ships lost, damaged and put out of action, then Germany won on points. If, on the other hand, we argue that the objective was to damage the German High Sea Fleet to such an extent that it would never challenge the Royal Navy again, then, we \\"could\\" easily suggest the result went in favour of the British Grand Fleet because German sea power remained confined thereafter.Because neither side scored a decisive victory, there is little point in holding a view about who may or may not have won and we can all speculate (or is it day-dream?) about what might have happened if only... More importantly, what sets this work apart from others on the same subject is the sources tapped by Geoffrey Bennett which were previously unknown prior to the first publication of this book. Research is the key to works of this nature and Geoffrey Bennett was both meticulous and knowledgeable when it came to conducting his own.Previously published in 1964 and again in 1972, there has been a lot of accurate and inaccurate books published about the Battle of Jutland in the ensuing years. Perhaps it is time to get back to some basic facts which are well presented and equally well written up for the reader to enjoy. In this way, we can look at all those contentious issues afresh.NM"},{"Title":"The Battle of Jutland","review":"I have read the author's previous book about the Falklands, and this book was as detailed, but a little more confusing in movements. Author makes extensive use of official reports from the battle, including extensive quotations. I liked the book and got a detailed answer on what happened at Jutland. For the British to call this a victory, it was clear it was not. They lost over 6,000 men, and three battlecruisers. The Germans lost two major ships and were mauled badly. However, for the rest of the war, the German's fleet in being, was only that. Both sides suffered from this battle. The British could afford their losses, and made good on replacements. The Germans spent the rest of the war suffering poor morale, and finally mutiny.This is an OK read by a good author. The book is well researched, and reads OK. There is enough detail to show how the battle played out."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"When I first started reading this book, I couldn't put it down....it really pulled me in, but all of a sudden the story ended without warning. Then they threw a bunch of crappy short stories and I'm thinking WTF happen to Neville? The ending was so anticlimactic and it really annoyed me, especially the short stories that had nothing to do with I am legend."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I greatly enjoyed the story \\"I Am Legend\\", but was quite dismayed to find that it ends halfway through the book and the remainder is short stories. There's no indication on the listing that this is a book of short stories."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"I Am Legend\\", by Richard Matheson, is the eerie tale of Robert Neville, a simple man who is faced with the complicated dilemma of being the last living man in a world infested with undead vampires.Set in a post-war scenario, Neville is the sole survivor of a horrific biological war that has turned every person but him into blood-hungry vampires. Forced into an uncomfortable and numbing isolation, Neville is forced to live out his life in a day-to-day race to find the answers to why every person on Earth has turned into a vampire, and to stop them before they destroy him.Throughout the story, Neville battles alcoholism and the immense pain of losing his wife and daughter, all while struggling to understand the plague that has transformed his family, friends, and neighbors into monsters. While Neville is no saint, Matheson offers an honest depiction of what might become of anyone who is faced with such a great burden.While following Neville in his daily routine, we appreciate the magnitude of the milestone discoveries that he gradually makes. These seemingly small, but vastly important findings lead Neville to the ultimate discovery of what causes the vampirism and why he was spared the atrocity of becoming one.Although Neville's education, organization, and enlightenment are extraordinary, they are countered by his realization that the vampires have been through a similar metamorphosis. This parallel adaptation between Neville and the monsters lead to a thought-provoking and surprising conclusion.Captivating and full of rich detail, \\"I Am Legend\\" was a true pleasure to read. Matheson's masterful portrayal of this grim tale makes \\"I Am Legend\\" a welcome addition to the horror genre."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Robert Neville is the last man on Earth. The rest have been turned into bloodthirsty abominations whose only goal is to pry, to tease Robert out of his shelter. By day, Robert mercilessly destroys them as they are frozen with rigor mortis at dawn. His life has turned into a game of survival against all odds. He lives to kill.&quot;I Am Legend&quot; desperately needs some cheap suspense. Otherwise, it just isn't scary. The novel's horror aspect is almost totally obscured by the measurely, prosaic depiction of its central character, his general safety in his well-protected home, and his scientific pursuits. True, there are several very powerful episodes, such as when Robert recalls the first days of the plague, when the victims of the desease return to a semblance of life. But other than that, there is few major thrills. In other words, it's not Matheson's goal to be scary. He depicts a complex, original, emotional mindscape: the gradual dehumanization of the survivor, and the mirror-image humanization of his predator-prey. Even despite the hurried ending, the gradual understanding of Robert's transformation is gripping. Furthermore, Matheson postulates a well-grounded scientific explanation of vampirism: the undeath and bloodlust are caused by a bacterium, and the fear of the cross, lack of reflection, etc. are given psychological causes.The short stories following the main piece are a mixed bunch. A number of them are exceedingly straightforward, word sketches of improbable concepts, like so many &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; episodes. None of them are really scary. Matheson settles for dark irony (&quot;'When did she die?' 'As soon as I get home.'&quot;). Some, like &quot;From Shadowed Places&quot;, are outrageously old-fashioned.Read for the novel, skim the stories."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A friend of mine lent me this book, and it turned out to be the best book i've ever read. It draws you into the story, and won't let go. It was a bit short, with an odd, abrupt ending but wonderful. Richard Matheson is the most talented writer i've found so far. Read this book. Not for the weak of mind, not to mental for the everyday person. I also reccommend &quot;Hell House&quot; by Matheson, not as good as &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, but a great story, captivating. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"If you like vampire books then you'll love 'I am Legend'. It creates a terrifying world where one man struggles to survive alone. Hunted and hunter, he becomes the abnormal; the one different to everyone else, the one to be scared of. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Matheson, noted author of novels, shortstories and screenplays (Twilight Zone, etc) brings you into a vampiric world easily recognizable to any baby-boomer.It is Matheson's humanity thru the main character that pulls the reality(sic) along at an absorbing pace.Known best perhaps for his &quot;Shrinking Man&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; novels-made-movies, this is Matheson at his best.It is less a vampiric novel, more a social-commentary of &quot;the ordinary man in extra-ordinary circumstances&quot;. READ THE BOOK! Forget the movies (Price or Heston)!You'll return to it again and again.If you want Matheson in an excellant, small bite, search out the short story (also Zone episode) &quot;Little Girl Lost&quot;; though rare and hard to find in a collection, it's worth the hunt. I AM LEGEND will make you sad when finished to realize this gifted 50's writer writes no more!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"a good book. no, nothing more. perhaps even a bit worse. a plague makes everyone either dead or vampires. except one. who tries to survive. who tries to kill vampires. he locks himself up safe and sound in his house. this is actually the great thing in the book. the descriptions of the way the guy stands there watching the vampires trying to lure him out or attack the house. very W.H.Hodgson- like. but except for that. i mean, why bother killing the vampires if you're the only one left? and how important are we supposed to feel his survival is, when he's the only human left. he lives, he dies. mankind's done for either way. survival isn't even important for him, since he feels lonely, scared, etc. let him die, i say. who cares when it doesn't make a difference? this is actually more a story about loneliness than a horror novel to me."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"I am Legend\\" really is a great novel. However a comment about this particular edition. Despite the cover with Will Smith on it, the book isn't just this novel but this novel and a collection of Matheson short stories. Nothing wrong there, more bang for the buck. But if you have never read \\"I am Legend\\" before, just note when it ends. I didn't realize this book was a collection and so I took the ending of the novel to be the end of a chapter. As I started reading what I thought was the subsequent chapter the story went off in a completely different and related direction. I didn't figure out what was happening until a couple short stories later. It would have been helpful had the edition mentioned any of this, but there isn't a word about the fact that this is a collection anywhere."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I purchased this book in anticipation of the movie. While \\"I Am Legend\\" is a great story and interesting read, I, like other reviewers here, wish the book had been better titled.It wasn't until halfway through the additional short stories that I realized they had nothing to do with \\"I Am Legend\\". I had been reading them thinking they were a continuation trying to sort out how the various plots and storylines related to the original.Unfortunately, doing so distracted from the true storylines. So, if you get this book thinking the entire book is \\"I Am Legend\\", pay attention to the Table of Contents!Otherwise, the story of John Neville is touching and realistic. Anyone can relate to his struggle with the lonliness of being the \\"last man of earth\\", from the shock of hearing his own voice out loud after not speaking to anyone else for months to the desire of any type of companionship, whether human or animal.John Neville is a strong man in the face of complete horror. He doesn't recognize the lengths his strength has driven him to adapt to his situation and doesn't see this strength in himself.A great story that makes you think how you would cope with being alone in the world."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"They made a movie that captured almost nothing of what this novel is really about. This is the author that Stephen King learned from. Honestly, I read this book 10 years ago and it still haunts me. I see echoes if it in things in the news and things I experience in my own life. It is about much more than vampires and, in that way, will be around long after the twilights and crap have all gone out of fashion."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is a good, quick read. Very different from the movie. I was surprised to find out, after I'd started reading, that it was written in the 50's!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I started reading this book with thoughts of the Will Smith movie in mind. The book has many differences from the movie, but if anything I like it more. I literally could not stop reading it, which included during class and breaks at work. I finished it in a couple of days. It was well worth the money I spent on it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"In this copy of \\"I Am Legend\\", the first half of the book is Matheson's hugely popular story about Robert Neville, the last man on earth. The second half of the book is ten short stories. So...I Am Legend-is a great story that may not seem like such a unique idea now a days, but must have been at least semi-original when it was published nearly sixty years ago. Aside from the actual content story, what I really enjoyed about this book is Matheson's simple-yet-effective writing style. His writing reads as if it was written just last year instead of over half-a-century ago. I greatly admire his style, for being modern and seemingly ahead of his time.As for the actual story itself, well, it's very good in its own right. The last time I attempted to read a story like this (meaning just one character all alone) was The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon by King, and it didn't really work that well for me. I am Legend, despite barely any dialogue and only slight plot twists (at least for the first 90% of the story), is thrilling and horrifying. The story I expected to be great, was just that.As for the short stories-they are easily as good, and a few of them I'd even say are better, than the main attraction. If you ask me, there wasn't a bad one in the bunch.I really enjoy stories where the narrative is sort of a half-mad rambling from one of the characters: A Dress of White Silk and Mad House were incredible stories told in this style.Person to Person was another great one. Unique idea, mysterious and chilling, fantastic.Even the shortest story, about three pages long, The Near Departed, manages to make an impact.Prey is a terrfying story that reminds me of Chucky from Child's Play, which freaked me out as a kid.Buried talents is a quick story with a nice little ending.Witch War, The Funeral, Dance of the Dead, From Shadowed Places: all dark and creepy stories. Dance of the Dead in particular contains some frigthening images.Overall, I am Legend is certainly a classic, but that's only some of the fun in this book. Great title story, and GREAT set of short stories. Five stars for sure."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This was my first journey into the vampire genre and it was a great appetizer. The writing is crisp and the suspense is palpable. I found the entire book easily digestible and after two days I was sad to see this story end.It is immediately evident why this book was made into a movie - though (and I write this as a fan of the movie overall), in many ways I wish the film had stayed truer to the book!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I choose this book due to watching the movie. This book goes much deeper into how the disease took off and how the main character goes about its discovery. The is a great psychological view on the main character and how he maintains his sanity through the end of days and absence of human contact."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It's a classic. Tries to make sense of the vampire with science and delves deep into the psychology of being the only man alive. Read it.NOW"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I expected more out of this book after seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews. It does introduce some interesting ideas regarding human-vampire relationships, but ultimately it wasn't enough for me. Also, the main character was hard for me to relate with and Matheson's writing style wasn't my favorite.Amazon consensus says I'm an outlier. It's not that expensive, so if you decide to buy it I hope you like it.Lastly, be aware that only half the book is \\"I Am Legend\\". The rest is a series of short stories (also by Matheson)."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is the first Matheson book I\`ve read. Nothing like the films I\`ve seen based on it. Good read. Short but sweet."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Descriptively paints the picture for an apocalyptic world. I don't want to give away anything from the book, so I highly recommend to anyone interested in an end of days crisis or survival in general. The story is far more about the protagonist, Robert Neville\`s ability to survive on an emotional and mental level than that of a physical (food, supplies, etc.) one. I related to the story because when I think about surviving in this type of situation many of the same ideas play into my head like that of the writer."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I've read a lot of lower-rating reviews express emotion ranging from slight disappointment to Chris Nealic Outrage about the fact all 317 pages in this book aren't dedicated to the telling of the title story. Let's get this out of the way right now -- there are 11 stories in this book. \\"I Am Legend\\" starts at page 1 and ends at page 170. There. I wrote it for all the readers to read. Sorry for the spoiler. [By the way, if you haven't read the book, don't worry if you don't know what Chris Nealic Outrage is. You'll get it when you read \\"Mad House.\\" If you have read the book, shame on you for not getting that.]The uniting theme of all 11 stories in this book is death. It's all about death and how it comes to human beings, and what happens to those who survive us -- how easily we can kill each other -- how there may or may not be an afterlife -- how we may or may not be able to contact those who've died.Two of the stories in this book have been depicted in at least four movies I'm aware of -- \\"The Last Man on Earth,\\" \\"Omega Man,\\" \\"I Am Legend,\\" and \\"Trilogy of Terror.\\" With the exception of \\"Trilogy of Terror,\\" where \\"Prey\\" is one third of the trilogy, the movies don't come anywhere close to the actual story in the book. Of course, the other three movies were based on or inspired by \\"I Am Legend,\\" but you couldn't tell by watching them, though, maybe Vincent Price in \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" comes closest.In case you aren't aware, Richard Matheson has written many books that have spawned movies. For example, \\"What Dreams May Come,\\" \\"Stir of Echoes,\\" \\"Duel,\\" and \\"Real Steel\\" are all based on Matheson novels or short stories. He's also written for \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" and other TV shows during his long career, and you can tell it in his writing (he even has a girl trip in one of the stories as she's running through the woods in terror -- yeah, he went there). He's not the sort of writer whose prose reads like extended poetry, who packs entire scenes and character sketches, histories, into single sentences like, say, Thomas Pynchon or William Gaddis do. No, Matheson's writing is well crafted, to be sure, but it's more geared toward an Everyman or Joe Six-Pack who wants to be entertained while not intellectually insulted. In fact, if Pynchon and Gaddis are luxury cars, Matheson is a muddy, dented, well-used pick-up truck that will get you somewhere a luxury car can't get you -- and though the ride may be rough here and there, the payoff will be well worth it. The worlds he takes you to are unique, the thoughts he provokes ... interesting at the very least, sometimes, downright scary.The reason I mention these things is because Matheson has a lot of history not only with the reading public, but also anyone who watches TV and movies like the ones mentioned above. So, when you read this book, I would suggest looking at the years the stories were first published. Realize that \\"I Am Legend\\" was written in 1954, \\"Prey,\\" 1969, \\"Mad House,\\" 1952. Pretend you've never heard of any of the movies, forget all about Will Smith, and don't judge the writing from today's perspective. (Yes, Dr. Lurice Howell is probably a perfect example of a female magical negro character, I know. Just enjoy the show though. You can write a condemnation of Matheson when you finish the book. But remember \\"From Shadowed Places\\" was written in 1960.) Just pretend some old WWII vet you know shared a beat up, faded binder with 11 stories he wrote way back in the day (Matheson actually did see combat in WWII, by the way). Have a drink or two if you're not a teetotaler, stop to use google maps as he mentions locations, youtube the music he mentions, take your time with these stories and I think you'll agree this collection is not only entertaining, it's downright spooky at times, as well as unforgettable.One side note: If you're familiar with John Steinbeck's books, you may have noticed how much he loves to mention what characters are doing with their feet. They're always wiggling their toes, standing with one foot on top of the other, scratching their opposite leg with a foot, &c.; Matheson has a similar habit, except with him, it's throat movements.[Oh, and, yeah, of all 11 stories in this book, the one that actually creeped me out was \\"Dress of White Silk.\\" -- maybe because I read it at three in the morning]"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I was rather shocked to see how much Hollywood had veered from the original storyline.

In the book we get a better feel for Neville and his personal vampire/zombie apocalypse as well as his aching loneliness at first.

Hollywood caters their visual stories to what they think will sell, and that is understandable.

He has written many many things from the old Rod Serling's Twilight Zone to Somewhere in Time among others..This book is closer to Vincent Price's Last Man on Earth than Will Smith's I am Legend..

The book had a good ending that I wont spoil for you, youll have to read it your self. ;D"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"One of my all-time favorite movies is \\"I am Legend\\", so I decided to read the book by Richard Matheson. In most cases you will find that people will say, \\"The book is better than the movie.\\" In this case it's hard to compare. The reason I say this, is because the book and the movie differ in so many ways it's hard to see how they both share the same title.I will have to say, the book is much slower than the movie, but if the movie had played out as the book did there would not be much to watch and virtually no dialog. I think this is the main reason for the difference between the book and the movie. In the book, most of the dialog that did go on was going on in the main character's (Robert Neville) head. Where in the movie, Robert has a companion from the get go, a dog named Sam. In the movie, this helps with the dialog from the beginning of the movie.**Spoiler Alert**In the book Robert comes across his companion, but later on; I will not say how he comes across his companion or what happens to his new friend because I don't want to spoil the book for anyone who might be interested in reading it.Both the book and the movie share a common thread, Vampires. Not like you would see in most vampire stories, these vampires seemed to me to be more like zombies. Not really intelligent and driven by the desire to feed on fresh flesh. The only thing that holds true to the common vampire is that sun light burns their skin, but in most stories vampires are intelligent.The setting of this story mostly takes place at his home, with windows boarded up and holy water splashed on the front porch. Robert dose not venture to far from his home in the book unlike the movie where he is trying to find a cure, so he tries to catch some of the vampires during daylight hours. In both the book and movie have the two same characters (Sam the dog and Ruth who he meets later in the story) that play a huge role in Roberts's life, but in different ways when it comes to the book vs. the movie.In the book, Sam does not show up until later in the story and from aside from talking to himself Robert is able to have an external dialog. Robert feels obligated to heal the dog after many wounds and almost starvation. This is as far as I am going to go about Sam, because I don't want to ruin it for anyone else who wants to enjoy the book.Ruth also comes to Robert towards the end of the story, but as I said earlier they she plays a role in the book that is against Robert, were in the movie she was in it for humanity. Again I don't want to get into her role because I don't wasn't to ruin the story for anyone else.Overall the structure of the book flows evenly and the chapters were there to separate the next chronological even in the story. All though there was not much dialog, except what was going on in Roberts head, the story was one of those that are hard to put down because at the end of each chapter Matheson left a cliff hanger. If the reader is trying to follow the story from the movie or vice versa, s/he will be disappointed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A virus of unknown origin has swept across the planet killing the majority of humans and mutating the rest - all except for one man who seems to be immune. The mutants have developed vampire-like traits, and the lone survivor, Robert Neville, barricades himself in his home by night to avoid being drained by them, and systematically searches for and destroys the mutants when they become comatose during the day.Although there are zombie-like vampires (or vampire-like zombies?), and Robert Neville is hunting and killing them, this is not really the focus of the story, so there isn't very much blood and gore. The story actually focuses around Neville struggling to cope with isolation and his pursuit of knowledge in an attempt to make sense what has happened to his world and his tenacious effort to \\"fix\\" it. Above all, the story is an exploration of the true definition of humanity and the subjective moral center of society.Written in 1954 and taking place in the \\"future\\" of 1976, \\"I Am Legend\\" doesn't feel at all dated until Neville decides he needs to do some research and doesn't go into a panic over the loss of the Internet. This futuristic 1970's dude knows exactly what to do when the power grid is down and he needs to know everything there is to know about blood and bacilli - he heads straight to the local library.Richard Matheson's writing is absolutely brilliant, and I now understand why this novella is considered a classic. If you have seen any of the movies based on this book, you still don't know the story. Read the book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I came by Richard Matheson through his writing for The Twilight Zone. This is the first of his novels I've read and it definitely will not be the last. Though written in 1954 it doesn't feel dated at all. The story is well-paced, thoughtfully written, and easy to follow. I really enjoyed Matheson's writing style. The ending is superb; thoughtful and appropriate. It's no wonder this book is a modern classic. I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I AM LEGEND - which, by the way, is a ridiculously awesome title - is Richard Matheson's most celebrated story. I AM LEGEND, first published in 1954, is a staple in the genre of horror literature, a haunting novella that inspired three feature film adaptations. Three feature films which still don't do justice to the book. Matheson's game-changing scientific approach to vampirism, combined with his impeccable storytelling skills, influenced a host of renowned horror writers such as Stephen King and Brian Lumley. Matheson chronicles the harrowing odyssey of one man's struggle to survive in a blighted world. We track three years in the life of Robert Neville. In describing that three-year span, \\"bleak\\" would be understating it.The vampire virus struck without warning; it rapidly consumed the world, infected or killed off the entire human population but one. And now Robert Neville finds himself the last remaining human, clawing out a meager existence. By daylight, Neville stocks up on necessities and hunts down the vampires. By night, he barricades himself in his fortified home while the revenants roam the landscape and taunt him on his doorstep. It's only natural that Robert Neville finds himself quietly going insane. Matheson has never been more pronounced in his ability to convey a man's unendurable loneliness and sense of alienation. I AM LEGEND is haunting and frightening and addictive. I can see why it's regarded as an absolute classic, science and the supernatural and nerve-jangling human drama relentlessly melded into a nightmarish read. The pages almost turn themselves.I AM LEGEND, understandably, is the featured content in this anthology, but don't dismiss the other stories, which range from potent three-page drive-bys to more-fleshed out blood-curdlers that run over twenty pages. In this anthology, Matheson weaves a thread that seems to suggest that sinister, unfathomable forces, while not exactly always aligned against us, nevertheless inhabit our daily existence. While one or two of these tales is weaker than others - I found \\"Dance of the Dead\\" an offputting read, mostly because of the jarring style Matheson adopts - he manages to consistently display his arsenal of black humor (\\"The Near Departed,\\" \\"The Funeral\\"), his knack for psychological suspense (\\"Mad House\\"), and twisted imagination. I love his penchant for throwing in the occasional punchline or nasty swerve. \\"Dress of White Silk,\\" \\"Mad House,\\" and \\"Person to Person\\" are particularly noteworthy \\"What the F---?!\\" stories.I AM LEGEND kicks off the anthology; here's the rest:- \\"Buried Talents\\" (1987) - In a fairground, a man with infallible aim approaches a game booth. It would've better had the booth runner not effed with him.- \\"The Near Departed\\" (1987) - A pale little man enters a mortician's office and makes arrangements for his deceased wife. But there's a twist.- \\"Prey\\" (1969) - A long-suffering daughter inadvertently lets loose a murderous Zuni fetish doll who has this sharp little knife.- \\"Witch War\\" (1951) - Seven chattery little girls are conscripted into some unnamed war.- \\"Dance of the Dead\\" (1954) - In the aftermath of a war in which some of the dead are resurrected, four kids drive down to St. Louis to see a zombie stage act.- \\"Dress of White Silk\\" (1951) - The moral of this one is you shouldn't make fun of disturbed little girls' mothers or their mothers' dresses.- \\"Mad House\\" (1952) - Psychobolie phenomena: the paranormal link between the animate and inanimate. Matheson submits a story in which a habitually frustrated writer's unchecked anger, when released, doesn't dissipate but instead is channeled into the inanimate objects in his home. Sucks for that writer.- \\"The Funeral\\" (1955) - How Morton Silkline became the funeral director of choice for the supernatural community.- \\"From Shadowed Places\\" (1960) - A tale of darkest juju and prejudice and how primal forces roil beneath even the most professional of demeanors. It's Matheson's cautionary way of advising his readers to be kind to starving witch doctors.- \\"Person to Person\\" (1989) - From 3am to 6am, Millman hears a phone ringing... in his head. That is never a good thing."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It is no surprise that the novella I Am Legend is quite possibly the best short fiction horror story that has ever been written. In that regard, it is also not a surprise that such powerhouses as Stephen King have borrowed heavily from Richard Matheson's writing style, his ability to weave a story, the balance of utter horror and snide humor, and to explain or to choose not to explain the horror presented within the pages of their works. I Am Legend not only presents a story that is invigorating and easy to follow, but Matheson goes several layers deeper into the questioning depths of societal norms, religion, politics, and the human psychosis.We follow a main character by the name of Robert Neville. The first chapter is in January of 1976 and he lives in California as opposed to the modern movie version where Robert Neville lives in New York City and the time period is set into the near future. That, in of itself, changes a lot of the story. Regardless, we follow Robert Neville through his routines of living alone in a waking nightmare. From the get-go we realize that Neville is alone with his thoughts since he is immune to the bite of the vampire and because of that he makes some startling discoveries. He begins to try and understand how the vampires that populate the world function and why. Refusing to believe that it is associated with stigmatized myth, he begins his experimentation in the hopes of saving some form of humanity. He even dabbles into the option as to whether or not humanity is even worth saving, if perhaps the vampire is nature's response to the way we have treated her. Nevertheless, he pushes is on to find a logical understanding in an illogical world.He, however, struggles not only with the problem of the vampires but the problems within himself at having lost everyone he knew and having no one to talk to but himself. During this stage he questions society, religion, politics, everything that once existed in comparison to the vampire--finding little to no differences there. Like most established order, depending on your view, it can become suffocating.As the vampire consumes his life and gives him the only reason for living Robert Neville also loses himself to an animalistic way of life, losing his ability to communicate and function properly. When his world gets flipped upside down, he reacts in the only way he knows how.An excellent read and truly a masterpiece in a quick 170 pages. The rest of the book consists of short stories also written by Matheson which are all very good, unique, entertaining, sometimes funny, and certainly horrifying tales that follow his style where the abnormal infects the normal and has a deep, sub-level understanding that can be analyzed and critiqued openly."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Despite many new caricatures currently being done with vampire lore, Richard Matheson's \\"I am Legend\\" still stands out in the crowd. His novel provides a fascinating, scientific twist on the origin of vampires. One of the most notable trends endemic towards his and other horror novels written in the \\"Cold-War Era,\\" were the constant admonitions given by novelists against nuclear weapons. Since the \\"vampiris bacillus\\" gets spread in the throes of a future nuclear war, atomic weapons shouldn't be used! I personally believe the omens provided by Matheson and other writers during the dawn of our \\"Atomic Age\\" helped, in no small measure, to end the Cold War. Reviewed by Brian Alexander, Author of:The Mailman---available as a Kindle Book on this site."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"You've seen the movie. Will Smith chin uping his way through the end of the world.The movie was a picnic in the park compared to the book. In reality the movie should have given itself a whole other title. I give four stars on this only because I believe Matheson hurt his book with all of references that date the story. Otherwise this is a classic that every reader should read if they enjoy horror/suspense.The psychological drama involved will keep you on the edge of your seat and the ending will finally explain why the book is called 'I AM LEGEND' unlike whatever was going on with the movie.I really cannot say more than if you have an interest at all, read it, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This should be the standard by which books of this genre should be based.

What's interesting about Matheson is that he uses the themeof isolation is many of his works.Note: When I first downloaded my copy it had a number of typos. After contacting the publisher they fixed the typos which I appreciate.Bob"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"There are a few books that I can beyond a reasonable doubt are seamless masterpieces; I Am Legend is one of those rare few.The first thing to point out is that this was the 2nd book I've ever read in my life and that number was a very crucial number for both my writing and reading career; in other words, if this book happened to suck, I would have tried to have been a writing without being a reader (and that could have had dangerous results). I'm glad to say that this novel did not make me hate reading--it made me give books a chance because Richard Matheson spoke to me through his written words, \\"I Am Legend.\\"Now there are three types of people that are reading this review right now. First, the people who are also posting their reviews and see what everyone else is saying; second, the people who saw the Will Smith movie and thought it was really good and want to give the book a chance; third, the people who were once like me, who are finally giving reading a chance. And the person reading this might be a combination of all three.But let me speak to the second type of person reading this: this has nothing to do with the Will Smith movie except for the main characters name (well, technically the vice versa is the truth). I won't alienate those who like the movie by stating my own opinions about it; and I won't bash the movie, because this isn't about the movie - it's about the book, and it's a dang good one.For those who've liked the movie, I can say that the book isn't about mutant-zombies, but rather traditional vampires with a twist; for those who hate the movie and are somehow stumbling upon the book on amazon based on recommendation or instinct, then my friend, both scenarios are right. This is a good book and it goes to show how great it is that maybe - just maybe - it's the most adapted book to film almost ever (if not ever). Of course films haven't gotten the book right yet, nor does it matter.Maybe all the adaptions mean that this novel is so good that the films can't even compare. I highly recommend it for those who either A) want to enjoy a book they haven't read yet, or B) those who are into the horror genre.**a special thing to mention. George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead was inspired by this novel . . . so you can say if it wasn't for this novel, the flesh eating zombie genre wouldn't even exist in the world. So with that conclusion, Bravo!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"One of the best horror books I have ever read. A book that really lived up to the critical acclaim given to it by a generation of writers.I have few books that I like so much that I keep a copy always a re read sections of them that live on in my mind. This is one such book.I don't normally like vampire stories, but this is fresh and original twist on a theme that has been so done to death."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am Legend is considered by many to be one of the most influential vampire stories of all time. It's a reputation well deserved, written in the 50s it was one of the first stories to remove vampires from gothic castles and place them in familiar urban settings. Although the vampires are rightly so, a important part of the story, a more important part is the main character &quot;Robert Neville&quot;. I Am Legend is the story of a regular man, not a hero, just a regular man forced into a life of solitary wandering in a world that constantly reminds him of how wonderful the world truly is and how that world will never exist again. It is a story of how humanity copes with life in a dead world with no meaning. To some it may seem that neville wastes his time as the last man on earth, but what would any of us really be able to do? Looking for a cure is vaccine is hopeless, there is no-one left to use a vaccine on. Ridding the world of these vampires? Why? There's no one left to take the world back over once they're all gone. I am legend is a story of how humanity copes, and goes on in a world with nothing left."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I AM LEGEND remains an all time favorite in my library. It is the first book I read cover to cover (simply because I wanted to read)and started my love affair with reading that has continued since 1972. I bought the paperback that was released as a Tie-In to \\"The Omega Man\\" and was surprised to find that the movie had so little in common with the book.This is a review for the book, SO I have to say that a recent rereading of this book left me feeling like I had read A CLASSIC. In my years, I have been in awe of Richard Mathesons imagination, growing up with his stories on the Twilight Zone/Night Gallery, his movies and books (even \\"The Beardless Warriors\\") remain in my library.\\"I Am Legend\\" doesn't conjure gory images, it weaves a story that is riveting. The chapters where he finds the dog in the daylight and all that follows, still leaves me with feelings for Robert Neville that never seem to come through in so many other books, classic or otherwise.I would certainly like to see it done right as a movie. I have only seen bits and pieces if the one with Vincent Price, but it isn't necessary. The impressions left by the book (always in black and white in my mind) are still quite fresh and will be years from now."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"If you think that this is just an adventure story with vampires, then you are missing the point. Sure, it works on that level, but intentionally or unintentionally, something much more sinister is going on.This book was written in 1954, a time when there was general paranoia about communists hiding under every rock. More importantly, there was also a growing fear of the youth subculture and \\"juvenile delinquents.\\" When the vampires in this story are described as \\"pallid, glassy-eyed travesties of humanity\\" the author is obviously talking about drugged-up kids- either then or now.Combine this with the fact that the hero (the last true man on earth) is described as being middle aged, of English-German stock, college educated, and cultured. In short, he is an upper-class wasp surrounded by a society of vampires (i.e. blood sucking freaks who contribute nothing to society.)Having said this, as detestable as it is, I now have to say that this is exactly why people still identify with the main character. If you are an intelligent, cultured individual that has ever been forced to live in a state college dorm or a low end apartment complex, then you can also readily understand Robert Neville's siege mentality....Oh yes, this book was the basis of the film \\"The Omega Man\\", but a much better version was made in Italy in 1964 called \\"The Last Man on Earth\\"- it stared Vincent Price in one of his greatest roles."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"&quot;I Am Legend&quot; is an engrossing tale that succesfully moves the legend of the vampire into the modern world and the realms of plausibility. The narrative is quite dry, and yet gripping.Rovert Neville is excellently portrayed as a man who has survived a plague, only to see his family, friends and neighbours return from the dead as monsters.Driven to survive without ever truly understanding his own motivations, he establishes a routine of hunting the dead in their inert state by day while barricading himself in his home at night.Eventually, as much to maintain his sanity as out of any curiosity, he starts to research what turned these people into vampires and why he seems to be immune.The plot is plausible, and the novel treatment of an established legend is exceptional. I read this book as part of the excellent &quot;SF Masterworks&quot; series, which has introduced me to several authors I'd never previously heard of - I'll certainly be seeked out more of Richard Matheson's writing."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"WOW - I really wish Mr. Matheson had written a longer version of I Am Legend, because this was one of the best 160 pages I've ever read. An extremely compelling story that I wanted to continue for another 100 pages (at least!!). I loved the little twist he threw in concerning one of the characters, as well as how the novel ended. Mr. Matheson had the guts to end the story in a way that many novelists would never dream of. And as a nice bonus, I loved his shorter stories - violent, grotesque, engaging with Twilight Zone type endings.I look forward to reading Hell House and other Matheson stories, and I hope and pray that Hollywood does I Am Legend justice when it comes again to the big screen. Thanks for a great read!!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I AM LEGEND is a terrifyingly bleak tale set in a world that has gone horribly wrong. Robert Neville is the lone survivor of a plague that has killed everyone in the world and then reanimated them as vampires. By day, he searches for answers and tries to reduce the ranks of the undead. By night, he is besieged by the ghoulish hordes, led by his former neighbor and friend Ben Cortman. His sanity threatening to give way, time is running out for Robert Neville. Matheson succeeds in breathing vivid life into his horrific tale. These ghouls populate a world that we know all too well, not some far-away nether world. There is no safe distance from this story. We see our world, our everyday, mundane world, twisted into a nightmarish landscape of relentless fear and ever-present death. Read this novel. It is a classic that will continue to endure."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"That movie has been the best interpretation of this novel so far (even though it supposedly has nothing to do with it). A close second would be &quot;The Homega Man&quot; episode of The Simpsons. This is one of the many cornerstones of 20th Century horror which Matheson is responsible for. The story is a character study of Robert Neville--the last human being in a world entirely populated by vampires--and all of the existential implications that entails. Very well-written, creepy, and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I was really enjoying I Am Legend when it suddenly ended just partway through the book. What I didn't realize, was that this classic vampire yarn is only a novella, and that the rest of this paperback is filled with other short horror stories by the author. Whereas I Am Legend is still a good read, generally standing the test of time, the other stories are almost comically outdated. In an era of greatly sophisticated horror films and novels, these short stories of yesterday seem almost like a caricature of themselves, though they must have been scary enough when they were first published. If you're interested in an absorbing vampire tale, definitely pick up a copy of I Am Legend. Just don't expect it to last for an entire flight across the Atlantic."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Nothing Matheson has ever written has disapointed me (what can I say, all those rave reviews aren't just a smoke screen) but &quot;I am Legend&quot; is different because it is a landmark in the vamp genre. In a world where so much garbage is pumped out into the public and passed off as literature it's nice to read something of substance, something gothic and dark and big enough to make you forget your life. The plight of Neville in this gem made me forget my own worries, and Matheson's unique use of the English language allowed me to visualize that plight in detailed horror. If you enjoy the works of Stoker and Rice, but haven't read Matheson, you don't know what you're missing."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"this book is the best book i have ever read and i think that everyone should read this book and i bet all of you that you will love it forever once you have read the first chapter i give this book 5 stars because thats how much i love it i have never read a book that was better then this book one reason that i love this book is because he shoots the vampires in the face with the pistols and when he runs out of ammo he gives them blows to the heads with the handles of the pistols when i saw this book i knew it was the book for me i saw the cover it had alot of vampires so i thought this book would be about vampires and it was.So if you see this book at the librey rent it you wont regret it i promise."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"One of the best screenplays and potential movie classic, it still hasn't been made yet!!!

Of course you do, everyone does.

What it comes down to is the whole point of the story was forsaken for a typical \\"hollywood happy ending\\". The whole point of the BOOK, was far from that and the last line is \\"I Am Legend\\". Well guess what...sorry, hollywood missed that. \\"This was the story of Robert Neville and his Legend\\", doesn't even come close. I don't want to ruin the book for you, all I can say is this...it is truly amazing and hits the heart and makes you think.This movie was as bad as \\"The Village\\" by M.

In fact, it reminded me of parts of that plot.and then we have the \\"lets not call them, but they may as well be, Vampires\\"....well, it may as well haev been The Incredible Mr.Limpit....you know...that movie with Don Knotts and the cartoon fish? Or better yet, lets just say all the non-Vampire-Vampires were Imhotep from the mummy...but not when he is first formed, like a bad cartoon version of Uncle Frank from Hellraiser...I mean when is is just about Human...still a CGI extra from Beowulf, YEAH...that crap.ENOUGH WITH THE frigING CGI. PLEASE. ENOUGH. YOU GUYS SUCK AT IT. IT HARDLY EVER WORKS.moving on...As much as I liked Smith's performance and had to hold myself back from shouting out \\"WELCOME TO ERF\\" or \\"DON'T YOU SHOOT THAT GREEN crap AT ME\\", he did his damnedest to say \\"hey world, I am just as good as tom hanks in Castaway, I swear...no frig you, really, i friging mean it\\". And he was. Wilson was replaced by a dog and manikins. oh so clever and funny. cocksmokers. This was almost as bad as \\"The Omega Man\\" with Chuck Heston. Which was another poor adaption of this story.No matter how badly i want to ruin the end of this movie for all of you, i wont. I am done with spoiling crap for people. Just go waste your money on a movie that blows penises by the dozen.....\\"36....no 37 including you\\", yeah THAT many. Puts Dante's (clerks) girlfriend to shame. Please just read the book and save your money. I promise you we can talk about it and pretend it was a movie if that will make you feel better.

So then I really don't give a crap about what you do with your time.anyways, please READ \\"I Am Legend\\".also, vincent Price made a remarkable adaption of the book called \\"The Last Man On Earth\\". Its in the public domain and you can watch it in high quality in 3 parts on Youtube.com.Oh yeah, there was a Batman Preview, it was extra long and full of goodness.

All the character does is \\"drink all day and smoke\\". He seems to have left the book awhile before returning to the ending which seemed far fetched and absurd. Other stories in here include boring cliched type horror stuff that isnt really stimulating. This book would have been good if I was 14 but now it is just average."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is actually the original novel (170 pages) and some additional short stories written over the next thirty five years (the last in 1989).As to \\"I am Legend\\", maybe I've read to much other horror or have been overwhelmed by \\"Night of the Living Dead\\", \\"Omega Man\\",\\"Buffy\\" and \\"Angel\\" and \\"Twilight Zones\\" up the wazoo. Maybe all those mentioned above are the result of 'Legend', but I don't think so.What is different about the novel is Matheson's treatment of the cause, turning it into a plague like organism that had been around for a long time and had suddenly gotten out of hand. What he didn't explain was how they all survived without blood. Or maybe he did and I missed it in one of the medico-jumble explanations. A couple of things were interesting like a cross only affects a christian, and that mirrors don't seem to matter. He seems to take an inordinate time among some very minor ideas.But I won't bore you, you can do that by reading the other stories. The additions are a hodge-podge, some good some bad. Reminds me of Vonneguts 'Welcome to the Monkey House'; throw in all the stuff you wrote for Ladies Home Journal and Readers Digest.You have to read these fifties books with an eye on what pre-TV writting was like.

If you are looking for the written equivilant of the movie you will be disappointed.

At times they felt like \\"filler\\" to make the book big enough."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I hate to go against the grain here but I found this book to be mediocre at best.It started out decent and I especially like the attitude of the main character, but the ending was a huge disappointment. I believe it could have had a much better ending in keeping with the general tone of the rest of the book.The last half of the book had me confused until I figured out that it had nothing to do with the first part. As I haven't read any other books by this author, I thought maybe my copy was a misprint.If I had it to do again, I wouldn't wast my money. My advice is to save the money on the book and if you just have to know the story, go see the movie."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"If you're looking for a book that will make you jump at odd noises you hear while reading it or make your mind wander to the shadows at night (is something there?)...this book will not do that (try reading Hell House by Masterson instead).However, it is an interesting read. The story kind of reminds me of the story premise of the comic book 'Blade', except that the main character is not half-vampire, but a vampire killer nonetheless.It's a short read and the ending is worth the hour or so read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Quite slow, with pretty much just one man left, all the book talks about is him. There is only so much to TELL."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I'm not kidding, I truly think these people are crazy. I've just seen review after review describing how scary and suspenseful this book is. What a joke! It reads like a documentary that doesn't really go anywhere. I thought the book was very interesting. And if you want to someday write a horror book, maybe this book can give you some ideas. But it's not suspenseful and, now don't all start screaming at once, it's kinda boring. Sorry. But you start it, you read it, and it's over. No real ups or downs. And the ending: I guess it was supposed to be a big deal, but all I could think was, &quot;Who cares?&quot;"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I must say that I went into this expecting it to be more like the movie but better. I didn't know it was basically a short story. This book short story whatever you would consider it was all over the place. It went from being a vampire survival story, to a medical/scientific discovery. The main character seems to be two totally different people as the story unfolds. once the climax comes and it seems you may finally get some really meat from this story it comes to an abrupt end. To me the script writers did an amazing for the movie taking what little the author have them and expanding it into a passable story. The movie wasn't amazing but was much more plausible than the random thoughts that were jotted down and called a book.

Having been a long time fan of the genre I know that you can't over think, but even the basic suppositions of this book had gapingholes in it. I personally need someone to root, for or at least identify with and from the beginning I didn't carewhether the main character lived or died. It was a complete waste of time but having invested in the book I completed the transaction but should not have thrown good time after bad money!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"All I heard about was what a great vampire book this was, and while it wasn't terrible and was certainly well written, it lacked the oomph that todays vampire novels have. If you want to read about vampires I recommend the the truely poetic and literary writings of Anne Rice her Vampire Chronicals series, it leaves this one in the dust. All the Lestat book are great, but skip, Pandora, Blood and Gold and Armand and pick up again with Merrick and Blackwood Farms the latter is in my opinion her best novel yet! Also, Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Baker Vampire hunter is a great series, although not as literary."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Though historical in its genre, \\"I Am Legend\\" suffers from contradictions and poor storytelling. It's actually not worth all the hype when compared to most horror stories written collectively over the century. Boring, repetitive, and very slow paced, the book is solely based on a single man, of whom is immuned to a \\"disease.\\" This character, Robert Neville, watches everyone he loves die of the \\"disease\\" (which is shown through several flashbacks). Robert Neville is very hard to relate to, and even harder to feel sympathy for. He basically spends his evening locked up in his house listening to records, drinking. Most of the time the character just sits there, in the verge of hope and hopelessness.It's also hard to understand why the \\"living\\" never killed him in the first place; they saved him for almost 3 years! They later send this woman to spy on him (I don't know why. I never really saw Neville as such a great threat, and even if he were, why did they keep him alive?) You tend to ask yourself that after you finish this book, because that's close to the ending, when he spots a woman.If you're thinking about reading it, read it because you want to, not because you're bored; it won't entertain you if you are bored. It will fascinate you; then the fascination just slowly tappers off, leaving the whole book with just bland writing."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book has nothing to do with vampires. To me, it's a tale spun around a man who has nothing to interact with other than a bottle of boze and Ottorino Repshigi recordings. This man knew 'lonesome'. And the ending was one of the most FABULOUS i've come across. Forgot King, or whomever else. Carrere, Kressing, and this man are horror."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"First off: I read this in one sitting. I couldn't stop. I started to fear that vampires were surrounding MY apartment.Filmed twice and cited by many horror authors as a quintessential classic, _I Am Legend_ deserves every bit of this acclaim. This apocalyptic science-fiction take on the vampire engrosses from the first page until the \`anti-horror' conclusion that overturns the customary expectations of the horror novel. (It is similar to Jack Williamson's _Darker Than You Think_, which I also recommend.)Nudging in over 50,000 words in length, this novel is a perfect example of economy of storytelling. In another author's hands, this might have bloated into a five hundred page epic about the world under a vampire reign, but it would have utterly lacked the focus and passion that Matheson gives it. Matheson wrings heartbreak from simple human sequences, such as Neville's pursuit and attempt to rescue a mangy dog. Matheson has the unnerving power to find the emotional core of every scene through protagonist Robert Neville's struggle; you feel his loneliness, his shifts of despair and hope.Can't emphasize it enough: this is a liteary masterpiece."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I first read this book in the 1950s, as a child. My dad, an avid SciFi reader, gave it to me. We both loved it. All this time I've kept the original paperback on my shelf. I grew up to be a professional writer myself, and just decided to re-read this for pleasure---and also to study his craft.Wow! He IS a master. The story, the pacing, the premise, the character (Robert Neville has to carry the entire narrative himself---it ain't easy to write a novel with one character in every scene, who can't talk to anyone but himself) are truly impressive. And the acid test: you can't stop reading it---even when you KNOW what happens.I think it was T.S. Eliot (or maybe not?) who said, \\"The most heinous crime a writer can commit is to be boring.\\" Knowing all the vocabulary, the plot point tricks, etc etc are useless unless you can compel readers to keep with your story. This is a great achievement of Matheson's, and it's a sort of magic.I didn't find it dated as some did---in fact it seemed eerily current, what with the terrorist/biological warfare threat back.Matheson, I'm in awe of your talent! Thanks for a great classic vampire tale...one that ....will live forever!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I liked this book but i listened to it on audio and it isn't very long. I think the story could have become broader and the story could have been longer. Also, i think there are segments of the story that were not totally explored, such as the vampire virus where it came from etc. Overall it was a good classic vampire story especially for the time it was written in , i believe it was copyrighted in 1954."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Matheson had written many great novels, but this has got to be one of his finest. True, I do wish that it was longer, he tells a complete, complex story with twist and turns like few out there. His attempt to blame vampirism on a virus was near brilliant, the story entertaining overall. By turning the tables, he shows what it is like from the other side of the mirror. I would recomend this book to anyone who has ever read Ann Rice and wants something better."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"What's particular interesting in this book is the way how vampires are represented. Richard Matheson found an interesting way to write a creative story involving classic figures, the vampires. If you think that this book will contain the same old way to write a vampire story, you are wrong!! The main character takes you into a desperate world, trying to survive at all costs.The book is completly involving and it's worth to give a look at it!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"What would you do, if a mysterious plague swept throughout the world, literally killing everyone off, but leaving in its place something new, something frightening, something downright horrible, while leaving you alive, immune and seemingly alone? What would you do, if the undead now walked the earth looking for you, the last man alive...the last vestige of the human race? What if what they wanted was the taste of your blood on their lips? Just what on earth would you do?These are the questions that faced Robert Neville. It is he who is Legend. How he answers them is what makes this a book to remember and a classic within its genre. It is a book of profound hope and despair. It is a book that demands to be read. Read it. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson is a new author for me until recently, and it was only after I'd read _I Am Legend_ that I found out he was responsible for _What Dreams May Come_ (though I must admit I've only seen the film).The title story in this collection is an eerie and fascinating exploration of our society after it is overcome by vampirism. The main character, Robert Neville, lives locked away in his fortress of a home by night, and kills vampires by day. He explores their affliction scientifically to determine the origins of the &quot;germ&quot; as he calls it. In fact, this is an interesting aspect of the story; vampirism as a simple bodily illness blown into the proportion of a legend._I Am Legend_ is a good read, and the ending, though abrupt, is worth it as Neville finally comes to understand his place in this new world ruled by gruesome enemies of humanity.The other stories in the volume are entirely forgettable, in my opinion. Most are enumerative horror at their core, and simply list all the horrible things that happen to someone because of African curses/cursed statuettes/witchcraft wielding teenage solider-girls/fiery temper/etc. The words sound right, but the stories suffer because of the bland laundry list of cuts, bruises, and lacerations that the characters endure.Again, read it for the title story; I was disappointed in the others."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A spell binding read of one man's life of sorrow and loneliness, the eternal outsider. One human in a world of vampires."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Unfortunately, I read all of the great reviews of Richard Matheson's book on Amazon.com and had certain expectations upon reading it. Needless to say, I found the book neither as scary nor as interesting a read as most reviewers thought. I believe the book must have been on the vanguard of horror back in the 50's when individuals were a little less sophisticated about manifestations of gore and vampires, but in today's society, it's little more than social commentary."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I ordered this book after hearing that Stephen King liked it. It was incredible. Neville is such a great character, and you really feel his pain. He is no longer a normal average guy. Now he's the outsider, the feared one. When he is in a tight situation, this book makes your heart race.When it is over, you feel like you know Neville personally.Read this great book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book was cool. It was just like a Night Of the Living Dead type movie but with vampires. the only thing i disliked about it were the short stories at the end. those i did not read but the novel itself was sweet!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I love this book. Forget all versions of the films, including the upcoming one, this blows all of them out of the water. From beginning to end, Matheson hooks us into Nevilles world and we can't put the book down afterwords. The ending is still my favorite of all horror books."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson has written a timeless classic of the horror genre, one that deserves a place next to Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; and Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. If you liked this book, you may want to check out his take on the psychological thriller, entitiled &quot;Seven Steps to Midnight&quot;."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is not only one of the best modern horror novels, but one of the essential books of this century. It captures well the alienation and horror of conformity that characterizes much modern literature. I think this book would appeal to readers of Kafka and Camus as well as to readers of Stephen King. When it comes to good books, genres are irrelevant. This is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"After seeing &quot;The Omega Man&quot; on AMC I decided to buy the book. It was a thousand times better. The novel is an important work showing what it is like to all of a sudden become the outcast in society. The main character goes from being a average man to being a legendary evil in a new world. Guarenteed to make you think."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"For those of us who love the tradition of horror writing, this is a novel not to be missed. The book was unfortunately out of print for about 20 years and I was only able to find and old used copy of it. I am glade to see it has been revived! Although written in the fifties, its bizarre blend of horror and science fiction,gives this book a universal quality that has stood the test of time. I would highly recommended it to readers."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Picture this: a weird, half-crazed lonesome guy spends most of his time killing as much members of a society as he can in the most gruesome manner. He moves swiftly, mercilessly, doing his job at a time when his victims are most vulnerable. He's considered an aberration, the only one of his kind in the world, living alone in a kind of fortress. He's rightly considered by this society as an evil monstruosity that must be exterminated at all costs.Well, if my description of this creature could very well fit Count Dracula, it's no coincidence, but I'm talking about Robert Neville, the tormented hero of &quot;I Am Legend &quot;. Neville is the only human being left in a world inhabited by vampires, and the beauty of Matheson's book resides in this reversion of roles. The monstruosity here isn't the vampire, but the human, now turned into a predator to this society of vampires. How does he feel, this lonely human? How does he come to terms with the ethical and moral problems of killing these intelligent creatures ? What is being human?What is being normal?? Those are some of the questions put foward by Matheson in this wonderful book, in wich he recreates a powerful myth for the modern times, giving new form to the Outsider. Be prepared: the Outsider in this one is all of us..."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"My aunt, who loves horror, gave this book to me when I was only 14. The book effected me in unexpected ways. First, it was the sole reason reading become a serious occupation in my spare time (which kept me out of trouble in my adolescence); second, it's the only book I've read more than twice (I've read it 15 times since I was 14). However, I did become depressed when I AM LEGEND was rumored to be out of print. I'm ecstatic to learn that's not the case! To those who have never read this book, you have only my pity."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Great story about loneliness (and vampires).

It is a very interesting story and I was intrigued by the day to day events the protagonist goes through and the effect the plague has on his sanity. The storytelling is not chronological and jumps right into things, with the protagonist recalling how the plague started and events that happened before it became full blown.The story is amazing and I was very intrigued at how Mattheson can make simple day to day chores interesting. It's an amazing concept and doesn't seem dated at all, even though the story was written over 50 years ago (it takes place in the \\"future\\" of 1970).My main problem with this book was that it ended halfway through. Apparently it's a collection of short stories, and \\"I Am Legend\\" only takes up about 170 pages. I read about half of the other stories and they are okay, but nothing too good and I lost interest quickly. Some are a few pages and some are several chapters. I got bored with them quickly and they're pretty much your typical science fiction from the 50s, although some were written later. I do think the \\"I Am Legend\\" story alone is worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I bought this book because I heard that it inspired George Romero to create Night of the Living Dead. The main story is amazing. The only thing I didn't realize is that half-way through it turns into short stories. 'I Am Legend' is just one of about a dozen short stories - it being the longest. I would read a whole series on the main concept though. First rate."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"All you have to do is check the quotes from guys like Stephen King and Dean Koontz to see how important this was to writers and the horror genre in regards to popular modern fiction but also George Romero has said that after reading I AM LEGEND he sat down and compulsively wrote the original treatment for NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, so it could be argued that I AM LEGEND is perhaps the most influential novel of its type written in the 2nd half of the 20th century; it is easy to underestimate the lasting influence it has had on not only horror fiction but cinema and pop culture in general. Think about it: every zombie movie ever made after Romero's owes something to him and therefore something to I AM LEGEND. This is just begging to be adapted for the screen again; this time maybe doing it right; the first version starring Vincent Price is surprisingly faithful to the book but under-budgeted and limply shot and performed (it kills me to say that, but Vincent price seems bored and half-hearted in his performace and the movie drags) and THE OMEGA MAN really had nothing to do with I AM LEGEND. I was thrilled when, a few years back, it was rumored to be in the works with Ridley Scott directing but in almost the same breathe it was announced that first ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (please, no!) and then Will Smith (again, please no!) were \\"attached\\" and my hopes were dashed as that surely would have led to another misfire like The Omega Man. To me this book has always seemed to be more about the psychological effects of lonliness and isolation than it is about pitched battles between Robert Neville and hordes of bloodsucking freaks. Perhaps Danny Boyle is the only artist currently working in the Cinema who has the right sense of story and style to do this one justice, judging from \\"28 Days later.\\""},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I am a huge horror fiction fan and lately I've been widening my collection to include older books (I usually read King, Laymon, Little, Lee, etc). So I picked up I am Legend b/c I've heard it is a classic vampire book. I can tell you I am not disapointed, this book was excellent and easy to read. I found it so interesting and fast paced I finished it in one day. The book is about Robert Neville, a man who had survived an epidemic that has turned everyone into vampires. He has barricaded himself in his house, venturing out in the daytime to get supplies and hunt vampires. The story is compelling as he struggles with his solitude and tries to figure out why people have changed and if there is a cure. This is a classic vampire novel and has earned a permenant place on my bookshelf!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is one of my all-time favorites.My only critique is that he sacrifices description for action. The audience has to realy on its imagination to fill the visual cues. Of course, that is also Matheson's greatest strength. We are not bogged down with overly picturesque descriptions that distract from the dialogue and action.It revolves around Robert Neville, the last man alive on Earth. Everyone else has succumbed to a strange virus that has turned all others into vampires. Now he works tirelessly to solve the riddle to save himself--and perhaps others.I have met some people who were put off by Nelville's obssessiveness on researching the virus strain. I disagreed, thinking it was the one thing that kept him from going insane from his isolation. It is his only outlet.Matheson deftly articulates his craft, able to give the reader just as much angst, despair, desperation, and disappointment as Neville. He does find other humans and they lead him to new highs and lows in life.Next to Dracula, this is the best Vampire Novel of all time. And Matheson proves why he is one of the best writers of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is an icon for horror and suspense. I think the novel I AM LEGEND is something every aspiring writer should read despite their genre perference. I just wish we had more quality stories like this today. We have novels that contain hundreds of pages that do not say as much as this work does. WOW! Read it!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"First off, I have to say I agree, to a certain extent, with the reviewer who gave this book only two stars. He raises some interesting points, some of which do indeed present valid issues regarding the content. That said, I must next admit to being a R. Matheson fan of the highest degree. He has a way with time and place that melds together even inconclusive facts in a way that becomes totally believable, even irrevant to the whole story. Let's face it, the man makes time travel a romance and horror a comment on society. I adore his work, all of it, this book is no exception. I found the short stories following IAL to be just as entertaining, perhaps even more so... I do love well written horror! It is amazing, and emmense praise that so many horror movies have been generated from Matheson's I Am Legend. I just saw 28 Days Later over the weekend... a movie which doesn't apologize for it's resemblence... any \\"zombie\\" and/or vampire movie from the past four decades tips it's hat to Matheson... and it's this type of response that speaks loudest for this story. Immitation is the highest form of praise and for Matheson, rightly so."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"upside: i usually dont go for the supernatural/horror genre, but this book hooked me. i was studying at borders and someone left this book at the table i was sitting at. read the back cover and the rest is history. im a sucker for these &quot;survival&quot; stories, man vs _________________. in this case, its vampires and matheson breaks it down to a science.downside: theres a collection of short stories written by matheson that disappoints following the conclusion of this book. after enjoying &quot;i am legend&quot; so much, it was such a letdown.highly recommended to all."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I have to confess right away, I have yet to read the other stories in this edition of Matheson's classic. I rushed to finish I AM LEGEND to review it Fri the 13th:). The plot of the title story is deceptively simple. Robert Neville is the last human in a plague struck earth. The rest of the population have become vampires.Matheson writes an incredibly exciting and compelling tale of vampirism. The action is continous throughout the short novel, and he offers alternative theories to the mythology. I still lay awake 48 hours after finishing it that is testament to how spooky the atmosphere permeating this story is, and I am a jaded horror reader. There is little gore in Matheson's horror, but great suspense/paranoia and a chilling climate compelling readers' to turn pages at furious page until the superb ending.This novel is a must read for fans of the Vampire sub-genre horror fiction."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"First, the writing is great. Matheson writes clearly and lucidly, delivering stories that come across with almost brutal effect. Most of the stories were written in the \\"golden age\\" of early sci-fi, and the tenor of the words shows that, but they still impact over the span of time.But the sheer pessimism of the writer made this a tough read. The depressing look at human nature, the inevitability of a bad end; all of that made this a collection that I would not want to read again. And I don't think I'll be looking for any of his other (copious) works. There's only so much misery, even when (or, perhapse because it's) presented so well, I want to take."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I purchased this book on sale...Thank God! I have plans to see \\"I Am Legend\\" once released on DVD. I decided to read the book before the movie (I enjoy seeing the differences between the book and movie). Half way through the book , the outcome for the main character became evident, and it was a logical conclusion. The book continued on, and so did I. I hoped that there would be some logical explanation for what followed. I tried to force my own explanation into the book to make sense of it all. It just never happened. I gave this book three stars because the beginning of the book is quite good. The second half, however, is horrible."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Stephen King calls it one of his influences, and critics have labeled \\"I Am Legend\\" as one of the top-ten all-time vampire novels. With the recent interest stirred by the movie, I gave in and decided to give the book a shot--with favorable, though mixed, reactions.The story is masterfully told. Set in Los Angeles, as opposed to the film's New York City, the first-person narrative is at times claustrophobic, lucid, surreal, and achingly human in the midst of tragedy. Robert Neville is a brilliant creation, a perfect vessel for Matheson's exploration of traditional vampire myths in a world of reason and science. Even as Neville tries to survive after the loss of his wife and daughter, he finds himself committed to finding a solution, a cure if you will.I read the entire story in one sitting, with a page count of under 170 pages. The pacing is perfect. The character development is credible and insightful. The muted comments on society are thought-provoking. Matheson's prose is tight and full of active verbs that make this stripped-down story surprisingly vivid. In conclusion, he adds a touch of bittersweet irony found more often in the tales of Ray Bradbury than vampire novelists.While the story is masterful, it did not move me emotionally or intellectually. It seems a bit distant, supremely logical, even cold, in comparison to the newer breed of vampire novels that sometimes wink and nod while giving us chills. Nevertheless, \\"I Am Legend\\" deserves the praise and attention it has received. In its time, it was clearly a landmark in the evolution of the genre."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"the first story was good.. I did not know it was a book of short stories.

Cashing in on the impending film?"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I can see why certain elements of the sci-fi community love this novel, but it is overrated. It was worth the hour it took me to read it, but one of the best sci-fi works of all time?? Hardly.The story starts out great. Matheson does an excellent job of portraying Neville's total isolation and lonliness. The internal dialogue of Neville as he goes about his daily routine is superb. The flashbacks, especially where Neville's wife returns to life, are as chilling as anything you will read in a Stephen King work.The story goes south after Neville encounters the band of plague-resistant humans. Suffice it to say, it is patently absurd that a man who took such great pains to maintain his life and sanity for so long, would so abruptly commit the ultimate act of cowardice. Not only is it against human nature, it defies Neville's characterization up to that point.Matheson very cleverly uses the character of Neville, who is not a believer, to advance the view that religion is nothing more than a subset of culture. Obviously, this sort of \\"soft-atheism\\" is a common theme in sci-fi: attack religion indirectly through ridicule, or create a future world where religion has disappeared and is irrelevant. (Funny, that future is always arriving but never seems to get here!) The idea that vampirism is real, but not supernatural, is not new. As an argument against belief in God, it is rather weak. Nevertheless, the concept of mass hysteria caused by a combination of ancient supersticion and yellow journalism is intriguing. I think the character of Neville could have explored it with more credibility had Matheson written him as a believer."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am Legend will encapsulate you in a horrifying shiver. The exploits of Neville are both thrilling and daunting as he attempts to survive the voracious appetite of the living dead. This book was recommended to me and I do not regret buying it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am Legend became the basis for two so-so movies during the 60's and 70's. If you've seen either movie (\\"The Last Man on Earth\\" featuring Vincent Price and \\"The Omega Man\\" with Charleton Heston), you'll get a taste of the theme without the full flavor of this marvelous novel's full meal.A plague has been released on mankind. Everyone has turned into Vampires except for Robert Neville.In a very clever inversion of Dracula, the last remaining human becomes the monster in their eyes as all of humanity has changed except him. He's not just an outsider but a crusading outsider --the Van Helsing of the book--bent on destroying these mutant creatures.Matheson's novel isn't just about horror but about character. His best work has always concentrated on the humanity of his characters and trying to create a convincing world where they just don't fit anymore (The Shrinking Man is another fine example of this theme). Skillfully written, I Am Legend doesn't feature blood splattering or gore at the turn of every page (this was written in the 50's folks) but concentrates on character, mood and suspense as it does on the horror that drives the story.I have to agree with Dean Koontz and Stephen King about Matheson--he set the standard for the modern horror story with his thoughtful, carefully plotted stories and glimpse into these isolated characters. Like fellow writers Rod Serling, Charles Beaumont and William F. Nolan, Matheson's stories turn as much on the creepiness of the situation and core idea as they do on the convincing characters he creates. He doesn't rely on cheap tricks nor on a bloody rampage to keep you turning the pages. If you're the type of person who always has to investigate a place where there's a prominent \\"Keep Out\\" sign (or did so as a kid)or did something precisely because the other kids wouldn't do it, you'll appreciate Matheson's complex character driven horror and science fiction stories. I'd also recommend A Stir of Echoes (adapted into the criminally underrated but quite different film of the same name)."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"My book is entitled &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, it is written by Richard Matheson. The thing that caught my eye about the book was that Richard Matheson inspired Stephen King to start writing, also the fact that the book was about vampires. &quot;I Am Legend&quot; is about every human on Earth turning into vampires except one man, Robert Neville. Robert is trying to keep himself alive while all these vampires are thirsty for his sweet fresh blood. Robert tries to find if the so called &quot;vampire&quot; is a virus or not, and tries to find a cure for them. Robert Neville is a hunter in the day and when night falls he traps himself in his room. &quot;I Am Legend&quot; is an excellent book, I recommend this book to everyone and anyone. It is an exciting book that keeps you reading and reading. Richard Matheson wrote the book in a way that I could picture everything that was going on. The dialogue was also believable. I could see people talking the way they did in the book. Remember the book is entitled &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, pick it up and read it you'll like it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Although I did enjoy this novel, I dont understand how it is even comparable to Stephen King horror books. Yes this book was exciting yet I dont think it had the true horror that exists in most of King's novels. I must say though, I truly enjoyed the last chapter very much. It made a lot of great, horrifying points about humanity in general. There were also a couple of other short stories by Matheson in this book. I did not feel any of them were up to the same caliber as &quot;I am Legend.&quot; &quot;Prey&quot; and &quot;Mad House&quot; were somewhat unique yet overall short stories do not appear to be Matheson's forte. Overall this book was unique in its plot and an enjoyable read"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book wasn't bad. These particular vampires/zombies weren't all that interesting but I did like it. I am legend wasn't scary or fast paced and I felt it could have been longer. I was a bit confused on the new society and 'people' but Matheson was a good writer overall. Haven't seen the movie yet..."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am Legend - In this most popular collection of shorts, the novella 'I Am Legend' has turned out to be a timeless piece of horror. Originally written in 1954, it takes place in the future of 1976. Robert Neville finds himself alone as a human in a sea of vampiristic creatures who once were human beings. After losing his wife and daughter to the \\"sickness\\", he turns his house into a fortress and spends his time drinking heavily and studying blood and bacterium. He discovers the \\"vampires\\" are actually victims of a bacterium, and begins to frequently experiment on cures and repellents as he hunts out the living dead during the day. Some are truly dead, but others, though only coming out at night, still breathe in their hidden cubbies. Neville kills them all; after all, they're ALL the enemy, gathering on his lawn night after night, wanting in. When Neville finally does meet a woman (Ruth) in daylight, he discovers he has become too much of a loner, leaving him very suspicious of Ruth. After she leaves, following an 'altercation' I won't explain, she gives him a warning. But is it too late for Neville to hear her message? In the end, Robert truly is a legend.'I Am Legend' is a classic novella of terror, isolation, and the human condition. You can't help but think of a herd animal segregated from it's herd, and how much anxiety and behavioral changes that animal would make. It's been used for three movies; 1964's 'The Last Man On Earth', 1971's 'The Omega Man' (starring Charlton Heston), and 2007's 'I Am Legend' (starring Will Smith). The book, however, is a collection of shorts that are all good. Here's a quick summary of the other stories in the book:Buried Talents - An odd man wins a carnival game.The Near Departed - Very short story of funeral arrangementsPrey - A strange little doll comes to lifeWitch War - Seven pretty little girls win a military battleDance Of The Dead - An innocent girl gets corrupted by wild friends who take her to a bar where the \\"Loopy's\\" danceDress Of White Silk - Strange but flat tale of a young girl and her dead mother's white silk dress.Mad House - An angry man with a volcanic temper passes along his rage into the very fiber of his houseThe Funeral - A Vampire funeral starts a fadFrom Shadowed Places - An ancient African ritual must be performed to save a man's lifePerson To Person - A man receives phone calls inside his head, but who are they coming from?The novella 'I Am Legend' is a must-read horror classic. The other stories included in the book were written between 1952 through 1987. Matheson was an artist of horror and science fiction writing, a master at his craft. If this is the first Matheson book you pick up, you'll be hooked and want to try out his novel length books, all of which are timeless regardless of the era he wrote them in. Definitely worth a purchase. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Wanted to read this and see how it compared to the movies. Really this is the I am Legend tale and then a collection of the author's other works as well, which I have yet to read.Overall, it was a little too much 60's theory that man is controlled by his urges not his mind for my taste but it was nice to see the payoff at the end to understand what the author really wanted the title to be."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A few months ago I watched the fairly entertaining movie, however hadn't considered reading the book until a friend highly recommended it. What I found was a profoundly dark, dreary, and at time sadistic horror story that I believe ranks amongst the greatest ever written. If you weren't a fan of the all-too-typical Hollywood ending found in the book, you shouldn't pass up the original story's disturbing alternative!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Classic vampire/zombie/end of civilization book. Matheson influenced many of today's horror authors. A simply outstanding story and fun to read. I recommend you add this to your collection."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I received my new copy of this book quickly and at a good price. Thank you"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"If you have never read this book you are missing out! It's well-written, intelligent, and will grab you until the end. Definitely worth buying for your own library!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Great content, the story is fantastic, but short. Don't spend a lot of money on the book because you will have finished reading it in a couple of days! Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"I am legend\\" is only about 150 pages or so (I guess not quite long enought to be a book on its own). Some of the stories are a bit short and unusual, some I recognized as episodes of \\"Tales from the Crypt\\" or other TV shows. Overall a good read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson has crafted a clever (relatively) modern-day tale of the undead. I have not yet seen the recent DVD movie which was based on the book, but I suspect there are many dissimilarities.Caveat for those picking up the paperback version -- be aware that much of the book consists of unrelated short stones by Matheson. This is not made clear to readers or buyers of the book up front, which can be confusing when you transition from \\"I Am Legend\\" to \\"Buried Talents.\\""},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Now, I love Will Smith as much as the next gal, but this book was soooo better! It made me cry a few times and the ending was unexpected. It's still relevant today even though it was wrote in the 70s. Definitely a good read if you like sci-fi/disaster/zombie type stuff."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Saw the movie and always wanted to read the book.When I saw it was only $1.99 on the deal of the day I jumped at the chance to buy it.I just finished reading it today.Very satisfied."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Great story. Much better than the movie.Kindle edition is okay. I didn't see anything that called attention to itself like poor formatting or anything like that."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Robert Neville blockades himself in his home every night to ward off the hordes of vampires that have overtaken the world. By day, he slays the undead in their sleep and researches their affliction, never suspecting what he himself is turning into.Richard Matheson's seminal horror/SF novel is a terse, gripping tale of loneliness and a meditation on what it means to be human and what it means to be a monster. There is plenty of vampire action, but what really touched me was Matheson's depiction of Neville's reaction to solitude: his drinking, his melancholy reminiscences of his wife and daughter, his battle against despair, his heartbreaking attempt to befriend a dog, and the redemptive power in simply being seen and recognized by a sympathetic soul."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A classic horror novel. I borrowed this book and I am very happy I read it. It is a dark, edgy and gripping story of a man left 'alone' in a world inhabited by zombies who want to kill him. Great depth of charter and a fast paced story makes this book hard to put down."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Obviously, the main story is why most folks buy the book, but I highly recommend that you give the other shorter stories a try also. I guarantee that they will stick with you. The fetish doll story is a classic and my personal favorite was 'Witch War', a three page story that still haunts me! Oh yes, 'I am Legend' is a great story, but don't forget the rest of the book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Although this book has vampires in it, its really about how the human spirit can endure and the physical body can keep going even when it seems pointless. I found it to be inspiring, even though it truly paints a desolate picture of the \\"future\\" (the book takes place in 1976, but was written in the 50's). I think this book must have played a key role in the development of Justin Cronin's \\"The Passage\\", in fact I found the similarities striking; so if you enjoyed \\"The Passage\\" and are looking forward to Cronin's next book \\"The Twelve\\", you will like this. It is a quick read, and well worth the time!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am legend is a classic science fiction/horror novel written in 1954 by Richard Matheson. It is a story written in a post-apocalyptic setting. The hero is what appears to be a lone survivor of the disaster and is having to deal with the results thereof. I have read that this book has served as inspiration to many of the zombie books and movies from just after it was written through the modern era. While I'm sure that many will have seen the Will Smith movie version of this book, please do not expect the book to be precisely like the movie.I was torn as how to rate this book. From a classical perspective I would rate it a five, but when I compare it books that I have really enjoyed from the modern era I would rate it a three. Neither is fair so I have compromised and given it a four. It is a definite read if you are into reading the classics. I would highly recommend to anyone who is into the science fiction/horror genres.I was always puzzled by the title of this book. However, on the last page it becomes crystal clear.Happy reading to all!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Ok, I actually liked all of the movies (I Am Legend [Blu-ray],The Last Man on Earth, andThe Omega Man) that were based on this classic story, but none of them really do full justice to the book.No plot spoilers from me: the story centers on Robert Neville, perhaps the last \\"normal\\" man alive. Neville faces nightly torment from a horde of \\"vampires\\" and spends his days gathering supplies and hunting down the vampires when he can find them. This not an action centric tale, but rather a somewhat deeper look into the mind of a man driven by loneliness and torment, but still holding on to a glimmer of hope for the future.Matheson does great a job setting the tone and moving the story along in a surprisingly succinct and \\"mater of fact\\" way, making this a fairly short, but very enjoyable read. This still holds up nicely after all these years!Highly Recommended!CFHNote: that title quote was borrowed from a friend, I only wish I was that clever!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"If you are a fan of the vampire genre, read on. If you enjoy scifi, read on. If you are post-apocalyptic stories like Cormac McCarthy's The Road, read on. This book is so broadly appealing it almost defies genre. I found myself enjoying the occassional prose, the action, the thought-provoking nature of the book and many other features.As others noted, this book holds up well so many years later. Not much seems dated or stylistically out of place.Some of the images in the book were almost heart-breakingly haunting; the smoke column from the mass-burial pyre for example. Using multiple angles such as the former commuting buddy and of course the main character's wife, Matheson certainly made a play for our emotions.I found this book recommended in a list of post-apocalyptic fiction including Earth Abides, The Postman, Lucifer's Hammer and others. While The Postman was good, I am Legend was easily the best of the bunch. Only The Road is an equal."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I have only seen the Will Smith movie that is lightly based on this book. The movi was just okay. This book however is a great read and show what the man Robert Neville struggles with as he deals with loneliness, loss, and the struggle to find out what he is dealing with. This very apocalyptic thriller is a great read and it is hard to believe it was written in the 1950's. You can tell this is a great precursor to the spike in vampire and zombie novels that are the big craze today. This novel stands out though in comparison to them and is very interesting."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Like many I saw the hollywood movie first before I even knew about the novel. As a an avid reader I know that the novel is often much better than the movie version. That was certainly the case with I Am Legend! I think that the movie would have been ten times better if they had not have strayed from the original premise of the novel. My only complaint was that the novel was so short."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"When I ordered this, I wasn't sure what the contents would be, since the reviews only referenced I am Legend and the book is only 301 pages. I consequently purchased Hell House separately and now I have it twice. My review is primarily to help others who may be interested in more than just I am Legend. As horror literature goes, both of these titles are essential reading. They are classics. The included stories are also very good. I respect the author very much. If you like Hell House and haven't already done so, read Shirley Jackson's \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\"."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Unfortunately, I did not know there was even a short story called I Am Legend before I saw the movie. I thought the movie was so-so, but now that I have read Matheson's awesome story, I hate the movie for not staying true to the book and missing the mark. Shame on you, Hollywood. This story is intense, gripping, and unique. The main character, Robert Neville, is a likable character who I became invested in quickly. My only semi-complaint is that the scientific talk went over my head, but I didn't feel like it made me appreciate the story less. I love Matheson's take on the vampires and the imagine of \\"Neville, come out!\\" was absolutely haunting. It had good twists and I loved the ending. It seems like in today's society every vampire story(or scary movie)is pretty much all the same. Originality is hard to come by these days. It's interesting that a story written in the 50's is more fresh and solid that anything I've read (or seen) in quite awhile. Bravo Matheson!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Cheap book and a quick read. The story is quite different from the movie, and I think I like the book better. I'm a science nerd, and I love how they talk about a potential scientific mechanism for the transformation of the human race (trying hard not to give away any spoilers). There are some more short stories at the end I haven't checked out yet, but I\\"m sure they will be great."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is a fantastic novel. It manages to mix vampire and post apocalyptic themes into one novel. It is such a good read I found myself reading and reading until it was finished in one sitting. It is a little on the short side, but every page is perfectly crafted. It was so good it left me wanting more, which is an indication of just how good it is. If you like your sci-fi and horror books, then this is a must have for your collection.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"loved the book hated the movie, as alot of you have said. but if you want a good book try this one"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I decided to read the book after an online acquaintance told me about it. It's a really excellent read, with biology added in for effect. The reader follows the Robert Neville's psychological torment from being the last human alive. The book cannot be put down until the final scene. And even then the final scene must be read twice. The effect is that good. And it's nice to read a story about vampires that's not a pretty, rainbow and butterflies love story ;)"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"My opinion of this book changed quite a bit while I read through it. Unlike what the title suggests, this isn't just the \\"I Am Legend\\" novella (which is 159 pages long), but rather it is a short story collection, containing 11 stories of various lengths. Some were very good, but some were not.The titular story was very good. We follow the main character, who believes he is the last human alive in a world populated by vampires. I was a little confused as to what the differences between the two \\"monster races\\" were (vampires and living creatures infected by the vampire virus, but not dead). It's a key plot point, but it was never clear in my head how each came about. The story also hits the science stuff pretty hard at some points, but overall it was a fascinating quick read.I liked the short story \\"Prey\\" quite a lot. Stephen King's quote from the back cover is \\"Books like I Am Legend were an inspiration to me.\\" That inspiration is very clear here, as this story feels like a precursor to King's short story Battleground (from the Night Shift collection). In King's story it is a collection of Army men that come alive, but for Matheson, it is a doll. In both, the human has to fight a deadly little creature that is trying to kill them. I loved it.\\"Mad House\\" is another story that I enjoyed quite a bit. To reference King again, I was reminded of the Shining a lot (in that book, the main character has plenty of rage issues to deal with).Some of the stories towards the end were good as well. I personally didn't care for the \\"Dance of the Dead,\\" \\"Witch War,\\" and \\"Dress of White Silk\\" stories, which unfortunately are lumped together in the middle of the book. My opinion of the book overall started to drop during that section, but picked up with the last 4 stories that finish up the book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I am Legend is an amazing short novel. I listened to the audio book and I felt like I was in the book. This book is a classic and there is a reason so many movies have been made based on the book itself."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Here is the story of Mr. Robert Neville, the sole witness and only survivor of the end of the world. One good day, people started to rise from the grave and turn into vampires. Our main character isolates himself in his house with everything he needs to survive.By night he stays in, tormented by the screams and memories of his past life, by day he hunts the devils. Kill them in their sleep.Richard Matheson left his mark in the vampire genre with \\"I Am Legend\\", its one of the best vampires novels ever.It leaves you with a hollow feeling in the chest (the same feeling I got when I saw almost 25 years ago the original Planet of the Apes).The way he describes the solitude of Robert Neville, his desperation it's just incredible. The fact that a new species (vampires) had organized and now rules the earth it's just the final touch of desperation to the trama. Robert Neville is the last man on earth, the outcast, the intruder. He is the new and last monster to be destroyed.I Am Legend it's a must in your book collection."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I just finished reading this book and was completely blown away by Matheson's gripping story of a man living in a post-apocalyptic vampire-infested world. I'm almost afraid to see the movie now, because I generally feel that the book is better than the movie. This is probably one of the best novels I've ever read.As an aside, a few of his short stories were published with this novel and I found one of them, \\"Prey,\\" to be the basis for the 1975 television horror movie, \\"Trilogy of Terror\\" which gave me nightmares for a month."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Just like many end of times tales, this book is the survival of one man alone in the world. However, what makes this book stand out from the others is the inner monologue of the character. Seeing how Robert Neville's psychological well being changed throughout the book was interesting-one chapter he would have it all together, the next he was crushing a glass in his hand out of frustration.I also appreciated the fact he was a man of regular intelligence in the book. He didn't know what he was doing when it came to the experiments and all the knowledge he gained took a lot of painstaking work.The ironic twist at the end where Neville ends up being more feared than he was at those he was hunting was also great, this is one aspect of the book that the movie really should have incorporated."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I had seen the recent movie adaption to this book and I must say, I love both just the way they are. The book made the movie a lot clearer in ways for me, actually trying to put science behind exactly what the monsters were. This book is extremely well written for the time it came from, and the imagination is boundless. I love monster stories and this one is not one to pass up!This book, however, comes with more than just I Am Legend. It also comes with assorted stories from Richard Matheson. Although his other stories aren't quite as long as I Am Legend, they follow a similar style and are definitely worth reading once you're done with the book itself. All in all this is an extremely great buy. I love it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"I Am Legend\\" contains mostly short stories, where the book's first half is one story titled by the novel's namesake. The remaining creepy stories cover various characters, whether a younger or older male or female, and places each person in a disturbing situation. The finely crafted plots capture the morbid struggles against a range of supernatural forces.Since the story \\"I Am Legend\\" composes the largest amount of the book, it receives the greatest attention. It is about the supposedly last member of the human race, 36 year old Robert Neville. Daily he fights vampires and his own depression while trying to survive the deadly nights. The author brilliantly explains vampirism from a scientific perspective and additionally provides a shocking conclusion. The other stories while shorter are just as effectively engaging.As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.I highly recommend this novel to any fan of the horror genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I loved this book. Probably a little better than the movie. And I loved the movie. However both are one in the same. I wish they would have made the movie to match the book. But that's another review.Do NOT buy the cd version of this book. I borrowed it from the library and had major skipping issues. I thought I'd buy the book because the first disc kept my interest. I had skipping issues with all 5 discs. I returned the first audio book and had more skipping issues with the next audio book. Luckily, if any of you have one of those things called a cassette player, circa 1963. Blackstone audio has a cassette version available and you are surely not to have any skipping issues.Robertson Dean reads this book with so much intensity that I find myself listening to the book over and over again. Pretty soon I'll be able to recite it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This novel has stood the test of time. Not only has it been adapted into a movie more than once, but its dark view of the future is still fresh and thought-provoking, even decades after the book was first published.Offering elements of suspense, science and the human condition, this is a very engaging novel. I recommend this book for a wide audience...even readers (or listeners) who might not have a strong interest in science fiction-oriented books.An excellent novel."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This novel is up there with Stoker, and in many ways surpasses his classic work. Neville's character is far too believable, the plot unfolds with the character, and together the whole is more than any mere vampire tale -- it is a tale of what makes us human and what it means to survive.Note: Has little if anything to do with the movie by the same name."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Don't be fooled by the cover. A short story in this book inspired the movie with Will Smith, but it is NOT the same story as the movie. The movie changed the story a lot. Both are very good. There are many other short stories in this book as well."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This story was excellent! I thought the author did a fine job of capturing the thoughts and feelings of the last human on Earth. Robert Neville is a believable guy - he mumbles to himself, procrastinates, and drinks heavily so he doesn't have to face the horrors around him. He shows a wide range of emotions, changing from his very sensitive nature in the time before the plague to the hard and bitter person he's become. I especially liked how he'd continue to form attachments to things that would kill him just to stay sane. Since Neville is the only real character in the novel, Matheson has to capture him just right. I think he succeeded.Also, I loved Matheson's treatment of the vampire legends. His scientific approach was a great idea done well. These were probably the most interesting parts of the book. But by far my favorite parts were those where Neville was dealing with the living, and he shed his cold exterior to show some real depth. This was all brilliantly written and quite emotional.If I had to make a complaint, I'd say that the details of Neville being attracted to the vampire women was over the top, but fortunately that tapered off within the first third of the book.The ending was, of course, very solid. In fact I appreciated the entire pacing and organization of the book. It was gripping and read quickly and easily.My copy is actually half I Am Legend and half other short stories, though this isn't marked and confused me greatly when I reached the ending. Reading the rest of the short stories here, I see that Matheson is actually a horror writer, and was taking a step out of his element to write this book. It's quite an accomplishment. (Incidentally I have not read horror stories before, but I was somewhat creeped out by these, so I guess that's something...)A final comment: after reading the book I still have no problems with the different story presented in the movie. Many people complain about the changed ending, but really the movie changed quite a bit about the book, to the point where the only things in common are the title and the fact that the main character is a lone survivor. They clearly set out with different messages in mind, and developed the story in their own logical ways. Just as putting the movie ending on the book would make no sense, so would trying to use the book ending with the movie. I enjoyed them both equally, but in different ways."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"One of the best, if not, the best book I have ever read. I will say I haven't read the great classics like &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; but this is still a really great book. It is so compelling."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I found this book on Amazon after I read that it was the inspiration for the Movie 'Omega Man' with Charlton Heston, which is one of my favorite flicks. I was summarily impressed to find out he is a favorite author of the greats like King and Koontz. I was not disappointed by it at all. It had a very thorough, yet concise writing style that is lacking in a lot of today's horror writers (Anne Rice comes to mind) and I couldn't put it down. If you want to see where it all started, here you go."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Using words like &quot;stereotypical&quot; to describe this book is NONSENSE. Obviously those comments are from persons who don't know the literary - or film - history and chronology of the genre. Matheson's book was THE FIRST of its type! This is a horror classic, and now .... &quot;The Legend of Hell House&quot; has also just been issued by Tor Paperbacks. The film of this was even closer to the novel than &quot;Legend&quot; was. Richard Matheson wrote some things that were better than some of his other things, but that's just relative - these books don't contain anything less than very good. One of the finest of horror writers - period. It's a real shame that the majority of the youth generation are so shallow and/or uneducated that they haven't got the good taste to recognize this."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is the only vampire novel I've found that brings the myth into the modern world, not only through science-fiction science, but with the modern state of politics and society. As such, it is viscerally terrifying, not distanced and picturesque like current books still stuck in the 19th century (time and place or attitude). The suspense does wane at the end, but this is a satisfying book to read and re-read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson is one of those writers that many of us have never heard of but who has had a huge influence on a generation of very successful writers. Stephen King, Dean Koontz, and others have all acknowledged their debt to Matheson with no less than Ray Bradbury calling him \\"One of the most important writers of the twentieth century.\\"\\"I Am Legend\\" is set in Los Angeles and told from the viewpoint of Robert Neville, the apparent sole survivor of a worldwide plague. But the plague does not kill; instead, it transforms its victims into creatures with all of the characteristics of vampires: an aversion to sunlight and garlic, a lust for drinking blood, and a fear of religious symbols and mirrors.Because of a unique experience in his past, Neville has developed an immunity to the bacteria and survives the plague. His life soon deteriorates into a struggle for survival as groups of vampires hunt him, seeking to drink his blood.Neville turns his house into a fortress, stocked with a generator, canned food and bottled water. During the day, he roams the city, finding and killing vampires in their sleep. At night, he locks himself inside while vampires, some of whom were his neighbors and friends, circle his house, calling his name. There's something really creepy about the scenes where Neville's neighbor, now vampire, wanders outside the house calling \\"Come out, Neville!\\"Written in 1952, \\"I Am Legend\\" is a brilliant and innovative story that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. I read this book after reading Stephen King's \\"Salem's Lot\\" and it's obvious that King borrowed some of his ideas from Matheson. King has even admitted that Matheson is \\"the author who influenced me most as a writer\\".This story is not a thrill-a-minute joy ride, but the depth of the story is incredible as it explores the psychological impact that comes from being a lone survivor. We also get to follow Neville's progress as he investigates and learns more about the vampire bacteria and how to fight it.There are two especially innovative parts of this story:1) Matheson gives a scientific explanation for the existence of vampires. He explains their desire to drink blood and aversion to sunlight and garlic in scientific terms. It makes the idea of vampires more believable and the story more real.Spoiler ahead!2) Despite the other interesting ideas Matheson introduces to the vampire story, the most original is the unusual twist at the end when Neville discovers that not all humans infected with the bacteria are completely transformed into vampires. Ironically, these infected \\"living\\" view Neville as we view vampires - a \\"monster\\" who comes into their bedrooms at night and kills them in their sleep. He is no longer the \\"good guy\\" who is fighting to survive. For them, he has become the evil in the night. He is their \\"legend\\".This last point makes \\"I Am Legend\\" something special. It is a story that defies convention and dares to do something new, to bring a fresh take to an old myth.Highly recommended.----------------------------------------Michael Mihalik is the author ofDebt is Slavery: and 9 Other Things I Wish My Dad Had Taught Me About Money.

Both were great in their own ways. If you're used to readiing non-fiction and you're looking for a good fiction book to let your mind run free, this book is it. Easy read with short chapters that entice the reader to keep going. Real page-turner. Ensure to treat yourself to the movie as well. Awesome movie to see in the theatre."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I am Legend is really really good. But nowhere on the outside of the book, or the inside even, does it state \\"Collection of short stories.\\" I liked the ending, but it would've been a lot more satisfiying if I knew the end was coming. Instead I was getting to the end of I am Legend wondering \\"Wow, how is he going to get out ot this situation... theres a little less then half a book left!\\" I skimmed ahead and looked for his name. Never seeing it I went online and found out what this book really was.I am Legend is a really good short novel... but in future reprintings they need to be more clear that this is a collection of short stories."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Many people have rushed out to read this 'book' due to the upcoming movie. Frankly put, the movie will not be close to the book and great liberties will be taken. Most people know the basic story, as noted everywhere, Neville is the last man on earth... but he's not alone. Everyone else has succumbed to the vampire-like plague. This is his story. Neville is just a guy, he's not a doctor, cop, athlete, or military. He's just Mr. Anybody and that is what helps make this 160 pg story work.Even better with the current release of the story, is the collection of other short stories written by Matheson. There's a good variety and some stunk (Witch War), some were borderline (Mad House), some were mildly amusing (The Funeral), and some were quite good (Person to Person) but most of the extra stories are interesting and light horror. My favorite in the book is actually PREY which does have a movie adaptation in 1975'sTrilogy of Terror. I saw that movie as a little kid and it scared the bejesus outta me and still bothers me now.Buy it for I AM LEGEND, but enjoy the surprisingly decent short stories afterward."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I guess I really don't like Vampire stories, if this tautly written classic filled with rich description, and keen insights into the human condition, can't hold my interest, then there's no hope for me. Even though I didn't enjoy the book as much as others have, I can certainly understand why it has achieved legendary status among fans of the genre. Unlike a lot of post-apocalyptic tales from this era, it has held up surprisingly well despite the 50+ years since it's first publication. Matheson's writing is on par with Heinlein, Dick, and the other masters of science fiction. Give this story a chance, I hope you like it more than I did."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I remember seeing a preview for a movie called I Am Legend a few months back and it looked alright. When I started talking to some co-workers about it, they urged me to pick up the book before the movie comes out (about a month as of this writing). They couldn't say enough good things about Matheson's I Am Legend. So, I purchased it.From the moment I started the book, I knew what to expect, but I had no idea that this short (170 page) story would be so engrossing. It tells the story of one man, Robert Neville, who is the last man alive in a world that has been taken by vampires, living and dead. By day he hunts/gathers, studies, does work on his house; at night, he hides to survive another day to do it all over again. But how long can he keep it up?This book is both scary and funny, a very quick and easy read, yet highly enjoyable. The realization at the end of the book in the last few paragraphs really makes this book stand out as one of the most unique vampire tales that I've ever read. The book also contains more short(er) stories from Matheson in the back. I haven't read them yet, so no review on those, just I Am Legend. Defiantly worth picking up."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I just finished to story (not the book) and I have to say that I didn't it except it to be so short. I know if I would have read on a little more I would have found out that its basically a short story, even still, I think that there could have been so much done with it. Don't get me wrong, Mathesons' interpretation and use of scientific fact is flawless and very convincing, but I was just left wanting more. (which is sometimes a good thing.) I also greatly enjoyed the included short stories. With that said, even though it was a shorted than expected, it was a great read and still deserves 5 stars. Also, I amped to see the movie interpretation (regardless of the fact that it's staring Will Smith..lol.)"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book/short story, what ever you want to call it... is absolutely amazing! An instant classic. If you dont buy it, you are seriously missing out. It's a little short -- but VERY sweet! If there are any bad reviews of this book it's one of the two reasons... They didn't understand it. Or they didn't read it!!!!But trust me, it's not complicated. It's just a great story with an amazing ending. What ever you do, DO NOT READ the last page until you actually get to it... Trust me... it's a mind job. This is the only book i've ever read where the last line has so much impact on the entire story.... When you read this you will see what I mean!!!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I really liked the book. It is a quick and entertaining read - especially for being written in 1954. I'm not really in to vampires, but this isn't about vampires. It's about a man who is the last man on earth and he's trying to deal with being alone, and trying to figure out what has happened to the rest of his race. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for some light summertime readingThere are periods when Neville's coping with his solitary existence - sometimes he drinks himself into a haze and other times he just zones out for months at a time. It reminded me of Cast Away when Tom Hanks was just dealing with being all by himself. It is interesting to read and to get inside the head of a charater like that. Cast Away had over 40 minutes of silence, but in I am Legend you a exposed to the inner thoughts of the survivor. I can only imagine what it would do to a man - but it sure makes for good reading..."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Easily the best novel I have ever read. My only complaint would be that it is so short. I would have read 900 pages of Neville's story if it were there.I grew up reading primarily Stephen King books and I heard that this novel was a great influence on King so I gave it a try. I can see why King holds it in such high regard.This book isn't really so much a horror story, but an apocolyptic tale of survival, love, science and sorrow. Surely it sounds like an odd combination, but thats what makes it so remarkable.Do yourself a favor and read this book. It will not dissapoint"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"I am Legend\\" is a very human vampire story. By that I mean that the story revolves around one person, his hopes, fears, loneliness, frustration and despair. The story takes a new spin on the vampire legend in that it removes the supernatural element of it (though the main character's scientific discoveries) and explains vampirism in terms of a pandemic that wipes out humanity as we know it. The virus spreads quickly, leading to a breakdown in society and mass death, near total extinction, with the main character as the sole living person as far as we the readers know. People infected with vampirism quickly die and then come back to life, driven by the need for blood - as with traditional vampire stories. Rational explanations are given for their aversion to light, garlic, religious relics, and so on. Even the hunger for blood is explained in biological terms.Early on, you really begin to feel for the main character of the story. He's a tormented person - by his inner turmoil and the vampires that come out each night in an effort to kill him. He's left alone, having to watch all that he loves (family) and knows (neighbors, city, and civilization) die and become forever lost. With this backdrop his character is revealed, both the weaknesses and strengths. He's a very human character, very round, and very believable. His loneliness is plain after the loss of his wife and child and all human contact, and he turns to alcohol to sooth his pain. He becomes desperate for companionship of any sort. Loss of affection, no outlet for sexuality and companion ship all play a part in this story. His strength of character and ability to persevere, despite the overwhelming odds, are illustrated throughout the story.It's a very dark story with a dark ending. It's definitely an intense story. It's uncluttered with numerous characters and subplots. It's tightly centered around one very developed character with a fairly unique vampire legend and distinctive storyline. \\"I am Legend\\" is one of the more human of all horror stories that I've read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I was introduced to Richard Matheson much later than I was introduced to Stephen King and other horror ginuises. I have to say unfortunately. Reading \\"I am legend\\" put in me in the classic driver's seat of horror fiction. It's like riding that old first mustang ever manufactured. Lay back and stir the wheels and inhale the early original dust of horror.Richard Matheson writes simply, arguably not the best writing. But it just overtops the many years of everything we have read. Other than this being like the original thought provoking idea of vampires, a man against the world, a wolrd where only one human is left to fight for survival, it's a spine chilling a much more believable and tasty story than numerous horror fictions lately. Think about alll these new adventure games like Silent hill and that stuff, where did come from? What do you think? Think about Vanilla Sky the movie? and much moreThis is an original everlasting theme. Human against inhuman. Alone with his fears to confront. Having to find solution to survive even when it is for some more hours. Finding that inhuman enemy are smart and not jut dorky slow crumbling zombies.I think I am legen the phrase, does not go to the protagonist of the book after all of these years.Richard Matheson is THE LEGEND."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"On the back cover of the book \\"I Am Legend\\" is the fine print, \\"The complete novel, plus several more unforgettable tales by Richard Matheson.\\" I thought I was half way through the book \\"I Am Legend\\" and wondered why the next chapter had nothing to do with vampires or \\"what happens next.\\" All great stories, just beware the book is actually a compilation of short stories besides \\"I Am Legend.\\""},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND has become a legend in both the horror and science fiction genres. Published in 1954, the story concerns the future; the 1970's where a strange plague has spread across the world, which has turned most if not all of the human race into vampires. This plot may sound a bit corny but this classic novel is anything but...Richard Neville has not been infected by the plague. The poor man's daughter and wife are dead and he is all alone, barricaded in his home at night while the \\"undead\\" scream and throw bricks at his house, and by day, he trolls the city killing as many as he can find.More than the surface plot, this tale is a study in loneliness and a man's on-going effort to remain sane under conditions that would drive anyone around the bend.Neville also has resorted to binge drinking to escape his plight and through the novel comes to terms with this addiction or \\"monster\\" and settles into a calm routine of study and survival.Matheson is an excellent writer of the macabre and unusual. In this tale the genres are a mix between horror and science fiction. In fact Matheson is known to write outside these traditional categories and push the envelope of his trade. The list of his work certainly proves this, writing such classics now asHell House,Bid Time ReturnandWhat Dreams May Come: A Novel.If you haven't read Matheson before I AM LEGEND would be a good place to begin.Excellent."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"What a book! Although the book takes place in a horror background (vampire apocalypse), the majority of this book takes place inside the narrator's mind as he copes with his situation and struggles to find a solution to his hardships. The ending of this book is magnificent (last three words:classic) and really makes you ponder the advancement of science and human existence itself. Highly recomended read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"I Am Legend\\" a short, succinct novella penned by sci-fi and horror genre legend Richard Matheson gives ample evidence why he served as inspiration for notable authors such as Steven King and Dean Koontz. Matheson whose creative talents spawned a myriad of memorable Twilight Zone episodes, fabricated a modern day twist to an ancient myth, the vampire.Californian Robert Neville seemingly is the sole survivor of a bacterial plague capable of turning those afflicted into vampires. Sequestering himself into his impregnable, fortified house he survives the nightly onslaught of vampires desperate to lure him out and feast on his blood. Hanging onto his sanity by a thread after enduring the death of his family and three years of daily sojourns where he destroys as many of the undead as he can uncover, he is ready to give up.Matheson, however, provides Neville with a ray of hope as first a stray dog and then another female survivor appear. Do these signs portend a new beginning or the end of the world that we know. Matheson provides a curious twist as he answers that very conundrum."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book delves into the mind, daily toil, and the immense loneliness a person might experience: his house is messy, disorganized, and only those tasks essential to survival take precidence, as laundry and routine dusting are dismissed.Robert Neville fights to supress his sexual urges, becomes his own greatest threat as, sheltered from the vampires in his fort, he drinks himself into stupor, and contemplates the futility of existence and entertains offering himself to the vampires to allow them to end the life he ceases to value.Neville regards the vampire, as any human might, as an abomination, an evil creature that threatens life. The irony is that Neville is the rarity as a non-vampire, and the role of incarnate evil is reversed. His routine of hunting and killing the vampires during the day is justified by his need to feel safe, to protect himself. But to the vampire he is the bogey-man, the creature that takes lives while society slumbers. His realization of this dynamic between hiself and the vampiric society is what drives this book to the top of my favorites. It's seems a metaphore for the need to change with the world around you, to recognize your place and to be possessed of the ability to reevaluate your relationships, your position, and recognize the truth of your interaction with those around you. (Might have something to do with being written after WWII)Enjoy the read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I currently read the book I Am Legend by Richard Matheson. In this book there are about nine other stories, but I Am Legend is the main attraction. Robert Neville is a brilliant scientist and a virus has broken out incurable and manmade that has mutated every other man, woman, and child into bloodthirsty, nocturnal creatures who are determined to destroy him. Somehow immune, Robert is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City, and maybe the world. As day comes he scavenges for food and supplies, desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. Although the infected lurk in the shadows watching his every move waiting for him to make a deathly mistake. Maybe mankinds last, best hope, Robert is motivated to find to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood is also what the infected want. Robert knows he is outnumbered and is quickly running out of time.... I would recommend this book to people who are opened minded and think of the possibilities that can happen."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"My twelve year old came home from school two weeks ago and informed me that his friend had read \\"I Am Legend\\" and that it was entirely different than the movie. Well, I loved the movie but I was curious about the book. I bought it and took it to work to read. Whenever I am reading a good book at work and my phone rings; I jump so badly that my heart pounds for several minutes after the scare. This happened to me many times during the book. I became one hundred percent engrossed with the isolation feeling that the main character was experiencing. Then suddenly...BANG, the story abruptly ends mid-way through the book. I sat there scratching my head feeling very perplexed. This is something that anyone who is considering buying this book MUST KNOW. The book actually contains numerous short stories. I still highly recommend purchasing it though. It was different from the movie and I personally feel that it was just as good as the movie."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I didn't know this story existed until after the movie a friend of mine told me he had read it and wanted to see how they adapted parts to the movie. And after reading it, I can attest that it was close to the story. I can tell what was going through the character's head while he's alone, which is one thing that I like more about books than movies. All in all, the movie was very close to the original story. The book also come with a number of other stories, too."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"WOW!!! I saw the movie and was intrigued to read the original novel and i'm glad I did. The authot does an amazing job of putting you inside the mind of a man who has literally been alone for months. As cheesey and over-done as the whole vampire genre is, for a book that was written in 1954, Matheson added a new perspective to the classic myth by scientifically explaining what and how vampires come to be. The book is action-packed like the movie yet is very different in events that take place; for example, in the movie Robert had the dog from the beginning of the movie whereas in the book he finds the dog walking around the neighborhood one day. The ending is also amazing! Very surprising and totally different from the movie. In the movie he's called a legend because he discovers the vaccine for vampirism........in the book he's called a legend for a completely different reason!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Wow, I didn't realize how long ago this book was written! I cannot wait to see the movie! I have to say, I am a vampire book hater. I just don't get into them. I wanted to read this before the movie (because the movie caught my eye!) I picked this up and THEN realized it was about vampires...I was skeptical to even try reading it. However, the book was actually pretty interesting! It is mainly a man's struggle with vampires, when he fears he's the only man left! How crazy difficult would that be? We find out, his daily lifes struggles in \\"vampire dealings\\" and what is going through his mind as he tackles these unfavorable problems. I actually enjoyed this short story and look forward to see where the movie takes this. I can't say that I read ALL the other short stories in the book, but I AM LEGEND was worth it!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I can't believe it took me this long to pick up this book and read it considering I'm such a fan of the genre. It was very well done. I enjoyed every story in the book!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I really enjoyed this Book it just doesnt Have I am Legend it has other stories by this Author and i was very happy with this stories"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Whether you've seen the latest movie or one of the others made over the years,or just looking for a really good read you enjoy this book.Well written,very deep yet easy to follow."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Very good book. A lot better than the movie that just came out. One of my favorite stories from this book was mad house."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"When one considers that this story served as inspiration for at least three films, and on reflection, may have contributed to the attributes of heroic figures in a few others, the only real question for me was why it took so long to decide to read the source. While I enjoyed each movie version:The Last Man on Earthwith Vincent Price,The Omega Manwith Charlton Heston and, of course, I Am Legend with Will Smith, I found Matheson's original story superior to each screen adaptation.Robert Neville is not the Ubermensch or any other category of superman. He is an ordinary man compelled to react to extraordinary circumstances. Matheson doesn't state explicitly but infers, nuclear holocaust resulted in the virtual extermination of mankind save the protagonist who, holed up in his fortified home, must withstand the nightly incursions of the undead or the nearly so, who thirst for and require his blood for sustenance. Each day of this post-apocalyptic existence is a trial, foraging for food, for knowledge and against all available evidence, for the chance of companionship. While Neville is cognizant of the mathematical improbability of his long term survival, over a three year span, he becomes adept at finding and destroying vampires as well as those he suspects of being infested with the bacterial cause, an affliction he discovered and named vampiris.This is a speculative tale of the human condition, with the supernatural as impetus for investigation. It is the examination of the psychological, the emotional and even the physiological impact on this most tragically isolated being that I found most engrossing. Faced with a life sentence to isolation by the vagaries of chance - he cannot be certain why he is immune - he is driven by a primordial imperative to resist submission to the darkness surrounding him. Neville's struggle is another manifestation of the very basic question of one's purpose in life and whether existence for the sake of existence has any real value. Three times Hollywood has answered the question in vastly different manners than the author intended. This dystopian view offered by Matheson should not be discounted.Obtuse Alert - This edition also contains nine additional short stories that follow I Am Legend. Each story is entertaining, but obviously not on the critical path. I read four of them before it dawned on me I had finished the story I set out to read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"OK. I admit it. I purchased this book because I saw the movie previews. I'm a big Will Smith fan and am excited about the movie, but I always prefer to read the book before the movie so I can compare. I was hesitant to purchase the book with the movie cover on it, only because...well...I'm just that way. But trust me, the story does not disappoint.Considering the fact that the story was written in 1954, it was a truly amazing concept for it's time, although if you place this book in history, it was written within recent memory of the end of World War II and at the beginning of the Cold War. Human extinction from biological warfare or nuclear attack was real and fresh in everyone's minds at that time. But, especially interesting to me was the tweak on vampirism being caused by some pandemic outbreak. With recent news about SARS and the Bird Flu, the fear of a massive human extinction is as real today as it was in 1958.However, don't fall into the trap that this is a story of vampires alone. It is more of a story about the human will to survive, the need to be with others of our kind or to share the monotony of living with something (the plot line where Neville is trying to win the affection of a surviving dog is particularly heart-wrenching), and what happens when the persecutor becomes the persecuted. Without ruining the story, I will say that the plot twist is especially surprising and effective and very thought provoking. This short story will have you thinking about it for days afterwards!Now, why did I give this book 4 stars instead of 5? The only reason: This edition is a compilation of short stories by Richard Matheson, the first of which is I Am Legend. This fact is not noted ANYWHERE on the book covers, binding, title page, etc. I was very confused when I thought I was entering a new chapter of the book and realizing that it had nothing to do with the previous. However, I have found the other stories just as interesting as the first and recommend that you read them all! You can definitely see where modern horror novelists (ie, Stephen King) were influenced by Matheson's works. In fact, a few of the stories I have found creepier than Mr. King's works..and some of these were stories written over 50 years ago! In particular, check out Prey, Witch War, and Dance of the Dead.It will be interesting to see how Hollywood handles this story. I can already tell by the movie previews that it is not completely faithful to the book in many ways (the main character description, the dog, the setting in NYC instead of Southern California) and I will say that the book ending is not your typical Hollywood ending. I guess I'll just have to pay my $9 and see! Regardless of how Hollywood treats the story, I will give it credit for bringing attention to a short story I would have never found on my own but am so glad it is now a part of my collection."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I'm not going to summarize this book as you can just read Amazon's description. I just want to put in my 5 stars and let anyone thinking about reading this know that it is a great book. It's pretty short, only about 150 pages, (there are other short stories that come with this book), and very effective. Don't expect scary, gory vampires. This book works like an episode of the Twilight Zone, it's kind of scary throughout and then the ending is what really gives you the chills.On a side note -- it looks like Hollywood is going to twist this one all around and turn it into a Ford Mustang commercial!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I really enjoyed this book and was left hungering for more.The combination of PostApocalypse and Vampire genres is simply brilliant, and I am left hungering for a sequel or simply an expansion on the concepts explored in this short book.I could not put the book down, and read it in a single sitting. I am looking forward to seeing the movie, but at the same time, and fearful. I am fearful that the movie will scare the heck out of me, if it does a good job of bringing the book to life, and I am fearful of being dissapointed by a poor showing.Anyone who is into PostApocalypse and/or Vampire stories should consider this a must read. It has inspired the likes of Stephen King."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"If you are not, as I was/am, a lover of this Vampire genre you should be pleasantly surprised with this book as it is really nothing like you'd imagine a vampire book to be. In fact, the \\"bad guys\\" could be any bad guys, for example I could see this as the end of \\"The Road\\" or any other apocaplyse book. I was not one to be drawn to the Vampire stories, other than the old Ann Rice \\"Lestat.\\" I actually notice that some of the 'tags' are for zombies.For all the reasons others have given and the ringing endorsement by Stephen King I finally read the book. It had been sitting in my library for years and I was very satisfied with the story except that it ended quickly and without warning - maybe that was even better because you didn't have the expectation that the end was near.It's quite obvious that those readers who, to put it mildly, express their disappointment in the length of the I Am Legend story are doing so because of the price they paid for the book. Otherwise, the story is the story and that's what they paid to read. These short story books are all priced as if a one story full novel. I too was disappointed in the length because only because the story ended. Actually, I shy away from these little novellas. I really shouldn't as the \\"I am Legend\\" experience proves. Just think of it as the price you pay to read the story. Would you rather pay full price and get a different book with a crap story? I think not. In fact, at least the publisher gave us the other stories; it didn't have to."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is the quintessential vampire book. I first read this ten years ago when I was looking for something 'classic' about vampires. It was either Matheson or Ann Rice. Ann Rice has NOTHING on Matheson. Matheson is to vampires what Asimov is to robots.Anyway - what drew me in is that the story itself is relatively short (aproximately 150 pages) but deeply engaging. Matheson seeks to explain the vampire scientifically. I am, however, disappointed in the ending - it just didnt do it for me, hence I give it only four stars.As an added bonus this book contains roughly 10 more short stories of Matheson's which are all very entertaining. Matheson was a writer for the Twilight Zone (remember William Shatner exclaiming 'there's something on the wing!' yeah Matheson wrote that story) - he does not disappoint!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers who \\"complained\\" that this short story / novel was too short. but you know, that was probably because i enjoyed it so much. I'm a huge fan of the kind of books that start you out with some kind of world changing event and then drawing you into one person who's trying to survive. Looking forward to the movie with Will Smith, even though he would not be my first choice."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Stephen King once wrote, \\"[W]ithout Richard Matheson I wouldn't be around.\\" Many authors can make the same statement. Matheson's work has greatly shaped the horror genre, and his novel I Am Legend has been one of the most influential stories of his time.One of the best things about the book is Matheson's portrayal of the vampire. These creatures are ravenous and feral and widespread; they have taken over the earth. They act much like zombies--or rather, zombies act like them: George Romero admits that Matheson's I Am Legend inspired his zombie apocalypse in Night of the Living Dead.Matheson also contributes an interesting scientific explanation for the vampire outbreak. Robert, the protagonist, turns to books in his quest to understand the pandemic, and his discoveries explain everything from why the infected avoid garlic to why they crave fresh blood. His search for knowledge lends the novel a pragmatic feel emphasized by simple, clear-cut writing.There are many reasons why genre masters such as Stephen King and George Romero credit Matheson as an influence. I Am Legend is definitely one of them."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Though this novel is certainly quite well known, particularly amongst horror fans, it's not quite as famous as I'd imagine it would be, or as it ought to be, for that matter. It's pretty damn influential, particularly in films as it was a primary inspiration for 'Night of the Living Dead'. (And, it was adapted for film twice, first as 'The Last Man on Earth', then as 'The Omega Man' (which it resembles in only the vaguest manner.) But adaptations are quite entertaining I think, if far from truly satisfactory.) Anyway, this is definitely one of my favorite novels, horror or otherwise. (Well, I'd probably call it a 'novella', but whatever)Some negative reviews have complained about this novel from a stylistic of scientific standpoint, and while they may have a point, I think they're kinda missing the boat. Yeah, the whole scientific explanation for how vampires could exist doesn't work, but I've never heard of anyone saying they like this story because of the science. This ain't hard science fiction. In fact, it only loosely qualifies as sci-fi, as it is more sorta, 'apocalyptic horror'. (It is about *vampires*, for god's sake.) The only thing that bothered me much about the scientific aspect of this novel is that is comes as a sorta revelation to Neville that they could essentially be vampires, but that the condition was caused by disease. Well, duh.At it's heart, 'I Am Legend' is about isolation, and the key to whether or not you enjoy this novel comes from whether or not you can truly sympathize with Neville. (This is also true of Matheson's inferior but still enjoyable novel, 'The Shrinking Man', which contains even more improbable science.) Personally, I find Neville to be just about the most tragic character I've ever encountered in media of any sort. It may not seem too tough to make Neville sympathetic, as he's in an unimaginably bad situation,(everyone's dead but him, there are vampires, etc.) but Matheson makes the most of it, showing us his unspeakable loneliness, along with the crushing boredom and the dehumanizing brutality necessary to his new life. And his eventual transformation into something which is not quite a monster, but which is also definitely less than human is both convincing and shattering.And what can I say, I actually think this is a fairly cleverly written book, at least at times. Matheson is good at using sudden deflation and anticlimax, in terms of his prose. For example, I like how he writes about Neville's using all his stakes in his daily extermination, ending the section saying something like: \`He had 37 stakes'. That's just an effective way of instantly juxtaposing the gruesome absurdity of his situation, along with the casual, repetitious way he goes about his business. Also (spoiler alert), the way he ends the long section describing his attempt to help a dog writing simply, \`The dog was dead in a week'. (Or something like that.)Anyway, I'm done. I like this a lot. (The edition I've read doesn't come with the short stories after this, so I can't comment on them, naturally.)"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A man alone in the world of vampires lives to learn what they are and what happened to the world. It is frightening, intelligent, touching and tragic. This story is much much bigger than its hundred pages. I can't stress enough how important this book is for the reader of horror. It truly defines what the vampire is and why. Absototalutely wonderful."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am Legend is surprisingly great! You would think that something written in the era that Richard Matheson was was writing would be dated and well.... be ready to be taken off the shelf. Actually Matheson hits the nail on the head with a timeless classic that transends beyond horror and becomes in it's own way a statement of society itself.I am legend should be at the top of any readers list if they haven't yet read it. It's light and short but delivers ten fold what a book 30x's the length can. It goes to show you that great things come in small packages. You also can't help but relate to Matheson's main character if you are no stranger to isolation or the feeling of being well, different.A surprise ending worth every page... I can't say enough and I don't want to give the story away.... This should be on your \\"To Read List\\" today... and I'm not a heavy reader but, if there were more stories this interesting, I'd quite my job and sign up for foodstamps, haha.=====================Movie Alert=====================There are now 3 versions of this book in film.Latest was with Will Smith. Fun, big budget, not close to the book, disappointing ending.70's with Charleton Heston... Wow Daddy O' this is just too cool for school. If you dig the 70's you'll Dig this flickThe last Man On Earth with Vicent Price, Closest to the book. Very slow moving but very Entertaining, I feel this is the best representation of the book. I would suggest this over the others. I like will smith and I think he did excellent in the modern one but those vampires were CGI and were not scary at all. The old one was limited and didn't have the better set and budget but it's just a better film, a better adaptation to the book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I picked this book up a couple of days ago and read all of &quot;I am Legend&quot; in one sitting yesterday. To sum it up, one man is the lone survivor of a plague which causes people to turn into living vampires. As the plague progresses, those vampires die but their bodies are still animated by the disease (yes... I said disease). According to the story it is a bacteria that causes the condition. This story is credited by several people as THE story that started the whole &quot;Survival Horror&quot; genre which has been seen in movies such as The Omega Man (based on I am Legend), Night of the Living Dead, and Resident Evil. That is only half of the story. The whole point of the story is that throughout history it was the vampire that was the &quot;boogey man&quot; in a world where Man was the dominant and more numerous species. With the last sentance in the story Neville states that &quot;I am Legend&quot;. He understands that HE has become the &quot;boogey man&quot; of the vampire society. He is the one who creeps out in the day to slay the vampires in their beds while they sleep.On the way in to work today I was thinking about this statement of role-reversal. Given that this story was originally published in 1954 I was wondering what inspired Matheson to write this story. Instead of taking it at face value I wondered if he was making a statement that following the bombing of Pearl Harbor (13 years before the book was published) we made the Japanese out to be our society's boogey man but in the end when we dropped the atom bombs if we ourselves (Americans) had not become the boogey man we all feared. Then again, maybe I am reading too deep into the story.I gave it 4 stars because most this story could have been acted out on stage by one person. Neville hardly ever leaves his house and when he does Matheson really doesn't provide a lot of detail into the state of the world. I'm sure it was intentional. If Matheson had made this into a novel instead of a short story I'd have rated it a 5... I just felt like there was so much more that could have been done with the story."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"After enjoying the movie quite a bit, I had to see what the original was like. It was no surprise, then, to find that I enjoyed the book quite a bit, but for reasons not the same. The book is way different than the movie, with really the only common element being vampires and Neville's name. Everything else is completely different!Right from the beginning we know there are vampires, so no surprise reveal. And as another reviewer stated, the book is more about one man's trials and tribulations in trying to survive amongst the blood thirsty vampires, and then to try and overcome them by defeating them with science. This really was a good read, ultimately finishing up much stronger than the movie.It is a little deceptive though. You pick up this 300 page book and start reading, then you get to page 160 and I Am Legend ends. From there the rest is all short stories. Nowhere does it state that I Am Legend is basically a long novella, with the rest a bunch of short stories. Not on the back of the book. Not on any product descriptions. In fact everywhere only talks about I Am Legend. Not necessarily a bad thing, but a little deceptive in the marketing. Perhaps more bang for your buck, since you would have bought I Am Legend by itself anyway.All in all, the book is a lot better than the movie. The book is a great stand alone vampire/horror book that focuses more on man's struggle, rather than the gory side of it. Some of the short stories were interesting as well, but the star of the show is definitely I Am Legend.5 stars."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"What would you do, if a mysterious plague swept throughout the world, literally killing everyone off, but leaving in its place something new, something frightening, something downright horrible, while leaving you alive, immune and seemingly alone? What would you do, if the undead now walked the earth looking for you, the last man alive...the last vestige of the human race? What if what they wanted was the taste of your blood on their lips? Just what on earth would you do?These are the questions that faced Robert Neville. It is he who is Legend. How he answers them is what makes this a book to remember and a classic within its genre. It is a book of profound hope and despair. It is a book that demands to be read. Read it. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson's &quot;I am Legend&quot; takes the traditional vampire novel (in this case, they've taken over the Earth) and combines it with the killer plague theme and tops it all off with a last-man-on-Earth scenario that is as compelling as it is frightening. Unlike many other 1950s sci-fi and horror novels, it has lost little of its impact.Protagonist Robert Neville lives in his barricaded house near Los Angeles. During the day he can move around, but at night the vampires surround his house and try to break in. He keeps them at bay, but at a terrible cost to his mental well being. In an effort to stave off madness, he begins to research was caused the vampire plague. He eventually discovers the truth, which then leads to a climax that is both electrifying and haunting.The novel itself is only 170 pages in length, and the length of this trade paperback edition has been doubled by the inclusion of a number of Matheson short stories. The shorts of of varying quality, but they do not detract from what is one of the best vampire novels ever written."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book is so well written you can't stop reading to eat. From the first page you are absorbed into the story and become Robert Neville. You feel the sheer hell it would be to live in solitude, to be the only man left on the planet and be tortured nightly by vampires who want you dead. Matheson's words flow so smooth from the page you shudder at the horror in the world he's created. A magnificent story that becomes so real you want to lock your doors and windows before the sun goes down. This book is a must read. (For those who may be interested; Hollywood is remaking &quot;Omega Man&quot;, a well done adaption of Matheson's novel. Unfortunately, this remake, so far titled &quot;I am Legend&quot;, will not do justice to the novel. The film will star Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ridly Scott will direct. Expect this movie to be a worthless piece of garbage filled with explosions and stupid one liners from Schwarzenegger. And don't even think the movie will end like the book. I read the screenplay.)"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I had seen three \\"versions\\" of this book, the one with Vincent Price (my favourite), the one with Charlton Heston and the one with Will Smith, before reading the story and none of them come close to what the book is actually about. The story starts with our hero hunting and killing vampires and ends up being the story of perception. At times I felt the story was quite slow moving, but I believe that is part of the telling, because there are no other humans to help this man make the time pass. I read several of the 1 and 2 starred reviews and I feel most of them were unjust because they were expecting the book version of the Will Smith movie. Readers should know this book was written in 1954 and has the feel of the same era. It is not a slash bang smash em up. It is a commentary."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The movie was pointless. And it missed the point. This story is engaging and explores a lot more of the character. And makes way more sense."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Usually when I hear people say \\"The book is not like the movie\\" I will typically find more similarities between the two rather than differences. This is certainly not the case with 'I am Legend' - the two really couldn't be much more different.Many people seem to be coming to this book after watching the movie. I actually enjoyed the movie (somewhat). I found it to be a good evening out with the Miss's back when it was on the silver screen -- average Hollywood blockbuster fare. Knowing that books are typically better than their movie counterparts I was excited to dig into the book version. Overall I do like the book better, but it's not without its flaws.It is interesting to see Will Smith on the cover with a backdrop of New York City behind him - in the book Robert Neville looks nothing like Will and it takes place in Los Angeles.About the book -I'm not into vampires AT ALL. I have almost zero interest in stories involving them, so I was a little dismayed when I found that they populate this novel. Thankfully at least they aren't the super charismatic, overly powerful, teenie-bopper vampires that populate many of the stories today. In 'I am Legend' they are more animalistic, though the anti-garlic, anti-cross, anti-sunlight clich&eacute;s are present. I was able to get over this.Robert Neville is seemingly the only known human to have escaped an outbreak which is turning both the dead and the living into vampires. Robert is just a typical human being who is suffering loneliness in an abhorred world. Robert spends many hours a day ensuring that he lives to see the next day. He is constantly setting up strings of garlic, building stakes, fixing boarded up windows, etc. Eventually he becomes fed up and he tries to solve the mysteries of vampirism. Why can't they go out in the sun? Why is garlic such a good deterrent?Really, this story is more about a man's loneliness, the vampires and such are more in the background. I found that this book touched on the loneliness aspect far better than the movie.Here are some of the things I enjoyed about the book -I found the writing to be quite excellent. Also, finally I now understand what \\"I am Legend\\" really means - something the movie never really addresses. I like how in the book Robert is just a typical man with his own problems, such as alcoholism. Even though it did feel a little abrupt, I did like how the story ended, it's one of those books you reflect on for awhile after setting it down.But, there are some flaws -In some instances the scenes didn't really flow together very well. For instance, there is a whole scene involving Robert's interaction with a dog. Matheson doesn't really weave this scene in very well; the story just sort of comes to a halt as we read about this interaction for a number of pages. This element would of had more impact had it weaved with the underlying story a bit better, to me it felt really tacked-on. I found the science in this book way far-fetched and there are a few too many pages dedicated to this. Also, Matheson's idea of living and dead vampires felt as though it was an idea that really never fleshed out fully. It does come into play at the end, but it could have been done a bit better.Overall, 'I am Legend' is greater than the sum of its parts. Despite its flaws I enjoyed it quite a bit.Also worth noting, only half of this book is dedicated to the story 'I am Legend', the other half of the book contains various other non-related short stories that range from about 3 to 20 pages. Some of these are decent, but I had no idea this was a book of short stories, so I was a little disappointed to find that out, especially since it is not mentioned anywhere on the cover. I have read comments for other reviews that say \\"Well, you're getting more than you paid for!\\" but I don't quite see it that way - to me it would be like expecting a full-length movie, only for the movie to wrap up 40 minutes in, and the remaining 40 minutes to be below average to average short 'Tales from the Crypt' clips.In the end, I give 'I am Legend' a solid 4, and I collectively give the remaining stories about a 3. Overall this book is around a 3.5, but rounded to 4."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I like Will Smith, but the movie with its zombie things is not the same story.

The vampires' lures and taunts became a part of his everyday life.....while he struggles with justifying reasons why he should keep on fighting if he's the only human left.After years of holing himself in his house at night, (complete with soundproof walls to block the vampires' screams), and slaying vampires during the day, he meets a woman.

In &quot;I am Legend&quot; the bloodsuckers are either 1) wholly mindless and driven by bloodlust; or (2) calculating, mechanical schemers bent on a new world order. Thanks to Hollywood (see Interview with a Vampire, The Hunger, any Hammer or Universal Dracula movie), the vampire has become something of a priss: They live in castles, are fabulously wealthy, wear tuxedos, etc. &quot;I am Legend&quot; sucks the life out of those images and replaces it with something insidiously vile and monstrous. While I was reading this book, especially the last two chapters, I felt like Matheson was trying to invoke the terror and warped idealogy of Nazi Germany. Anyone agree?"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson can really keep a reader in the seat, or under the covers frightened of what may be lunking in the dark. I Am Legend made me think twice about going outside alone at night. The most interesting thing about the book, however, is the science behind the vampires. No doubt Matheson did extensive research to come to his conclusions. This made for a very good read. Everything that Anne Rice and other vampire authors neglect to explain is written here in black and white. Great book! It kept me from sleeping soundly..."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is a classic novel. One of the best vampire survival stories I have ever read.

As the story winds down, the ending is one of the best you can get."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The story flows well. Not very scary.

A great weekend read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"In I Am Legend, Matheson has spun the most original take on the vampire myth that I have ever read. It features Vampires not only as predators but as victims as well. Packed with tension and knowledge, I Am Legend is truly one of the most satisfying books in my library. A page turner that will keep you in your seat reading, but still short enough to allow you to go to work in the morning"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"If you only read one fantsy book, read I Am Legend. From start to finish you cannot close the book. And that is the strange part. A great portion of the book is spent with both the reader and the protagonist waiting . . . but it is a wait filled with suspense. The world Matheson creates is truly a dead world, even more so than the worlds created in books like King's The Stand or McCammon's Swan Song. It is a dead world in every sense of the word. On top of the sinister atmosphere created by Matheson you are presented with an interesting philosophical dilemma. In a world full of monsters, is normalcy the abnormality? If everyone has gone mad aren't those who are labeled insane actually sane? This is Matheson's most brilliant, and powerful work out of a body of work that is as impressive as any modern writer of fiction could ever hope to achieve(and when I say that I am including guys like Updike and Nabakov). Most people who don't read fantasy because it isn't &quot;real&quot; are missing out on a great classic of literature. So for those of you who think that books of fantasy are best left to children, I urge you, put down your copy of Gravity's Rainbow or Catch 22 and see why books that should have been put in the attic, along with your prom tux and teddy bear, still have a lot to offer as adults."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I read this because some science fiction critic said it was \\"better than Robinson Crusoe.\\"Not quite.\\"I am Legend\\" is a pretty compelling metaphor for isolation (and isolationism), but the author lets a lot of that tension run to waste by devoting the middle portion of the story to a bogus Freudian/science-fictional explanation of where the vampires came from, why crosses repel them, blah blah blah...I suppose it's an important contribution to the evolving vampire mythos (though I'm not sure that's a good thing if \\"Twilight\\" is what we get from it), but it could have been something even better: a truly atmospheric story throughout. That, to me, would have been even more valuable."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I bought this book based on the enthusiastically positive reviews here on Amazon, but I'm a bit disappointed. Some of the reviews said the book was far better than the Will Smith movie, so I was expecting something really deep and engaging. Instead, I felt the story \\"I Am Legend\\" had plot weaknesses and didn't hold my interest like I expected. There were a number of times when I thought, \\"But what if...?\\" or \\"Why didn't this happen...?\\" Some Amazon reviews even said the story's ending was far superior to the ending of the Will Smith movie, but I feel like I must have read the wrong book. The end of the story was anticlimactic and didn't seem to wrap up the meaning of the title at all for me.I picked up the book because I enjoy sci fi, but I didn't feel this book was sci fi. It feels more like horror, and not just because of the vampires. Nearly everything about the story made it feel more like a horror story, and I'm not a fan of horror so I didn't enjoy it much. There are also several short stories following \\"I Am Legend\\" in this book (which aren't mentioned anywhere on the covers) and they are all horror genre stories. I read most of them but they just aren't my cup of tea.One thing I noticed is that all the stories, including \\"I Am Legend,\\" remind me of Stephen King's works. Obviously Matheson influenced King. If you enjoy Stephen King, then you'll probably really like this collection of Matheson's stories. But if you're mostly a sci fi fan like me, you may not enjoy it so much. I suspect the glowing reviews of this book are from fans of horror who maybe would have liked the movie \\"I Am Legend\\" to more closely resemble a horror movie than a sci fi flick."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Good original story but the title was misleading,it should have said The Legend and other short stories,The story kind of left me hanging, I kept flipping back and forth until I realized the story was over and a new short story was beginning.

We experience Neville's grief and his solitary hell of day after day, fixing his home and hoarding supplies and spending the evenings listening to the barrage of vampires upon his front door. Neville handles his situation realistically: alcohol and rage.After \\"I am Legend\\" (which has a twist of an ending.. perhaps not satisfying, but original), Matheson finishes the book with short stories eerie and creative.

My notes from back then say that I liked it, but didn't understand the ending. I saw the audiobook at the library the other day so decided to give it another try.I Am Legend regularly shows up on lists of the best post-apocalyptic novels of all time, but I have to say, even after reading it a second time, I just don't get it. It was ok, but had way too many glaring plot holes to make it really enjoyable, and there's no way it ranks up there with the real heavy hitters of the genre.The story centers on Robert Neville, apparently the only survivor of a plague that turns it's victims into vampires. Yup, honest to god, need to drink blood vampires. Matheson does a good job of coming up with a scientific explanation for vampirism, but it feels like he spent all his time thinking about that, because there are lots of other elements in the book he could have worked on.The story, and its final revelation, work from a very high level, as long as you don't dig too deep and question how or why things happened the way they did.For those of you who haven't read it yet, I don't want to give too much away, so for now, suffice it to say that if you don't like stories that make you ask \\"why?\\" and don't give any explanations, then you might not like this one.

I saw the movie \\"Omega Man\\" when I was kid and loved it and did not realize it was based on this tale until I read through some of these reviews. Two basic comments about this book. First, the story \\"I am Legend\\" only takes up about half the book. The rest is made up of short stories that just weren't anywhere close to as good as \\"I am Legend\\" in my opinion. In fact I became very bored with them and had to put the book down a few times. Because of that I am downgrading the book overall to 4 stars.Having said that, I could not put the book down at all while reading the \\"I am Legend\\" story. To set up the tale: there could well be only one man left on earth as some sort of vampire virus has spread, possibly through biological warfare. The time is in the 70's which is the future when you consider this book was written in the 50's. The tale delves into this one man's fight against vampires who try to get at him every night. He has turned his house into a fortress. In the day he ventures out in search of the vampires to kill them while they sleep. He also fills his time with trying to solve the mystery of what the virus is and where it came from. Very intriguing. Could not put the book down.If you enjoyed Wellington's \\"13 Bullets\\" and \\"99 Coffins\\" you will definately like this one. I have not seen the movie yet and from what I hear, the movie does not follow the story line of the book. Book was fantastic!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I bought the book because of the movie. I thought it might have extra detail into the depth of the character Robert Neville, a character I really I liked. However, while the book is quite good as literature, it is quite different from the movie; a fact I knew but I just did not know how different. In the book, our Robert is not a scientist or in the Army and the true origin of the vampire-creating disease is not given. He does however try to figure out as best he can what has happened. He also grapples with his loneliness and the human side of being alone, more so than in the movie. In the book he is not accompanied by a his trusting dog Sam. Robert Neville is essentially not the same as in the movie; which is fine because that was the way the movie makers wanted it. So even though the movie is based on the book, you have to look at each work different, and don't judge one by the other. With the version of the book I received there were also some short stories by the author which I did not expect. I liked the book and it was/is good but I preferred the movie.

It was just different enough to be not exactly like the movie so there was new surprises. Only half the book is the real story the rest is all short stories."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson wrote this story for a different era. It is through a continuous evolution of the characters thoughts and memories that the reader is kept in suspense. This also affected by the give and take of the main character, Robert Neville, with the creatures. This is portrayed when sleepless nights are met with a days full of upkeep and work to stay alive.The continuing feeling of desperation and continual relapse into denial aid the character on. The psychology of why does one keep living in this state seems to be answered but shot down in just what seems to be crushing conclusions. The ending is what it should be. It's not happy so to say. Sometimes the scariest and most suspenseful conclusions are how things in there own situations really, in all honesty, end. Sometimes life is a tragedy. It's just one more aspect that makes this a classic."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"What a fantastically bleak tale. I decided to read this after seeing previews for the movie. Of course, the book is always better than the movie, so why not read what all the hype is about before seeing Will Smith present it. Just from seeing previews, I could discern a number of differences between the movie and the book, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this great story.Robert Neville is a survivor, the last human among a world of plague-ridden vampires. You probably know the story already, so let me emphasize the mood. Matheson creates circumstances that are so believable and an atmosphere that is so gripping that I felt like I was surviving right along with Neville. As I watched Neville evolve in his situation, I wanted to cheer him on and encourage him not to give up.

Anyone that has seen the movie AND read the book should be equally insulted. The novel has a wonderful dark and haunting atmosphere, which by the way is NOT set in New York City! Robert Neville is a brooding alcoholic layman who AFTER the \\"plague\\" has to teach himself science and virology between periods of drunken depression, he is NOT a colonel and brilliant scientist with a loving companion German Shepard.I loved the entire book but to me the greatest part and what separates \\"I Am Legend\\" from other typical horror/vampire/apocalyptic stories is the ending. That being said, the current movie that critics are hailing as the closest rendering of the novel yet (it has been remade 2x prior) is an insult to the post-apocalyptic vision Richard Matheson created. The demise of our beloved hopeless and inverted hero as Matheson wrote it is COMPLETELY lost in the film which disappointingly ends with hope for the future of mankind.Buy an another edition that is not related to the movie and enjoy."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The original book is only 122 pages.

He wrote it in the fifties, it is a pioneering \\"sick\\" style of writing that divulges way too much detail (a creepy plus in the hands of Matheson) and in spite of two so-so films (The Omega Man,I Am Legend), it has yet to be made faithfully.All of this in 157 pages of what is essentially a long short story. It has been called \\"second only\\" to Bram Stoker'sDracula: Complete, Original Text. Horsefeathers! Stoker couldn't write that well. The only work I say might compare to Matheson's is the 18th century 'vampire original',Varney the Vampire Or the Feast of Bloodby Thomas Prescott [Preskett] Prest.Unlike Heston or Smith in all their weird glory, this book is genuinely frightening and will, I assure you, give you nightmares. How Matheson was able to touch so many of the nerves of humanity and make them sting is beyond me. In fact, I have been known to describe the general storyline as \\"scalding\\".What I want to call to the vampire lore/horror lover's attention (without spoiling) are two horrifying things the movies can't ever get right: this is primarily about a plague; and our hero seeing his wife and a close neighbor resurrected has to be the most mind-blowing horror of anything I have ever read. These 'vampires' still have their old memories and some of them call out to our protagonist, trying to lure him by speaking normally to him, while others merely perform obscene acts on his front lawn. It's worse than any nightmare. LOVE IT!!This is what horror should be - and I've yet to see anything remotely approaching this quality in any other horror writer. Especially King. Matheson did what no one else had ever been able to do: reconstitute the vampire theme and make it horrifying beyond words. He was able to reach out, grab and include the reader in the godforsaken evil that is let loose in this story. I'd almost go so far as to call this a haunted story.Buy this and read the real thing. And be ready with dozens of good light bulbs, because you won't want to sleep with the lights off, ever again!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am Legend is a collection of stories, the longest of which - taking up roughly half the book - is the story I Am Legend, upon which the Will Smith movie was (extraordinarily loosely) based.I was especially intrigued by this novel after seeing a raving quote from Dean Koontz on the front and one from Stephen King on the back. It was definitely a solidly good read, if short of fantastic. Matheson has a talent for word craft, and a rich, dark imagination. The reader will benefit greatly from both, and find themselves thoroughly frightened, horrified, and entertained. It's interesting that even though some of these stories were written as long ago as 1952, for the most part they don't feel dated at all and could well have been written today.I did have one issue with the book, which is that many of the stories are vignettes with little or no resolution or clarification. I personally enjoy stories that end."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is definitely more of a haunting vampire tale then one of gore, action or romance. One man, Robert Neville, has survived a plague virus that after killing, resurrects its victims as blood suckers. I AM LEGEND is Neville's skillfully told horrifying and sad account of the end of the human world; as he struggles to hold on to his own sanity.The despair and loneliness of Neville is almost too much to take at times, as he borders on giving up and slipping into madness. And although genre as a horror, I found I AM LEGEND more gut-wrenching and heartbreaking then anything. I truly appreciated Matheson's emotional writing style, as he completely captivated me with Neville's bleak story.*I have yet to see the highly acclaimed Will Smith movie version of I AM LEGEND, although I do hear it's a bit different from the book. I'm now intrigued..."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I listened to the audio book of I am Legend.The main character, Robert Neville, for some reason not completely known to him, is the last living man. Everyone else has either turned into a vampire or has been killed by the vampires. Robert is struggling day by day to survive while at the same time trying to figure out why he alone was not infected like everyone else.I loved how the author made this a post-apocalyptic vampire novel (and one quite original for its time...written in 1954), but the vampires are not the main focus of the story. In fact, Robert hears them at night and hunts them during the day, but they really are in the background, at least until towards the end. The story is really about Robert and his struggles with loss, despair, loneliness, and trying to keep his humanity in a world that is no longer human.The other short stories in this book were good also, but I Am Legend was by far my favorite."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It's not very often that I read a book that isn't YA. It's even more infrequent that I read a book that wasn't written in the last 2 years. I Am Legend was first published in 1954... So why did I pick it up? Well, mostly because I really liked the movie, and that's mostly because Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, if not my favorite.I Am Legend was certainly an interesting read. Matheson did an amazing job of getting the reader to feel the emotions the main character is reading, loneliness, craziness, despair, determination. The author has a fantastic understanding of basic human nature.I'd heard the book was quite a bit different than the movie, but I wasn't prepared for HOW different it would be! Aside from the main character being on his own most of the time, nothing was the same. I was really surprised when I realized the book was about vampires, not zombie like creepy creatures! Don't even compare the two, just let them be their own separate awesome.For a book that is almost 60 years old, there really wasn't a whole lot that made it feel old. Except for one word that was used... which starts with a \\"N\\" (I won't say more than that, it was offensive)... I wouldn't have guessed it was written so long ago.Highly recommend if you want something with a MC who isn't a teenager, but something still with paranormal elements.4 out of 5 stars!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"For a book written in the mid-fifties, it reads like it could have happened yesterday. The book seems like a great study in 3rd person limited and hits on every kind of emotional high and low a man who is alone would probably experience. The fights scenes between him and the vampires were absolutely awesome and it felt like I was right there along with Robert Neville (the protagonist) kneeing a vampire in the face, hitting them with his car as he scurried back to the house, or shooting them in the face. Matheson has a great use of realism and while the book has some really cliche events (that I won't go into here), they still all work. In the end, you're sort of floored from the powerful combination of good writing and imagination. If you want a book that pretty much haunts you even after you have read it, then check this book out. It's worth it. And oldie but goodie that delivers."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I originally bought the book thinking of how much I loved the movie and books are always so much better. This was absolutely the case, only to find out that although the basic premise is the same, there are very few connections between the two. I was swept away with the Robert Neville of the story and the total contrast from the Robert Neville of the movie. Overall, the book had me completely captivated throughout and brought me to a new level of thinking when it comes to vampires."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I will keep this short and simple. A roommate recommended I read the book after I saw the movie (which was fair) and said I would like it. WOW, this book is such a great read! It is not very long and is very emotional, I really wish they would have based the movie on the book way more. A+ grade in my book, highly recommended to everyone."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"You'll recognize the ideas put forth in the stories in this book because Richard Matheson is one of the most copied authors of his time. Many horror/thriller/spooky movies & TV episodes have borrowed his creepy ideas. I Am Legend is very good, better than the 3 or 4 movies based on it in my opinion. Just remember, half the book is I Am Legend, half the book is weird short stories, and there's basically no transition between the two, so if you're not looking for it it can be confusing : )"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"As expected, \\"I Am Legend\\" was not like the movie. It was a little confusing (living vampires? dead vampires?), but was still thought-provoking. The other short stories in the volume were a little dated, but still good stories."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Back in the day I used to read young adult horror like it was going out of style. It got boring. I felt it the genre became predictable and uninteresting. I even used to watch horror movies and stopped for that very reason. How many times can you reinvent something over and over again before it becomes tedious?Then Twilight appeared on the scene and turned me off completely from the vampire genre. Now to make things clear, I never read the books. I read excerpts and heard of the premises. I had no desire to pursue reading them. Obviously Stephanie Meyer is doing something right, given how popular the series is but the story and her writing style is not for me.But I digress! The point to what I stated above is that it's been a really long time since I've read some good horror. I didn't expect this story to \\"wow\\" me like it did. Thank you, Richard Matheson. I confess that this story made me fall back in love with vampires.There are major discrepancies between the movie and the book so for those of you unfamiliar with the book's premise, here is a summary from yours truly:Robert Neville is the last living man on Earth. Every man, woman, and child has turned into a vampire is out for his blood. By day, Robert hunts those who seek to ultimately kill him. At night, he fences himself inside his house, drinking away his sorrow and almost-suicidal despair. How long will he survive before his own madness and loneliness overtake him? Man by nature is a social creature and is not meant to be alone.*** warning, there will be spoilers so be on the lookout ***Definitely a must-read! It's gripping, intense, and thought-provoking. I couldn't put this book down until it was finished. It is possibly the best short story I've read! Forget the movie. The book is worth the read.Matheson's description of the psychological aspect concerning Robert Neville's struggle is superb. It is existentialist in nature with minimal dialogue throughout the story. It is mainly a story of contemplation, exploration, and survival. I think that is what I like best about it. It is not your typical horror story consisting of gore or action packed into 170 pages. It is bleak and retrospective, clearly written with the human condition in mind.As a reader, I felt Neville's anguish, depression, and anger. At moments I even questioned why he decided to live in a world that wanted him dead. Hell, I wanted a drink or two!When Neville meets Ruth with such skepticism, as the reader I wanted to knock him over the head and shout, \\"Get over yourself! Trust her!\\". I thought his paranoia was unfounded, until I read the ending.hook.line.sinker.It's depressing, yet poignant and appropriate. The concept that the infected humans evolved, making him the only non-infected human alive (and consequently a legend to be feared and hated like the vampires of old), is ingenious. Ironically, Neville accepted his fate as if he was tired of struggling and came at last to some sort of peace with himself and the infected. While I was sad, in a strange way I felt relief for him.In addition to all of this, I thought Matheson's scientific explanation for vampirism was creative. I didn't follow his logic, however, for how Neville was immune to the bacteria. It didn't make sense. I found myself glossing over that small detail though because it is such a well-written story. After all, when you're the last person on Earth and not a scientist, why does it matter?"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The very first post apocalyptic book i ever read. And one of the reason why i bought a Kindle and got into reading this genre whether its zombies taking over the bodies of the deceased or the after-effects of a nuclear (emp) holocaust. Like my title says, the book is a classic. The movie, on the other hand, should take notes from the book. Seriously, the book is practically a guide that the films failed to deliver."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Great Great Great Horror Story. had to read in one night to find out the ending. Re-read on occasion. The movie does this book by Matheson no justice. Love the story!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I am Legend was made into 3 movies, Vincent Price's \\"The Last Man on Earth\\", the Charlton Heston film \\"Omega Man\\" and the Will Smith film \\"I am Legend\\". Each of these movies are superb, yet the novel is different and better.The story is set in a post apocalyptic world and tells about Robert Neville, the last survivor of a mutant virus that turned all humans into evil vampires. Neville fights with depression as he deals with being alone, and is haunted by the vampires from outside his fortified home. Over several years, Neville kills the vampires in the day as they sleep. He experiments with different methods in repelling and killing vampires. A surprise ending, that pleases the reader."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Not quite done with the book but so far so good (only a few chapters to go). This is the 1st book I've read in a while. Three kids under three doesn't allow me to read as much as I would like to. If I didn't have distractions I can tell you it would be one of those books that you wouldn't be able to put down.This is worth a read IMO."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Robert Neville is, or at least he believes he is, the last man alive, the only person on the planet not killed by a plague. However, sadly for Robert, those who died didn't stay dead, they've been resurrected as vampires who hunger for Robert's blood. During the day Robert works on making his home a fortress, but he also uses mirrors and garlic to ward of the dead who won't stay dead. He's stocked up his house with food and classical music (records, not CDs - the book was written in 1954 after all).Neville is immune to what happened to the vampires and wonders why, so he starts going to the Los Angeles Public Library, where he researches viruses and bacteria and as he thinks he begins to understand what's going on he finds out he may not be the last person alive. There may be more.It's been years since I've read this book and I've written the above from memory, but I think I've gotten it pretty straight as the book made quite an impression on me. Matheson put me right in Neville's head, made me afraid. I felt Neville's loneliness, felt him all too well. Then there were the vampires, pretty bloody scary. It's a short book, but it's horror extraordinaire."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This novel provides an interesting look at the human instinct to survive. It also has interesting themes about xenophobia, civil rights, war, and microbiology all wrapped up in a rather far-fetched world swarming with ultra-violent vampires. I didn't really care for the narrator, and a lot of the \\"science\\" seemed pretty ridiculous, but I enjoyed this novel for it's atmospheric settings and it's willingness to push the \\"what if vampires were real\\" envelope about as far as it could have gone, given the book's production date."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The loneliness and despair of Robert Neville are thoroughly expressed and provided with slight imagery in this novel. The storyline falls on classic vampire stories along with real modern day science.Robert Neville is a man living in the late 1970's; alone. He seems to be the only living human on earth; after something had turned everyone else into bloodsucking living dead. He spends his time fixing and re-fixing his house, drinking, and trying to figure out exactly what these creatures are; how they work, and how they changed into such.To examine and comprehend the lives and motives of the \\"vampires\\", Robert researches tales such as Dracula; along with deep scientific experimentation books. The story at first seems to revolve only around the vampires and the reason of their existence, but the reader will see that throughout the story it is about one man struggling with surviving through not only the risk of death from the vampires, but from his own suicidal thoughts.I thought this book was well written and had a flowing and constant voice the entire way through; even through Robert's changes. It was interesting and hard to put down. The author, Richard Matheson, although he made it easy to follow, a person had to focus on the hidden details and thoughts of Robert to be able to solve the scientific cause of these vampires."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Book was purchased on two attractions: Forth-coming movie with Will Smith due around 12DEC07, and discount purchase offer.I am disappointed in this book!It is an incredible story, you can read the other reviews to see why; I would only echo the postive comments written by others.Then why only three stars? This edition nowhere states that this is a collection of short stories. The table of contents does not reflect that this is a collection of short stories. As you move into the short stories, the page headers still have \\"I AM LEGEND\\" on the pages. Hence, my gripe is with the format used to publish this book.So, awesome story (only read further if you have already read the story) however as you approach page 71 you wonder how Neville is going to escape, or if Mattheson is daring enough to carry on the story without his lead character. After Neville realizes he is Legend, your mind is predisposed to wondering how the next chapters will take shape.Interesting enough will be the movie: will they stay true to the story, or adapt the concept of this story to the movie and carry on after what the first 71 pages have offered.Don't misunderstand the review here: the following short stories are awesome, but after you finish the first, and try to realize how Neville is going to be mentioned again, only then does it dawn on you that I am Legend has already ended!Written in the 1950s or 70s I only hope that the movie adapts this era's genre in the film."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"1. Presentation: *4* I really didn't like the book cover. Not that I don't love Will Smith (I do and can't wait to go watch the movie!), but in book format it's very jarring to see him on the cover and then read how the author describes Robert Neville. So I made a little book cover so I wouldn't be forced to see the incongruity everytime I picked it up. It's a better poster picture than a book cover.Another thing was the front cover doesn't tell you that it's a collection of short stories. Which I knew but then forgot when I got the book. The table of contents made it seem more like chapters then new stories. So the ending of LEGEND lost its main point for me since I went straight into the next story not realizing LEGEND had already ended. User error, granted, but it would have been nice to have a little more warning of the short stories.2. Content: *5* Awesome. LEGEND was by far the best of the group. I wish it would have explained more of HOW the tides changed towards the end instead of summing it up in one word. But that's just a preference. It was well written and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I just wonder how they're going to stretch the movie to an hour and a half and if they'll keep the ending the same. Or most of the middle even. The rest of the stories were a little strange but not bad. I wish some of them had a little more content or explaination, but they were interesting little points to ponder in their own.Overall: Definately would recommend this book, regardless of the cover."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It's amazing how things change in fifty years. In the fifties, what used to be considered science fiction is now science fact.Technology has grown in leaps and bounds, views on the world have changed for the better, and for the worse, we've learned so much.And, of course, even here in North America, our culture has changed as well. Quite dramatically.Personally, I don't know why I am Legend was written. Was it a social commentary? Or was it merely a work of fiction written to entertain and make (back then), the author a few bucks?However, the main reason I chose to read this classic novel was based entirely on the movie of the same name starring Will Smith coming out on December 14th.Reading the novel was quick and easy. Actually, the novel was only a hundred and sixty pages out of 312 pages. The rest of the novel is a collection of short stories, ranging in length from a couple of pages, to forty or fifty pages.Some of the short stories were frightening, some humorous, some outright confusing.But the main novella in this publication was, of course, I am Legend.It's the story of the last man on Earth. Robert Neville is the only survivor of a plague that either killed, or turned the rest of humanity into vampires. Some of these vampires are living, some are dead. It does get a little confusing at times.It chronicles his life over a period of years, starting a few months after the end of humanity.The novella, at times, was hard to read. Richard Matheson was able to bring across, through the medium of word, the hopelessness, despair and loneliness the last human on Earth felt.Especially because he had to deal with the nightly siege of his refuge by the vampire hoards.In a way, it chronicles the death of one species, while witnessing the birth of another.On a side-note, the novella really showed its age. Even though it was supposedly set in 1976, it was originally written in 1954.Back then, nearly 54 years ago, married men and women still slept in separate beds (it's a wonder how any pregnancies occurred), women still wore dresses, and the men were the main breadwinners.And blacks were called something else. Not the derogatory term, the racist term, but still, a term that has long since fallen out of use in our society.So, from a society point of view, it is quite interesting to read it in modern times, to see how things were portrayed in the time of most of our parents or grandparents.For those of you who don't know, this will be the third film adaptation of the novel. The first was The Last Man on Earth, Starring Vincent Price, released in 1964. A few years later in 1971 it was shot as The Omega Man, which starred Charlton Heston.I personally have never seen the Vincent Price version, but if I get a chance, I will try to remedy that. Although I have seen The Omega Man and found it entertaining.From what I remember of the Omega Man, the novella and the movie have very little in common. If memory serves, the character portrayed by Heston was a researcher working for the military, who survives the plague that kills off most of humanity by injecting himself with the only known cure for it. There are those who did survive this plague however, and it turned these survivors into robe wearing, technology hating albinos, who want to kill him because he's the last \`pure' human.As I said, very little in common with the novella.I do recommend the novella to read, even though it does show it's age, albeit gracefully. I feel that in another fifty years it will still be poignant as it is today.An, of course, I am looking forward to see how close Will Smith's movie compares to the novel."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Awesome read that kept me curious throughout. I was surprised that the book also contains a collection of around 10 novella/short stories by the author after the main book. A Dark story that will stick with you."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This history is a classic one about vamps, and in my poit of view, the clever one besides Stoker's 'Dracula'.What will happend if all the humanity but one, transform in a blood-thirsty specie?Matheson will make you feel the anxiety of the last man on Earth.And, as a plus, this book includes a bunch of other well written histories from the author.Worth the money... and the chill down the spine."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"In 1976, the pandemic plague devastated the earth. Most people died while those who survived were biologically altered into nocturnal blood drinking in-humans. That is everyone except for one remaining purebred; Robert Neville never changed as he apparently was immune to the plague. He is the last surviving Homo sapiens, but the converted see him as being different as the monster tied to the dead legendary past who must die. He endures his ordeal through alcohol, but his loneliness is driving him insane as each night he considers giving up until he meets his first non vampire friend since the disease, a dog fearful of him.This book actually contains a reprint of the 1954 classic novella I AM LEGEND in conjunction with an upcoming movie (note that Vincent Price starred in the 1960s film The Last Man on Earth based on this tale) and ten short stories that are entertaining and well written, but feel like padding to almost double the size of the book. Readers will understand why some of the great horror writers like Stephen King consider this novella one of the best ever as it crosses science fiction with horror yet holds up well because the bottom line is this is a character study of the human need for companionship as well as a Frankenstein like question as to just who is the monster?Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Sure, I will admit that I Am Legend was one of the better vampire stories I've read, but something was missing. I suppose I could say I'm among the readers who thought it was too short. When I picked up this book, I guess I was in a hurry or I overlooked something, but I didnt realize that I Am Legend is really just a short story among others in this book. And though the other stories are great, I only picked up this book for I Am Legend. Good story, interesting premise, but still it was over too fast. Maybe I'm speaking too soon, but the movie looks to be one of the few movies to surpass thier book counterparts.But we'll see."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I recentl purchased this book and all i could think of was wow.

It was very well written and I thought the concept was great. What a great ending! :)"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am Legend was a great story and a quick read and one of the best endings I've read in any novel. Just a great line and a well painted picture of the scene and the emotion. The rest of the short stories are very hit and miss. All of them paint a picture and put you in the story and really give it life, but the endings seemed flat or confusing. I understand that you're supposed to be left with questions and you should form your own thoughts, but I would prefer some idea about what's going on. That being said, if you buy this book for I Am Legend, you will not be disappointed and you'll find one or two other stories that make the book worthwhile outside of the title story."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Great story about loneliness (and vampires). I can\`t believed that it was written in 50\`s, it\`s very universal. Way better than the movie!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson is one of the greatest writers ever. Every single story in this book is haunting. \\"I am legend\\" is a terrific view into a post-apocalyptic survivors life from day to day and his struggles to survive and find companionship. \\"Hell House\\" is one of the best haunted house stories that will have you turning pages long into the night. Mathenson is wonderful!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"On those cloudy days, Robert Neville was never sure when sunset came, and sometimes they were in the streets before he could get back...\\"First off, let me start this review by saying: Do not let the god-awful recent cover or the terrible movie adaptation prevent you from reading this story. Really, the only thing that the recent blockbuster movie and this classic piece of literary fiction have in common is the title and the main character's name.Yes, this book rests in the horror section, but don't let that deter you either. Written in 1954, this dystopian novella was and is a literary achievement and beyond brilliant in its allegorical portrayal of the evolution or rather the devolution of society.In the mid 1970's, the aftermath of war brings sandstorms to California and with it a plague. Over the next few years time, the world is cast back into the dark ages, and the entire population is decimated, leaving in its wake legions of vampiric creatures, stalking the night in search of fresh blood. Robert Neville is immune and the only survivor.Now what makes this story so absolutely brilliant is that the focus is not on the creatures but on the psychological drama that unfolds as Robert Neville not only tries to survive but tries desperately to maintain his sanity and his humanity. Robert Neville is not some highly educated scientist with a high-tech lab in his basement. He is an average man, with conflicts and limitations. Page after page, we feel his struggle. We feel the hatred building within him, we feel the loneliness, and we feel the futility. We relive Neville's shattered life through his heart-wrenching reminiscences, and we desperately reach for hope through his interludes of madness. This is an age-old story: Man's search for the Grail. Human need fuels Neville's quest - He needs to know how and why this happened. He spends his days in the library and his nights performing crude experiments. Is the vampire legend real? Is it a virus? Can he stay alive and lucid long enough to find out? Neville is a man obsessed, tormented by the very idea of his own existence. He must hunt them by day and kill every last one of them to stay alive, but in the end, Neville finds that the world has changed around him: a world where he is not the hero but the monster.I can't reveal too much without spoiling the end, but the title of the story has profound significance. Matheson is one of the finest fiction writers of all time and has influenced many other writers including Dean Koontz and Stephen King. Those of us who love the literary aspects of the horror genre will find no fault with his work. I would even put this story up in the ranks with Frankenstein or Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde simply for its profound social commentary. I am Legend is truly the essence of Dark Romanticism with Poe and Lovecraftian elements weaved throughout. The writing is quick and engaging, very up close and personal, subtle, and not graphic. This is after all a character study. Neville's internal struggle is palpable. The depth of emotion is mortally wounding, and the philosophy - terrifying.Other books by Matheson that have had truly spectacular movie adaptations made of them are: Stir of Echoes and What Dreams May Come. Both are favourites of mine. Sad to say that the movie versions - all of them - of I Am Legend just don't even come remotely close to the true essence of the story. If I had to say, 28 Days Later is by far the best and most psychologically accurate in it's adaptation of the work, but with writing this good, who needs a movie."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"After seeing the movie, I wanted to know more, so I picked up the book. I discovered this is actually a short story & was totally different than the movie.Like a lot of books, the story starts out in the present. However, Matheson did not delve into the past's details & when he did, it wasn't quite the chronology I was expecting -- which sets this novel apart. Also, I think Matheson portrayed the main character wonderfully! I love that he was so rough & flawed, but this also made the character more real to me. I also enjoyed the sporadic dialogue the main character had with HIMSELF -- the dialogue kept the book from being monotonous. Thought-provoking read with enough emotional & scientific-based depth to keep me interested."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It's really hard to believe this book was written in the 50's. You can clearly see where modern post apocalyptic books/movies are getting their ideas from. I am Legend is very well written, the author does a very good job of placing you in the mindset of the main character Robert Neville. If you enjoy all of the similar books/movies that have been released recently, you will most likely appreciate this book.-Graf Exum"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This was a great book!! It is so much better than the movie. Also the movie had changed the story way too much. If you saw the movie and then read the book, you will be disappointed in the movie. Also its interesting to note that this book was written in 1954 and takes place in 1976. Also the ending was interesting. Included in this book is not only the story \\"I am Legend,\\" but also contains other short stories created by Richard Matheson. But I would definently recommend this to anyone who was interested by the movie and want to read the actual book which is way better."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It's funny that our hero is blond and blue eyed while the movie has a black man. Really good story though. I hesitated to read it because I'm not into zombies or vampires but this was surprisingly good and not what I expected. A good story of survival.8-1-10: After actually seeing the newest version of this movie with Will Smith a couple of months ago, I was blown away. I have gained respect for Will Smith as an actor! I have now seen all three versions of this movie and I believe this one is better than Charleton Heston's Omega Man. Of course, they always change the endings. I expect they'll do another version in 20 years. Thank goodness, the book remains the same. Without ruining the ending I can only say it has to do with evolution and human DNA."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This story is almost completely different from the movie. The basic idea is the same, but the actual movie interpretation is a departure from the original story. Which is fine with me, I think the book and the movie are both great. The book was written a long time ago, and is more of a short story than anything at only about 160 pages. The movie was great, too. As usual, when Hollywood takes a book and turns it into a movie they use a lot of poetic license. If you want to kill a couple of hours, read this. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I saw \\"I Am Legend\\" the movie with my fiancee at the theater in January. We both liked the movie, and after watching it, we went across the street to the video store to rent a couple of movies for the night. The clerk there was very informative and told us that the movie was \\"Somewhat\\" based on the book of the same name. Being the curious type, I bought the book, and read it.The differences are very obvious, and I won't point them out for those of you that want to read the book if you've seen the movie or see the movie if you've read the book.I will say that I think the book is superior (Aren't they always?) to the movie. There were some times in the movie that gave me the creeps, but the book gave me the creeps all the way through. It's a very psychological thriller of a book.The book is short as well. In my copy, the story \\"I Am Legend\\" only runs 159 pages, and is an easy read. My copy also has several short stories by Matheson after \\"I Am Legend\\", and these stories are entertaining too."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The story that started it all. 'I Am Legend' is the classic story that inspired countless zombie movies and stories, despite being technically about vampires. This is not just about monsters, but human nature, the environment, and our future in an evolving scientific world. This book also contains several short stories by Matheson that are exceptional. A must read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I have always been a huge vampire fan, and I think this is my favorite vampire story of all time. The pace is quick, and you are thrust into the story from page one. There is a lot of intelligent speculation on the part of the character as far as his situation of being the last human left in a world of vampires. This is appropiate though, as he is the only character in the story, and the book still has a very fast pase that can leave you wanting more at the end. This story has some elements of &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;The Stand,&quot; and if you liked those and like vampires you will enjoy this story."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is the first book I have ever read by Richard Matheson, I am impressed! From the very first chapter of this book I found myself feeling what the main character felt and wanting what the main character wanted. The book will keep you enthralled until the end, Oh, and what an ending!!If you like vampire stories you will love this! I highly recommend!!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Drag your soul through the mud. One of the most compeling and disturbing books I've ever read. Not for the suicidal or depressed. Matheson creates a castaway without hope of rescue, a protaganist whose suicide would seem a victory. This is not your father's horror novel."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"When most of us imagine vampire lore, we often connect the word immediatly to novels such as Dracula, by Bram Stoker, or The Vampire Chronicles (Interview With the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, The Body Thief, The Vampire Aramand, etc.), by Anne Rice. Novels of the vampire have entirely based upon the lore originally set by Bram Stoker. Matheson offers to us a new view of the vampire and how they came to be. The year is 1974, Robert Neville is the last surviving man on Earth after a plague had swept over the world obliterating the entire human population and reforming it in to a planet where the vampire is the dominant race on Earth, the human an endagered species. Every passing day, Robert Neville battles against the creatures that stalk the night growing garlic or creating stakes. Every night he is forced to drown out the calls of the vampire's from the comfort of his home fighting his very sanity as he loses himself in his drinking. One must admire Matheson for the development of the vampire. As most authors attribute it to some form of ancient evil, Matheson places it upon a biological mishappening. Anyone who shares interests in vampire literature most purchase this novel. It is perhaps one of the greatest vampire novels of the 20th century. It is a pity that the novel is roughly only 200 pages."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I first saw the movie &quot;Last Man on Earth&quot; starring Vincent Price on TV in the 60's when I was 9 which was based on this book. A teacher in Junior High School recommended this book and I read it one sitting and it blew me away. Tightly written, it captures an atmosphere that one will never forget. The plausibility of being the only one (or one of the few) to survive a horrible plague is haunting and Matheson captures it here in this novella. It is one of the very few books that I reread and each time it is just as powerful. This book, I have noticed has been mentioned in several works of fiction. In one Mystery, where books is the main theme, a retired cop who is a book lover, has a conversation with the owner of an Used Book Store, and the owner describes &quot;I am Legend&quot; as the scariest book ever written. I have to agree."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"According to Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary:legend: &quot;1a. a story coming down from the past; esp: one popularly regarded as historical although not verifiable. b: a body of such stories c: a popular myth of recent origin d: a person or thing that inspires legends&quot;A classic story about vampires conquering the human race, and the last (maybe?) human battling it out against the monsters. The story is riveting for several reasons. The persistence and continuously hard-fought survival of the human compelled me to cheer and root for him throughout the novel. His emotional turmoil and reflections about society draw me into the book and make me feel sympathy and a great deal of fear for him. The story is written so well, with the ever-present question looming over the main character and always in the minds of the readers: is he the last one? If he is the last one, and he dies, does the human race essentially become a legend; that which exists only in popular myth...that humans existed once but that such truth is not verifiable? Does the protagonist essentially become a legend as the last of his kind, living out his days as an inspiration to others?"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It inspired NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. It changed the way we see vampires (no longer counts in castles), and practically invented zombies (no longer voodoo victims). It even made a young Stephen King pick up a pencil and begin scrawling out horror stories.I AM LEGEND is without a doubt one of the most powerful, influential and important horror tales ever woven. Like Stoker, Poe, Bierce, Shelley, Lovecraft and Stevenson, Matheson's work is mandatory reading for any true fan of dark literature. No movie could ever (despite two attempts so far) capture the brillant terror of this book, and no other books by Matheson, although all of them are excellent (Hell House, 7 Steps to Midnight, ect.), are as good as this one. It is more then worth the money, for it is a book you will read more then twice!If you enjoy King, Clive Barker, Poppy Z. Brite, William Peter Blatty or Ramsey Campbell, you will shriek for Matheson,... and vice versa."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"i found this old weird looking 1950's paperback of my dad's and read it, it was getting on in the day, and reading this book as the sunset neared, i grew very edgy. i was alone in my sister's apartment reading about this unbelievable world and setting. i just can't believe how mattheson can write cliffhangers, my favorite part was him describing the protanganist's favorite hobby was looking for his undead neighbor to kill him. also amazing when the protaganist was experimenting with killing the undead and he realizes his watch had stopped.... jesus just the best. my commentary doesn't do it justice, but he painted a mood so hopeless and dreary..... i will leave it at that."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"From the claustrophobic beginning, to the exciting &amp; unexpected ending this book delivers. A central character you get to care about &amp; set-pieces that are crying out to be shot on film ( the encounter with the vampires while racing back to his home in the station wagon had me gripped!). The Omega Man is a very poor indicator of the impact and excitement of this novel. Cannot recommend it high enough. A thoroughly deserved 5 stars!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"There are three milestones in the development of Vampire lore. Bram Stoker began the whole thing with Dracula, and Stephen King ushered in the modern incarnation with his 'salem's Lot. This seminal work by Matheson, originally published in 1954, is the middle stage, bringing Vampires out of thier Victorian beginnings and into a familiar, urban setting.The story tells the tale of Robert Neville, the last man on Earth. Thanks to a world-wide plague, he is now holed up in his fortified house, at night holding off the attacks from the zombiefied vampire populous, at day roaming a deserted city methodically rooting out and dispatching his sleeping foes.This is a true revisionist version of the swave, Bela Lugosi bloodsucker. Neville is a proper British practicioner of logic, and as he puzzles through what is going on, the entire vampire legend is sussed-out with proper scientific method. And as the legend is deconstructed, we also see the wonderfully drawn Neville travel through a heartbreaking character arch as he comes to grips with the vast solitude he can't decide is worth living through or not.Influential is a label often given to this story, and it's not hard to see the fallout it has created with the authors in the horror genre today. Filling out the book are several other, shorter tales created by Matheson, some of which fly higher than others, but are all entertaining to read. Matheson was a contributer to Rod Serling's classic anthology series The Twilight Zone, and reading these stories makes it easy to see why. They are extremely well-crafted, accessable and leave a lasting impression on the reader. I Am Legend made it to the screen in two versions: one as an entry in the Charleton Heston 70's SF sweepstakes called The Omega Man, and the other a much more faithful adaptation made in the early 60's called The Last Man on Earth, starring the venerable Vincent Price. Both are worth seeing, but even the creepier Last Man pales in comparison to the source material. Read it and the other stories and see how Matheson laid the foundation for the modern horror/suspense market."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I only read I am Legend and not the ten short stories that follow in this edition of the book, so my review will only be of the one story I read and not the book as a whole.I am Legend is considered by many as a classic horror story. I previously saw the movie adaptation starring Will Smith and let me warn you now, that movie is nothing like the book. It was very strange seeing Will Smith on the cover of this book while reading about Robert Neville who is very different, physically and mentally than the character Smith portrayed.I am Legend is a not-sexy vampire book, closer to Salem's Lot (King calls I am Legend an inspiration for him) than the plethora of vampire romances today. Robert Neville is the only real focus of the book, being the last remaining non-vampire in the world. We see what he does all day, what he remembers of the past and his attempts to figure out a cure. The vampires are scary, but scarier still is the utter aloneness Neville lives with and his desperation to have someone to share this hell with.I really thought I knew where this story was going, but the last third of the book really shocked me. Having seen the movie did nothing to warn me of what was to come as the book and movie are so vastly different. I found the book to be scarier, but the movie was slightly more entertaining if it's really fair to compare them at all. I am Legend is a must read classic vampire tale with nothing in common with its movie adaptation."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The book which started it all. Published in 1954, it has been the basis of no less than 4 movies, the most well known of which was the 2007 Will Smith vehicle.This is the original apocalyptic novel of the 1 man against the horde story. In this case, it's the story of Robert Neville alone in a post pandemic world of vampires. Everyone else is dead and he alone fights against them, it's humanity against the vampires and he represents humanity. It's like Robinson Crusoe, except Robinson Crusoe with vampires on the island. I won't repeat the plot here because it is so well known.In fact, I would say this book is ground breaking. One thing which is less known is that George A. Romero admitted that his zombie movies was inspired by this book too, substituting zombies for vampires. Seeing that Romero's movie was the idea behind all the zombie movies that came after, this book was the grandfather behind them all.Even though this book was written in 1954, it is quite easy to read. It's a very solid book and like many books of it's day, there is even a story within a story inside it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I LOVE this book. I completely disagree with those who say it 'ends abruptly'... I don't understand that at all. I think it has a beautiful, very powerful and affecting ending; where it is very clear what has happened, and what is about to happen. I wish I could say more, but that would ruin it! Please don't judge this book by any of the film adaptations, they are awful and not at all faithful to this superbly written novel. I love, love, loved it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Many reviewers have described the greatness of this story and its influence on modern writers. I wanted to offer my viewpoint as a reader who had seen the movie first. I initially avoided the book because I felt that the movie, while entertaining, was shallow with an uninteresting story. However, the positive reviews finally convinced me to give it a shot and I am glad that I did.The character portrayed by Will Smith is a brilliant man who is the cause of the epidemic and also the eventual savior of the human race. The character from the book is a much more interesting and relatable one. He is just an average man who struggles to survive. Not only with the vampires, but also to motivate himself to complete the menial tasks required for his daily survival.The vampires portrayed in the movie are superhuman killing machines completely devoid of any perceivable intelligence. In contrast, the book's portrayal of the vampires is much more interesting. They retain many of their human qualities, including their intelligence, personalities, and physical capabilities. This allows for interactions far more interesting than those found in the movie.The conclusion found in the movie is very unsatisfying. It serves as a confirmation of the woman's belief that God had directed her actions, portends the rebirth of human civilization, and illustrates the triumph of the human spirit against all odds. All very common themes that deliver a boring result. The book's conclusion deviates drastically from the movie's. I don't want to ruin the ending, but I will say I found the final realization the main character is forced to accept very interesting and thought provoking.I encourage anyone to read the book regardless of their feelings on the movie. The book provides a deeper story and a much different take on the vampire genre than the one presented in the movie."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"First and foremost, anyone considering buying this book -- I speak specifically of the trade paperback edition with Will Smith on the cover -- should be advised: the first half of the book is the short novel \\"I AM LEGEND\\" and the second half is a collection of unrelated short stories by Richard Matheson. Nothing on the cover, title page, preface, etc. clues you in to that fact. In the front matter, if you look carefully, you'll see all the stories listed with different copyright dates. That's the only hint that the 300+ pages of this book are not entirely devoted to a full-length novel entitled \\"I AM LEGEND.\\"That out of the way, I enjoyed this. The novella (@ 150 pages... maybe 30,000 words) \\"I AM LEGEND\\" was interesting. It's much more about human isolation than monster-fighting, with Robert Neville as a bi-polar Robinson Crusoe rather than a cheeky tough-guy Will Smith. I'm not a big horror fan, but Matheson is one of the granddaddies of the genre, and you can see why here. His writing is taut and engaging, with human pathos and creepy scares woven together. The short stories tucked in here give you a nice overview of his work -- from the comic to the disturbing -- again making it clear why the likes of Stephen King and Dean Koontz worship at Matheson's altar.One wonders why the publisher felt they needed to hide (no other word for it) the fact that this book is an anthology and not a singular novel. If you like the Will Smith movie and want to read the book, would you really be put off by seeing \\"...and Other Stories\\" on the cover? Sadly, that may well be true. Short stories simply do not sell like novels. Too bad, because if -- like me -- you don't know much about Richard Matheson, this book, with its famous short novel and lesser-known short stories, is an excellent intro.- mattmchugh"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I am one of those who will admit to have liked the Omega Man film in the '70s. I was mildly initially dissapointed with Will Smith's \\"I am Legend\\" because of the ending, but was sold on the alternate version on the DVD. When I reviewed the film, a woman asked me if I had read the book and I had not. I asked my dad about the book as he has a huge library, and he offered me his first edition paperback from the '50s (with the $.035 price on the cover), I was excited, but ended up turning down the offer, as I didn't want to break the aged binding. This week I finally got a new copy and read it. It is a completely different story than either of the films, for example, Robert Neville is not an Army Doctor, he is in fact a factory worker. And there are actually vampires in the story, not just vampire like people.The short version is this, this is a very good story (if a bit sad), it was written as a sci-fi, but the future of the book is 1976, and the tech was a bit out of date even for '76, but what can you do? It was published in 1954. If you have an afternoon to spend on a good novella, give \\"I am Legend\\" a try."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"In fact the book was out before the movie, by some 60 years! I am Legend is a short story of classic horror from the 50's. So short in fact to say much of the story will give away lots of the novella.The current cover showing Will Smith from the movie I am Legend does this book a disservice. The two stories are not the same beyond the basic survivalist premise, and the movie ending is nothing like the book ending - I love the book's ending MUCH more, such a great hook.The novella is well worth the reading if you want a little horror thrill from the 50's and can be read in a single sitting. Also when you pick this book up you are actually getting two stories; so when I say short, I am Legend is short, make no mistake."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is one of those rare cases where I saw a movie before I read the book it was based on. I enjoyed the film with Will Smith, but it was totally different than the book. To me, the film was more about the triumph of the human spirit; one man fighting for humanity. The book is more of a philosophical examination of what it means to be normal - part of the majority. Matheson chose vampirism to be his plague, but really, he could have chosen anything. The question becomes, is a person still normal when the rest of the world is different, is it right to keep fighting against change?Robert Neville is perhaps the last man on earth. He has barricaded himself in his house, and each night it is surrounded by vampires waiting for their prey to emerge. He wrestles with not only survival, but his very sanity. He needs a purpose to keep going, and finds it in a search for answers. Vampires were legends - but perhaps they were real all along. What causes vampirism? Is it just a bacteria? If so, how does he explain their fear of religious artifacts? The novel is written almost like a journal of Neville - only in third person. There is a lot of descriptions of what he does day to day, what he is thinking (or trying not to think about). Gradually, pieces of the past are put together for the reader to see how he came to be alone for 3 years. In the novel, there are 2 types of vampires - those infected but still alive, and the undead. The difference between them is crucial to the resolution of the story - though not necessarily in the way a reader may expect (or the way the movie ended). In the movie, the vampires are ravening, seemingly mindless creatures that the audience can easily side with Neville against. In the novel, they are intelligent and see Neville as a threat to their existence. Who has the right to survive?I think what made the novel most worth reading was finding out just what the title meant. The movie never explains it - the book makes it pivotal. Overall, the book is very slow (much like the movie) but makes a reader think more about what is happening than simply watching one man try to survive. And I highly recommend it - if only to know the ending that really needed to occur.Given that I Am Legend is a short novel, this edition is very nice for the inclusion of several other Matheson short stories. Even though Will Smith doesn't look like Neville as described in the book, I'm still happy to see him on the cover!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am Legend is Richard Matheson's short novel about the only survivor of a plague that has made everyone else on earth into something like zombie vampires. It is a foundational novel in the post-apocalyptic genre of science fiction and horror, and has been made into a movie three times: The Last Man on Earth (1964), with Vincent Price, The Omega Man (1971), with Charlton Heston, and I Am Legend (2007), with Will Smith. Of these, The Last Man on Earth follows the novel most closely.Matheson's style often seizes on the mundane details of the situation, at times without apparent value to the story, but the overall effect is suspenseful, in large part because Matheson takes the reader inside the main character Neville's mental imbalance. Throughout the book, Neville is not only in danger from the vampires, but also from himself.This edition contains ten Matheson short stories, ranging in genre from horror to suspense. None of them are as good as I Am Legend, but a few of them are genuinely creepy and others show Matheson's knack for exploring the disturbed minds of his characters. The reader will also notice a few of Matheson's writing preferences (he loves to use the word \\"funereal\\", and he frequently describes characters' mouths as \\"gashes\\").Like or not, books like I Am Legend are responsible for the now over-played zombie genre. Here, at least, it's done originally, and done well.RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"For many, this will be the only taste of Matheson.... this story is a good example of his style. He is very descriptive of scene - If you were around in the 50s/60s you can immediately picture the den, the mural on the wall, the bar!!! Even the colors come through... In addition to his ability to draw us into his environment, the flow of the story and the thoughtfulness of his science... getting from point A to B is just awesome!! There is very little need to extrapolate. He puts the framework right there - and in as spare a style as possible. The shock of realization and the wave of understanding at the end of the story are indescribable.Obviously, the main story is why most folks buy the book, but I highly recommend that you give the other shorter stories a try also. I guarantee that they will stick with you. The fetish doll story is a classic and my personal favorite was 'Witch War', a three page story that still haunts me! Oh yes, 'I am Legend' is a great story, but don't forget the rest of the book - you will not regret it.All the best,Jay"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I am Legend is arguably the greatest short horror novel ever written, and its influence on the horror genre has been profound. Stephen King and many other of today's masters rank this book highly in their personal top ten lists of favorites. It is a short novel that can be read in one sitting; it is hard to put down, building in intensity from start to finish. Matheson creates an entirely new type of vampire fiction herein. Transcending the traditional vampire tale, he adds science fiction elements to produce a refreshing new interpretation of Stoker's legend. The most fascinating part of the story is the protagonist's (Richard Neville's) attempts to explain the legendary aspects of the vampire myth in scientific terms. His discovery of a bacterium, which he dubs vampiris, as the true source of vampirism struck me anew reading the novel again after the events of September 11, 2001. Although we only get pieces of the story regarding the outbreak of the vampiric plague, including a reference to bombings, it can easily be seen as the fruits of germ warfare. Neville even conjectures that the Black Death of the Middle Ages was caused by this same vampiris germ, and he extrapolates facts and ideas from that history in his attempts to understand why such defenses as garlic, crosses, and stakes driven into the heart actually are effective against the hordes of undead creatures menacing his own time. He studies academic texts and conducts experiments with the blood of these creatures, which is the means by which he identifies the bacterium. The essence of garlic has no effect on the germ when injected into a blood sample, which initially he is unable to explain, but he later is able to explain garlic's effectiveness. Less scientific tests lead him to conclude that crosses are only effective against &quot;Christian&quot; vampires; the cross has no meaning to for vampires who were once Jews and Moslems, but sacred symbols of those religions, such as the Torah and the Koran, do. All of these scientific tests and speculations are just fascinating.Neville is essentially the last man on earth, and the loneliness of his situation is the central part of the story. Matheson is able to communicate Neville's emotional feelings vividly, making him very real. We gradually acquire the story of the deaths of Neville's wife and daughter, essentially experiencing the pain he goes through when these memories overcome him. We watch him drink himself into a stupor as each night finds him besieged in his fortified house, surrounded by vampires, including his old friend and neighbor, calling for him to come out. We watch him slowly lose his grip on sanity and come very close to giving up. Then, however, we watch him overcome his depression and courageously fight to live in the nightmare world he is trapped in. The scenes with the dog he finds are full of emotion and really gripped this reader. This is Neville's first contact with nonvampiric life, and his attempts to befriend and help the poor creature (at the same time finally finding a companion) touched me greatly and brought tears to my eyes. His eventual discovery of another human being like himself is also powerful and emotional, although to speak more about this aspect of the story is to risk giving something away to the future reader.This is a story of one man overcoming all obstacles and fighting to defend his way of life and his very humanity. The novel deals with the human condition, the essential ingredient to effective horror writing. Neville struggles constantly with his doubts and fears, particularly as he commits acts that he would have condemned as barbarous in the time before the plague. His needs for companionship of any kind offer us a clear image of the inner soul of man. By the end of the story, he does indeed become legend, both in his world and in ours."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This novel, although short, is absolutely outstanding.While this book is advertised as one of the best vampire novels of all time, it is really not about the vampires at all, but about a man. This is the story of what one man can endure, what his limits are, how much he can accept, and what will happen when he goes too far.Yes, there are vampires in the book, and yes, he does hunt them by day, but it's not an action story; the suspense is more pyschological. This is also one of the more different vampire books you will ever read.Somewhat short and written precisely, words are not wasted here, and the beauty and simplicity of the language is part of the appeal that this book holds. Robert Neville is an amazingly real character, and the ending of this book is perfect. While I have not yet read the multiple other stories by Matheson in this volume, I Am Legend alone is worth the cover price."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"SO BUY THIS BOOK!This is where it all started. The pioneering work that later inspired George Romero's \\"Night Of The Living Dead\\" and Stephen King's \\"Salem's Lot\\" and every other tale of a normal human being fighting against the odds in a world gone mad with the hungry hordes of the undead.Matheson, a TV writer (most notable work, \\"The Twilight Zone\\"), places us in a world where a mysterious virus has not only killed off virtually ever other man, woman and child but causes them to return as zombielike vampires intent on only one thing... to drain the blood of the living. Matheson's hero holds up in his old family home, now a battered fortress assaulted nightly by what were once his friends and neighbors and who have become the walking dead intent on taking hold and devouring him. He, in turn, waits until the morning light and searches out there hiding places in order to destroy the revenants when they are at their most vulnerable. A one man army, who is patiently, skillfully ridding his world of this vermin.Fortunately, in one of his sweeps he finds that there is another who is doing the same thing. He is not alone in the world afterall.Unfortunately, this other wants to destroy him as well.Matheson wrote a thinking man's horror novel. He touches on that feeling of alienation and loneliness that pervades so much of our modern world. A world that places us as pawns, used (and often victimised) by the science and technologies of our own creation. However, Matheson also inspires in the reader a feeling of hope and fighting back even if the odds are staggeringly against us. He appeals to the survivalist instincts that every healthy, normal man and woman possess. He builds the anger in us to strike back and overcome the menace to our existence.Two movies made were based on \\"I Am Legend\\": \\"The Last Man On Earth\\", starring Vincent Price and the classic, \\"Omega Man\\", starring Charleton Heston. Neither of these came close to the quality of this novel. This book is essential reading and keeping for every horror fan, especially us zombie fanatics. Now go order this book!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Robert Neville is he who strives for perfection, he whose goal is to soar among the stars with the angels on high; Neville is the man who, despite everything, has fallen into the eternal charnel pit of the soul. The bleakest and farthest regions of the dismal are his and his alone. How then did Neville come to this winter of discontent? How then did he, who sought the beautiful, become the ugly? His lustrous silver wings melted in the shining sun that he blindly mistook for redemption and when it was too late to save himself he fell like a beautiful yet poignantly destructive shooting star plummeting to earth in a ball of unquenchable fire.In the latter days of the latter years hidden in the home of his oblivion, he has come full circle pondering over the joys and the discontents of a \\"normal\\" life that like the best of fiction is so believable yet so totally alien. Yes, truly he is Icarus dying, the embodiment of dead hopes and dreams and the paragon of destruction. Yes, truly he is the aching longing that will never be fulfilled, the imagined sound of a loved one calling in the midst of a dream. He, and he alone, is the bright and shining hope that failed. He is alive in body only for the soul has fled. Is he any better than the living dead that haunt him so, the mythical vampires who, sadly, turned out to be so real? Those miserable souls of legend that were tortured into an eternity desiring to be with their brethren yet destroying all those who were near. In a dead and howling world, Neville is all that survives to remember what civilization was once like before the virus came, the mysterious virus that turned the world into a legend. In this sea of pain, Neville must make his way alone embracing the eternal solitude amongst the wailings of the damned, but the vampires have a little surprise for Neville that might just change everything. Fly Neville, fly on your beautiful wings and touch the sun before you fall to earth, incinerated and desolate. Goodbye Neville. . .I Am Legend is a poignant narrative conducted by the forlorn Neville, the only man left standing among the charred ruins of a formerly grand civilization . . . our civilization. All those that have gone before him have returned only they are not the same. They want blood for sustenance and in the deepest pits of the night they await Neville, their eternal hunger gnawing away at their humanity. And so, Neville's long journey through the bleak passages of the heart begins and we, the public of readers, join Neville wishing that we could reach out and grant him comfort because Neville's forced loneliness, his desire to see another human, his desire for his dead wife, is truly heart wrenching making the desolate, apocalyptic aura of the book come alive filling the reader's heart and soul with Neville's undying pain. Neville is a narrator that demands sympathy. The author's emulation of a classical, gothic horror style requires the audience to understand Neville's mental degeneration as he seeks solace in whisky and music as the damned howl outside his door. We love him because in him humanity is portrayed at both its best and its worst and his continual flashbacks remind the audience how temporarily life can be and how easily everything that is good, that is noble, can be suddenly ripped away from our grasp. While the tale echoes science fiction, the real story of one man's pining for a life that will never return is what makes the tragedy so forceful, and so believable. Yes Neville, we shed a tear for you because in your bleak existence we see our own moments of pain and loneliness and because of your humanity we are overcome with compassion.Likewise, the drama of the plot echoes Neville's degeneration as his slow, bleak days and lonely black nights plod by and he gives himself away to contemplation, flashbacks, and the false hope promised in the bottom of a bottle. However, everything is about to change as our hopeless hero is overcome with one life mission: he must finally understand the reason behind his enforced agony, he must understand the gruesome plague, he must teach himself the mysteries of medicine and perhaps, in his quest for knowledge, redemption from loneliness will be found. As Neville finally finds a mission in life, a reason to live again, the world starts to shift and his lonely days are suddenly interrupted by an enigmatic woman. What could this mean? Is it salvation, a mirage from a dying mind, or a sinister prelude? Neville cannot decided and so the plot spirals eternally downward, dragging Neville into a shocking climax where the truth of the legend is finally revealed, leaving the reader breathless and tearful. Yes Neville, we hear the pain in your grim requiem.Richard Matheson, the author, has a wonderfully poetic and metaphoric style that combine to bring Neville's bleak world into a shocking, surrealistic picture before the reader's mind. Originally penned in the 's, I Am Legend echoes the literary style of the classics allowing the readers to care deeply for Neville due to the concentration on characterization and the exquisitely beautiful manipulation of the English language. Matheson's eloquent, descriptive language and his evocation of emotion combine to entrance the reader.A note to those who have seen the movie:Although, I Am Legend: The Movie was \\"based\\" on this novel, the movie was not even remotely similar. The plot and some of the characters (including the woman and the dog) are not the same in the book as in the movie. Also, the deaths of both Neville's wife and his daughter are very different in the novel. Once the novel gets rolling, it becomes instantly obvious that the movie deviated massively from the original storyline, so don't expect the same plot. The novel, while very different, was still equally as enjoyable as the movie. I highly recommend both. The movie and the novel are both classics in the horror genre.Extras:This addition of I Am Legend includes several short stories from Richard Matheson including the following:Buried TalentsThe Near DepartedPreyWitch WarDance of the DeadDress of White SilkMad HouseThe FuneralFrom Shadowed PlacesPerson to PersonI Am Legend concludes at the half way mark of the novel on page 159 and the short stories begin, unannounced on page 160, at first causing the reader to falsely believe that they pick up Robert Neville's saga. For the most part the stories are rather unspectacular, possessing none of the author's insight into human nature and knack for implementing stunning literary phrases. The best stories are Mad House, The Funeral, and Person to Person. These three stand above the rest and break the general mold of boredom. Other than these three short stories, I would recommend that potential readers skip the other stories. They were only added to this addition to make the novel look fuller and thus attract more potential buyers.Conclusion:I Am Legend is a bleak testament to one man's isolation and his eternal longing for those who have gone before him. Thought provoking and highly emotional, this is not a novel to be missed. Days after Neville's last word has fallen neatly onto the last page, the readers are still casting their minds back to visit their forlorn friend. Yes Neville, although you thought you were no longer wanted in a dead world, you live on in our memory's museum. Emotional, descriptive, and highly imaginative, I Am Legend is a story that everyone can relate to. Unequivocally recommended.- Ravenova"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A long time ago, I saw &quot;The Omega Man&quot; and liked it so much that I sought out the book it was adapted from. &quot;I Am Legend&quot; was nothing like the Charlton Heston movie, but it was the best damn vampire novel I had ever read. Since reading the book, I have collected all of Richard Matheson's other novels and short story collections, but &quot;I Am Legend&quot; remains my personal favorites. Robert Neville's struggle to survive in a world of vampires robs him of his humanity, transforming him into a legndary boogyman, who stalks and murders the planet's new nocturnal citizens as they sleep. No true horror fan should go without reading this landmark novel. Matheson always leaves his readers wanting more, which is more than can be said for most of the post Stephen King bloated bestsellers."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Matheson's I AM LEGEND has been made into three bad movies:THE LAST MAN ON EARTH starred Vincent Price. Made back in 1964, it's the most faithful of the adaptations, but hindered by a very low budget.THE OMEGA MAN starring Charlton Heston, 1971, could charitably be described as \\"based upon\\" I AM LEGEND. Worst of the bunch.I AM LEGEND the big budget action movie starring Will Smith (2007) was reasonably faithful in an \\"amp it up and blow it away\\" manner, but continued the tradition of totally missing the ending. Hint: To see what Matheson was getting at with the ending, look at the title!Anyway, the book remains one of my all-time favorites. It's still the only book I've ever finished and then immediately returned to page one to read again!If you're expecting a \\"zombie gross-out\\" or anything along those lines, you'll be disappointed. There's suspense a'plenty, but mainly it's a personal drama as Robert Neville strives to find meaning in a world in which he no longer belongs.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"When I bought this book I assumed the entire contents were a novel called I Am Legend. I was quite surprised when about half-way through the novel it became a short story and ended. The remainder of the book is filled with Matheson's short stories in the horror genre. They are certainly quality reading in their own right, but they were not expected and therefore I was resentful while I read them! That said, the main story, I Am Legend, is well-written and haunting.The trailers of the movie adaptation of the book seem to convey a horror/scifi story about the last man on earth (and his dog). The book is quite different. It is really a story of grief, loneliness and the torturous effect of having and losing hope and gaining it back again, only to lose it. You get the idea.Matheson's protagonist, Robert Neville, is a blonde, blue-eyed sensitive every-man who was bitten by a vampire bat somewhere in Central America sometime in his unexplored past. This is never developed so we don't know why he was in Latin America. We just know that this event somehow inoculated him against a pandemic that turned the entire human race into regular dead (like, stayed dead)and \\"undead.\\" These are not zombies, per se, but rather thinking human beings who have become single-minded predators with a need for living blood. Yes, vampires.Most of the story takes place in a fortified house where Neville is safe from the blood-thirsty neighbors. The reader feels his anger and loneliness and the writing is nuanced enough to make you pause and wonder if you would be able to maintain the will to live under the same circumstances. Some of the key storylines involve a ragged dog that wanders into Neville's world, his self-taught science experiments with infected blood and efforts to develop a \\"cure\\", and his memories of his life with his wife and daughter, both of whom he had to toss into a large fire pit of burning dead people (that way they stay dead). One element that Matheson writes about very powerfully is the approach of night. Night is, of course, when vampires wake-up and kill things. Night is really the main villain in this story and its approach is the only element that affects Neville with bone-chilling fear. There are some very exciting moments when he is outside of his fortress and night is approaching too quickly for him to get back inside. As the years pass, and the story seems to span about five years, Neville becomes less and less able to experience his humanity. He has become a survival machine. The end of the story is, perhaps, the most compelling as it gives us a glimpse at evolution and a new form of human life. I won't spoil it by over explaining this, but it was interesting enough a proposal that I was irritated when the story ended just as the ideas was reaching development.It's worth reading and certainly is an amazing proposal about the possibility of the all-powerful human race brought to the edge of extinction by a virus -- particularly clever look for being written in the 50s."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Robert Neville is the lone survivor of a vampire plague which has wiped out most of earth's inhabitants. by day he single-handedly stalks the city laying undead to rest. At night he drinks himself into a stupor and listens to classical music. After 5 months alone Robert realizes that some of the legends about vampires are true and begins to seek scientific explanation. With all the time in the world, he reads books from the library and steals an expensive microscope to help him analyze the bacteria in the victims. This book reminds me a lot of Robinson Caruso. At first Neville rails against his loneliness, the vampires and the world in general... Eventually he develops a survivor mentality which allows him to deal with the situation. When Neville finds a dog things begin to look up... Can Robert survive humanity's near extinction or will he become the last survivor of earth's great plague?I read the book in anticipation of the movie in December starring Will Smith. I can't wait to see how this is treated in film. Neville is an interesting character who I took a while to get to like. Mostly because the first 1/4 of the novel he drinks, smokes, and feels sorry for himself (who wouldn't). I really warmed to the character once the dog arrived... Overall this was a compelling audiobook well narrated and worth a listen."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"As a child (and young teen) I'd had the opportuntity to see many of Richard Matheson's works converted into movies (Incredible Shrinking Man, Hell House, Last Man on Earth &amp; The Omega Man), but being an avid reader at heart I eagerly hunted his novels &amp; stories down one by one over many years...until at last I found his terrifying novel...&quot;I am Legend&quot;.Robert Neville, the hero of Matheson's brilliant work, is a tortured man living a life of loneliness, despair, frustration and paranoia. Driven into this existence by a genocidal plague that wiped out humanity, and the prowling vampires of the night that seek nothing more than to drain his flesh of every drop of his precious blood.Matheson so vividly conveys the terrible loneliness of Neville's plight and his monotonous existence trying to get through each solitary day...and each white knuckled, pulse pounding night. I found myself experiencing such a wide range of emotions reading this book...sadness, pity, anger, euphoria and symapthy....Matheson really outdid himself with this excellent piece of writing !By far and away one of my favourite fantasy novels...If you don't already own a copy....do so now ! You won't be dissapointed !"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I am astonished at the fact that this novel recieved any bad reviews. I can understand the fact that some readers felt cheated by the fact that the book included short stories after the novel, but this was simply an added bonus for any Matheson fans. Enough about other ratings, now I'll explain why I feel the book deserves five stars.The idea of the book alone is enough to make you try reading it. A plague has turned the Earth's humans into vampires, and there is only one man left.After hearing this idea some readers may be thinking that it sounds silly, or has been done before, but belive me; nothing like this has ever been done before. For many vampire novels, the author simply gives the vampires the traditional powers and weaknesses, (crosses, garlic, etc.) but Richard Matheson goes so far as to explain why all this is true. The explanations he gives, though they may seem far-fetched, are extremely plausible when Matheson describes them. It seems as if Matheson did a lot of scientific research for this novel, because his explanations of DNA are terrific.Finally, don't read this novel if you're just looking for a normal horror novel. Read it if you're looking for an intelligent, suspenseful tale of a world overtaken by vampires."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I was turned on to Matheson after watching Charlton Heston in the Omega Man years back, the movie based loosely upon the book, I Am Legend. You may find that the only regret from reading I Am Legend is the length of the story: It leaves you aching for more. What is particularly remarkable about Matheson is that he can compose a truly compelling story in so few pages, as he deftly details the tribulations of the last man alive in the world...or is he? Combining interpretations of vampire lore with an excellent interweaving of science fiction, Matheson achieves in his one main character greater fulfillment of plot, tension and irony than many horror or sci-fi authors are able to gain with a full cast. Positively riveting and fear inspiring, Matheson appeals to the reader emotionally as well: The chapter involving the protagonist and his relationship with a stray dog is heart breaking, but is evidence of what a truly fantastic author can do with the right material. Oh, and the killer ending....if you can't see this bittersweet conclusion play out in your mind's eye like a motion picture, you need to read this story again. Simply the best."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I'm not sure how I heard about this book, but I sure love the title. It's intriguing. So I read the novella about the last man left on Earth who fights vampires every night, and really enjoyed it. I enjoy reading Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, the series includes some of my all-time favorite novels, and I Am Legend, although much different, was effective at creating an atmosphere of dread and despair. The title comes into play on the very last page if I remember correctly, and the ending has stuck with me since I read the story a few months ago.Matheson's story is similar to a Stephen King story, and it is interesting to see how the main character survives every day in an empty world inhabited by vampires. I don't want to supply any plot spoilers, but the ending is fantastic, yet eery. Anyway, if you like vampires and a decent tale, then give it a try. Oh, the short stories included with the story are just OK."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Always a good writer, Matheson had at least three classic novels in him, and this is one of them.Dean Koontz usually gets the credit for creating the cross-genre novel, but he was predated by others, Matheson among them. I Am Legend redefined the vampire novel as science fiction, but it actually is even more complex than that. The story is richly layered and textured, highly adult and morally ambiguous. It is a medical thriller of the genre later made more famous by Michael Crichton and Robin Cook, a post-apocalypse novel, a commentary on Darwinism, and even a war story - Cold and Hot.The '64 AIP Vincent Price vehicle The Last Man On Earth was a faithful and effective adaptation of the book, though Matheson didn't like it any more than he did the far less faithful Warner Brothers remake ten years later, The Omega Man. Both movies are worth a look, for different reasons. But you owe it to yourself to read it as Matheson originally wrote it, if you really want to enjoy it to the max. I re-read it about a year ago, and was pleasantly surprised at how little dated it was. In fact, it's actually more up-to-date, in light of AIDS and concern over biological weapons."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I grew up look and reading anything about vampires.One night I saw a movie on tv title the omega man. I loved this movie. I found out that this movie was taken from the book I am legend. I had to find this book. I found the book at the age of 39. The book takes you into the life of the last man on earth. The last normal man for everyone else are vampires.The book take you on a ride into the mind and will of the last man on earth. This is a must read for a true vampire fan,and for fans of a good book.Anyone who thinks that they know the story from the omega man,and will not read the book are missing the story altogether. The movie can not touch the book in anyway."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Words cannot express how I enjoy this book, but I will certainly try. I have hunted for this book for years, ever since I saw the movie &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot; with Vincent Price. And when I finally found it, I wasn't disappointed. The book was better than the movie (of course)! Matheson draws you in with the haunting idea of the last man on earth in a world of vampires. Even though he attempts to discover the cause of the plague, many things are left unanswered, which only adds to the horror. I have read this book more times than I can count, and almost always in one sitting. As an aspiring author, Matheson has inspired me. I hope I can write a tale that will haunt readers as this one has me."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Although the title story of this book was good enough, it left me deeply disappointed when I reached the end (after only 170 pages!) On no spot, except a small area on the back cover (which many readers avoid to prevent spoilers) does it state that this is not a full novel, but an anthology of short stories. I felt especially sore after investing my twelve dollars on this softcover collection. I will not say that &quot;I am Legend&quot; was not a good story in and of itself, but when a reader anticipates another several hundred pages and turns the page and realizes the story had already ended, there is a sense of being cheated. Praise for the author's &quot;short story&quot;, but shame on the publisher for misrepresenting it's product and tricking the consumer!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The book basically consists of many different stories with I Am Legend in the beginning. There are over 300 pages in the book but only the first 160 pages are I Am Legend. After page 160 Matheson dives into about 10 or so shorter stories which have nothing to do with the main title of the book. I enjoyed I Am Legend and I found the short stories amusing but I found it kind of disappointing that I thought I payed for a full book about I Am Legend. I feel a little cheated considering the cover and the back of the book give no indication that the story only lasts for half the book. I would recommend to buy but just understand that the whole book has more than the main story."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I purchased this book/short story in anticipation of the upcoming Movie. Generally i like to read the book first, because most of the time, they are different, and the book is usually far better.This remains to be seen in this case. I cannot recommend this book, it starts out good, and it feels like it will build to a natural climax, but it does not, it kinda just fades away, and ends.I really hope the movie isn't the same. I paid $14 for this, and i'm disappointed. 170 pages is the short story, then the rest of the 300 and something pages is alternate stories. Don't be fooled at the size of the book itself! Off to ebay!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"My husband is a Richard Matheson fanatic and when I said I wanted to see the Will Smith movie of the same title, he told me to read the book instead. So I read his tattered 40-cent Bantam paperback and now I won't see the movie. They can't do it justice (besides Will Smith is not a blonde of German descent). Richard Matheson is a master storyteller, I could not put this book down. With his words I could feel the suffocation that Robert Neville felt being alone all the time, fighting for his life. He drank a lot but still managed to be very productive and never feel sorry for himself. He was a hunter, doctor, scientist, judge, jury and executioner. He somehow avoided the infection that killed or mutated everyone else, but then that became his downfall because the others saw him as the danger. The ending is incredible, Robert Neville becomes legend. This book is a must-have for any sci-fi or suspense fan."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"In 1954, Richard Matheson published a novel that would influence so many future generations of science-fiction and horror writers and film directors. Matheson's body of work prior to 1954 could be summed up as good but nothing too exciting. His work thus far overlapped such pulp genres as horror, science-fiction and fantasy. This style would be the hallmark of his brand of story-telling. This style could truly be seen in his epic and greatest work to date: I Am Legend.I Am Legend takes the vampire tale and brings it out of the shadows and darkness, so to speak. Set in the late 1970's, I Am Legend begins its tale with humanity pretty much on the quick path to extinction due to a pandemic where the bactirium or virus involved causes symptoms very similar to what folklore calls vampirism. The protagonist of this tale is one Robert Neville. An unassuming man living in a Los Angeles suburban neighborhood who may just be the only living human being, or at least the only un-infected one, on the face of the planet. Neville's been reduced to a day-to-day routine of defending his fortified home from the vampire-like infected humans who've tried attacking him and his home once night falls. This routine has become so ingrained in Neville that it starts him on a downward spiral to utter despair. He knows that he may just be the only human left and the prospect of such an idea almost becomes too much for his psyche.His attempts to solve the mystery of why he's the only one not affected by the disease becomes his way of keeping himself sane. Neville's work in trying to find the answer leads him to take chances in keeping a vampire survivor alive and bound instead of just killing it outright. His experiments ranges from disproving the myths surrounding the vampire creature and ackowledging the scientific and/or psychological explanations to certain behavioral traits of these nocturnal creatures. Neville's studies on captured vampires tell him why certain things like garlic and sunlight causes such an extreme reaction on these creatures. Why do they have a certain invulnerability towards bullets but not a stake through the heart. He even surmises that the vampires aversion to crucifix is more psychological than anything supernatural. Neville arrives at this after observing a vampire's reaction to a Star of David is similar to the reaction of another one towards the crucifix.It's events such as these which puts I Am Legend in a category all by itself. It still uses themes of horror which the vampires fulfill to great effect, but it also does a great job of taking the vampire tale out of the supernatural realm and into the scientific and logical. Neville's attempts to keep himself sane, as his loneliness begin to weigh on his psyche and health, through these studies and experiments adds a level of the science-fiction to this tale. It's the combination of these two genres which makes I Am Legend such an epic tale in scope yet it's not that which gives the tale its heaviest impact. It's Neville himself, more to the point, his desperate situation of being the last man on earth weighing on his mind. This tone gives this apocalyptic vampire tale such an intimate feel that the reader hopes and wishes for some sort of peaceful end to Neville, better yet some hope that he might find clues that he might not be the last.As the story moves forward, the line between who is human, who is monster and who is the true survivor become blurred as Neville's forays into the city for supplies lead him to a community of others who have not succumbed to the monstrous effect of the pandemic. It's this discovery that gives Neville a semblance of hope which momentarily lifts the heavy weight of inevitability from his mind. But not everything is at it seems at first glance. Neville finds this out as his encounters with this thriving community continue to give him more and more insight as to how they've survived. The climactic end to this tale has become such a classic ending that any other resolution wouldn't have worked. The end worked as the best possible ending to Matheson's tale. It also gives the books title a deeper and more profound meaning to it.I Am Legend will continue to go down in literary history as one of the best examples of fantastic literature. It's seemless blending of horror, science-fiction and the apocalyptic gives the tale both an epic and intimate feel and tone. It's not wonder the very themes and premise of this story has influenced such horror writers and filmmakers as Stephen King (The Stand, Salem's Lot) and George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead). I Am Legend takes the vampire tale out of the shadows and darkness it usually in habits and brings it out to the light of science and logic with surprising results. A true classic piece of writing from Richard Matheson and one that still stands as the benchmark for apocalyptic tales."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I just finished this story, and I love it. Matheson really wrote a unique story here. After you read it, you can see how it became an inspiration for much of the horror to come after it. What I really wanted to talk about however, is how it compares to the hardback/paperback version. Buyers should just beware that unlike the print edition, this version is just \\"I Am Legend.\\" The print version contains several other short stories. However, the progress bar at the bottom still goes by the full-length book, so I was confused for some time. However, since the price is low, I don't fault anyone or subtract from the score for it. This is still a great read for anyone who loves horror with a bit of science."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This seminal work is singlehandedly responsible for kicking off the modern zombie craze in my opinion. The book is dark, taught and gut-wrenching. It was originally published in the 1950s, and I can't begin to imagine what all those happy \`Father Knows Best' readers made of it at the time. And remember, this was way before the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Cold War.Though the actual monsters were in fact vampires, their penchant for coming out at night and ripping their victims to pieces is very much in the zombie vein. For me, what's most interesting is the author's ability to spend the majority of the book with Robert Neville alone as he battles not only these nocturnal demons but the ghosts of his dead family and his own heartbreaking loneliness.For anyone out there who appreciates zombie literature, I highly recommend this book. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I loved the book. It is very different from the movie. Movie is amazing too. It was difficult to pause reading so I could do get to my work. I would recommend this book for everyone who wants a good story to read and is interested in apocalyptic genre in books."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It's important to realize this is a collection of short stories with \\"I am Legend\\" just being the longest- a novella. The other stories are great, too. \\"Dance of the Dead\\" is one of the most haunting stories I've ever read. It has stuck with me for years as a statement on what happens when we lose our humanity, and what it feels like to know you are a single appauled voice in a crowd of inappropriate cheers. The animated dead performing as entertainment is only part of the horror of the story. The fact that people perceive it as entertainment is even worse."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book was good and I really enjoyed it. The movie was so different but it was good just the same."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"A somewhat atypical example of 1950s science fiction, or perhaps I'm just too accustomed to the rather pulpy and childish short story genre. Matheson's work is gritty, realistic, cynical and only slightly under-informed. The author paints a picture of post-apocalyptic life that is believable and makes it seem much more contemporary than it really is. The only real annoyance was the author's insistence in using the word 'germs' in place of bacteria. Doubtless this is a nod to his readership of the time but it left me rather perturbed and constantly in search of a red pen."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book is not at all like the movie that was released with Will Smith. It instantly pulls you in, alternating between the struggles Neville must face psychologically as well as physically it goes deeper into the Horror genre than just running scarred. He has to accept who he must become in order to live in this bleak new future. New plot elements are introduced in such a way as to keep you on the edge of your seat, hopeing and praying that Robert Neville will find the peace he needs to somehow be happy again. In the end, I was completely surprised by what happened.This book is a whole new adventure from the movie and is far better in my opinion. It is not very long and very enjoyable. I highly recommend it to anyone who is even remotely a fan of psychological fiction, horror, zombies, vampires, post-apocalyptic future, etc.."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Matheson's take on the vampire legends is a quantum jump beyond the nightmarish images conjured by writers from Bram Stoker to Anne Rice, yet presents an even more profound nightmare. A man, Robert Neville, imperfect, realistic and brave in the face of overwhelming circumstances, refuses to abandon hope even though he recognizes the very real possibility that he may be the last of his kind. Neville's desperate grasping at one last hope leads to an unexpected and provocative ending, leaving the reader with a glimpse of primal imperatives rarely sensed in literature attuned to modern, sophisticated sensitivities. It is a reminder that the word, sophisticated, is derived from the same root as sophistry."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Sometimes I have a hard time getting into the classics, but this one was the easiest thing to get into. I was surprised to see the book was very different from the Will Smith movie, but I loved this version too.A superb book, filled with such powerful emotions when pondering the existence of humans.Yes, this book is Legend.5 stars!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"No wonder this is at the top 10 list of several Horror book lists. I would say that this book is a must read for every one interested in this type of book, it's also only about 160 pages. Having seen the movie before reading it doesn't spoil anything."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I've had I Am Legend on my list of books to read ever since I read an interview with Stephen King a couple of decades ago where he cited it as one of his favorite books ever. When I saw that the trailer for the soon to be released movie I knew that if I saw the movie first then I'd never read the book. I ordered the copy from Amazon that had the coolest cover and read it when it arrived on Wednesday. First off, I'll be surprised if the newest movielization of this is any closer to the written story than The Last Man on Earth or Omega Man. The story is very well-played...but I was completely bamboozled by Amazon when I Am Legend came to an end halfway through the book, and I realized that the other half of the book was a collection of short-stories. I thought I had quite a bit of story left until I realized that the \\"next chapter\\" I had just begun was a completely different story. I looked the book over, and the only indication that the whole book wasn't I Am Legend was a small phrase on the back just above the bar-code...\\"The complete novel, plus several more unforgettable tales.\\" I can't really complain...more stories!...but I thought that it could have been a bit more apparent say...on the cover...or the spine...that I'd bought half a book of filler."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"I Am Legend\\" by Richard Matheson is indeed one of the greatest vampire novels ever written, and that's reason enough to get this book. Just note that the original novel was rather short and no longer seems to be in print as a stand-alone entity. So this edition offers the novel along with a collection of Matheson's short stories. Thus, this edition is docked one star because even though \\"I Am Legend\\" is tremendous, the collected short stories are middling at best. Out of the ten short tales, three are pretty enjoyable, as readable snippets of terror or suspense - \\"Witch War,\\" \\"Mad House,\\" and \\"Person to Person,\\" - and in these stories Matheson shows a mastery of psychological dread and creative plots and settings. Unfortunately, the other stories range from predictable to nonsensical, and may very well be leftovers and rejects. As for \\"I Am Legend,\\" all vampire lovers should be aware of this classic tale of the last man on Earth who is not a vampire, and Matheson's extremely creative treatments of this man's loneliness, and the efforts by the new majority of vampires to understand themselves and build their own society. This story is a masterpiece of human and inhuman dread, and you should certainly obtain this whole book just to get your hands on this classic. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Great book - genuine masterpiece of SF and horror.However, don't read any more reviews as half of the reviewers seem to think that a review consists on revealing all of the plot (including twists) and will definitely spoil your enjoyment of this book.The only plot a person can reveal without spoiling it is the stuff that's in the blurb (the bit on the back cover). If you want to know what the book is about then go read it! The only people who won't like it are the people who think that Freddy Kreuger is the pinnacle of intellectual horror."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Good story, but the style was quite dry. Certainly creative but lacked a spark to make it completely entertaining. The investment in the story you make as the reader is never paid off by Matheson. It's like reading the newspaper; sometimes riveting, usually mildly interesting, but rarely entertaining. One other HUGE point I'd like to make that seems neglected by all other descriptions and reviews of this book. Only two-thirds of this book's length are taken up by &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, the rest is a bunch of short stories, which aren't very good either in my humble opinion. I wish someone had told _me_ that before I bought it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I had been put off reading this book because of the dreadful film with Will Smith. Luckily I listened to a friend who convinced me that the book was even more of a betrayal of the book than most films are.I found this book truly gripping. Written from Roberts point of view who, before the catastrophe struck, didn't know anything about vampires. He examines the legends, he starts to research what caused it all to start and tries to find a cure. He becomes a scientist. He wants to find out why/what it is they are what they are.He hates them, the creatures who took the world away. He wants them cured but if not, he wants them dead. He is alone and almost going insane in his loneliness. It is so tormenting you can almost taste his despair.*Spoiler ahead*Then he meets her and it rocks his whole world. She makes him realise there is a totally different side to the whole story. One he'd never considered.He is the enemy but not for the reason he thought. All they want is to live. He is the killer. He is the abnormality.A truly gripping read that makes you really think."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Beware: while this book is 300+ pages long, only about 170 of those pages is the story, \\"I Am Legend.\\" What follows is a handful of short stories not related at all to the main story line. They are a collection of stories written by the same author. If I would have known this I probably would not have purchased this copy. However, the book \\"I Am Legend\\", while much different from the movie and much shorter than anticipated, was worth the read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Fantastic book, Richard really pulls off a great story of struggle. Also includes several other short stories, which are also great."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I've been listening to audio books from the State Library for over 30 years and received a copy of this through unabridged.com. I thought it was pretty well done. Maybe coulda done without the WC Fields impression in one story, but the rest were very good.A previous reviewer said \\"the stories were dated\\" - the book was originally published in 1954 and the story in the book is MUCH better than the current movie which was VERY badly done trying to make the story \\"HIP\\" - Wasn't Will Smith's fault - just bad direction.I will definitely be \\"reading\\" this book again. Good Science Fiction/horror NEVER gets old."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Sure, I'll admit I never heard of Richard Matheson or I AM LEGEND before the promo for the new Will Smith movie started. But I'm glad I know of them now. This was an amazing story, scary and hard to put down. It's definitely dated (having been written in the 50's), but that doesn't detract from it's readability. I enjoyed seeing how Neville reacts to so much isolation over time, and how he dealt with his fear.I understand that the movie is like the book in premise only, which doesn't surprise me. A Will Smith flick couldn't end the way this book does.I recommend getting the version which also includes several short stories by Matheson. The ones you must read are:- Prey- Mad House- From Shadowed Places- Person to PersonOutstanding, original, edge of your seat stories.The pretty good ones are:- The Near Departed (very short, predictable, and quite funny)- Witch War (freaky little girls!)- Dress of White Silk (what really happened...!?)The ones that didn't do it for me:- Buried Talents (intriguing, then leaves you hanging)- Dance of the Dead (too 'arty'?)- The Funeral (good idea, not so good story)Overall, you need to check out I AM LEGEND, and most of the other stories are worth your time too."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Not bad. Good story, good story telling, a consistent character, i.e. no let's make the end nice to please readers, and good tempo. If you like horror/vampire stories you may enjoy this book. There's very little interaction between the protagonist and the vampires beyond hiding from them at night and killing them when he finds them during the day. Mostly it's a portrait of this last living human and his struggles to live in a kind of self-imposed solitary confinement. I would be interested in a book about what happens next."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I had no idea the movie was based on a book, so when I found this I had to read it. Its completely different than the movie, but that isn't really a bad thing. It left me guessing until the end. Not terribly long and easy to read. A neat twist on the movie, or I guess the movie was a neat twist on the book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I've seen the movie version of I Am Legend at least twice, probably three times. And up until maybe a year ago, I didn't realise that it was actually a book, and a sci-fi classic to boot. Which also made me think - how many movies are based on, or inspired by a book we don't even know about?I'm also not a fan of reading a book after seeing the movie - I always find movie versions are either a) completely different or b) a big fat let-down, so I was a little wary when I started reading. I really thought I wouldn't be able to get Will Smith's face out of my mind.....However, right from the beginning I realised that the book version of I Am Legend is different in several ways to the movie, and not once did I imagine Neville as Will Smith. The book is more personal and intimate than the movie, and the hopelessness and isolation Neville experiences comes through strongly. There is less action and less vampire spookiness, but their presence was always in the back of my mind the whole way through.I'm really glad I put my habits aside and decided to read I Am Legend - and I will definitely be recommending it to anyone that interested in reading a sci-fi classic. There's not a lot I can say that hasn't been said a thousand times and a hundred different ways before, but I found I Am Legend to be far more character-focused and emotionally intense than I imagined it would be."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This was an amazing book. It read fast and captured my attention from the beginning. I could not put this book down."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The movie was much better. I have completed the comparison. So that can be marked off the list! Two words."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This book is incredibly good. One of the best books i have ever read. Richard Matheson tells a great story of survival."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"It will blow your mind wether you liked the movie incarnations or not or even if you never watched any of them.You'll be baffled by the arrogance of the Hollywood producers that thought they could do better."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I must admit to having been a huge I Am Legend fan for a long time. I enjoyed the book and 3 film adaptations. Vincent Price, Charlton Heston and even Will Smith. What a great cast (but I digress). The novel is a very good read and it is probably Matheson's best work. Robert Neville is the main character. He has watched the world fall apart, buried his family and searched for a cure after a worldwide crisis left no one else except a group of rampaging zombies who are the only known survivors. You do get a sense of dread as the story unfolds. If you like the armageddon, post-apocalyptic, futuristic style of story then I Am Legend is right up your alley. Stephen King was also greatly influenced by Matheson. This is old-school horror at its finest. One Man vs. The World. It almost always turns up into Man fighting Himself, Other Men, and Enemies also. He is not really alone at all yet he knows the world is going to get a lot worse before it gets better. The book asks a valid question about who we are and what we are capable of doing in an emergency. If you liked 28 Days Later you will appreciate this. If you liked the I Am Legend DVD or are a Richard Matheson fan it's hard to pass up. Matheson also wrote What Dreams May Come, Stir of Echoes, Hellhouse and Somewhere in Time (amongst many others). Highly recommended."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I really loved the movie with Will Smith, but this book (as all books usually do) blew it away! i loved the twists and each step Robert took especially psychologically."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is not only a suspense novel like the movie, it is a struggle of a man trying to live in a world where he is the last one on earth.Saying that, I loved this book because of the inner lines that the thinking of the character develops, you can distinguish how his mind works. You can see him struggling with his thoughts, even lying to himself to stay sane.It may have happened to you that you are in a situation when you start saying a sentence and you change it because you know it could be hurtful to the listener, but your hesitation is noticed by them, and they know what was on your mind and why you decided to change it.Well, this is what happens in the struggle of the character, you (the listener) can notice how his monologs drifts because he must stay sane, so the author is giving us not only his thoughts but more than that, and that is incredible."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The book and the movie share only a few details in common. The most obvious shared attribute is the title. The differences are almost staggering; Los Angeles/New York, Caucasian male/African-American male, blue collar/white collar, etc. The story is roughly 160 pages long, although there are ten short stories that follow:Buried Talents, The Near Departed, Prey, Witch War, Dance of the Dead, Dress of White Silk, Mad House, The Funeral, From Shadowed Places, and Person to Person.If you are purchasing the book because you like the movie you may feel cheated that the movie is merely based on the book, rather than a direct cinematic interpretation. The book is a great (and a quick) read, told by the perspective of Robert Neville, a man feared to be the sole survivor of the human race. The beginning, however, seems to be drawn out and the word choice is less than sophisticated. Thankfully, as the story progresses so does the word choice. If you love stories based on the appeal of the last man, or on the decline of society, then this book would be to your liking. Matheson also takes a new spin on vampire lore, which was one of the reasons this book appealed to me (the other being that it was a required text for a class). Although better vampires stories exist, this book is worth the read for any vampire enthusiast and highly recommended."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"More melancholy than scary, I felt this was more of a dystopia than a horror book. For that reason, it only gets a 3/5ths of a scream rating. Still, it does have vampires in it so it isn't a walk in the park or anything. (Yet the vampires are more dumb than scary for the most part.)THE BASIC STORYRobert Neville might be the last man on Earth. Everyone else is either dead or turned into a vampire by a virus. Neville seems to be immune to the virus, but he hasn't given up hope that he might find another like himself out there. Despite his intense loneliness, Neville dedicates himself to fighting the vampires (who come to his house nightly) and trying to figure out why this happened and whether it can be undone.MY THOUGHTSThe \\"last man left on Earth\\" story is a good one, and this was one of the better ones I've come across. I felt a real sympathy for Robert Neville, and my heart broke for him over and over. His practical nature and approach to the vampire problem felt realistic ... like something that might legitimately happen. He struggles and gives up and then gets reenergized and then falls apart again. I think I would react to this situation in a similar way--losing my faith and then finding it again only to wonder why I was continuing on against all odds.Matheson does a good job of providing the back story while keeping us firmly rooted in Neville's present. I got just enough glimpses of how he ended up in this situation to sympathize with him and understand the reality that he must endure. I loved how he took a scientific approach to the problem and experimented with all the various vampire lore that we've all heard about. More than anything, I think Matheson captures the difficulty of being completely alone in a world that has fallen apart around you. It would be so psychologically challenging. You completely understand why Neville woos a stray dog so diligently and carefully--humans aren't meant to live alone!The ending was very satisfying and true to the nature of the book. (And I love how the title gets incorporated into it.) It is definitely one of the more melancholy horror books I've ever read, and it left me feeling sad. If you're looking for an atypical vampire book or are a fan of dystopia, this would be an excellent choice. It is much more about Robert Neville's struggles and emotional life than anything else, and this elevates it from being \\"just a horror book.\\""},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This was a very unique story in it's time and in a way it still is. It's sad how few people know the original story and only the many film adaptations (the Vincent Price version being closest to the actual novel). So many people don't even know the meaning behind the title \\"I am Legend.\\" In fact many people, too used to the movies, aren't even aware that this is a vampire novel with traditional (old school, vulnerable to garlic and sacred objects) vampires.This is a well written and tragic story. It really grabs you and can, surprisingly, break your heart. Read it if you can bear it."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Having seen the Heston and Smith movies based on this story, I wanted to back to the beginning and read the genesis. The original story stands on its own, and is virtually completely different from either movie. The only complaint I have is that the book should have been advertised as a compendium of short stories with \\"I Am Legend\\" as the lead."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I kept saying I was going to buy it to read, and when I learned that a friend had bought it, it was the perfect opputunity to try it before I bought it. I loved this book. I will admit that I only read it because I had enjoyed the movie so much. But, of course like they always are, the book was so much better. There are always parts that they re-write to make a movie flow better, so I understand how people are irrated that the book and movie are so different. The thing is that this is a very short book anyway, so to change things to make a movie look good seems to change A LOT. But, I think the movie was still good if you separate it from the book, just wasn't an exact portrayal of the book. Anyway, this was a great book...very well written, detailed, and made easy to relate to the main character.As for the short stories in the back... they were just as good, loved how the uniqueness of his stories. I loved Dress of White Silk, especially the way he wrote it in the view of the child. Actually, that's is one of my favorite things about his stories.... he's writing style is very diverse and he can put himself in any characters' shoes."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"End-of-civilization novels are my guilty pleasure. How do people survive the crash, and how do they cope with the aftermath? Perhaps I hope by reading such books, that I will pick up my own survival tips.Anyhow, I really enjoyed Richard Matheson's \\"I Am Legend.\\" \\"Omega Man,\\" a 1971 Charlton Heston film, has always been one of my favorite B movies, and I loved the superb \\"I Am Legend\\" starring Will Smith from a couple of years ago. I finally read the book, and while it has a less hopeful ending than the movies (which offered at least a chance of humanity overcoming the plague), it was a very interesting and entertaining read."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is a really good read. Much more powerful that the Will Smith movie, which I enjoyed. They are really quite different. If you're looking for a classic apocolypse tale, this is it. Recommended."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"When the modern film adaptation I Am Legend came out in 2007, many people were annoyed or angered by the movie. I heard things like, \\"it's nothing like the book\\", \\"the ending sucks\\" and \\"it misses the point\\". Now I know why. Let me just tell you, the movie does miss the point, particularly with the theatrical ending. That version of the film misses the point like the missing the broad side of a barn with a tactical nuke at point-blank range. That's not to say I dislike the movie. I thought that, with the alternate ending, it was pretty good. I still think that. However, reading the original story has changed my feelings about it a bit, namely that I like certain things about it less than the novel. Now, I don't remember if the credits say \\"based on I Am Legend by Richard Matheson\\", but if they do, I believe they definitely commit the crime of false advertising. The most it should say is \\"inspired by...\\" The only similarities I can think of between the book and what I remember of the movie are:The main character is named Robert NevilleThere is a plague of vampires that led to the collapse of civilizationThe main character is a human man, ostensibly the last on earth, who is immune to the diseaseThe main character lost his wife and child after/during the outbreak of the diseaseThere is a dogThere is a womanThere is scienceBut enough about the film! Overall, I enjoyed the novel. I was not initially aware that the novel I purchased contained I Am Legend in addition to several short stories, because it was not clearly advertised on my edition. Thus, I was surprised that the story was as short as it was. I only read I Am Legend from the bunch, because that is the reason I purchased it. I feel like Matheson could have made the book longer, and fleshed out the world, the situations, and Neville's past quite a bit more.One thing about the story that I wasn't a huge fan of was how little actually happened in the book. A big portion of the narrative was devoted to the more mundane events and inner monologues in the post-apocalyptic life of Robert Neville. On the other hand, much of the narrative dealing with Neville's inner thoughts helped vastly with the world-building. Through Neville's erratic, desperate, hopeless thoughts, the reader developed a taste for what it felt like to be the last man on earth, living a daily battle for existence in the midst of a plague of vampires, having lost everyone and everything you once loved.However, that brings me to my next point -- Neville was surprisingly unfeeling. I don't know if the reader was supposed to chock that up to him being a man who doesn't want to display feelings, his being a man that has given up hope, or what. He faced situations with very little sympathy, or even horror, and seemed largely apathetic about what was happening to him and what he was doing. Throughout several places in the story, I got the idea that Matheson has issues with women. I know that authors don't always write their thoughts into their characters, but it didn't seem like Neville was supposed to be especially misogynistic, because the author wrote it strictly as if his thoughts were fact and entirely acceptable.There were some things I really liked about I Am Legend. First off, it is number one on my list for most scientific books about vampires I have ever read. As a biology major and pharmacy student, I found it incredibly interesting to read about Neville's discoveries and experiments as he uncovered the origin of the disease. That Matheson invented a somewhat scientifically sound background for the existence of vampires, debunking some elements of mythology and supporting others was original and pleasing to me.The thing I liked most about the novel (especially compared to the movie) was the ending. The events of the ending portion of I Am Legend really came out of left field for me. I wasn't expecting what happened, at all. It is very much the most important part of the novel. It leaves us with a message, questioning what we have known and what we believe. I thought it was poignant and powerful, and it certainly left me thinking.It is an unimportant detail, but I also enjoyed that the last line of the novel was \\"I am legend.\\" I love when books really come full circle, and when they have their title worked into them somehow. Matheson managed to do both, and it brought a smile to my face."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is one of those classic books I've been meaning to get around to. When it was finally on sale for less than a buck on the Kindle, I decided to take the plunge and I was not disappointed.I've only read one of Matheson's other books (his latest one at the time of this review) but I'm a big fan of his work on the original \\"Twilight Zone\\" and \\"I Am Legend\\" certainly has much of the same vibe as many TZ episodes.Many \\"Twilight Zone\\" episodes (including the pilot) dealt with a lone or small group of survivors after the apocalypse. Only in this case instead of nuclear war it's a plague that gradually turns everyone into \\"vampires.\\" It's important to note that in many ways Matheson's vampires are more akin to the zombies of \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" and such than the vampires in \\"Dracula\\" or especially \\"Twilight.\\" These vampires cannot go out in the light and they drink blood, but they aren't super strong or super fast and they can't change into other shapes. The way they shamble around, seemingly unable to even open a door, definitely makes them closer to zombies than vampires.Robert Neville is seemingly the last man on Earth, or at least the last man in his neck of the woods in California. After about five months he's built his old house into an impenetrable fortress that's stocked with food and has a generator for electricity. He even has a hothouse to grow garlic that helps keep the vampires at bay. Every night the vampires gather around his house, hoping he'll come out. One of his former neighbors yells at him constantly to come out while the undead women strike lurid poses in the hope of coaxing Neville from his fortress.Most of the story then deals with Neville's survival. In particular in how he has to deal with the crushing loneliness and isolation of being the only real human left. To help combat that, Neville begins trying to understand the disease that wiped out humanity and possibly to find a cure for it.Along the way we learn a little more about Neville's life before the plague, in particular what happened with his wife and daughter. Though still by the end the details are a little skimpy, especially where the daughter is concerned. One bit of confusion for me was that it took a while for Matheson to really establish whether Kathy was the wife or daughter and the same for Virginia.Still, I found this a riveting, suspenseful read. Modern readers who yearn for buckets of blood and gore aren't going to find that so much in here, but it is a fascinating tale of survival in the face of great horror and adversity.Another note is that if you saw the Will Smith film from a few years ago you should disregard that as except for the title and basic premise they don't have much in common.That is all."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The story centers around Robert Neville, a normal \\"every day\\" man who travels to work with his neighbor each day. One day, there is a virus outbreak that converts everyone in the world but him into crazed, flesh seeking monsters that only come out at night. Much like the Resident Evil stories, the dead comeback, reanimated by the virus until either subjected to sunlight, effectively killing the virus or being stabbed with a stake, exposing the virus to oxygen.Robert embarks on a mission to understand the \\"vampire\\" virus only to rule out vampires completely in favor of a much more scientific understanding of the disease.In the novel, he is not a Military LT or genius scientist hellbent on curing the disease but rather a very lonely man, desperately missing his wife spending his time studying about the horrible nightmares that attack his home each night. He spends his days scouring for food, information, disposing of bodies in a fire and trying to better understand what has happened to the world, theorizing on his immunity.His final undoing(as has been mine many times) is by that of a woman he meets and I'll leave it at that so as not to give any spoilers away."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I decided to read this book because it's a classic in the genre, it basically gave form to the modern zombie. Although the word vampire is used in this book, and aspects of vampire lore (garlic, crosses, etc..), the behavior of the \\"afflicted\\" is really what later characterizes the zombie.The author's writing is superb, he creates great vivid imagery and you really get inside the mind of the main character, Robert Neville. Since I felt I knew the character so well I found it hard to put down the book. How can he survive alone in a world where everyone else seems to be infected and wanting eat his flesh and drink his blood? How long can he stay boarded up in his house while the \\"vampires\\" try to break in night after night?When you have finished the book you will understand the meaning of the title, and the real meaning of the book. For fans of horror, zombies, etc... it's a definite must. If not just for its historical value in the genre."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I bought this book because I had seen that a movie version is coming to theaters. I also know that the movie versions of books can leave a lot to be desired. After reading this, I really hope the movie captures what the story holds. The actual story of \\"I am legend\\" is under two-hundred pages, and the remainder of the book is comprised of short stories. I couldn't actually put the book down for \\"I am legend\\" and ended up reading it in two nights before going to bed. I would recommend this book 100%."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I got this book as a preview for the upcomming film I am Legend with will smith this winter. The book was amazing and I had a hard time putting it down. It has everything a horror fan can live for. There are elements of Zombie films as the character is traped from infection. Also takes the Vampire theory and runs with it. Interesting and A great buy. Matheson's short stories at the end is a added bonus as they are a good read as well. If you want a good book to read I would choose this one."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"\\"I Am Legend\\" (c. 1954) by Richard MathesonRichard Matheson was born February 20, 1926. As of this writing (April 29, 2007) he's still alive.Two films have been based on \\"I Am Legend\\": \\"The Last Man On Earth\\" (1964) starring Vincent Price as Dr. Robert Morgan (Robert Neville in the text) and \\"The Omega Man\\" (1971) starring Charlton Heston as Robert Neville.The plot puts protagonist Robert Neville as the last human to live in a world where all others have been metabolized into the living dead who feed on each other and hunt Robert Neville at the same time that Robert Neville hunts the undead to rid not only the earth, but his own memories, of a disease worse than death.Richard Matheson has a crisp writing style that doesn't sacrifice cadence or style to keep the pace moving. Here is a little passage as Robert Neville mourns his wife:\\"His unkempt hair rustled on the pillow as he looked toward the clock. Two in the morning. Two days since he'd buried her. Two eyes looking at the clock, two ears picking up the hum of its electric chronology, two lips pressed together, two hands lying on the bed.\\"Matheson's dialogue engages the reader adding punctuation and text formatting to believable language conveying tone that moves the characters' voices along.The action in \\"I Am Legend\\" is continuous and grounded.Matheson created the protagonist, Robert Neville, with bold strokes accented with visceral highlights. For me, although Neville in text is physically different than either Charlton Heston or Vincent Price, both actors captured sides of Neville's character that I could recognize. Charlton Heston was a good choice to embody Robert Neville's strong yet tense characterization, while Vincent Price did a fine job portraying the sentiments of a man who lost his wife, companion, and love of eleven years as well as a beloved child. Robert Neville, to put it another way, is a man's man who appeals to women for the depth of his love and passion, tenderness and morality.This story appealed to me as a female; I know it appealed to my husband for its story line, characterization, and Matheson's ideas. Robert Neville is a man in pain, cut off from life as it used to be good. I sympathized with him as he tried, without success, to lose the suppressed grief and haunting world that had replaced the one we all take for granted but without cannot function.Matheson takes elements from history, folklore, the horror genre, religion, and human psychology and biology to weave legends and science together creating \\"I Am Legend.\\" While the book's technology is dated, and the story was written more than half a century ago, I can't help but wonder if within its scant 174 pages is a story that will engage readers for many years down the road. Is my age speaking about things past that I enjoyed? Or, as I think more likely, is \\"I Am Legend\\" a story that continues to be adaptable for current and future audiences?I'd like to think the latter. With a wink of research, I learned that Will Smith is cast as Dr. Robert Neville for a December 2007 release of a film titled \\"I Am Legend\\" directed by Francis Lawrence who directed \\"Constantine\\" (2005). Good stories last."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Matheson was an amazing writer....had me on the edge of my seat. The realism was perfect, and the simplicity of the story was astounding. I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of horror or even fiction."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This is really a gem of a short story - on par with really the best of American fiction. While it uses horror conventions and mythos as the props, on a deeper level the story is a seering examination of isolation, loss, and, perhaps most interesting, the way in which the perspective of object-subject impacts ethics and norms.Frankly I think a movie CAN'T be successfully made of this book - it is written in the first person and it relies on the thoughts of the narrator to drive its plot forward."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The other reviews have done a good job of describing this excellent book, but have failed to note an important item of interest regards to this; it was the basis for the outstanding Vincent Price film \\"Last Man on Earth\\" which follows the book very well. It was also the basis for the Charleton Heston film \\"The Omega Man\\", which follows the book a little more loosely but is also quite good. If you have seen the Price film, you will recognize it as you read the book. This is an outstanding novel which will make you feel the extreme loneliness experienced by the character Neville as he exists day to day alone searching for the hiding places of the plague created undead to destroy them and then at night holing up in his fortified house as they come out to pound on his doors yelling \\"...come out, Neville...\\"!! Chilling....!!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"For several days after reading this (a book which is easily consumed in the 90 minutes a film would last) I could NOT stop obsessing on the idea of a film adaptation. It was already made years ago as the Omega man which is easily forgotten."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"...it's a novel about the human persona. Any fan of the Twilight Zone knows the name Richard Matheson. His stories have been made into episodes and was a major influence on Rod Sterling with stories such as \\"nightmare at 20,000 feet\\" and \\"little girl lost\\". His novels \\"Hell House\\" and \\"A Stir of Echoes\\" have been made into memorable movies.\\"I Am Legend\\" seems to me to be his best out of all his works. The book deals with the familar examples of what a vampire is but with an atomic age twist. The story is not centered on vampires but on the loneliness of one man and the effects of isolation from contact with other humans has turn his mental and emotional instincts off.Inside the story the character remembers what it is like to be a human again and we see what has turn him into the hermit we first meet thru flashbacks. But the most important part of the book is the twisted ending that Matheson is famous for.Less then two hundred pages but worth the money. You will never look at vampire novels the same way again."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"If Bram Stoker had been a middle class American in 1976, this would have been Dracula. Judging solely on the cover and maybe what somebody told you about I Am legend, you might assume that this is a straightforward horror read, a pulp 10 cent-er from the fifties. What this novel really does well is lull the reader into thinking the hero, Robert Neville, is totally safe in his baricaded house, which is what Neville seems to think. How wrong he was.Most of the begining of the book is Neville skulking around his empty house drinking lots of whiskey and mourning the death of his wife and daughter. Its only when he can shrug the booze off and venture outside that things actually take a turn for the worse. if he had stayed in his house and got drunk non-stop, he would only become victim to crippling depression and a burnt out liver, instead of the undead and the suffering living preying on him.one thing this novel does that no other Vampire book I've ever read is to inject some science into Vampires, the victims of a horrid plague that makes them feast on blood and avoid sunlight. A good portion of Neville's time is spent trying to understand the plague, and for a while it helps keep his mind off of his problems and he actually learns lots about vampires.In conclusion, this is an amazing novel that I had trouble putting down. If you are a fan of movies like night of the living dead or 28 days later you owe it to yourself to read the inspiration. BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Matheson's I Am Legend is one of my favorite books--one I've read over and over, and always find something new to cherish about it. This is a book I highly recommend. Not just becuase it is entertaining and well written, but I Am Legend is a staple of both the horror and science fiction genres. But it is more than that. It is also one of the finer Apocalyptic novels (or novellas) written. And I believe might even deserve a place (no matter how small) in the sub-genrea of Utopian fiction. Matheson does a wonderful job of helping us understand the horrors of the end of the world, being alone, and even the sympathetic side of being a vampire (all with almost no dialogue). It's a beautifully written book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I eagerly anticipated this book and I have to honestly say that I hated it. Nothing ever really happened in the story and the ending seemed imcomplete to me. What a disappointment. If you want to read good vampire related material, try the Anita Blake series"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The first half of this book was very engrossing. I don't even know what to say about the second half...I would love it if someone could explain to me what the heck it was about!! I hated the last half of this book...it made no sense. I just kept thinking that it would all come together and make sense at some point, and it never did. Thankfully, the movie was very different from the book."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"99% of the time I will always say \\"the book was better\\". In this case, I couldn't say it. Even though I saw the movie first then read the book it didn't make a difference. The story is disjointed, and doesn't fill you in on the past. The ending is horrible. No one would be satisfied with the way it ended. That being said it's a pretty good zombie book for the time that it was written."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I Am Legend aired on television and although I've seen the movie before I didn't realize it was based on a book. That's what prompted me to order it. I loved reading the book and seeing the differences in it compared to the movie; however, the movie was 100 percent better. The ending was dry and disappointing, and I didn't understand the unrelated stories at the end."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Decent story, different by today's standard. The book size is deceiving though as the main story stops end about half way through."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I purchased this book since the movie was good. I figure the book would be even better. I was so wrong. Of course, if you like vampires, then you will like this book. The ending was uneventful and confusing."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I saw the film first and, after seeing so many reviews that referenced the book, I felt I had to read it.So now I've read the book (or most of it). Honestly, I thought \\"I Am Legend\\" was only okay and the rest of the stories got kind of boring after a while.There is very little to compare between the movie and the story. Honestly, I prefer the movie."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The book was shipped very quickly and in time for Christmas. Both books were in excellent condition."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Richard Matheson's style phenomenal. I picked up this book looking for a good vampire book, and got way more than that. The story is absolutely fantastic. The characters are very deep and are constantly developing. A deep look into all the emotions somebody would go thru being a complete outcast, last man on earth. Lots of cool stuff, very complete and full. Hits on all the emotions a book like this should. Very well written.Robert Deville is the last man on earth, everyone else is vampires. He holes up in his house during the day, drinking, listening to music, trying to stay sane. At night these vampires come out and beat upon his house, thirsty as hell for his blood.I would definatly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.Exciting, dark, terrifying, classic =)"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"This story is the most brillant book ever written about vampires , but it is not really about vampires. It's about being an outcast in a society. The book is difficult to categorize, it is not really horror, not really suspense but it has many aspects of each type of story.It very easy to see how Matheson inspired many of the horror we like today like King."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"If you see this BEFORE you purchase (wish I had done some checking before I purchased...) be advised the \\"I am Legend\\" story encompasses about half the boook's size...the remainder is a series of very (VERY) short stories that are completely and totally unrelated to the title of the \\"book\\", as well as to each other. I learned after the fact that I was not the only one to be completely confused while my brain was trying to make the leap from the main story to what I had waded into after finishing \\"I am Legend.\\" The title story itself was ok, however, had I realized I was paying for such a tiny little read I would have left it on the shelf."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"The book is well written but never delivers the punch it tries to build. It borders on 'who cares?' as it drags and drags on. The new generation of readers will not get the stuggle of a man living in a futuristic 70's though wriiten in the 50's. Its supposed to take place in the seventies which it clearly is not.The story embarks the life of a lonely man living in his home. He is the last man alive not infected or last man alive around his neighborhood, we think. During the day, he fixes his house or goes out for provisions. He is stalked at night by vampires so he is imprisoned at sun down. All the vampires do is wait outside his home like pigeons waiting to be feed which never happens. The vampires are written to be dumb, so not Lestat or any vampire character (i.e. Blade) of today. Instead they are more of a mob and never problem solving. More like zombies.. The protagonist spends all his nights dreading his life and usually ends up getting drunk. BORING!The twists are predictable and not that climatic. The book is only a few hundred pages. SO much better out there. A book past its generation if ya will."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Ending sucks so boo on you and the book though what dream as may come was absolutely awesome so yeah"},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"Enjoyable short read. Better than the 70's movie version and better than the author's Hell House."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I know that not all movies are gonna resemble the book. Sometimes the movie is far from the book. This book is far far far from the movie. I dont know how they made a movie from this book but it's 100% different. And there are all these different stories that have nothing to do with what I am Legend was supposed to be about. There is nothing that states there are different stories mixed in which I may also add make no sense. I wish I could return this, it was a big disappointment."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I wasn't a big fan of the movie, which I saw first, but this book was even less noteworthy. Some broad themes were used by the film but it ended there. Mostly a vampire book so if you are into that, perhaps it is worth a look. Otherwise, don't waste your time. Not science fiction by any stretch of the imagination. I found the writing tedious, the pacing glacial and ending a disappointment. Thank goodness I got this as a Kindle book for 99 cents. Even that may have been too much."},{"Title":"I am Legend","review":"I loved the movie, so I had to buy the book ! I haven't finished it, which is why I only gave three stars, but so far so good ! It isn't like the movie of course , but it gives a good descriptive story about how Robert Neville lived and survived all the tragedy that hit him."}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],H={key:0},O={key:1};function F(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),t(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),y(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",O,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",H,"See more"))],8,E)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(L,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-58b854cd"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/35.md","filePath":"quotes/35.md"}'),C={name:"quotes/35.md"},B=Object.assign(C,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(W)]))}});export{D as __pageData,B as default};
