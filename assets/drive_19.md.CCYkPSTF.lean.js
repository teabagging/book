While the earlier history, sometimes called the prehistory, is also considered, this volume is mainly concerned with the more recent history of topology, from Poincar  onwards. As will be seen from the list of contents the articles cover a wide range of topics. Some are more technical than others, but the reader without a great deal of technical knowledge should still find most of the articles accessible.

Following the death of Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon church, its second Prophet and new leader, Brigham Young, determined to move the faithful out of the Midwest, where they had been constantly persecuted by their neighbors, to found a new Zion in the wilderness. In 1846-47, the Mormons made their way west, generally following the Oregon Trail, arriving in July 1847 in what is today Utah, where they established Salt Lake City. Nine years later, fearing a federal invasion, Young and other Mormon leaders wrestled with the question of how to bring thousands of impoverished European converts, mostly British and Scandinavian, from the Old World to Zion. Young conceived of a plan in which the European Mormons would travel by ship to New York City and by train to Iowa City. From there, instead of crossing the plains by covered wagon, they would push and pull wooden handcarts all the way to Salt Lake. But the handcart plan was badly flawed. The carts, made of green wood, constantly broke down; the baggage allowance of seventeen pounds per adult was far too small; and the food provisions were woefully inadequate, especially considering the demanding physical labor of pushing and pulling the handcarts 1,300 miles across plains and mountains. Five companies of handcart pioneers left Iowa for Zion that spring and summer, but the last two of them left late. As a consequence, some 900 Mormons in these two companies were caught in early snowstorms in Wyoming. When the church leadership in Salt Lake became aware of the dire circumstances of these pioneers, Younglaunched a heroic rescue effort. But for more than 200 of the immigrants, the rescue came too late. The story of the Mormon handcart tragedy has never before been told in full despite its stunning human drama: At least five times as many people died in the Mormon tragedy as died in the more famous Donner Party disaster. David Roberts has researched this story in Mormon archives and elsewhere, and has traveled along the route where the handcart pioneers came to grief. Based on his research, he concludes that the tragedy was entirely preventable. Brigham Young and others in the Mormon leadership failed to heed the abundant signs of impending catastrophe, including warnings from other Mormon elders in the East and Midwest, where the journey began. Devil's Gate is a powerful indictment of the Mormon leadership and a gripping story of survival and suffering that is superbly told by one of our finest writers of Western history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YJUl0TzsKkIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best Mud Pie (Rookie Readers: Level B)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dream Fish & Road Trips: Fly-Fishing Tales from Alaska, Montana, and Beyond","description":"\\"Karlo Mila's voice travels from urban Aotearoa to Tonga and Samoa via friendships and family relationships.

For Christopher Day architecture is not just about a building's appearance, but how the building is experienced. 'Places of the Soul' presents buildings as environment, intrinsic to their surroundings, and offers design principles that will open the eyes of the architecture student and professional alike, presenting ideas quite different to the orthodoxy of modern architectural education. Christopher Day's experience as an architect, self-builder, professor and sculptor have all added to the development of his ideas that encompass issues of economic and social sustainability, commercial pressures and consensus design. This book presents these ideas and outlines universal principles that will be of interest and value to architects, builders, planners and developers alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UB229PNbMwoC&dq=Environmental+Design:+Architecture+and+Technology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Business of Child Care: Management and Financial Strategies","description":"The Business of Child Care: Management and Financial Strategies focuses on the most essential business skills child care owners and administrators need.

Part cultural history and intellectual memoir, part travelogue and guide book, Tylus writes with a novelist s flair, taking the reader on a quest of discovery through the well- and not-so-well-travelled roads and alleys of the ancient city. Today, Siena can appear on the surface standoffish, a bit static, and very old-fashioned, especially when compared to its larger, flashier cousins Roma and Firenze. But first impressions wear away as we learn from Tylus that Siena was, over the long view, an innovator among the cities of Italy: the first to pave its streets and main plaza (1298), the first to publicly fund its university (1321), the first to employ the promissory note (1720), the first to ban automobile traffic from its city center (1965), and much else. We also hear about Siena s great artistic and architectural past, hidden behind centuries of over painting and rebuilding, and about its resident apocryphal and not-so-apocryphal Saints. And about the distinctive characters of its different neighborhoods ( contrade ), exemplified in the highly competitive horserace that takes place annually in the city and that serves as both a dividing and a uniting force for the Sienese. Throughout we are guided by the assuring voice of a seasoned scholar with a gift for spinning a good story and with an eye for the telling detail, whether we are traveling Siena s modern highways or digging through ancient Etruscan tombs; or shadowing the path walked by medieval pilgrims; or tracking the city s financial history from its beginnings as the once-great center for commerce in the sixteenth century to its near collapse in January 2013; or celebrating literary giants Dante and Calvino or giants of the arena, Siena s Series A soccer team. A useful and entertaining guide for students of Italian culture (Tylus has written discursive, reader-friendly endnotes and included a full bibliography in the back matter), the book will also appeal to the traveler and tourist (virtual or otherwise) interested in learning more about this ancient, mysterious, reclusive citydespite itself.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F0B5CAAAQBAJ&dq=City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pasajes: Lengua","description":"The Pasajes series is one of the most widely used and highly respected programs for intermediate Spanish courses in North America.

By the end of his major league career in 1925, he had accrued 212 wins and more than 1,700 strikeouts, and in 1953, he became the first American Indian elected to baseball& s Hall of Fame. But as a high-profile Chippewa Indian in a bigoted society, Bender knew firsthand the trauma of racism. In Money Pitcher: Chief Bender and the Tragedy of Indian Assimilation, William C. Kashatus offers the first biography of this compelling and complex figure. Bender& s career in baseball began on the sandlots of Pennsylvania& s Carlisle Indian Industrial School, where he distinguished himself as a hard-throwing pitcher. Soon, in 1903, Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack signed Bender to his pitching staff, where he was a mainstay for more than a decade. Mack regarded Bender as his & money pitcher& & the hurler he relied on whenever he needed a critical victory. But with success came suffering. Spectators jeered Bender on the field and taunted him with war whoops. Newspapers ridiculed him in their sports pages. His own teammates derisively referred to him as & Chief,&  and Mack paid him less than half the salary of other star pitchers. This constant disrespect became a major factor in one of the most controversial episodes in the history of baseball: the alleged corruption of the 1914 World Series. Despite being heavily favored going into the Series against the Boston Braves, the A& s lost four straight games. Kashatus offers compelling evidence that Bender intentionally compromised his performance in the Series as retribution for the poor treatment he suffered. Money Pitcher is not just another baseball book. It is a book about social justice and Native Americans&  tragic pursuit of the white American Dream at the expense of their own identity. Having arrived in the major leagues only thirteen years after the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890, Bender experienced the disastrous effects of governmental assimilation policies designed to quash indigenous Indian culture. Yet his remarkable athleticism and dignified behavior disproved popular notions of Native American inferiority and opened the door to the majors for more than 120 Indians who played baseball during the first half of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9IVIgZZmnVwC&dq=Money+Pitcher:+Chief+Bender+And+the+Tragedy+of+Indian+Assimilation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Growing Up Male: The Psychology of Masculinity","description":"This study of the development of masculinity covers sex and gender issues, male bonding, psychosexual adjustments, situational ethics, and sexuality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qwVHAAAAMAAJ&dq=Growing+Up+Male:+The+Psychology+of+Masculinity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Home How-To: Easy-To-Follow Step-By-Step Instructions with More Than 3,000 Color Illustrations and Photographs (Popular Mechanics)","description":"Popular Mechanics inspires, instructs and influences readers to help them master the modern world.

New introduction by Jane Harrison. Two volumes bound in one. In this book E. A. Wallis Budge, one of the world's foremost Egyptologists, focuses on Osiris as the single most important Egyptian deity. In Ancient Egyptian mythology, Osiris was the god of the beyond whose death and resurrection brought a guarantee of an afterlife to mortals. He was a kindly Pharaoh, teaching agriculture, music, arts, and religion to his people. Jealous of his successful reign, his brother Seth killed him with the help of many accomplices and took control of Egypt. However, Seth's reign was foreshortened by Isis's great love for her husband and brother Osiris, whom she brought back from the dead. Osiris and Isis then conceived Horus, their beloved son. Seth, seething in anger, killed Osiris once again, this time by cutting his body to pieces and throwing them into the Nile River. Isis, with the help of Anubis, the god with the jackal head, reconstituted Osiris's body with bandages and embalming rites, thus creating the first mummy. During this act, the god Thoth recited an incantation. Finally, Horus avenged his father Osiris in a bloody duel with Seth in which Horus lost his eye, which was then given as a food offering to Osiris. This is the most thorough explanation ever offered of Osirism. With rigorous scholarship, going directly to numerous Egyptian texts, making use of the writings of Herodotus, Diodorus, Plutarch and other classical writers, and of more recent ethnographic research in the Sudan and other parts of Africa, Budge examines every detail of the cult of Osiris. He also establishes a link between Osiris worship and African religions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7Jv0xQEACAAJ&dq=Osiris+The+Egyptian+Religion+of+Resurrection+2+Volumes+in+One&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Queen of Attolia","description":"Discover and rediscover the world of the Queen's Thief, from the acclaimed novel The Thief to the thrilling, twenty-years-in-the-making conclusion, The Return of the Thief.

Following a run of New Year's concerts at San Francisco's legendary Fillmore, Patti Smith finds herself tramping the coast of Santa Cruz, about to embark on a year of solitary wandering. Unfettered by logic or time, she draws us into her private wonderland with no design, yet heeding signs--including a talking sign that looms above her, prodding and sparring like the Cheshire Cat. In February, a surreal lunar year begins, bringing with it unexpected turns, heightened mischief, and inescapable sorrow. In a stranger's words, \\"Anything is possible: after all, it's the Year of the Monkey.\\" For Smith--inveterately curious, always exploring, tracking thoughts, writing--the year evolves as one of reckoning with the changes in life's gyre: with loss, aging, and a dramatic shift in the political landscape of America. Smith melds the western landscape with her own dreamscape. Taking us from California to the Arizona desert; to a Kentucky farm as the amanuensis of a friend in crisis; to the hospital room of a valued mentor; and by turns to remembered and imagined places, this haunting memoir blends fact and fiction with poetic mastery. The unexpected happens; grief and disillusionment set in. But as Smith heads toward a new decade in her own life, she offers this balm to the reader: her wisdom, wit, gimlet eye, and above all, a rugged hope for a better world. Riveting, elegant, often humorous, illustrated by Smith's signature Polaroids, Year of the Monkey is a moving and original work, a touchstone for our turbulent times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BbWPDwAAQBAJ&dq=Year+of+the+Monkey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Hangover: Moving from Pain to Purpose After a Relationship Ends","description":"Riley and Hawkins help the reader recover from one of the most common emotional traumas-a broken heart.

Noel Wells, curate in the sleepy village of Saltmarsh, likes to spend his time dancing in the study with the vicar's niece, until one day the vicar's unpleasant wife discovers her unmarried housemaid is pregnant and trouble begins. It is left to Noel to call for the help of sometime-detective and full-time psychoanalyst Mrs Bradley, who sets out on an unnervingly unorthodox investigation into the mysterious pregnancy, an investigation that also takes in a smuggler, the village lunatic, a missing corpse, a public pillory, an exhumation and, of course, a murderer.

Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions. The writings of French philosopher Jacques Derrida have been the single most powerful influence on critical theory and practice in the United States over the past decade. But with few exceptions American philosophers have taken little or no interest in Derrida's work, and the task of reception, translation, and commentary has been left to literary critics. As a result, Derrida has appeared as a figure already defined by essentially literary critical activities and interests. Stephen Melville's aim in \\"Philosophy Beside Itself \\" is to insist upon and clarify the distinctions between philosophy and criticism. He argues that until we grasp Derrida's philosophical project as such, we remain fundamentally unable to see his significance for criticism. In terms derived from Stanley Cavell's writings on modernism, Melville develops a case for Derrida as a modernist philosopher, working at once within and against that tradition and discipline. Melville first places Derrida in a Hegelian context, the structure of which he explores by examining the work of Heidegger, Lacan, and Bataille. With this foundation, he is able to reappraise the project of deconstructive criticism as developed in Paul de Man's \\"Blindness and Insight \\"and further articulated by other Yale critics. Central to this critique is the ambivalent relationship between deconstructive criticism and Lacanian psychoanalysis. Criticism--radical self-criticism--is a central means through which the difficult facts of human community come to recognition, and Melville argues for criticism as an activity intimately bound to the ways in which we do and do not belong in time and in community. Derrida's achievement has been to find a new and necessary way to assert that the task of philosophy is criticism; the task of literary criticism is to assume the burden of that achievement. Stephen Melville is an assistant professor of English at Syracuse University, and Donald Marshall is a professor of English at the University of Iowa.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FCvpAAAAIAAJ&dq=Philosophy+Beside+Itself:+On+Deconstruction+and+Modernism+(Theory+and+History+of+Literature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION REFERENCE BOOK","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sclQAAAAYAAJ&dq=ELECTRICAL+TRANSMISSION+AND+DISTRIBUTION+REFERENCE+BOOK&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the Goths","description":"Provides an overview on the formation of the Gothic tribes, their migrations, and the later history of the Ostrogothic and Visigothic settlements.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xsQxcJvaLjAC&dq=History+of+the+Goths&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death by the Light of the Moon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QQc0ngEACAAJ&dq=Death+by+the+Light+of+the+Moon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Voices Under One Sky: Contemporary Native Literature","description":"This dynamic collection of contemporary short prose, poems, and songs by 44 Native North American authors contains stories about the spirit world, the wilderness, and the joy and sadness of native people in the United States and Canada.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x0EqAQAAIAAJ&dq=Voices+Under+One+Sky:+Contemporary+Native+Literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Italian journeys","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5TgqAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The saga of \\"Cimba.\\"","description":"First published in 1939, this book is a vivid account of Richard Maury s voyage from New York to Fiji in the small, 35-foot, Nova Scotia-built schooner Cimba. When a 23-year-old Maury and a likeminded sailor filled with wanderlust set off into the winter North Atlantic on November 30, 1933, it proved to be an expedition of high adventure, and one embarked upon at a time when such voyages were practically unheard of. The reader is taken on a fascinating journey to Bermuda and, from there, to Grand Turk, Jamaica, Panama and through the Canal, with the two young sailors finding their every dream come true at Galapagos, Marquesas, Tahiti, Samoa culminating in a gripping finale at Fiji...  If I were asked to pick the best book in recent years about deep water cruising in a small yacht, I would unhesitatingly choose The Saga of Cimba by Richard Maury.  Maury went to sea because he loved being at sea and ports to him were interruptions rather than objectives. The story of his cruise is the story of the struggles and triumphs of his diminutive schooner in breasting thousands of miles of deep water. It is the sailing of the schooner that engrossed him. The yarn is the story of a boat rather than the story of her skipper. One can go on to the book s last enthralling page and be left speculating on what sort of a man this Maury is. He never tells you. You have to sense it from his attitude toward his little vessel. But you are left in no doubt about Cimba herself. You know what manner of ship she is. You know every inch of her by the time you have seen her to the Fijis.

A truly unique keepsake and collectors  item to be treasured.  For the nearly seven decades of her reign, Her Majesty The Queen has used clothing to create a powerful visual identity that transcends fashion and has made her perhaps the most readily identifiable person on the planet. Angela Kelly, building on the work of the great designers and milliners who have worked with Her Majesty through the years  including couturiers Sir Norman Hartnell, Sir Hardy Amies, and Ian Thomas, and milliners such as Simone Mirman and Freddy Fox  brings her own imagination to bear on an iconic  uniform  that suggests continuity and tradition, and ensures that the wearer is always the most visible person in a room or a crowd. Anna Wintour, Vogue When Angela Kelly and The Queen are together, laughter echoes through the corridors of Buckingham Palace. Angela has worked with The Queen and walked the corridors of the Royal Household for twenty-five years, initially as Her Majesty s Senior Dresser and then latterly as Her Majesty s Personal Advisor, Curator, Wardrobe and In-house Designer. As the first person in history to hold this title, she shares a uniquely close working relationship with The Queen. In The Other Side of the Coin, The Queen has personally given Angela her blessing to share their extraordinary bond with the world. Whether it s preparing for a formal occasion or brightening Her Majesty s day with a playful joke, Angela s priority is to serve and support. Sharing never-before-seen photographs  many from Angela s own private collection  and charming anecdotes of their time spent together, this revealing book provides memorable insights into what it s like to work closely with The Queen, to curate her wardrobe and to discover a true and lasting connection along the way.  The book documents the unique working relationship between Her Majesty The Queen and the woman who has been her Personal Assistant and Senior Dresser for more than two decades: Angela Kelly. It gives a rare insight into the demands of the job of supporting the Monarch, and we gain privileged insight into a successful working relationship, characterized by humor, creativity, hard work, and a mutual commitment to service and duty. Angela is a talented and inspiring woman, who has captured the highlights of her long career with The Queen for us all to share.

Previously objects of study for cartographers and geographers, the value of medieval maps to scholars in other fields is now recognised and this book, written from an art historical perspective, illuminates the medieval view of the world represented in a group of maps of c.1300. Naomi Kline's detailed examination of the literary, visual, oral and textual evidence of the Hereford mappa mundi and others like it, such as the Psalter Maps, the '\\"Sawley Map\\", and the Ebstorf Map, places them within the larger context of medieval art and intellectual history. The mappa mundi in Hereford cathedral is at the heart of this study: it has more than one thousand texts and images of geographical subjects, monuments, animals, plants, peoples, biblical sites and incidents, legendary material, historical information and much more; distinctions between \\"real\\" and \\"fantastic\\" are fluid; time and space are telescoped, presenting past, present, and future. Naomi Kline provides, for the first time, a full and detailed analysis of the images and texts of the Hereford map which, thus deciphered, allow comparison with related mappae mundi as well as with other texts and images.

This small body of water often compared to the English Channel separates the PRC and Taiwan, and has been the location for periodic military tensions, some threatening to end in war. Today, relations between the ROC and PRC depend on quelling tensions over the Taiwan Strait. This work provides a short, but highly relevant, history of the Taiwan Strait, and its significance today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fbhFEAAAQBAJ&dq=Formosa+Straits&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nicholas Roerich","description":"Record of legends and parables of Central Asia and Tibet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xRDUA5ZpNJsC&dq=Nicholas+Roerich&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clausewitz and Chaos: Friction in War and Military Policy","description":"Failure and folly are inevitable in war and in security policy related to war.

The father of the modern American state was an obscure Macy's department store executive named Beardsley Ruml. During World War II, he devised the plan for withholding taxes from your paycheck, thereby laying in place a system that allows the hand of government to reach into your wallet and take what it wants. Today, taxes make up more than a third of our economy, the highest level in history outside war. We live in the nation revolutionary father Thomas Paine foresaw when he wrote of \\"the Greedy Hand of government thrusting itself into every corner of industry.\\" This book is a cultural examination of the way taxes influence our behavior, how they force us into an arbitrary system that punishes families and individual enterprise. Amity Shlaes unveils the hidden perversities of our lifelong tax experience: how family tax breaks do little to help the family, and can even hurt it. She demonstrates how married women pay a special women's tax rate, higher than anybody else's. She shows how problems that engage and enrage us--Social Security problems, or the things we don't like about schools--are, at heart, tax problems. And she explains why the solutions Washington offers merely accelerate a vicious cycle. Finally, Amity Shlaes shows us a way out of this madness, endorsing a number of common-sense reforms that will give all Americans a fairer and simpler tax system. Written with eloquent compassion for working Americans and their families, The Greedy Hand makes the best case yet for rethinking our tax code. It is a book no tax-paying citizen can afford to ignore.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f7xSuI4lIEYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cult of Saint Thecla: A Tradition of Women's Piety in Late Antiquity (Oxford Early Christian Studies)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NZUArgEACAAJ&dq=The+Cult+of+Saint+Thecla:+A+Tradition+of+Women%27s+Piety+in+Late+Antiquity+(Oxford+Early+Christian+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Culture Is Our Business","description":"Culture Is Our Business is Marshall McLuhan's sequel to The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man. Returning to the subject of advertising newly armed with the electric sensibility that informed The Gutenberg Galaxy, Understanding Media, and The Medium Is the Massage, McLuhan takes on the mad men (a play on the ad men of Madison Avenue) of the sixties. Approaching commercial messages as unacknowledged art forms and cultural artifacts, McLuhan delivers a series of probes that pick apart their meanings and underlying values, their paradoxes and paralogisms, and their overt function as persuasion and propaganda. Through humor, satire, and a poetic sensibility, he provides us with a serious exploration of the consumer culture that emerged out of the electronic media environment. In keeping with the participatory ethos of the Internet that McLuhan so clearly anticipated, this is a book that is meant to open the door to further study, reflection, and discussion, and to encourage the development of critical reception on the part of the reader.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A1qnBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cheng Man-Ching's Advanced Tai-Chi Form Instructions","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3Qe6jgEACAAJ&dq=Cheng+Man-Ching%27s+Advanced+Tai-Chi+Form+Instructions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blago Bung, Blago Bung, Bosso Fatakal (Anti-Classics of Dada)","description":"The First Texts of German Dada Atlas Anti-Classics The German contribution to the Dada movement as it unfolded in Zurich during the first World War is still little known.

In contrast to old-school assumptions of cool-headed rationality, the new behavioral school embraces hot-blooded human irrationality as a core feature of both individuals and financial markets. The 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to scholars of this new scientific approach to irrationality. In Mean Markets and Lizard Brains, Terry Burnham, an economist who has a proven ability to translate complex topics into everyday language, reveals the biological causes of irrationality. The human brain contains ancient structures that exert powerful and often unconscious influences on behavior. This \\"lizard brain\\" may have helped our ancestors eat and reproduce, but it wreaks havoc with our finances. Going far beyond cataloguing our financial foibles, Dr. Burnham applies this novel approach to all of today's most important financial topics: the stock market, the economy, real estate, bonds, mortgages, inflation, and savings. This broad and scholarly investigation provides an in-depth look at why manias, panics, and crashes happen, and why people are built to want to buy at irrationally high prices and sell at irrationally low prices. Most importantly, by incorporating the new science of irrationality, readers can position themselves to profit from financial markets that often seem downright mean. Mean Markets and Lizard Brains skillfully identifies the craziness that is part of human nature, helps us see it in ourselves, and then shows us how to profit from a world that doesn't always make sense.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rXJjltRFSpUC&dq=Mean+Markets+and+Lizard+Brains:+How+to+Profit+from+the+New+Science+of+Irrationality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shirley","description":"NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE STARRING ELIZABETH MOSS AND MICHAEL STUHLBARG!

In Dream, Phantasy and Art she reworks her ideas on these topics and brings them vividly alive in a new integration which links them afresh to the work of Freud, Klein, and Bion. Throughout the book, the clinical illustrations the author has selected brilliantly spotlight the theory, touching the imagination, and fixing even the most difficult ideas permanently in the reader's mind. In a mutually enhancing relationship, theory and clinical example are combined, and then applied, to create the author's new and original theories of art and aesthetics. As Betty Joseph notes in her foreword, Segal's writing, and in particular this book, does much to enrich psychoanalysis not only because of the clarity and intelligence but also because of the depth and breadth of her interests and her clinical imagination.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dQOKAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hail Orisha!: A Phenomenology of a West African Religion in the Mid-Nineteenth Century (Studies of Religion in Africa)","description":"Informed by the documentation of journals and letters of the time, this book offers a detailed view of the day-to-day religion and life of \\"orisha\\" worshippers in West Africa around the mid-nineteenth century, before the advent of colonial rule.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BIdITHIAEs0C&dq=Hail+Orisha!:+A+Phenomenology+of+a+West+African+Religion+in+the+Mid-Nineteenth+Century+(Studies+of+Religion+in+Africa)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hania","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CTUPAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blackbird Rising: Birth of an Aviation Legend","description":"If you want to know how the SR-71 came about & who did what to whom, you need to read this book.

What happens when real-world situations cause those values to conflict? To better understand the intellectual map of how American society works, Arthur G. Neal and Helen Youngelson-Neal analyze values prominent in American word and deed. These values appear in our nation's formal documents-rights and privileges prominently emphasized in the US Constitution and inscribed on the Statue of Liberty. They have shaped the historical destiny and, indeed, include those values most extensively propagated by the general population. Using these criteria, the authors identify individualism, the pursuit of happiness, freedom, consumerism, materialism, equality of opportunity, technology, mastery of the environment, quality of marriage, and national unity as the core American values. Core values provide the raw materials for the construction of contemporary society as a moral community, wherever that community is located. Such values are clusters of ideas that are central to self-identities; they generate a sense of collective belonging and membership. As such, core values define the existing social order and advance a set of ideas for depicting a desirable future. The analysis presented here helps us understand contemporary conflicts inherent in the American value system and the problems confronted by Americans as they try to live within the limitations and contradictions of value systems.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nG9QDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lust and Other Stories","description":"Men and women from their teenage years to their early thirties are vividly portrayed in this collection of stories as they fall in love, live together, fight, and break up.

Anti-British invective, whether directed against the empire, the monarchy, the aristocracy, or even against Americans suspected of harboring pro-English sympathies, would remain an important determinant of U.S. foreign policy well into the 1940s. In Twisting the Lion's Tail, John E. Moser roots out the causes and consequences of this resurgent distrust of \\"perfidious Albion.\\" Through rigorous analysis, Moser shows that twentieth-century American Anglophobia outstrips the two causes which are usually called upon to explain it-isolationist tendencies and the Anglophobia of recent immigrants to the U.S. In addition to these traditional explanations, Moser finds an Anglophobia running far deeper through American culture, rooted in the American national mythology, which continued to cast the British monarchy and empire as antithetical to the ideals of liberty and equality. Twisting the Lion's Tail follows the trajectory of American Anglophobia up to the emerging Cold War-when only the global challenge of Stalin's Soviet Union could persuade most Americans that a long-term association with Great Britain was necessary or even desirable.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S5sUCgAAQBAJ&dq=Women+of+Steel:+Female+Bodybuilders+and+the+Struggle+for+Self-Definition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arabic-Middle East, Egypt Bible","description":"This bible is the Today's Arabic Version.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6UMGAQAACAAJ&dq=Arabic-Middle+East,+Egypt+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ludwig Van Beethoven (Getting to Know the World's Greatest Composers)","description":"These books are without a doubt the definitive-and most entertaining-biographies of composers for young readers.

The Korean peninsula has existed as a fragile territory between China and Japan and thus shared many cultural elements from their neighbors. To what degree has the Japanese and Chinese arts influenced those practiced in Korea over the centuries? Can we distinguish any original Korean martial art style? Chapters in this anthology are derived from the Journal of Asian Martial Arts specifically in response to such questions as asked above. The authors provide great detail on the military/martial manuals that recorded both battlefield arts and personal combative arts and use these sources to give a picture of the martial traditions practiced in Korea for hundreds of years. In chapter one, Stanley Henning provides an excellent overview of martial arts in Korea since the earliest dynasties. These include bare-hand arts as well as those with weaponry. His overview illuminates the time and place of highly influential military manuals as discussed in the chapter by Manuel Adrogu . John Della Pia s two chapters focus on a particular manual the Muye Dobo Tongji (1790) providing details of open-hand and weapons training, in particular with the unique Korean  native sword.  Two chapters provide the theory and practice of qigong methods for health and martial effectiveness. Dr. Patrick Massey et al. offer results on the use of breathing methods affecting lung capacity. Sean Bradley s chapter goes deeply into the medical theories that parallel the practice of Sinmoo Hapkido s qigong methods. The final two chapters focus on practical fighting applications from Hapkido. Marc Tedeschi s chapter provides sound advice for self-defense against multiple opponents. In addition to detailing principles that give any defender a helpful advantage, Tedeschi shows nineteen examples of techniques against two, three, and four opponents that include pressure point striking, throws, arm bars, locks, and a variety of kicks. In the closing chapter, Sean Bradley discusses a few of his favorite techniques, where he learned them, and why they are memorable. Rich in historical details and practical advice, this anthology will prove to be a prized reference work to all interested in the Korean martial traditions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hf0QEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Privileged Lives","description":"A dedicated detective traces the connections between a society queen's sudden awakening from a seven-year coma and the discovery of a hideously mutilated corpse in a luxurious high rise","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P7tNip1yp2EC&dq=Privileged+Lives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Portable Oscar Wilde","description":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, Salome and The Importance of Being Earnest are accompanied by Wilde's prison memoirs, poems, and selected correspondence","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VqYOAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Portable+Oscar+Wilde&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Battle of White Plains","description":"Washington's Harrowing Escape from the Hudson Valley In October 1776 central Westchester witnessed a critical episode in the early campaign of George Washington's ragtag Continental Army and its quest for American independence. Often overlooked as just an interval between the disastrous Battle of Brooklyn and victory at Trenton, the Battle of White Plains showcased Washington's sly strategy of perseverance. Poor decision making and ignorance of the area's hilly terrain among British leadership gave the patriot army a chance to secure a path to safety despite being on the run and outmanned. Though British General Howe claimed victory, the battle's lessons informed Washington's cat and mouse strategy that ultimately brought success later in the war.

Greece has vehemently argued, particularly in the West, that the name Macedonia was in fact Greek and that its use by this new nation in the Balkans portended Macedonia s expansionist ambitions. The Macedonians bitterly disputed this, noting that Alexander the Great was a Macedonian, and adducing many other fascinating and rational arguments. Tensions were said to have been reduced by an interim agreement between the two countries, but the attempted assassination of Macedonian president Kiro Gligorov in October 1995 has again heightened hostility in the area. The genesis of the conflict is detailed here, as well as the modern day events that have led many observers to believe that the area is a flashpoint for a major war, greater than that in Bosnia.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8TPECwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Cut a Long Story Short","description":"Offers fourteen stories of intrigue and surprising twists, many of which are based on incidents recounted to the author in his travels throughout the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I191HiS5l-MC&dq=To+Cut+a+Long+Story+Short&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of Bedford and Somerset Counties, Pennsylvania, with genealogical and personal history","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eQYjAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Final Test (The Secret of the Unicorn Queen, Book 3)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e54kAAAACAAJ&dq=Final+Test+(The+Secret+of+the+Unicorn+Queen,+Book+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach yourself botany (The Teach yourself books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K4rZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Teach+yourself+botany+(The+Teach+yourself+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building with logs,","description":"This deluxe unabridged reprint Legacy Edition of Building With Logs is full of old-time tips and methods from the forest experts on how to build log cabins, shelters, houses, and buildings with the natural materials from the woods.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=foC_zAEACAAJ&dq=Building+with+logs,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tavern At The Ferry","description":"Describes the development of settlements, taverns, and ferry crossings along the Pennsylvania and New Jersey shores of the Delaware River and the events leading to Washington's crossing of this river in 1776.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Not_QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Tavern+At+The+Ferry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joan--the reluctant Kennedy: A biographical profile","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VnOxzQEACAAJ&dq=Joan--the+reluctant+Kennedy:+A+biographical+profile&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The tough-minded optimist","description":"Offers advice on how to end fear and guilt, develop one's self-esteem, achieve prosperity, remain enthusiastic, handle problems, and use the power of prayer","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h-LvSSD_PDQC&dq=The+tough-minded+optimist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decision Analysis for the Professional","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JXL8PQAACAAJ&dq=Decision+Analysis+for+the+Professional&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Guns of Navarone","description":"The classic World War II thriller from the acclaimed master of action and suspense.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e1ZZHkzMb6sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aunt Clara's Dominican Cookbook","description":"The second edition of this bestseller, this cookbook introduces the reader to the Dominican cuisine as a whole cultural experience with its humorous anecdotes, cultural references and information about the history and background of each recipe.

With the recent blockbuster box office success of the Lord of the Rings films, the time is ripe for someone to poke a bit of good-natured fun at the phenomenon that is The Hobbit, and this hilarious parody succeeds brilliantly. Written by an acknowledged expert on all things Tolkien, it both salutes and skewers the classic novel, reinventing the tale of a courageous little being whose amazing persistence--and more than a bit of Soddit luck--belies his diminutive stature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lqbhzQEACAAJ&dq=Soddit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Operation rhino","description":"The fifth African adventure in Lauren St John's bestselling THE WHITE GIRAFFE series.

He saw too lots of words beginning with 'self,' which gave him pause. Self-belief, self-possession, self-righteousness, self-confidence, self-love. Perhaps these characteristics are as necessary to a hero as courage.\\" In Heroes, Fry draws out the humor and pathos in both tender love affairs and heroic battles, and reveals each myth's relevance for our own time. ?

But none of the men seem to be under forty, and Ligurians have particular ideas about life, including swimming (\\"To go swimming in seawater outside the month of July or August is even worse for your health than drinking cappuccino after twelve noon!\\"). But Annie and her sister are captivated by San Pietro's quirkiness and beauty, and suddenly their brief stay stretches into years, as they are bemused, charmed, and ultimately accepted by the eccentric inhabitants of their adopted home.

There were over 500 killed by terrorists in those years, thousands wounded, burned, scarred; there are hundreds in jail or who have done time, and thousands still out there, like \\"Giorgio,\\" having lived decades as clandestine soldiers. The most shocking document of that unstable era and one of the primary source documents in the history of terrorism is this anonymous firsthand narrative of a life devoted to the bloody cause of The Red Brigades. In candid and grim detail, \\"Giorgio\\" tells of his \\"transition to living underground.\\" He coldly narrates his mundane routine that prefigures the methods of al-Quaeda: the long patient shadowing of potential targets (never victim, always \\"target\\"), the clinical monitoring of the news for opportunities for destruction, and the relentless study of target companies to identify the strategic personnel to kneecap or assassinate. He describes the succession of events that took him from simple troublemaking to full-fledged terrorism, from a gleeful \\"proletarian expropriation\\" of Levis from a Milanese \\"jeanseria\\" to shooting at the police in a famous demonstration in which one policeman was killed, and on to outright political assassinations. Fascinating and horrifying to the end, Giorgio's story resonates with the current situation in the United States as much as it did with Italy's when it was first published. A best-seller in Europe and a classic in Italy, this is the first U.S. publication of these uncensored memoirs of an unrepentant terrorist.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O_nHwAEACAAJ&dq=Memoirs+of+an+Italian+Terrorist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Little Learning (An Inspector Peach Mystery)","description":"After this murder, everyone is lying to DI Peach; One weekend in November, two students at the University of East Lancashire are at a loose end.

As noted in the introductory material, almost all African art has a functional base - each sculpture's primary justification is its effectiveness as a ritual or utilitarian object. Text accompanying each photograph describes not only the circumstances, when known, of the object's creation, but also the harmonious interplay of its aesthetic features and cultural and spiritual function. The catalogue also details the rituals surrounding the religious objects and the social importance of the secular works. Organized by region, from the western Sudan to southern Africa, the book includes essays on the history of each area, as well as maps and an extensive bibliography. Michael Kan, the curator of the collection, provides a history of the museum's African art acquisitions since 1900, and the introduction by Roy Sieber traces the evolution of Western appreciation for African art, describing also the value placed on the objects by the community from which they arose.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i8vqAAAAMAAJ&dq=African+Masterworks+in+the+Detroit+Institute+of+Arts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Selfishness","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1FRmPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Selfishness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Fierce Splendor (Delaney Dynasty, 1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M6hdDY-B3VgC&dq=This+Fierce+Splendor+(Delaney+Dynasty,+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"JOB (DAILY STUDY BIBLE)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jhQltJewQNAC&dq=JOB+(DAILY+STUDY+BIBLE)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heir To Danger (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1312)(Code of the Outback series)","description":"To escape an arranged marriage, princess Shara Najran fled the Australian Outback.

Their greatest challenge is to identify, manage and use the right information to compete.

Donald Marchand and his colleagues at IMD invite you to learn your information responsibilities, so your company can use information faster, better and smarter than the competition. By using the business framework of 'strategic information alignment,' this book shows how information can create business value through delighting customers, being more innovative, managing risks and being the low-cost leader in your markets and industries.

Spirits were high when the Fairchild F-227 took off from Mendoza, Argentina, and headed for Santiago, Chile. On board were forty-five people, including an amateur rugby team from Uruguay and their friends and family. The skies were clear that Friday, October 13, 1972, and at 3:30 p.m., the Fairchild s pilot reported their altitude at 15,000 feet. But one minute later, the Santiago control tower lost all contact with the aircraft. For eight days, Chileans, Uruguayans, and Argentinians searched for it, but snowfall in the Andes had been heavy, and the odds of locating any wreckage were slim. Ten weeks later, a Chilean peasant in a remote valley noticed two haggard men desperately gesticulating to him from across a river. He threw them a pen and paper, and the note they tossed back read:  I come from a plane that fell in the mountains . . .  Sixteen of the original forty-five passengers on the F-227 survived its horrific crash. In the remote glacial wilderness, they camped in the plane s fuselage, where they faced freezing temperatures, life-threatening injuries, an avalanche, and imminent starvation. As their meager food supplies ran out, and after they heard on a patched-together radio that the search parties had been called off, it seemed like all hope was lost. To save their own lives, these men and women not only had to keep their faith, they had to make an impossible decision: Should they eat the flesh of their dead friends? A remarkable story of endurance and determination, friendship and the human spirit, Alive is the dramatic bestselling account of one of the most harrowing quests for survival in modern times.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UqHMDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Big Book of Crazy Quilt Stitches","description":"Embellish the seams and patches of crazy quilt projects with over 75 embroidery stitches and floral motifs.

Melting snow and warmer temperatures provide optimal opportunity for mushroom enthusiasts; people of all ages can be found wandering the woods, clutching bags and hoping to spot a clump of elusive morels. Now, for budding naturalists, beginning mushroom hunters, and professionals outside of the area of mycology, Donald Huffman and Lois Tiffany have provided this laminated guide to the most common mushrooms of Iowa. The guide illustrates forty-three species of Iowa mushrooms using color photos that show the fungi in the wild, from the yellow morel to the destroying angel to the pear-shaped puffball. Huffman and Tiffany give common and scientific names, descriptions of caps and stalks, descriptions of where the mushrooms can be found (on the ground in woods, in clusters on fallen logs, etc.), the season when they are most likely to be seen, plus information on edibility from the  choice edible  yellow morel, much coveted by generations of mushroom hunters, to the poisonous false morel. Mushrooms  diverse forms and variety of colors, along with their seemingly mysterious appearances and disappearances, have long made them objects of fascination. Mushrooms in Your Pocket will be an invaluable companion for finding and identifying these unusual and interesting organisms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uOO8MgEACAAJ&dq=Mushrooms+in+Your+Pocket:+A+Guide+to+the+Mushrooms+of+Iowa+(Bur+Oak+Guide)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conversemos First Book for Spanish Conversation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qFPJvwEACAAJ&dq=Conversemos+First+Book+for+Spanish+Conversation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hidden Florida Keys & Everglades (Hidden Florida Keys & Everglades, 6th ed)","description":"The Florida Keys have witnessed all kinds of historical events, from the dramatic and the outrageous to the tragic and the comic.

For example, two thirds of Americans including most history teachers think the Confederate States seceded for  states  rights.  This error persists because most have never read the key documents about the Confederacy. These documents have always been there. When South Carolina seceded, it published  Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union.  The document actually opposes states  rights. Its authors argue that Northern states were ignoring the rights of slave owners as identified by Congress and in the Constitution. Similarly, Mississippi s  Declaration of the Immediate Causes    says,  Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery the greatest material interest of the world.  Later documents in this collection show how neo-Confederates obfuscated this truth, starting around 1890. The evidence also points to the centrality of race in neo-Confederate thought even today and to the continuing importance of neo-Confederate ideas in American political life. The 150th anniversary of secession and civil war provides a moment for all Americans to read these documents, properly set in context by award-winning sociologist and historian James W. Loewen and co-editor, Edward H. Sebesta, to put in perspective the mythology of the Old South.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QWKzf8j2yPoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Marauders","description":"A little Elmore Leonard, a little Charles Portis, and very much its own uniquely American self. . .Tom Cooper has written one hell of a novel. -Stephen King When the BP oil spill devastates the Louisiana Gulf Coast, the citizens of the bayou town of Jeanette scramble to replace their lost livelihoods.

In New York City, a brutal act of violence summons a malevolent spirit and a growing congregation of desensitized worshippers in  The Whimper of Whipped Dogs,  an Edgar Award winner influenced by the real-life murder of Queens resident Kitty Genovese in 1964. In  Paingod,  the deity tasked with inflicting pain and suffering on every living being in the universe questions the purpose of its cruel existence. Deathbird Stories collects these and sixteen more provocative tales exploring the futility of faith in a faithless world. A legendary author of speculative fiction whose best-known works include A Boy and His Dog and I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream and whose major awards and nominations number in the dozens, Harlan Ellison strips away convention and hypocrisy and lays bare the human condition in modern society as ancient gods fade and new deities rise to appease the masses gods of technology, drugs, gambling, materialism that are as insubstantial as the beliefs of those who venerate them.

For one year, in 2007-2008, Sebastian Junger accompanied 30 men a single platoon from the storied 2nd battalion of the U.S. Army as they fought their way through a remote valley in eastern Afghanistan.Over the course of five trips, Junger was in more firefights than he could count, as men he knew were killed or wounded and he himself was almost killed. His relationship with these soldiers grew so close that they considered him part of the platoon, and he enjoyed an access and a candidness that few, if any, journalists ever attain. War is a narrative about combat: the fear of dying, the trauma of killing and the love between platoon-mates who would rather perish than let each other down. Gripping, honest and intense, War explores the neurological, psychological and social elements of combat, as well as the incredible bonds that form between these small groups of men. This is not a book about Afghanistan or the  War on Terror ; it is a book about all men, in all wars. Junger set out to answer what he thought of as the  hand-grenade question : why would a man throw himself on a hand grenade to save other men he has known for probably only a few months? The answer is elusive but profound, going to the heart of what it means not just to be a soldier, but to be human.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qQR3iRW0a8gC&dq=War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Michael McClure (Boise State University Western Writers Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K4IhAQAAIAAJ&dq=Michael+McClure+(Boise+State+University+Western+Writers+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War as I Knew It","description":"Transcripts from General Patten's war diary covering his campaigns in Sicily, France, and Germany","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2A4BPpDQTfcC&dq=War+as+I+Knew+It&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plucked From The Fire","description":"This book focuses on Zechariah's vision of Joshua the high priest and how the Lord cleansed him, clothed him, crowned him, and commissioned him.

However, using the Internet to carry sensitive information can present serious privacy and security problems. By explaining how VPNs actually work, networking expert Jon Snader shows software engineers and network administrators how to use tunneling, authentication, and encryption to create safe, effective VPNs for any environment. Using an example-driven approach, VPNs Illustrated explores how tunnels and VPNs function by observing their behavior \\"on the wire.\\" By learning to read and interpret various network traces, such as those produced by tcpdump, readers will be able to better understand and troubleshoot VPN and network behavior. Specific topics covered include: Block and stream symmetric ciphers, such as AES and RC4; and asymmetric ciphers, such as RSA and EIGamal Message authentication codes, including HMACs Tunneling technologies based on gtunnel SSL protocol for building network-to-network VPNs SSH protocols as drop-in replacements for telnet, ftp, and the BSD r-commands Lightweight VPNs, including VTun, CIPE, tinc, and OpenVPN IPsec, including its Authentication Header (AH) protocol, Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), and IKE (the key management protocol) Packed with details, the text can be used as a handbook describing the functions of the protocols and the message formats that they use. Source code is available for download, and an appendix covers publicly available software that can be used to build tunnels and analyze traffic flow.

In the second edition of The Saudi Arabian Economy, Mohamed Ramady uses several overlapping themes to establish and develop a framework for studying the fundamental challenges to the Saudi economy. Particular attention is paid to the benefits of short-term planning and long-term diversification intended to shield the economy from potentially de-stabilizing oil price fluctuations and the pace and diversity of domestic reforms. The author examines the core strengths and evolution of various financial institutions and the Saudi stock market in the face of globalization, before analyzing the private sector in detail. Topics discussed include: ? The hydrocarbon and minerals sector, including the emergence of the competitive petrochemical sector ? The impact of small and medium sized businesses and the evolving role of  family  businesses ? The growing role of women in the Saudi economy ? The role of privatization and FDI as engines of change and the position of public-private-partnerships ? The establishment of a foundation for a knowledge-based economy Finally, the author offers an analysis of the key challenges facing the Saudi economy, paying particular attention to the potential costs and benefits of globalization, and membership in the WTO. Employment, education, economic and social stability, and Saudi Arabia s place in the Gulf Cooperation Council, as well as Saudi Arabia s evolving strategic economic relations with China and other countries are offered as keys to the consensus building needed to ensure the Kingdom s healthy economic future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U7ae3Y2idIkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scoffield Study Bible","description":"The fruit of Dr. C.

Charlie Bellerose leads a seminomadic existence, traveling widely to manage the language academies he has established in different countries. After separating, somewhat amicably, from his wife, he moves from Madrid back to his native Canada to set up a new school, and for the first time he forges a meaningful relationship with his brother, who s going through a vicious divorce. Charlie s able to make a fresh start in Toronto but longs for his twelve-year-old daughter, whom he sees only via Skype and the occasional overseas visit. After a chance encounter with a girlfriend from his university days, a woman now happily married and with children of her own, he works through a series of memories-including a particularly painful one they share-as he reflects on questions of family, home, fatherhood, and love. But two tragic events (one long past, the other very much in the present) finally threaten to destroy everything he's ever believed in.

Over the past 150 years man s actions have thrown some species of gulls totally out of context with their world, yet they have managed not only to survive but, for better or worse, to multiply at a rate that matches man s own. Nature fitted the forty-four species of gulls to be efficient predators and scavengers, and for hundreds of years they lived the precarious existence of wild things, foraging along the shore and feeding on birds  eggs and nestlings. When man arrived on the scene, they rapidly learned to follow the fishing boats and even went into the fields to eat the insects turned up by the plow at one point saving an entire harvest by consuming swarms of grasshoppers. The nineteenth-century craze for plumage on women s fashions nearly extirpated several kinds of gulls from our coasts. At last naturalists and concerned laymen established bird-protection societies to halt the indiscriminate slaughter. Then a new element entered the scene: open garbage dumps. The graceful predators became omnipresent scavengers whose population explosion for a time seemed to have no end; whose range extended year after year; whose feet carried contaminants from dumps to reservoirs; who endangered aircraft; and who destroyed colonies of terns and puffins by consuming their eggs and young.

Twenty years after his tragic death-he was shot by his father-his relevance persists because of the indelible mark his outsized talent left on American culture. A transcendent performer whose career spanned the history of rhythm and blues, from doo-wop to the sultriest of soul music, Gaye's artistic scope and emotional range set the soundtrack for America's tumultuous coming of age in the 1970s. Michael Eric Dyson's searching narrative illuminates Marvin Gaye's stellar ascendance-from a black church in Washington, D.C., to the artistic peak of What's Going On?-and charts his sobering personal decline. Dyson draws from interviews with those closest to Gaye to paint an intimate portrait of the tensions and themes that shaped contemporary urban America: racism, drug abuse, economic adversity, and the long legacy of hardship. Gaye's stormy relationships with women, including duet partner Tammi Terrell and wives Anna Gordy and Janis Hunter, are examined in light of the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. Dyson also considers family violence in the larger context of the African-American life and how that heartbreaking legacy resulted in Gaye's murder. Mercy, Mercy, Me is an unforgettable portrait of a beloved black genius whose art is reflected in the dynamism of contemporary urban America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=83s6mwmjXBcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lethal Justice: One Man's Journey of Hope on Death Row","description":"a history of religious communities in the Church","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AMryAAAAMAAJ&dq=Lethal+Justice:+One+Man%27s+Journey+of+Hope+on+Death+Row&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sedimentation in Versailles Lake, Ripley County, southeastern Indiana, 1956-88 (Water-resources investigations report)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tNrz9Cg_zf4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Harvard Brief Dictionary of Music","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YWrbnQEACAAJ&dq=The+Harvard+Brief+Dictionary+of+Music&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"As I Remember: An Autobiography by Lillian Gilbreth","description":"Reminiscences of Lillian Gilbreth, co-author of Cheaper by the Dozen and recipient of honors and awards which are listed at the end of the book along with academic degrees, memberships, and books and articles she authored.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gUwBAAAACAAJ&dq=As+I+Remember:+An+Autobiography+by+Lillian+Gilbreth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Britannica encyclopedia of American art","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SeWBoAEACAAJ&dq=The+Britannica+encyclopedia+of+American+art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Righteous Deception: German Officers Against Hitler","description":"In the spring of 1944, Adolf Hitler firmly believed that the llies would invade the Continent via the beaches of Normandy.

Lynda Barry captures all the glorious magic and excrutiating pain of junior high school in this Ernie Pook Comeek collection from the early 90s. The star of this collection is 14 year old Maybonne who relays the angst and insecurity of life through hand scrawled diary entries, class assignments, and letters, in cursive with doodle and bubble letters. Of course, there is the ever-annoying yet adorable little sister Marlys who never fails to read her big sister s diary. Barry deftly portrays the capricious nature of teen friendships, adolescent peer-pressure, and the kill or be killed nature of a middle school s social scene in her signature style. No one but Lynda Barry can so naturally zero in on the joyous urgency yet heartbreaking poignancy of childhood. In an authentic teen voice full of diffidence and melodrama, the bespectacled and freckled Maybonne relates all of life s indiginities on equal measure. Heartbreaking stories of a broken home, child molestation, an alcoholic absentee father and a bitter mom emerge between strips about home ec class, summer vacation, and babysitting, illustrating Barry s peerless ability to make the reader both cry and laugh.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JtIuEAAAQBAJ&dq=Come+Over,+Come+Over&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the House of the False Lama: Travels with Monks, Nomads, and Outlaws","description":"Beyond the House of the /td/tr/table Lama, now in paperback, traces Crane's adventures as a writer, wanderer, and anarchic but still failing student of Zen.

This urgently paced yet deeply introspective novel closely tracks Jack Kerouac s own life. Jack Duluoz journeys from the Cascade Mountains to San Francisco, Mexico City, New York, and Tangier. While working as a fire lookout on Desolation Peak in the Cascades, Duluoz contemplates his inner void and the distressing isolation brought on by his youthful sense of adventure. In Tangier he suffers a similar feeling of desperation during an opium overdose, and in Mexico City he meets up with a morphine-addicted philosopher and seeks an antidote to his solitude in a whorehouse. As in Kerouac s other novels, Desolation Angels features a lively cast of pseudonymous versions of his fellow Beat poets, including William S. Burroughs (as Bull Hubbard), Neal Cassady (as Cody Pomeray), and Allen Ginsberg (as Irwin Garden). Duluoz draws readers into the trials and tribulations of these literary iconoclasts from drug-fueled writing frenzies and alcoholic self-realizations to frenetic international road trips and tumultuous love affairs. Achieving literary success comes with its own consequences though, as Duluoz and his friends must face the scrutiny that comes with rising to the national stage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yKCCCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Overcoming Jet Lag","description":"The amazing 3-step program developed at the Argonne National Laboratory and used by Fortune 500 executives and the U.S. Army Rapid Deployment Forces -- over 200,000 copies in print!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x1-cPwAACAAJ&dq=Overcoming+Jet+Lag&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Myth and Christianity; an Inquiry Into the Possibility of Religion Without Myth","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=94hLAAAAIAAJ&dq=Myth+and+Christianity%3B+an+Inquiry+Into+the+Possibility+of+Religion+Without+Myth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eight Skilled Gentlemen","description":"Master Li, the Sherlock Holmes of a mythical China, struggles with a bizarre mystery involving the murdering of mandarins, as evidence points to the Eight Skilled Gentlemen, long-dead shamans who engage demon-dieties to perform their evil deeds","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=71_jsgEACAAJ&dq=Eight+Skilled+Gentlemen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coleridge's Ancient Mariner And Select Poems","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bPllDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son","description":"Tim Wise offers a highly personal examination of the ways in which racial privilege shapes the lives of most white Americans, overtly racist or not, to the detriment of people of color, themselves, and society.

It s time to invest in our teachers and local school leaders instead of in more tests. It s time to help all students understand how to unleash their strengths and gain a sense of themselves as learners capable of choosing their own paths to success. In The Perfect Assessment System, Rick Stiggins calls for the ground-up redevelopment of assessment in U.S. education. Speaking from more than 40 years of experience in the field and speaking for all learners who hope to succeed, the teachers who want them to succeed, and the local school leaders whose aspirations for success have been thwarted by assessment traditions Stiggins maps out the adjustments in practice and culture necessary to generate both accurate accountability data and the specific evidence of individual mastery that will support sound instructional decision making and better learning in the classroom. He addresses ? Assessment purpose how (and why) to clarify the reason for every assessment and the users it will serve. ? Learning targets to be assessed how to make sure we focus on the right competencies and set consistent definitions of success. ? Assessment quality how to ensure every assessment, at every level, is an excellent one. ? Communication of assessment results how to share information in ways that best support diverse purposes. ? Assessment impact how to link assessment to truly productive, universal student motivation. We have not yet begun to explore assessment s true potential to enhance both school quality and student well-being. Stiggins kicks off this critical conversation and charts a course for a new system that promises much higher levels of student success at a fraction of our current testing costs. The door is open for assessment reform; here is a bold plan for getting it right.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=egB3DgAAQBAJ&dq=Assessment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Motherhood The Second Oldest Profession","description":"#1 New York Times bestseller:A hilarious look at one of the toughest jobs on earth, by a writer  with the comic equivalent of perfect pitch  (The Boston Globe).

His books have had great success in this country, particularly The Cairo Trilogy. Fans of the famed trilogy will be delighted with The Harafish, an epic novel that chronicles the dramatic history of the al-Nagi family -- a family that moves, over many generations, from the height of power and glory to the depths of decadence and decay. The Harafish begins with the tale of Ashur al-Nagi, a man who grows from humble beginnings to become a great leader, a legend among his people. Generation after generation, however, Ashur's descendants grow further from his legendary example. They lose touch with their origins as they amass and then squander large fortunes, marry prostitutes when they marry at all, and develop rivalries that end in death. The community's upper class keeps a watchful eye on the descendants of al-Nagi for fear of losing their privileges, but they find no threat of another such as Ashur. Not, that is, until the al-Nagi who, like his noble ancestor, finds his power once again from among The Harafish, or the common people. Through the strength of their numbers and their passion, the glory of the name of al-Nagi is restored. \\"Of all [Mahfouz's] experiments in recent decades, this is the one which owes least to western inspiration and is probably the most successful. The Harafish, fluently translated by Catherine Cobham, makes accessible and engrossing reading.\\" -- The Washington Post Book World.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-55BDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (Norton Critical Editions)","description":"The Norton Critical Edition of this influential Harlem Renaissance novel includes related materials available in no other edition. Known only as the  Ex-Colored Man,  the protagonist in Johnson s novel is forced to choose between celebrating his African American heritage or  passing  as an average white man in a post-Reconstruction America that is rapidly changing. This Norton Critical Edition is based on the 1912 text. It is accompanied by a detailed introduction, explanatory footnotes, and a note on the text. The appendices that follow the novel include materials available in no other edition: manuscript drafts of the final chapters, including the original lynching scene (chapter 10, ca. 1910) and the original ending (chapter 11, ca. 1908). An unusually rich selection of  Backgrounds and Sources  focuses on Johnson s life; the autobiographical inspirations for The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man; the cultural history of the era in which Johnson lived and wrote; the noteworthy reception history for the 1912, 1927, and 1948 editions; and related writings by Johnson. In addition to Johnson, contributors include Eugene Levy, W. E. B. Du Bois, Carl Van Vechten, Blanche W. Knopf, and Victor Weybright among others.

Living a secluded life in the backwoods of Wisconsin, he carries a nineteenth-century rifle and never seems to age--a fact that has recently caught the attention of prying government eyes. The truth is, Enoch is the last surviving veteran of the American Civil War and, for close to a century, he has operated a secret way station for aliens passing through on journeys to other stars. But the gifts of knowledge and immortality that his intergalactic guests have bestowed upon him are proving to be a nightmarish burden, for they have opened Enoch's eyes to humanity's impending destruction. Still, one final hope remains for the human race . . . though the cure could ultimately prove more terrible than the disease. Winner of the Hugo Award for Best Novel, Way Station is a magnificent example of the fine art of science fiction as practiced by a revered Grand Master. A cautionary tale that is at once ingenious, evocative, and compassionately human, it brilliantly supports the contention of the late, great Robert A. Heinlein that \\"to read science-fiction is to read Simak.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O5vJsgEACAAJ&dq=Way+Station&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","description":"Speigel gets right down to business with instructing how to create three of the most sought-after Flash applications: 1.

In recent years, however, those revolutionary projects of the sixties and seventies have given way to quite a different narrative vision and ideology. Dubbed the new sentimentalism, this trend is now keenly elucidated in Love and Politics in the Contemporary Spanish American Novel. Offering a rich account of the rise of this new mode, as well as its political and cultural implications, An bal Gonz lez delivers a close reading of novels by Miguel Barnet, Elena Poniatowska, Isabel Allende, Alfredo Bryce Echenique, Gabriel Garc a M rquez, Antonio Sk rmeta, Luis Rafael S nchez, and others. Gonz lez proposes that new sentimental novels are inspired principally by a desire to heal the division, rancor, and fear produced by decades of social and political upheaval. Valuing pop culture above the avant-garde, such works also tend to celebrate agape the love of one's neighbor while denouncing the negative effects of passion (eros). Illuminating these and other aspects of post-Boom prose, Love and Politics in the Contemporary Spanish American Novel takes a fresh look at contemporary works.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FALsfqla0CoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Riley Child-rhymes With Hoosier Pictures","description":"First produced in 1890, this charming book includes 39 of James Whitcomb Riley's signature poems, such as \\"Old Aunt Mary's,\\" \\"Little Orphant Annie,\\" and \\"The Raggedy Man.\\" Graced by noted Brown County artist Will Vawter's illustrations of scenes such as \\"The Nine Goblins,\\" \\"The Circus Day Parade,\\" and \\"Barefoot, Hungry, Lean Ornery Boys,\\" Riley Child-Rhymes with Hoosier Pictures recalls simpler times gone by.

Fifty percent of adult women have some form of sexual dysfunction at some point of their lives, preventing them from enjoying vibrant, soul-satisfying sex. Such was the case with Laura Zam, who suffered the blame, shame, and embarrassment of feeling bedroom broken. For her, delving between the sheets meant physical pain, zero desire, and emotional scars from being molested in her early years. However, in her late forties, after meeting and marrying the love of her life, Zam was determined to finally fix her sensual self. This is her brave and bawdy plan to triage her flaccid romantic life, stepping into a void where intimacy, self-love, and playfulness could be experienced--the full monty of Eros that had been missing from her existence. The Pleasure Plan is what happened when she decided to challenge her hopelessness. In partnership with her initially reluctant husband, she visited 15 healers and tried 30 pleasure-enhancing methods: from dilators and dildos, to hypnosis and hosting a sex brunch, to cleansing chakras, to making love to her husband in front of a geriatric Tantric goddess. Packed with humor, heart, and a healthy dose of prescriptive advice, this book chronicles Zam s insight as she confronts many issues from mismatched libidos to female erection enlightenment. Throughout this journey, she and her husband grow as individuals and as a couple, both in and out of the bedroom. Fearlessly honest and full of inspiration, Zam peels back the layers or covers and exposes her foibles, insecurities, and eventual wisdom as she excavates past traumas, accepts and embraces her worth, and claims her right to be completely alive. Today, Laura works as a sexuality educator, wellness coach, and speaker helping other women who suffer from sexual dysfunction, the effects of trauma, or those who would simply like more pleasure (of all kinds) in their lives. She also consults with health care providers so they may better assist their clients in achieving sexual well-being. While The Pleasure Plan is Zam s personal narrative, it demystifies pervasive taboos, encouraging women to make pleasure a priority, while teaching them how to claim (or reclaim) the power of their sexual selves. It also shows men how they can support their partners in this #Metoo era. Healthy, sultry intimacy is a right; it is time for women to learn through glorious trial and error how to embrace the sensual side of themselves. . . exuberantly and unabashedly.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Awy2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to The Dominican Republic Map (Rough Guide Country/Region Map)","description":"Accomodation - Eating and drinking - Shops and markets - Music and night life - Festivals and events - Paris suburbsn_","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-nEcC1zeg-MC&dq=The+Rough+Guide+to+The+Dominican+Republic+Map+(Rough+Guide+Country/Region+Map)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Light of My Heart (Silver Hills Trilogy, Book 1)","description":"Dr. Letitia Morgan comes to Hartville, Colorado, in the late 1800s to follow her God-given calling to heal.

Unlike most of their contemporaries, they learnt very early in their history that winning a battle did not necessarily win a war, and they frequently bought off their enemies with treaties and bribes rather than squander men and mat riel in potentially fruitless campaigns. The Byzantine army of the 10th and early 11th centuries, at the height of its power and efficiency, was the best-organised, best-trained, best-equipped and highest-paid in the known world. This splendid book by Ian Heath examines the Byzantine Armies from 886-1118, including the lusty, hard-fighting, hard-drinking 'barbarian' Varangian guard.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J0xoAAAAMAAJ&dq=Byzantine+Armies+886-1118+(Men-at-Arms)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saved!

Her success was mostly due to Fox Studio s publicity: they made her a screen vamp and used her to titillate the public. And Theda Bara, ambitious and nearing 30 when she made her first film, enthusiastically played the role. In real life, Theodosia Goodman bore little resemblance to the vampish Theda Bara character. But the studio-created persona, with the invented name, evil personality and fictional history, was a major star. Though her films were often trite, poorly acted, extravagant and crude, the public packed movie houses. But her film career ended once the public tired of the persona. Through contemporary newspaper accounts, film reviews, interviews and other sources, this is a comprehensive account of the life and times of one of Hollywood s first female stars.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cmwfPXTQNSwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Surrendered Love, Redeeming Grace","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RkSNAAAACAAJ&dq=Surrendered+Love,+Redeeming+Grace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The First Captain Underpants Collection (Books 1-4)","description":"Offers four previously published adventures featuring Harold, George, and principal-turned-superhero Captain Underpants.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y2kCPQAACAAJ&dq=The+First+Captain+Underpants+Collection+(Books+1-4)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christian Spirituality: An Introduction","description":"This text fills the need for a clear, informative, helpful andwell-written introduction to Christian spirituality.

A critic rather than a designer, he did not fit easily into any school or category. To those seeking to promote modernism, Hegemann was something of an awkward figure - influential and undoubtedly authoritative but unorthodox. Today, however, when studies of modernism have largely shed their proselytizing role, he is of great relevance. Our interest now is less in those who proposed the answers than in those who asked the questions - and particularly the way in which those questions were framed. For this Hegemann is a key figure.\\" \\"Based on documentation largely unavailable in English - including Hegemann's published and unpublished writings, his correspondence, his diaries, the author's interviews, archival materials lent to her by Hegemann's widow, and the author's own substantial collection - this is the first comprehensive study of Hegemann for historians, architects, and urbanists.\\"--BOOK JACKET.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lnRwcHGyfTsC&dq=Werner+Hegemann+and+the+Search+for+Universal+Urbanism.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple Thai & Chinese Step-By-Step","description":"Presents a collection of accessible and economical Thai classics that can be readily prepared by busy American home cooks, offering such options as pad Thai with shrimp, tom yum soup, and pork satay with peanut sauce.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pwhwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Simple+Thai&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The bride who wanted a special present: And other tales from Western Kenya","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8llOtQAACAAJ&dq=The+bride+who+wanted+a+special+present:+And+other+tales+from+Western+Kenya&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pyramid Climbers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9kTMmgvUmjMC&dq=The+Pyramid+Climbers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Empire of Shadow (Three World Trilogy, No. 2)","description":"The hero is Pel Brown, an inter-dimensional traveller who goes to the aid of two parallel universes.

A virtuoso pianist and electrifying showman, he toured extensively throughout the European continent, bringing sold-out audiences to states of ecstasy while courting scandal with his frequent womanizing. Drawing on new, highly revealing documentary sources, including a veritable treasure trove of previously unexamined material on Liszt s Weimar years, best-selling author Oliver Hilmes shines a spotlight on the extraordinary life and career of this singularly dazzling musical phenomenon. Whereas previous biographies have focused primarily on the composer s musical contributions, Hilmes showcases Liszt the man in all his many shades and personal reinventions: child prodigy, Romantic eccentric, fervent Catholic, actor, lothario, celebrity, businessman, genius, and extravagant show-off. The author immerses the reader in the intrigues of the nineteenth-century European glitterati (including Liszt s powerful patrons, the monstrous Wagner clan) while exploring the true, complex face of the artist and the soul of his music. No other Liszt biography in English is as colorful, witty, and compulsively readable, or reveals as much about the true nature of this extraordinary, outrageous talent.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ing8DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Starting Over","description":"I wish I had loved more. I wish I had been smarter about money. I wish I had thought about God more. We all have regrets about the past. Many of them come from our attempts to fulfill unmet longings. Dave and Jon Ferguson call this back and forth between longing and regret the Sorry Cycle and they want to help us escape it. In Starting Over, Dave and Jon show us how to recognize specific regrets and then release them to God as we learn to see our regrets as opportunities to start over. Finally, we can see God redeem our regrets as he takes the worst things in our lives and uses them for a greater good. Your regrets don t need to keep you from the joy God has for your life. As you apply the recognize-release-redeem process to your financial, relational, and personal regrets, you will find new freedom in living out your God-given dreams. Fall in Love with Your Regrets It sounds impossible. How can we learn to love our mistakes and failures? Instead, we go over and over them in our mind. Could they ever bring us or anyone else good? Drawing from scientific research and biblical truths, Jon and Dave Ferguson give us tools to redeem our mistakes in five key areas: relationships, health, purpose, finances, and spirituality. Along the way, they teach us lifelong skills for getting unstuck when regret threatens to trap us again. We also learn how to help others escape the Sorry Cycle and experience the Starting Over Loop. It is possible to learn to love our regrets because through them we see God at work. We see that our weakness does not limit what God can do. Whatever regret is trapping you in the Sorry Cycle, God is big enough to redeem it. What could you do with a life beyond regret?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4AziCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And Still the Earth","description":"In future S?o Paulo, water is scarce, garbage clogs the roads, and every life is now ruled by the sinister and omnipotent System.

Here -- for the first time in one volume -- is the chronicle of the United States Army's dramatic mobilization and stunning march to victory in World War II. In a lively and engrossing narrative that spans theaters of operations around the world, Geoffrey Perret tells how the Army was drafted, trained, organized, armed, and led at every stage of the war. Beginning with the prescient military planners of the 1930s, he offers vivid warts-and-all profiles of the farsighted commanders who would lead the way, men like Marshall, MacArthur, Eisenhower, Ridgway, Bradley, and Patton.

They represent differences in socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and age. They were selected for this study because they use computer based technologies in their daily work. The conceptual framework underlying this research is feminist standpoint theory. Standpoint theory in this study stems from the work of Harding (1991) who has grounded standpoint theory in eight claims. These claims were connected to clusters that were organized into segments that could be contrasted, compared and analyzed. Themes were developed and photographs were used to operationalize the cluster categories. Methodology used for this study included three structured interviews. The first interview elicited background information. Interview two used the photographs as an auto driving technique to stimulate discussion. The third interview asked the respondents to validate their narratives and to describe their reactions to the feminist perspective. Results of this study demonstrate the importance of valuing women's lives as starting points for research and as generators of evidence for or against knowledge claims--specifically as their lives relate to computer based technologies. Women need to learn to value and network with other women in the use of technology. These respondents' early learning experiences reflect the cultural agenda and an absence of \\"hands on\\" science activities. They also encounter gender oppression in many forms in their daily life experiences. Although they all had opportunities to engage in computer learning at different stages of their life, the time to learn and the opportunities to access computers were constraints that prevented further advancement. These women educators predict positive futures for girls who are computer literate, but warn of the potential of the increasing power of technology to divide women in our society into the haves and the have-nots.

During this post-World War II period, Japanese printmakers effectively acted as ambassadors, bringing their aesthetic traditions into fruitful interaction with contemporary American trends and forging ties with artists, scholars, museums, and collectors. This volume presents for the first time an integrated history of innovative visual experimentation and pioneering cultural patronage. The creative print (sosaku hanga) movement originated in the early twentieth century, when Japanese artists sought to modernize their practice by embracing Euro-American concepts of originality and autonomy. The movement matured in the decades following World War II, when second- and third-generation sosaku hanga printmakers continued to experiment in stylistic, technical, and thematic terms. From the early 1950s, Japanese printmakers participated in a newly global art scene, achieving great success at international art exhibitions sponsored by the American and Japanese governments. The prints in this book range widely in treatment and medium, embracing woodcut, stencil, lithography, etching, mezzotint, aquatint, and screenprint. Made in Japan includes essays by Alicia Volk and Helen Nagata and biographies of the artists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TJePQgAACAAJ&dq=Made+in+Japan:+The+Postwar+Creative+Print+Movement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"*Signed* Doble Steam Cars, Buses, Lorries and Railcars","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eIVTAAAAMAAJ&dq=*Signed*+Doble+Steam+Cars,+Buses,+Lorries+and+Railcars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One, By One, By One: The Landmark Exploration of the Holocaust and the Uses of Memory","description":"Holocaust Memory in the Digital Age explores the nexus of new media and memory practices, raising questions about how advances in digital technologies continue to influence the nature of Holocaust memorialization.

Now, the Shoah Foundation's investment in new digital media is instrumental to its commitment to remembering the Holocaust both as a subject of historical importance in its own right and as a paradigmatic moral exhortation against intolerance. Shandler not only considers the Archive as a whole, but also looks closely at individual survivors' stories, focusing on narrative, language, and spectacle to understand how Holocaust remembrance is mediated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QHonDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Milton (English men of letters)","description":"Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive.

The author argues that Plato's 'dialogues' with traditional genres are part and parcel of his effort to define 'philosophy'. Before Plato, 'philosophy' designated 'intellectual cultivation' in the broadest sense. When Plato appropriated the term for his own intellectual project, he created a new and specialised discipline. In order to define and legitimise 'philosophy', Plato had to match it against genres of discourse that had authority and currency in democratic Athens. By incorporating the text or discourse of another genre, Plato 'defines' his new brand of wisdom in opposition to traditional modes of thinking and speaking. By targeting individual genres of discourse Plato marks the boundaries of 'philosophy' as a discursive and as a social practice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n3MeQikAp00C&dq=Genres+in+Dialogue:+Plato+and+the+Construct+of+Philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Loathsome Jews and Engulfing Women: Metaphors of Projection in the Works of Wyndham Lewis, Charles Williams, and Graham Greene (Literature and Psychology)","description":"\\"A remarkable study, one that I recommend to any reader fascinated by the shaping of culture and the power of the psyche.\\" - The Forward How typical of his generation was T.S. Eliot when he complained that Hitler made an intelligent anti-semitism impossible for a generation? In her new book, Loathsome Jews and Engulfing Women, novelist and critic, Andrea Freud Loewenstein examines the persistent anti-semitic tendencies in modernist, British intellectual culture. Pursuing her subject with literary, historical, and psychological analyses, Loewenstein argues that this anti-semitism must be understood in terms of its metaphorical link with misogyny. Situated in the context of the history of Jews in Britain, Loathsome Jews and Engulfing Women begins by questioning the widespread belief that the British government was a friend to the Jews in the 30s and 40s. Loewenstein shows that, as evident in the hypocrisy of many British governmental policies prior to and during WWII, Britain actively collaborated in the Jews' destruction. Against the backdrop of this tragic complicity in the Holocaust, Loewenstein evaluates Jewish stereotypes in the works of three representative twentieth-century British thinkers and writers. Her analysis provides a revealing critique of British modernism. In a larger sense, Loathsome Jews and Engulfing Womenexplores the riddle of prejudice. Loewenstein argues that anti-semitism is nurtured in an environment populated by other hatreds --misogyny, homophobia, and racism. To explain the interaction of these prejudices, she develops an investigative model grounded in object relations theory and informed by the works of such theoretically diverse authors as Virginia Woolf, Kate Millett, and Alice Miller. Loewenstein lucidly argues within an autobiographical framework, insisting on the need for critics to . . . look within ourselves for 'that terrible other' rather than to complacently assume that we ourselves exist outside the ideology of power. This well-written and readable book will be of interest to many people, ranging students of British history to psychoanalysts, from historians of Jewish culture to anyone interested in feminist and literary theory.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NI3tCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Fight for Irish Freedom","description":"In 1919 a group of young men barely out of their teens, poorly armed, with no money and little training, renewed the fight, begun in 1916, to drive the British out of Ireland.

With a novelist s gift for character, an unfailing maternal instinct, and her signature humor, Jackson turns everyday family experiences into brilliant adventures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GrsBDAAAQBAJ&dq=Life+Among+the+Savages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","description":"A boy imagines that he is a manatee, sprinkling seaweed on his Raisin Bran-atee and dignifying his watery domain with his wit, sophistication, and urbanity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oo09oR_l-BkC&dq=I%27m+a+Manatee&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","description":"Moving away from the dark tone of her more recent masterpieces, Joyce Carol Oates turns the tale of a family struggling to cope with its fall from grace into a deeply moving and unforgettable account of the vigor of hope and the power of love to prevail over suffering. The Mulvaneys of High Point Farm in Mt. Ephraim, New York, are a large and fortunate clan, blessed with good looks, abundant charisma, and boundless promise. But over the twenty-five year span of this ambitious novel, the Mulvaneys will slide, almost imperceptibly at first, from the pinnacle of happiness, transformed by the vagaries of fate into a scattered collection of lost and lonely souls. It is the youngest son, Judd, now an adult, who attempts to piece together the fragments of the Mulvaneys' former glory, seeking to uncover and understand the secret violation that occasioned the family's tragic downfall. Each of the Mulvaneys endures some form of exile -- physical or spiritual -- but in the end they find a way to bridge the chasms that have opened up among them, reuniting in the spirit of love and healing. Profoundly cathartic, Oates' acclaimed novel unfolds as if, in the darkness of the human spirit, she has come upon a source of light at its core. Rarely has a writer made such a startling and inspiring statement about the value of hope and compassion. \\"What keeps us coming back to Oates Country is her uncanny gift of making the page a window, with something happening on the other side that we'd swear was like life itself\\". -- The New York Times Book Review \\"A major achievement that stands with Oates' finest studies of American life...the novel is a testament to the tenacious bonds of the family, therestorative power of love and capacity to endure and prevail\\". -- The Chicago Tribune","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F84fAAAACAAJ&dq=We+Were+the+Mulvaneys+(A+William+Abrahams+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rhythms of Peace","description":"If you're ready to conquer stress and embrace the peace that your soul longs for, New York Times bestseller Rhythms of Renewal is your new go-to guide to transforming your life, one day at a time.

The only break in the Pan-American highway, which runs from Alaska to the tip of South America, it is an almost impregnable strip of swamp, jungle and cloud forest between the vast landmasses of North and South America. Stories of abduction and murder there are rife and in recent years more people have successfully climbed Everest or trekked to the South Pole than have crossed the Dari n Gap. In 2000, Tom Hart Dyke, a young botanist, set off to Central America with one thing on his mind: orchids. He knew that in order to find the rare and beautiful species he so fervently admired, he would have to visit some of the most inhospitable places on earth. Unbeknown to Tom, another young explorer, Paul Winder, was backpacking through the area at the same time. Though he sometimes worked freelance in the City of London, Paul was a fearless and intrepid traveller, happier scaling volcanoes than lounging on beaches. In every bar and caf  along his route, rumours abounded of the Dari n Gap - and the more he heard, the greater became his desire to make the journey. Pure chance brought Paul and Tom together in northern Mexico; they formed an instant bond and their fate was sealed. Ignoring a final, succinct warning from the Lonely Planet guide - 'Don't even think about it!' - Tom and Paul set off into the Dari n: Tom in search of orchids, Paul in search of adventure. They would find plenty of each. For six days they made good progress. Then, just hours away from Colombia, the dream ended and the horror began. Paul and Tom were ambushed by FARC guerrillas who were to hold them hostage for the next nine months. From that day on, their survival was a matter of extraordinary endurance, incredible ingenuity and not a little good luck ...","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GmRMhUWSQTkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Furniture","description":"An illustrated up-to-date reference work which describes every period and development in furniture styling and construction","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j3XWBk-qMV0C&dq=Furniture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pennsylvania Dutch cook book","description":"An excellent introduction to every aspect of Pennsylvania Dutch cookery from hors d' oeuvres to desserts.

Except that Tony, still bearing the scars of past cases, doesn't want to do this anymore. But the killer is about to strike uncomfortably close to home. The next victim is a friend and colleague. And Tony's former partner, Detective Carol Jordan, is directly in the murderer's path, working undercover in a world where human life means less than the smallest drug deal. She needs Tony's help as much as the beleaguered European police officials do. Now the danger is closing in. Confronting the worst of modern crime and struggling to unravel roots that lie deep in the tormented past of Nazi atrocities and Stasi abuses, Tony and Carol are forced to battle for survival against overwhelming odds. In this morass of double-cross and double-dealing, they have no one to trust but each other.

What interests or fascinates us, who we love, what angers us, what moves us, what bores us--all of this defines us, gives us character, constitutes who we are.In True to Our Feelings , Solomon illuminates the rich life of the emotions--why we don't really understand them, what they really are, and how they make us human and give meaning to life. Emotions have recently become a highly fashionable area of research in the sciences, with brain imaginguncovering valuable clues as to how we experience our feelings. But while Solomon provides a guide to this cutting-edge research, as well as to what others--philosophers and psychologists--have said on the subject, he also emphasizes the personal and ethical character of our emotions. He shows thatemotions are not something that happen to us, nor are they irrational in the literal sense--rather, they are judgements we make about the world, and they are strategies for living in it. Fear, anger, love, guilt, jealousy, compassion--they are all essential to our values, to living happily,healthily, and well. Solomon highlights some of the dramatic ways that emotions fit into our ethics and our sense of the good life, how we can make our emotional lives more coherent with our values and be more 'true to our feelings' and cultivate emotional integrity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yoE8DwAAQBAJ&dq=True+To+Our+Feelings:+What+Our+Emotions+Are+Really+Telling+Us&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"108 Ways to Get a Bright Idea and Increase Your Creative Potential","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ubkeOAAACAAJ&dq=108+Ways+to+Get+a+Bright+Idea+and+Increase+Your+Creative+Potential&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Landscaping and the Small Garden.","description":"A stylishly photographed guide to creating lush, layered, dramatic little gardens no matter the size of your available space--an urban patio, a tiny backyard, or even just a pot by your door.

And only a pataphysician nurtured lovingly on surrealist excess could have come up with The Blue Flowers, Queneau's 1964 novel, now reissued as a New Directions Paperbook. To a pataphysician all things are equal, there is no improvement or progress in the human condition, and a \\"message\\" is an invention of the benighted reader, certainly not the author or his perplexing creationsthe sweet, fennel-drinking Cidrolin and the rampaging Duke d'Auge.

Meanwhile, Cidrolin in the 1960s lolls on his barge moored along the Seine, sips essence of fennel, and ineffectually tries to catch the graffitist who nightly defiles his fence. But mostly he naps. Is it just a coincidence that the duke appears only when Cidrolin is dozing? And vice versa?

Caleb Williams, a self-educated orphan, gets a job at the estate of Ferdinando Falkland, a reclusive aristocrat. Curious as to his master s temperamental nature, Williams asks the estate s administrator to share any information he knows regarding Falkland s past. Through Mr. Collins, Caleb learns of Falkland s feud with Barnabas Tyrrel, his oppressive neighbor. Caleb is surprised to discover that Falkland was once regarded as a generous and gregarious gentleman who persevered in vain for the love of Tyrrel s niece. Following Emily Melville s untimely death and the unsolved murder of Barnabas Tyrrel, Falkland became an embittered man, prone to violent outbursts and averse to social interaction. Shocked by Mr. Collins s account, Caleb begins to investigate Falkland s behavior and soon grows to suspect his master of murder.

She describes living with her irascible, social-climbing grandmother while her mother pieced together a living taking pictures of the children of the wealthy inhabitants of the Main Line, an elite suburban enclave of Philadelphia. Her mother, Alice Benedict, was one of the few women photographers of her day--a student and prot g  of Alfred Stieglitz. Garrett sketches the science and history of photography, populating her narrative with legendary figures like Margaret Bourke-White, a bold contemporary of her mother and with whom Susan sensed her mother s veiled competitiveness; pioneers of photography like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Daguerre, and Fox Talbot; and writers like Susan Sontag, whose work ponders the meaning and ethical responsibility of taking photographs of tragic events. Garrett also writes of unknown photographers and ordinary people who captured her imagination as a sensitive young girl--such as the Japanese man who taught her how to dry a stack of dishes, who later was sent away on a tip from her mother, most likely to an internment camp.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iOhTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Quick-Eyed+Love:+Photography+and+Memory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crescent Rivers: Waterways of Florida's Big Bend","description":"The Big Bend is a crescent-shaped coastline where the peninsula of Florida merges with the underbelly of the southeastern states. From Tampa Bay to the Ochlockonee River, the land meets the sea in an ecologically abundant system of swamps, salt marshes, and wet cabbage-palm forests. For more than a decade, Todd Bertolaet has hiked, paddled, and waded through the region to capture these panoramic images that convey its botanical richness, primordial environs, and changing waterways. As Ansel Adams and others used wide-angle photography to present the magical play of light and shadow in the American West, Bertolaet uses a panoramic camera to document this vastly different landscape. Where the western images delight by their grand scale and sweep, these resonate by capturing the subtle intimacy of the landscape, as well as sensual illumination and shading across water and vegetation. Bertolaet's subjects are dark, blackwater rivers like the Sopchoppy and Econfina, crystal spring-fed streams such as the Wakulla and Wacissa, and the marshes, hammocks, and swamps through which they meander to the sea. The book's 55 duotone images offer those familiar with the area a reminder of the pleasures of a recent canoe trip, day hike, or a birding or fishing expedition. For newcomers, these pictures are wide-open windows onto one of the last pristine areas of the state.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uPjoHAAACAAJ&dq=Crescent+Rivers:+Waterways+of+Florida%27s+Big+Bend&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Secret Projects: Strategic Bombers 1935-1945","description":"This eagerly awaited companion volume to the enormously popular volume on fighters looks at the might-have-been strategic German bombers.

Tanner awoke to a different world, though some bad things have remained the same . . . or gotten worse. Even before he can fully acclimate himself to this perplexing future, Tanner's off to Burma (which isn't really Burma anymore) to pose as a monk, destabilize the government, dodge a lethal double-cross, and rescue a beautiful prisoner. The world's still full of conspiracy, corruption, greed, political chicanery and beautiful women.

Allen Hynek, the astronomer who invented the concept of \\"Close Encounters\\" with alien life, inspired Steven Spielberg s blockbuster classic science fiction epic film and is the subject of History Channel's Project Blue Book, and made an entire nation want to believe in UFOs. In June 1947, private pilot Kenneth Arnold looked out his cockpit window and saw a group of nine silvery crescents weaving between the peaks of the Cascade Mountains at an estimated 1,200 miles an hour. The media, the military, and the scientific community led by J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer hired by the Air Force debunked this and many other Unidentified Flying Object sightings reported across the country. But after years of denials, Hynek made a shocking pronouncement: UFOs are real. Thirty years after his death, Hynek s agonizing transformation from skepticism to true believer remains one of the great misunderstood stories of science. In this definitive biography, Mark O'Connell reveals for the first time how Hynek s work both as a celebrated astronomer and as the U. S. Air Force s go-to UFO expert for nearly twenty years stretched the boundaries of modern science, laid the groundwork for acceptance of the possibility of UFOs, and was the basis of the hit film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. With unprecedented access to Hynek s personal and professional files, O Connell smashes conventional wisdom to reveal the intriguing man and scientist beneath the legend. Tracing Hynek s career, O'Connell examines Hynek s often-ignored work as a professional astronomer to create a complete portrait of a groundbreaking enthusiast who became an American cult icon and transformed the way we see our world and our universe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QjLWDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11","description":"Soon to be a major motion picture: the true story of the man put in charge of the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund, and a testament to the enduring power of family, grief, love, fear, frustration, and courage. Just days after September 11, 2001, Kenneth Feinberg was appointed to administer the federal 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund, a unique, unprecedented fund established by Congress to compensate families who lost a loved one on 9/11 and survivors who were physically injured in the attacks. Those who participated in the Fund were required to waive their right to sue the airlines involved in the attacks, as well as other potentially responsible entities. When the program was launched, many families criticized it as a brazen, tight-fisted attempt to protect the airlines from lawsuits. The Fund was also attacked as attempting to put insulting dollar values on the lives of lost loved ones. The families were in pain. And they were angry. Over the course of the next three years, Feinberg spent almost all of his time meeting with the families, convincing them of the generosity and compassion of the program, and calculating appropriate awards for each and every claim. The Fund proved to be a dramatic success with over 97% of eligible families participating. It also provided important lessons for Feinberg, who became the filter, the arbitrator, and the target of family suffering. Feinberg learned about the enduring power of family grief, love, fear, faith, frustration, and courage. Most importantly, he learned that no check, no matter how large, could make the families and victims of 9/11 whole again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ksne1WYtVqUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fast Fourier Transform and Its Applications","description":"The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a mathematical method widely used in signal processing.

But human beings have found no signs of other life anywhere approaching human intelligence. This changes when scientists discover a sunless planet they name Danann, travelling the void just beyond the edge of the Galaxy at such a high speed that it cannot be natural. Its continents and oceans have been sculpted and shaped, with but a single megaplex upon it--close to perfectly preserved--with tens of thousands of near-identical metallic-silver-blue towers set along curved canals. Yet Danann has been abandoned for so long that even the atmosphere has frozen solid. Within a few years Danann will approach an area of singularities that will make exploration and investigation impossible. Orbital shuttle pilot Jiendra Chang, artist Chendor Barna, and history professor Liam Fitzhugh are recruited by the Comity government and its Deep Space Service, along with scores of other experts as part of an unprecedented and unique expedition to unravel Danann's secrets. And there are forces that will stop at nothing to prevent them, even if it means interstellar war. Other Series by L.E.

Young, a linguistics and New Testament scholar, attempts to answer the question being asked with greater and greater frequency: \\"Are Christians morally obligated to be vegetarians?\\" Many people are confused about the apparent mixed messages within the Bible. On the one hand, God prescribes a vegetarian diet in the Garden of Eden and the apocalyptic visions of Isaiah and John imply the restoration of a vegetarian diet. However, it is also clear that God permits, Jesus partakes in, and Paul sanctions the eating of flesh. Does the Bible give any clear guidance? Close readings of key biblical texts pertaining to dietary customs, vegetarianism, and animal rights make up the substance of the book. Rather than ignoring or offering a literal, twentieth-century interpretation of the passages, the author analyzes the voices of these conflicting dietary motifs within their own social contexts. Interwoven throughout these readings are discussions of contemporary issues, such as animal testing and experimentation, the fur industry, raising animals in factories, and the effects of meat-eating on human health. Thirteen chapters cover such topics as -- the vegetarian diet in the Garden of Eden -- the clothing of the first humans in animal skins -- God's permitting humans to eat meat -- animal sacrifice -- the dietary habits of Jesus and the early apostles -- Paul's condemnation of vegetarianism as heresy -- the dietary views of the early church fathers -- the peaceable kingdom. The author provides two vegetarian recipes at the end of each chapter. An epilogue includes guidelines for becoming a vegetarian and a recommended reading list. Insightful and challenging, Is God a Vegetarian? poses provocative questions for vegetarians, Christians, and anyone reflecting upon her personal choices and ethical role in our world today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t18QBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"RUSALKA.","description":"This book serves as an aid to anyone seeking to perform and gain a deeper understanding of this multi-layered opera, which so trenchantly asks what it means to be human, to love, and to be loved in return.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=54KBl5Yb4uoC&dq=RUSALKA.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Toil of the Brave","description":"Angela Ferrier is passionately in love with a British spy and a colonial staff officer during the American Revolution","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Au5oPwAACAAJ&dq=Toil+of+the+Brave&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Canyon Ranch Cooking : Bringing the Spa Home","description":"The two Canyon Ranch spas are rated No.1 and No.2 (they alternate positions) over and over by readers of the Conde Nast Traveler.

The recipes all have detailed nutritional breakdowns to help you plan a healthy meal with a lot of variety. Perhaps best of all are the tips and techniques to help enhance flavor without adding calories. Why does spa food taste so good when nearly all the fat has been removed? Jones reveals all the secrets -- such as adding citrus or vinegar to lift \\"flat\\" flavors; grilling over aromatic wood; marinating meat and vegetables; cooking at low temperatures for long periods to \\"marry\\" flavors; roasting rapidly for crispy crusts and tender interiors; using dried fruit for rich and creamy fat-free sauces; and much, much more.

In this pathbreaking study, Carol J. Oja explores this artistic renaissance from the perspective of composers of classical and modern music, who along with writers, painters, and jazz musicians, were at the heart of early modernism in America. She also illustrates how the aesthetic attitudes and institutional structures from the 1920s left a deep imprint on the arts over the 20th century. Aaron Copland, George Gershwin, Ruth Crawford Seeger, Virgil Thomson, William Grant Still, Edgar Var?se, Henry Cowell, Leo Ornstein, Marion Bauer, George Antheil-these were the leaders of a talented new generation of American composers whose efforts made New York City the center of new music in the country. They founded composer societies--such as the International Composers' Guild, the League of Composers, the Pan American Association, and the Copland-Sessions Concerts--to promote the performance of their music, and they nimbly negotiated cultural boundaries, aiming for recognition in Western Europe as much as at home. They showed exceptional skill at marketing their work. Drawing on extensive archival material--including interviews, correspondence, popular periodicals, and little-known music manuscripts--Oja provides a new perspective on the period and a compelling collective portrait of the figures, puncturing many longstanding myths. American composers active in New York during the 1920s are explored in relation to the \\"Machine Age\\" and American Dada; the impact of spirituality on American dissonance; the crucial, behind-the-scenes role of women as patrons and promoters of modernist music; cross-currents between jazz and concert music; the critical reception of modernist music (especially in the writings of Carl Van Vechten and Paul Rosenfeld); and the international impulse behind neoclassicism.

A Dutch painting of a young girl survives three and a half centuries of loss, flood, anonymity, theft, secrecy, and even the Holocaust. This is the story of its owners whose lives are influenced by its beauty and mystery. Despite their many troubles and unsatisfied longings, the girl in hyacinth blue has the power to inspire love in all its human variety.

The professor swears it is a Vermeer but why has he hidden this important work for so long? The reasons unfold in a series of events that trace the ownership of the painting back to World War II and Amsterdam, and still further back to the moment of the work s inspiration. As the painting moves through each owner s hands, what was long hidden quietly surfaces, illuminating poignant moments in multiple lives.

Is Earth condemned to the same fate, or can we protect ourselves and our planet from extinction? In his most riveting and revealing book yet, Graham Hancock examines the evidence that the barren Red Planet was once home to a lush environment of flowing rivers, lakes, and oceans. Could Mars have sustained life and civilization? Megaliths found on the parched shores of Cydonia, a former Martian ocean, mirror the geometrical conventions of the pyramids at Egypt's Giza necropolis. Especially startling is a Sphinx-like structure depicting a face with distinguishable diadem, teeth, mouth and an Egyptian-style headdress. Might there be a connection between the structures of Egypt and those of Mars? Why does NASA continue to dismiss these remarkable anomalies as \\"a trick of light\\"? Hancock points to the intriguing possibility that ancient Martian civilization is communicating with us through the remarkable structures it left behind. In exploring the possible traces left by the Martian civilization and the cosmic cataclysm that may have ended it, The Mars Mystery is both an illumination of our ancient past and a warning--that we still have time to heed--about our ultimate fate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jTcg9F_joxAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murder By The Book (Nero Wolfe)","description":" It is always a treat to read a Nero Wolfe mystery.

No son or daughter is doomed to acknowledge an ancestry from him.  Nearly a century and a half later, in 2004, writer Christopher Buckley observed  It is probably just as well that James Buchanan was our only bachelor president. There are no descendants bracing every morning on opening the paper to find another heading announcing:  Buchanan Once Again Rated Worst President in History.   How to explain such remarkably consistent historical views of the man who turned over a divided and demoralized country to Abraham Lincoln, the same man regarded through the decades by presidential scholars as the worst president in U.S. history? In this exploration of the presidency of James Buchanan, 1857-61, Garry Boulard revisits the 15th President and comes away with a stunning conclusion: Buchanan s performance as the nation s chief executive was even more deplorable and sordid than scholars generally know, making his status as the country s worst president richly deserved. Boulard documents Buchanan s failure to stand up to the slaveholding interests of the South, his indecisiveness in dealing with the secession movement, and his inability to provide leadership during the nation s gravest constitutional crisis. Using the letters of Buchanan, as well as those of more than two dozen political leaders and thinkers of the time, Boulard presents a narrative of a timid and vacillating president whose drift and isolation opened the door to the Civil War. The author of The Expatriation of Franklin Pierce: The Story of a President and the Civil War (iUniverse, 2006), Boulard has reported for the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times and is a business writer for the Albuquerque-based Construction Reporter.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PagYCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yugoslavia and Its Historians: Understanding the Balkan Wars of the 1990s","description":"Most of what has been written about the recent history of Yugoslavia and the fierce wars that have plagued that country has been produced by journalists, political analysts, diplomats, human rights organization, the United Nations, and other government and intergovernmental organizations. Professional historians of Yugoslavia, however, have been strangely silent about the wars and the breakup of the country. This book is an effort to end that silence. The goal of this volume is to bring together insights from a distinguished group of American and European scholars of Yugoslavia to add depth to our historical understanding of that country s recent struggles. The first part of the volume examines the ways in which images of the Yugoslav past have shaped current understandings of the region. The second part deals more directly with the events of the recent past and also looks forward to some of the problems and future prospects for Yugoslavia s successor states.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u5tUbUyXtToC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jewish magic and superstition;: A study in folk religion","description":"Alongside the formal development of Judaism from the eleventh through the sixteenth centuries, a robust Jewish folk religion flourished ideas and practices that never met with wholehearted approval by religious leaders yet enjoyed such wide popularity that they could not be altogether excluded from the religion. According to Joshua Trachtenberg, it is not possible truly to understand the experience and history of the Jewish people without attempting to recover their folklife and beliefs from centuries past. Jewish Magic and Superstition is a masterful and utterly fascinating exploration of religious forms that have all but disappeared yet persist in the imagination. The volume begins with legends of Jewish sorcery and proceeds to discuss beliefs about the evil eye, spirits of the dead, powers of good, the famous legend of the golem, procedures for casting spells, the use of gems and amulets, how to battle spirits, the ritual of circumcision, herbal folk remedies, fortune telling, astrology, and the interpretation of dreams. First published more than sixty years ago, Trachtenberg's study remains the foundational scholarship on magical practices in the Jewish world and offers an understanding of folk beliefs that expressed most eloquently the everyday religion of the Jewish people.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Sy3po8cI0FYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Narratology: An Introduction","description":"This text provides an excellent introduction and overview of Narratology, a rapidly growing field in the humanities.

Instead she planted the seeds and covered them, waiting to see what would happen, and discovered surprising success. As the years progressed, Stout refined her techniques, eventually adopting a year-round mulch which virtually eliminated the labor associated with traditional gardening. Her minimalist approach launched a long-running career as a gardening expert and a large following.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d7cmtAEACAAJ&dq=Gardening+without+work:+For+the+aging,+the+busy+and+the+indolent&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lossing's Pictorial Field Book of the War of 1812","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-dMmAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gunslingers in Action - Aircraft No. Fourteen","description":"The first thing to know about the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress is that it is a remarkableairplane for many reasons, not the least of which is its longevity.

Shaw takes us into the inner world of American black professional women during the Jim Crow era. This is a story of struggle and empowerment, of the strength of a group of women who worked against daunting odds to improve the world for themselves and their people. Shaw's remarkable research into the lives of social workers, librarians, nurses, and teachers from the 1870s through the 1950s allows us to hear these women's voices for the first time. The women tell us, in their own words, about their families, their values, their expectations. We learn of the forces and factors that made them exceptional, and of the choices and commitments that made them leaders in their communities. What a Woman Ought to Be and to Do brings to life a world in which African-American families, communities, and schools worked to encourage the self-confidence, individual initiative, and social responsibility of girls. Shaw shows us how, in a society that denied black women full professional status, these girls embraced and in turn defined an ideal of \\"socially responsible individualism\\" that balanced private and public sphere responsibilities. A collective portrait of character shaped in the toughest circumstances, this book is more than a study of the socialization of these women as children and the organization of their work as adults. It is also a study of leadership of how African American communities gave their daughters the power to succeed in and change a hostile world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aLJkpO_CiUgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medical Spanish Dictionary Pocket: English-spanish, Spanish English (single Copy)","description":"A Spanish-English dictionary for students.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zsV1CrYpM-IC&dq=Medical+Spanish+Dictionary+Pocket:+English-spanish,+Spanish+English+(single+Copy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Hebrew Scripture","description":"Jewish scholars and many other people are aware that the Torah (the Five Books of Moses) is only the first portion of the Hebrew Scriptures.

These three portions contain God's commandments, a constitution for His people, prophesies for the future, and perspectives on history and life.

In 1911 she won an unprecedented second Nobel Prize, this time in chemistry, for isolating new radioactive elements. Despite these achievements, or perhaps because of her fame, she has remained a saintly, unapproachable genius. From family documents and a private journal only recently made available, Susan Quinn at last tells the full human story. From the stubborn sixteen-year-old studying science at night while working as a governess, to her romance and scientific partnership with Pierre Curie-an extraordinary marriage of equals-we feel her defeats as well as her successes: her rejection by the French Academy, her unbearable grief at Pierre's untimely and gruesome death, and her retreat into a love affair with a married fellow scientist, causing a scandal which almost cost her the second Nobel Prize.

As he put the phone down and stared into the darkness of his hotel room, he feared he'd been handed a political death sentence. The year was 1993, and he would be responsible for an economy that had had seven different currencies in the previous eight years to cope with inflation that had run at 3000 percent a year. Brazil had a habit of chewing up finance ministers with the ferocity of an Amazon piranha. This was just one of the turns in a largely unscripted and sometimes unwanted political career. In exile during the harshest period of the junta that ruled Brazil for twenty years, Cardoso started his political life with a tentative run for the Federal Senate in 1978. Within fifteen years, and despite himself, this former sociologist was running the country. And what a country! Brazil, it is often said, is on the edge of modernity, striding with one foot in mid-air towards the future, the other still rooted deep in a traditional past. It is a land of sophisticated music and brutal gold-digging, of the next global superpower and the last old-time coffee plantations. It is gloriously ungovernable, irrepressibly attractive, and home to the family, friends and extraordinary life of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. This is his story and his love song to his country.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GQBljNymk-YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rancher and the Redhead (Back to the Ranch) (Harlequin Romance, No 3280)","description":"The Rancher And The Redhead by Rebecca Winters released on Jul 23, 1993 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4XjLX_UyngAC&dq=The+Rancher+and+the+Redhead+(Back+to+the+Ranch)+(Harlequin+Romance,+No+3280)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Redeem One Person Is to Redeem the World: The Life of Frieda Fromm-Reichmann","description":"A fascinating and dramatic account of a controversial figure in twentieth-century psychiatry.

This art reflects the messages that scientists hope to send to a general audience as a part of their effort to influence how public funds are spent in support of science. The art is the medium AND the message. The public fascination over dinosaurs has been fueled by images that eloquently illustrate current scientific theories about dinosaur behavior, physiology, locomotion, and reproduction. The evidence for many of these theories is very good. The art of dinosaur depiction is firmly rooted in the processes of scientific inquiry. Because the paintings and sculptures that illustrate dinosaur science are so powerful, collectors vie for this art paying top dollar to acquire it and display it. One of the largest personal collections is held by John Lanzendorf--over 100 superlative paintings and drawings, 40 significant sculptures (bronze), many other small pieces, drawings, figurines, action figures, and more. Artists represented in this unparalleled collection are the best illustrators, painters, sculptors and movie-magicians.

Which is to say, he makes a very good living flying around the world dispensing premonitory wisdom, a.k.a. pre-packaged B.S., to world governments, corporations, and global leadership conferences. He is an optimist by trade and a cynic by choice. He s the kind of man who can give a lecture on successive days to a leading pesticide manufacturer and the Organic Farmers of America, and receive standing ovations at both. But just as the American Empire is beginning to fray around the edges, so too is Yates  carefully scripted existence. On the way to the Futureworld Conference in Johannesburg he opens a handwritten note from his girlfriend, informing him she s left him for a fifth-grade history teacher. Then he witnesses a soccer riot in which five South Africans are killed, to the chagrin of the South African P.R. people at Futureworld. Fueled by a heroic devastation of his minibar and inspired by the rookie hooker sent to his hotel room by his hosts, Yates composes a spectacularly career-ending speech at Futureworld, the delivery of which leads to a sound beating, a meeting with some quasi-governmental creeps, and a hazy mission to go around the world answering the question Why does everyone hate us? Thus begins an absolutely original novel that is driven by equal parts corrosively funny satire, genuine physical fear, and heartfelt moral anguish. From the hideously ugly Greenlander nymphomaniacal artist to the gay male-model spy to the British corporate magnate with a taste for South Pacific virgin sacrifice rituals, The Futurist manages to be wildly entertaining and deadly serious at the same time. Wry, picaresque, and a wicked barb aimed at all that is fatuous, The Futurist is the story of a pundit who finds his audience when he proclaims he knows nothing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UBKr1Ha_GXYC&dq=The+Futurist:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding Dispensationalists","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qT8RAQAAIAAJ&dq=Understanding+Dispensationalists&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Redheaded Outfield & Other Baseball Stories","description":"\\"The Redheaded Outfield, and Other Baseball Stories\\" by Zane Grey.

Since the days of Emperor Rudolf II, 'devotee of the stars and cultivator of the spagyric art', who in the late 1500s summoned alchemists and magicians from all over the world to his castle on Hradcany hill, it has been a place of mystery and intrigue. Wars, revolutions, floods, the imposition of Soviet communism, or even the depredations of the tourist boom after the 'Velvet Revolution' of 1989, could not destroy the unique atmosphere of this beautiful, proud and melancholy city on the Vltava. John Banville traces Prague's often tragic history and portrays the people who made it, the emperors and princes, geniuses and charlatans, heroes and scoundrels, and paints a portrait of the Prague of today, revelling in its newfound freedoms, eager to join the European Community and at the same time suspicious of what many Praguers see as yet another totalitarian takeover. He writes of his first visit to the city, in the depths of the Cold War, when he engaged in a spot of art smuggling, and of subsequent trips there, of the people he met, the friends he made, the places he came to know.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TVsOgujHl7cC&dq=Prague+Pictures+(The+Writer+and+the+City)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nine Plays","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The great stone of Sardis,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bek3AQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Thanksgiving: The Eucharistic Norm of Christian Worship","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xFNrMwEACAAJ&dq=The+Great+Thanksgiving:+The+Eucharistic+Norm+of+Christian+Worship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hamster in a Handbasket (Animal Ark Series #16)","description":"James is excited when he is given the job of caring for the school hamster over summer vacation, but when it is stolen, he must find the culprit and save the poor animal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6F-6Ucs7z_sC&dq=Hamster+in+a+Handbasket+(Animal+Ark+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beethoven, (Master musicians)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lpFNAQAACAAJ&dq=Beethoven,+(Master+musicians)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Blonde Countess : An Exciting Novel of International Intrigue","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Txf0dJmgGccC&dq=The+Blonde+Countess+:+An+Exciting+Novel+of+International+Intrigue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Place Called Paradise","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tQGhtQEACAAJ&dq=A+Place+Called+Paradise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peter Freuchen's Book of the Seven Seas","description":"Here is a wonderful book filled with story, lore and legend, with history and fact, with myths and strange tales, and with magnificent illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eRAMAQAAIAAJ&dq=Peter+Freuchen%27s+Book+of+the+Seven+Seas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letters from the Dead","description":"'Gothic, claustrophobic, and wonderfully dark' GUARDIAN on Sam Hurcom's Thomas Bexley novels...

In a provocative new assessment of its success, David Chappell argues that the story of civil rights is not a story of the ultimate triumph of liberal ideas after decades of gradual progress. Rather, it is a story of the power of religious tradition. Chappell reconsiders the intellectual roots of civil rights reform, showing how northern liberals' faith in the power of human reason to overcome prejudice was at odds with the movement's goal of immediate change. Even when liberals sincerely wanted change, they recognized that they could not necessarily inspire others to unite and fight for it. But the prophetic tradition of the Old Testament--sometimes translated into secular language--drove African American activists to unprecedented solidarity and self-sacrifice. Martin Luther King Jr., Fannie Lou Hamer, James Lawson, Modjeska Simkins, and other black leaders believed, as the Hebrew prophets believed, that they had to stand apart from society and instigate dramatic changes to force an unwilling world to abandon its sinful ways. Their impassioned campaign to stamp out \\"the sin of segregation\\" brought the vitality of a religious revival to their cause. Meanwhile, segregationists found little support within their white southern religious denominations. Although segregationists outvoted and outgunned black integrationists, the segregationists lost, Chappell concludes, largely because they did not have a religious commitment to their cause.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8jomttdSV5YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The book of religions: Comprising the views, creeds, sentiments, or opinions, of all the principal religious sects in the world, particularly of all ... together with biographical sketches","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BUhIAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quack!: Tales of Medical Fraud from the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices","description":"In Quack! Tales of Medical Fraud from the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices, curator Bob McCoy shares his collection of the hilarious, horrifying, and preposterous medical devices that have been foisted upon the public in their quest for good health. From the Prostate Gland Warmer to the Recto Rotor, from the Nose Straightener to the Wonder Electric Generator, these implements reveal the desperate measures taken by the public in their search for magic cures. With period advertisements, promotional literature, and gadget instructions, this book offers a wealth of past and present medical fraud. For instance, you'll learn about: Albert Abrams, the \\"King of Quackery,\\" who believed that all that was needed from a patient for diagnosis was a drop of blood, a single hair, or even a handwriting sample as these would give off the unique \\"vibrations\\" of that individual. His theories were so popular that none other than Upton Sinclair promoted them in an article for Pearson's magazine. Wilhelm Reich, the groundbreaking psychiatrist who, in the latter portion of his storied career, discovered \\"Orgone\\" the energy supposedly released during sexual orgasm. According to Reich, absorbing large quantities of Orgone through his Orgone Energy Accumulator would make a person healthier. Dr. Albert C. Geyser, whose Tricho machine for removing unwanted hair through x-ray depilitation resulted in thousands of women contracting hardened and wrinkled skin, receded gums, never-healing ulcerated sores, tumors, and, of course, cancer. And if you think quackery is a thing of a past, a sampling of late night television commercials advertising everything from fat burners to magnetic and/or copper pain relievers will cure you of that notion. In fact, in the mid-1990s, a product called \\"The Stimulator\\" was advertised on television as a \\"cure\\" for pain, menstrual problems, arthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome. The commercial featuring Evel Knievel as its spokesperson was so effective that over 800,000 Stimulators were sold for $88.30 before the FDA shut the company down. Still, the owners made quite a hefty profit on what was simply a one dollar gas grill igniter!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iIwMAAAACAAJ&dq=Quack!:+Tales+of+Medical+Fraud+from+the+Museum+of+Questionable+Medical+Devices&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bird Guide: The Most Complete Field Guide to the Birds of Britain and Europe","description":"This definitive and bestselling field guide is the perfect companion for nature enthusiasts and birdwatchers.

The criminals of the Depression robbed almost at will (the Indiana State Police had only 41 members, including clerks and typists). Dillinger's daring escapes-single-handed at Crown Point jail or through the withering machine gun fire of FBI agents at Little Bohemia Lodge-and his countless bank robberies excited the imagination of a despondent country. He eluded the lawmen of a half-dozen states and the growing power of the FBI, earning him the dubious honor of Public Enemy Number One and captivating Americans to the present day. His brief but significant career is vividly chronicled here in extraordinary detail, as is the entire outlaw era of Baby Face Nelson, Bonnie and Clyde, Ma Barker, and Machine Gun Kelly. The author conducted hundreds of interviews; his research took him through thirty-four states, into the cells where Dillinger was confined, and into every bank he robbed. The Dillinger Days is the inside account of a desperate and determined war between the law and the lawless, a struggle that did not end until a unique set of circumstances led to Dillinger's bloody death outside a Chicago movie house.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fZ21tAEACAAJ&dq=The+Dillinger+Days.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Malay magic;: Being an introduction to the folklore and popular religion of the Malay Peninsula","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ETdJAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aurora Leigh","description":"Being an undated and detailed autograph manuscript of corrections and revisions to \\"Aurora Leigh\\", many of which are for punctuation and some of which appear in the first edition and many of which, particularly word revisions, do not.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gtUIAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Beginning ...","description":" Karen Armstrong is a genius.

As an adult, s/he lives a double life as Marion/Mario, passing undetected as a lesbian in the literary salons of the times, and as a gay man in the cocaine dens made famous by Colette. Delarue-Mardrus's novel belongs to a category of literature, written between the turn of the century and approximately 1930, which depicted lesbians as members of a third sex. The hermaphrodite became the visual representation of the ways in which lesbians were different from their heterosexual sisters, and Rene Vivien, Natalie Clifford Barney, Rachilde, and Colette, among others, shared Delarue-Mardrus's fascination with the topic. This is the first translation into English of The Angel and the Perverts. In an astute introduction, Anna Livia rereads Lucie Delarue-Mardrus as a prolific and significant writer, despite the fact that previous scholars viewed her primarily as the wife of the scholar and translator Joseph-Charles Mardrus. Livia also places Delarue-Mardrus's life in a lesbian context for the first time and decodes this delightful novel so that readers will feel quite at home in Mario/Marion's unusual world, which runs the gamut from Auguste Rodin to Jean Cocteau and Sarah Bernhardt.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gHYLWEScg-oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","description":"A tale of the impact of circumstance and fate on identity follows the interconnected lives of a little boy who is attacked by his mother's dog, a pregnant teenager who admits herself to a maternity home, a young man who considers a drug-dealing career, and a child who disappears from his grandmother's backyard.

B. I.","description":"This  penetrating and remarkable history of the FBI  examines its operations and development from the Reconstruction era to the 9/11 attacks (M. J. Heale, author of McCarthy's Americans). In The FBI, U.S. intelligence expert Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones presents the first comprehensive portrait of the vast, powerful, and sometimes bitterly criticized American institution. Setting the bureau s story in the context of American history, he challenges conventional narratives including the common misconception that traces the origin of the bureau to 1908. Instead, Jeffreys-Jones locates the FBI s true beginnings in the 1870s, when Congress acted in response to the Ku Klux Klan campaign of terror against black American voters. The FBI derives its character and significance from its original mission of combating domestic terrorism. The author traces the evolution of that mission into the twenty-first century, making a number of surprising observations along the way: that the role of J. Edgar Hoover has been exaggerated and the importance of attorneys general underestimated; that splitting counterintelligence between the FBI and the CIA in 1947 was a mistake; and that xenophobia impaired the bureau s preemptive anti-terrorist powers before and after 9/11.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2d_AAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Water of Death","description":"Kenzaburo Oe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for creating \\"an imagined world, where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament today.\\" In Death by Water, his recurring protagonist and literary alter-ego returns to his hometown village in search of a red suitcase fabled to hold documents revealing the details of his father s death during WWII: details that will serve as the foundation for his new, and final, novel. Since his youth, renowned novelist Kogito Choko planned to fictionalize his father s fatal drowning in order to fully process the loss. Stricken with guilt and regret over his failure to rescue his father, Choko has long been driven to discover why his father was boating on the river in a torrential storm. Though he remembers overhearing his father and a group of soldiers discussing an insurgent scheme to stage a suicide attack on Emperor Mikado, Choko cannot separate his memories from imagination and his family is hesitant to reveal the entire story. When the contents of the trunk turn out to offer little clarity, Choko abandons the novel in creative despair. Floundering as an artist, he s haunted by fear that he may never write his tour de force. But when he collaborates with an avant-garde theater troupe dramatizing his early novels, Kogito is revitalized by revisiting his formative work and he finds the will to continue investigating his father s demise. Diving into the turbulent depths of legacy and mortality, Death by Water is an exquisite examination of resurfacing national and personal trauma, and the ways that storytelling can mend political, social, and familial rifts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nkpkCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Night Prayer from the Liturgy of the Hours","description":"This handy-sized edition, taken from the Liturgy of the Hours, provides the last prayer of one's day.

The oldest sanctuary in the world was created in 40,000 BCE by african migrants in Har Karkom, later called Mt. Sinai, foundation place of judaism, christianity, and islam.Lucia documents the continuing memory of the dark mother and her values in prehistoric images of the dark mother, in historic black madonnas and in other dark women divinities whose sanctuaries are on african paths. She tracks the memory in rituals and stories of her sicilian grandmothers, in persecution of dark others in patriarchal Europe and the United States, in the rise of nonviolent dark others since the 1960s,in the banners of the 1995 world conference of women at Beijing, and in art. She finds the dark mother's values-justice with compassion, equality, and transformation-in everyday and celebratory rituals of the world's subaltern cultures-and suggests that the image and values are in the submerged memories of everyone.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ku8VZKrESuUC&dq=Dark+Mother:+African+Origins+and+Godmothers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Canal Bridge","description":"In 1913, before there is a rumor of war in Europe, Matthias Wrenn and Con Hatchel, lifelong friends from Ballyrannel in the Irish midlands, decide to see the world at the expense of the king of England and join the British army. A year later, while en route to India, their troop ship is recalled and they soon find themselves in the European slaughterhouse that was World War I. As stretcher bearers, the two men witness all too closely the horrors of the battlefield and the trenches, the savagery, and the unconscionable waste of human life on fields made liquid by  the blood and guts of boy soldiers  at the Somme, Ypres, and Passchendaele. Meanwhile, back home in Ireland, Con s sister and Matthias s lover, Kitty Hatchel, yearns for their safe return and reminds them of their carefree childhood on the banks of the local canal, as well as their hopes for the future. Brilliantly and movingly narrated by a chorus of voices from the community   Matt, Con, Kitty, and others   The Canal Bridge tells the story of how the young men take Ballyrannel to war with them, and how the war comes back home when hostilities end in Europe. The Ireland the friends left in 1913 no longer exists, for the political landscape has been transformed by the Rising against the British in 1916.

It is exceptional in the quality of its illustrations, and contains many original and unusual conceptions and designs.\\"--E. J. Tangerman. In answer to complaints from students that there was no concise, simple text on wood carving, Charles Marshall Sayers, a nationally famous teacher and craftsman, wrote this book. It is still the finest book for the beginning student in wood sculpture. In clear, straightforward language, Sayers carefully guides the reader through the fundamentals--what tools and materials to use, how to use them. There are lessons and designs for incised carving, relief carving, and other cutting methods. Sayers discusses woods suitable for carving, stains and finishes, preliminary and advanced methods of preparing woods for finishing, even how to make a workbench. The 34 illustrated designs for over 34 projects encourage the student to build slowly and methodically a sound, practical technique while creating objects of beauty and utility. All of the projects employ only four tools (one straight parting tool, three different sizes of straight gouges). With this book you can make panels for cabinets, chests, and doors; borders; table aprons; chair and bench rails; circular mirror frame; wall bracket with shelf; bookends; rectangular mirror frame; footstools; guest-book covers; mirror frame with half-circle top; holy water font; and doors. Though \\"The Book of Wood Carving \\"is meant for the beginner, experienced carvers will find that Sayers' original conceptions and designs will increase their own pleasure and skill. \\"Stimulating both by spicy text and large photographs showing every point in processes described . . .

The land of Terre d Ange is a place of unsurpassing beauty and grace. It is said that the angels found the land and saw it was good... and the ensuing race that rose from the seed of angels and men live by one simple rule: Love as thou wilt. Ph dre n  Delaunay is a young woman who was born with a scarlet mote in her left eye and sold into indentured servitude as a child. Her bond is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, a nobleman with a very special mission... and the first one to recognize who and what she is: one pricked by Kushiel s Dart, chosen to forever experience pain and pleasure as one. Ph dre is trained equally in the courtly arts and the talents of the bedchamber, but, above all, in the ability to observe, remember, and analyze. Almost as talented a spy as she is a courtesan, Ph dre stumbles upon a plot that threatens the very foundation of her homeland. Treachery sets her on her path; love and honor goad her further and will take her to the edge of despair... and beyond. Hateful friend, loving enemy, beloved assassin; they can all wear the same glittering mask in this world, and Ph dre will get but one chance to save all that she holds dear. Set in a world of cunning poets, deadly courtiers, heroic traitors, and a truly Machiavellian villainess, this is a novel of grandeur, luxuriance, sacrifice, betrayal, and deeply laid conspiracies. Not since Dune has there been an epic on the scale of Kushiel's Dart a massive tale about the violent death of an old age and the birth of a new.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g0jPyQEACAAJ&dq=Kushiel%27s+Dart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The damndest finest ruins","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NuojAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Street Hockey Millionaire: Common Sense Strategies to Win the Money Game","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oOMaPQAACAAJ&dq=Street+Hockey+Millionaire:+Common+Sense+Strategies+to+Win+the+Money+Game&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transpersonal Perspectives on Spirituality in Social Work (Social Thought)","description":"Use these ideas in your social work practice to help the whole person--including your client's spiritual side!

Then Egypt began to crumble into the desert sands and the waters of the Nile, and her remarkable achievements in civilization became her lingering epitaph. John A. Wilson has written a rich and interpretive biography of one of the greatest cultural periods in human experience. He answers as best the modern Egyptologist can the questions inevitably asked concerning the dissolution of Egypt's glory.

Beginning with a review of the history of sailboat rigs, Henderson moves quickly to modern fore-and-aft rigs, taking time for a sampling of the more exotic rig configurations that may be seen sailing today, such as the luna, modern Chinese lug rigs, cat ketches, and wing sails. There is a thorough look at masts and other spars, with a very complete discussion of wood, aluminum, carbon-fiber, and other materials as they are used in spar construction. You will find out how best to utilize your rig in a manner compatible with your sailing interests. There are chapters on standing and running rigging, with a detailed look at their components; discussions of rigging constructions such as wire and rod, and the most effective terminal fittings for each; and information on turnbuckles, chainplates, tangs, and backstay adjustors. Henderson gives you a comparison of halyards (should yours be all rope, or wire and rope?); a look at winches, cleats, blocks, and levers; and a most helpful section on deck layout. You will also read about sail trim and basic aerodynamics, and learn how to set up and tune your rig to optimize rake, shroud tension, lateral bend, mast flexing, and stay tension. The final chapter looks at improvements, modifications, and offshore rig considerations, including such elements as changing mast length and converting a sloop to a yawl or cutter, or vice versa. Throughout the book, Jud Henderson draws on his experience to focus on safety issues. For the newcomer and the experienced sailor alike, there is no excuse for putting a poorly selected rig in any boat that may venture offshore. Understanding Rigs and Rigging will provide you with the information you need to rig your boat properly. \\"This is an exceptionally detailed look at everything above the deck on a sailboat. Henderson is an experienced author and sailor, and he has organized a tremendous amount of information in one volume.\\"--Yachting\\"Details specific enough to guide sailboat owners in assessments of their own rigs are the strength of this survey.

Why do some teams achieve remarkable success while others fail or are consigned to mediocrity? To find the answers, Carl E. Larson and Frank M. J. LaFasto conducted a three-year study of teams and team achievement. Interviewing a wide range of teams, including the space shuttle Challenger investigation team, executive management teams and a championship football team, Larson and LaFasto discovered a surprising consistency in the characteristics of effective teams. In Teamwork, they explore the eight properties of successful teams: a clear, elevating goal; a results-driven structure; competent team members; unified commitment; collaborative climate; standards of excellence; external support and recognition; and principled leadership. A final chapter examines the priority of the steps that lead to the building of a high performance team. The authors strive to make the concepts concrete, coupling solid theory with straightforward, practical advice on how to apply it and with lively, fascinating anecdotes.

Introduction to Strategic Public Relations: Digital, Global, and Socially Responsible Communication prepares you for success in today s fast-changing PR environment. Recognizing that developments in technology, business, and culture require a fresh approach, Janis T. Page and Lawrence Parnell have written a practical introductory text that aligns these shifts with the body of knowledge from which the discipline of public relations was built. Because the practice of public relations is rooted in credibility, the authors believe that you must become ethical and socially responsible communicators more concerned with building trust and respect with diverse communities than with creating throwaway content. The authors balance this approach with a focus on communication theory, history, process, and practice and on understanding how these apply to strategic public relations planning, as well as on learning how to create a believable and persuasive message. Key Features Chapter-opening Scenarios capture your attention by discussing current PR challenges such as the Wells Fargo cross-selling, VW emissions cover-up, and P&G s  Like a Girl  campaign and thus frame the chapter content and encourage active reading. At the end of the chapter, you explore various aspects of socially responsible communication to  solve  the PR challenge. Socially Responsible Case Studies in each chapter illustrate the key responsibilities of a modern public relations professional such as media relations, crisis communications, employee communications, applied communications research, and corporate and government-specific communications. Each case features problem-solving questions to encourage critical thinking. Social Responsibility in Action boxes feature short, specific social responsibility cases such as Universals  #NoFoodWasted, Nespresso in South Sudan, and Merck s collaboration with AIDS activists to highlight best practices and effective tactics, showing the link between sound public relations strategy and meaningful social responsibility programs. Insight boxes spark classroom discussion on particularly important or unique topics in each chapter. Personality Profile boxes will inspire you with stories from PR veterans and rising stars such as the U.S. CEO of Burson-Marstellor, the Chief Communication Officer of the United Nations Foundation, and the Executive VP at HavasPR.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VUVBDwAAQBAJ&dq=Public+relations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The world's first love","description":"With his characteristic eloquence and brilliance, Fulton J.

Since the early 1930s there has never been a time when horror films were not being produced in substantial numbers somewhere in the world and never a time when they were not being criticised, censored or banned. The Horror Film engages with the key issues raised by this most contentious of genres. It considers the reasons for horror's disreputability and seeks to explain why despite this horror has been so successful. Where precisely does the appeal of horror lie? An extended introductory chapter identifies what it is about horror that makes the genre so difficult to define. The chapter then maps out the historical development of the horror genre, paying particular attention to the international breadth and variety of horror production, with reference to films made in the United States, Britain, Italy, Spain and elsewhere. Subsequent chapters explore: The role of monsters, focusing on the vampire and the serial killer. The usefulness (and limitations) of psychological approaches to horror. The horror audience: what kind of people like horror (and what do other people think of them)? Gender, race and class in horror: how do horror films such as Bride of Frankenstein, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Blade relate to the social and political realities within which they are produced? Sound and horror: in what ways has sound contributed to the development of horror? Performance in horror: how have performers conveyed fear and terror throughout horror's history? 1970s horror: was this the golden age of horror production? Slashers and post-slashers: from Halloween to Scream and beyond. The Horror Film throws new light on some well-known horror films but also introduces the reader to examples of noteworthy but more obscure horror work. A final section provides a guide to further reading and an extensive bibliography. Accessibly written, The Horror Film is a lively and informative account of the genre that will appeal to students of cinema, film teachers and researchers, and horror lovers everywhere.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EXR_BAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Horror+Film&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tandem Towns of Texas: Tuxedo, Frognot, and Oatmeal (and Many More)","description":"The stories behind the odd, funny, weird, and puzzling names of other Texas towns.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TpgIAAAACAAJ&dq=Tandem+Towns+of+Texas:+Tuxedo,+Frognot,+and+Oatmeal+(and+Many+More)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sal de paseo","description":"Now available in PDF, the fully updated The Rough Guide to Andaluc a is the ultimate guide to this autonomous region in southern Spain; an exciting blend of fiestas, sherry, Roman ruins and whitewashed villages.

Dominion explores the implications of this shocking conviction as they have reverberated throughout history. Today, the West remains utterly saturated by Christian assumptions. As Tom Holland demonstrates, our morals and ethics are not universal but are instead the fruits of a very distinctive civilization. Concepts such as secularism, liberalism, science, and homosexuality are deeply rooted in a Christian seedbed.

Hearing that Clym Yeobright is to return from Paris, she sets her heart on marrying him, believing that through him she can leave rural life and find fulfilment elsewhere. But she is to be disappointed, for Clym has dreams of his own, and they have little in common with Eustacia s. Their unhappy marriage causes havoc in the lives of those close to them, in particular Damon Wildeve, Eustacia s former lover, Clym s mother and his cousin Thomasin. The Return of the Native illustrates the tragic potential of romantic illusion and how its protagonists fail to recognize their opportunities to control their own destinies.

Brooks reframes one of the most important, controversial, and misunderstood issues of our time in this far-reaching reassessment of the growing debate on black reparation. Atonement and Forgiveness shifts the focus of the issue from the backward-looking question of compensation for victims to a more forward-looking racial reconciliation. Offering a comprehensive discussion of the history of the black redress movement, this book puts forward a powerful new plan for repairing the damaged relationship between the federal government and black Americans in the aftermath of 240 years of slavery and another 100 years of government-sanctioned racial segregation. Key to Brooks's vision is the government's clear signal that it understands the magnitude of the atrocity it committed against an innocent people, that it takes full responsibility, and that it publicly requests forgiveness in other words, that it apologizes. The government must make that apology believable, Brooks explains, by a tangible act that turns the rhetoric of apology into a meaningful, material reality, that is, by reparation. Apology and reparation together constitute atonement. Atonement, in turn, imposes a reciprocal civic obligation on black Americans to forgive, which allows black Americans to start relinquishing racial resentment and to begin trusting the government's commitment to racial equality. Brooks's bold proposal situates the argument for reparations within a larger, international framework namely, a post-Holocaust vision of government responsibility for genocide, slavery, apartheid, and similar acts of injustice. Atonement and Forgiveness makes a passionate, convincing case that only with this spirit of heightened morality, identity, egalitarianism, and restorative justice can genuine racial reconciliation take place in America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V5WaDwAAQBAJ&dq=Atonement+and+Forgiveness:+A+New+Model+for+Black+Reparations+(George+Gund+Foundation+Book+in+African+American+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The psycho-analysis of children (International psycho-analytical library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7tEbzwEACAAJ&dq=The+psycho-analysis+of+children+(International+psycho-analytical+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Only at Night We See the Stars: Finding Light in the Face of Darkness","description":"When Karol Wojtyla succeeded Albino Luciani the pope of 33 days who could possibly have foreseen the consequences The pontificate of the first nonItalian since the sixteenth century indeed has left a lasting imprint on the church and on the world.

Love is in the air in the colorful Ulster village of Ballybucklebo, where Dr. Fingal Flahertie O'Reilly has finally proposed to the darling of his youth, Kitty O'Hallorhan. There's a wedding to be planned, but before O'Reilly can make it to the altar, he and his young colleague, Barry Laverty, M.B., must deal with the usual round of eccentric patients--and crises both large and small. Being a G.P. in a place like Ballybucklebo often can mean more than simply splinting broken bones and tending to aches and pains. It can also mean helping a struggling young couple acquire their first home, clearing the name of a cat accused of preying on a neighbor's prize pigeons, and encouraging a bright working-class girl who dreams of someday becoming a doctor herself. And, if you're Barry Laverty, still smarting from a painful breakup, there might even be a chance for a new romance with a lovely schoolteacher, if her passionate political convictions don't get in the way.

On one side of the threshold lies Peter Pan's never-never land, a world of perpetual childhood.

So exploring biblical perspectives on justice can help us appreciate some of the convictions and values that have helped shape Western political and judicial thought. \\"Christians also regard the Bible as a uniquely important source of guidance on matters of belief and practice. What the Bible has to say about justice, therefore -- both social justice and criminal justice -- ought to be of great significance for Christian thought and action today. \\"Yet coming to grips with biblical teaching on justice is by no means easy.\\" Upfront, Marshall addresses the many complexities that surround \\"justice\\" in the Bible: the Bible seems to hold conflicting points of view; there is a huge amount of data to deal with; the world of the Bible and our present world are vastly different.

On December 7th, when the attack on Pearl Harbor woke so many others to the reality of war, Stewart was already in uniform - as a private on guard duty south of San Francisco at the Army Air Corps Moffet Field. Seeing war on the horizon, Jimmy Stewart, at the height of his fame after Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and his Oscar-winning turn in The Phadelphia Story in 1940, had enlisted several months earlier. Jimmy Stewart, Bomber Pilot chronicles his long journey to become a bomber pilot in combat. Author Starr Smith, the intelligence officer assigned to the movie star, recounts how Stewart's first battles were with the Air Corps high command, who insisted on keeping the naturally talented pilot out of harm's way as an instructor pilot for B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-24 Liberators. By 1944, however, Stewart managed to get assigned to a Liberator squadron that was deploying to England to join the mighty Eighth Air Force. Once in the thick of it, he rose to command his own squadron and flew twenty combat missions, including one to Berlin.  My father would feel honored by this book.   Kelly Stewart Harcourt, daughter of Jimmy Stewart \\"We would have made Jimmy a group commander [equivalent to an army regiment] if the war had lasted another month.\\" - General Jimmy Doolittle. \\"An excellent biography of a distinguished airman and fine human being.\\" - Roger Freeman, author of The Mighty Eighth: A History of the U.S. 8th Air Force. \\"How wonderful it is that Starr Smith has finally directed a literary light on the personal history of Jimmy Stewart. . . . I welcomed Starr's book. It is needed and wanted. Bravo!\\" - Gay Talese. \\"This is a very well researched and written book. . . . It fills a place in history about no mere actor but a courageous and selfless man, Brigadier General Jimmy Stewart, USAF.\\" - General Michael E. Ryan, former Chief of Staff of the Air Force.  I have met a few movie stars, but of them all, I think that Jimmy Stewart was most like those modest heroes he portrayed. Now journalist Starr Smith has raised the curtain on Stewart s gallant service as a bomber pilot and air combat commander in World War II.

In the 1960's, Notre Dame's football program was in shambles. Little did anyone know, help was on its way in the form of Ara Parseghian, a controversial choice for head coach the first one outside of the Notre Dame \\"family.\\" It was now his responsibility to rebuild the once-proud program and teach the Fighting Irish how to win again. But it was no small task. The men of Notre Dame football were a bunch of unlikelies and oddballs, but Parseghian transformed them into a team: a senior quarterback who would win the Heisman Trophy; a five-foot-eight walk-on who would make first team All-American; an exceptionally rare black player, who would overcome much more than his quiet demeanor to rise to All-American, All-Pro, Hall of Famer, and to the Minnesota Supreme Court. Parseghian would change everything, from the uniforms and pads to the offensive strategy. It would be a huge gamble against great obstacles. But Ara Parseghian had that look in his eye.... New York Times bestselling author Jim Dent chronicles one of the greatest comeback seasons in the history of college football. Once again confirming his position as one of the top sports writers in the country, Dent brings the legends of Notre Dame football to life in an unforgettable story of second chances, determination, and unwavering spirit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CWBrYeHyv6EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Northrop YF-23A Flight Manual (Manuals of Flight)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yKw5PQAACAAJ&dq=Northrop+YF-23A+Flight+Manual+(Manuals+of+Flight)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Photoshop Studio with Bert Monroy (Voices (New Riders))","description":"The Technique and Power of Creation\\"This is a book of techniques.

Frank Lambert explains why this happened, offering in the process a synthesis of American history from the first British arrivals through Thomas Jefferson's controversial presidency. Lambert recognizes that two sets of spiritual fathers defined the place of religion in early America: what Lambert calls the Planting Fathers, who brought Old World ideas and dreams of building a \\"City upon a Hill,\\" and the Founding Fathers, who determined the constitutional arrangement of religion in the new republic. While the former proselytized the \\"one true faith,\\" the latter emphasized religious freedom over religious purity. Lambert locates this shift in the mid-eighteenth century. In the wake of evangelical revival, immigration by new dissenters, and population expansion, there emerged a marketplace of religion characterized by sectarian competition, pluralism, and widened choice. During the American Revolution, dissenters found sympathetic lawmakers who favored separating church and state, and the free marketplace of religion gained legal status as the Founders began the daunting task of uniting thirteen disparate colonies. To avoid discord in an increasingly pluralistic and contentious society, the Founders left the religious arena free of government intervention save for the guarantee of free exercise for all. Religious people and groups were also free to seek political influence, ensuring that religion's place in America would always be a contested one, but never a state-regulated one. An engaging and highly readable account of early American history, this book shows how religious freedom came to be recognized not merely as toleration of dissent but as a natural right to be enjoyed by all Americans.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4CHIomb78VgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1500 feet over Vietnam: A marine helicopter pilot's diary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dRVNAgAACAAJ&dq=1500+feet+over+Vietnam:+A+marine+helicopter+pilot%27s+diary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Read Me Another Story","description":"A collection of stories and verse to read aloud or for young children to try reading on their own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j9EEAQAAIAAJ&dq=Read+Me+Another+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sheela-na-Gigs of Ireland and Britain: The Divine Hag of the Christian Celts - An Illustrated Guide","description":"An illustrated and comprehensive account of the sheela-na-gigs (carvings of female images) of Britain and Ireland.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RyoWAQAAIAAJ&dq=Sheela-na-Gigs+of+Ireland+and+Britain:+The+Divine+Hag+of+the+Christian+Celts+-+An+Illustrated+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Universal Intelligence of Spirits, Guides and God","description":"We exist in an intelligent environment.

Transactions range from licences to patented academic research, to product developments as licences, joint ventures and acquisition of intellectual property rights, and on to collaborations in development and marketing, locally or across the globe. Asset sales, mergers and corporate takeovers are also a part of the business development remit. The scope of the job can be immense, spanning the life-cycle of products from the earliest levels of research to the disposal of residual marketing rights, involving legal regulatory manufacturing, clinical development, sales and marketing and financial aspects. The knowledge and skills required of practitioners must be similarly broad, yet the availability of information for developing a career in business development is sparse.

Liu starts with China's desperate need for what the Chinese called \\"the heavenly horses\\" of Central Asia, and describes how the traders who brought these horses also brought other exotic products, some all the way from the Mediterranean. Likewise, the Roman Empire, as a result of its imperial ambition as well as the desire of its citizens for Chinese silk, responded with easterly explorations for trade. The book shows how the middle men, the Kushan Empire, spread Buddhism to China. Missionaries and pilgrims facilitated cave temples along the mountainous routes and monasteries in various oases and urban centers, forming the backbone of the Silk Road. The author also explains how Islamic and Mongol conquerors in turn controlled the various routes until the rise of sea travel diminished their importance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FJ8RDAAAQBAJ&dq=Silk+Road&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How To Dump Your Wife: Practical Advice For The Good Man Trapped In A Bad Marriage","description":"Read the controversial book Howard Stern considers required reading for any man (or woman) even considering divorce!

Her practical advice on withstanding the emotional and financial ravages of divorce focuses on how to survive three types of wives: (1) the doting, clingy sweetheart who wants to stay married at all costs; (2) the shrill, abusive, spiteful, soul-sucking harpy; and (3) the self-absorbed career woman with powerful friends and her own agenda.

K. Chambers's seminal four-volume account of the private, public, and court stages, together with other forms of drama and spectacle surviving from earlier times, from the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth until the death of Shakespeare. Haled in its day as a comprehensive compendium of 'practically all the discoverable evidence upon the various parts of the subject, collected, weighed, sorted, classified and built up with immense care into a logical and beautiful structure' (New Statesman), the work is still much consulted by by today's scholars and historians. From the author's Preface: 'My First Book is devoted to a description, perhaps disproportionate, of the Elizabethan Court, and of the ramifications in pageant and progress, tilt and mask, of that instinct for spectacular mimesis, which the Renaissance inherited from the Middle Ages, and of which the drama is itself the most important manifestation. The Second Book gives an account of the settlement of the players in London, of their conflict, backed by the Court, with the tendencies of Puritanism, and of the place which they ultimately found in the monarchical polity. To the Third and Fourth belong the more pedestrian task of following in detail the fortunes of the individual playing companies and the individual theatres, with such fullness and the available records permit. The Fifth deals with the surviving plays, not in their literary aspect, which lies outside my plan, but as documents helping to throw light upon the history of the institution which produced them.'","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6GfiLPVfrjEC&dq=The+Elizabethan+stage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And Time Rolls On : The Savitri Devi Interviews","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4NWXjwEACAAJ&dq=And+Time+Rolls+On+:+The+Savitri+Devi+Interviews&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zen: The Perfect Companion (Perfect Companions!)","description":"Zen combines hundreds of traditional kong-ans with vivid artwork, in a unique volume exploring the crucial balance between the self and the world.

Keith F. Pecklers, SJ, answers this important theological question by focusing on the basics of Christian worship. Beginning with the definitions of such terms as ritual\\" and *liturgy - he writes in a very readable style about the historical/theological foundations of worship, tracing the evolution of Christian liturgy from the earliest centuries of the Christian era up to the reforms of Vatican II. Pecklers focuses on such liturgical issues of importance in our post-Vatican II Church as: inculturation, popular religion, and the social responsibility that authentic worship requires. He also considers some key social issues of the twenty-first century and their impact on our worship: the break-up of the stale parish community and decline in church attendance; the clergy shortage and priestless parishes; ecumenical liturgical cooperation and interreligious dialogue; the credibility of preaching; and how worship welcomes or excludes the marginated. Chapters are *Worship and Ritual, - *Worship in Development and Decline, - *Worship in Crisis and Challenge, - *Worship in Transition, - *Worship and Culture, - *Worship and Popular Religion, - *Worship and Society, - and *Worship and the Future of Christianity. - Keith F. Pecklers, SJ, SLD, is professor of liturgy at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and professor of liturgical history at the Pontifical Liturgical Institute of Saint'Anselmo. Liturgical Press recently published his book Dynamic Equivalence. He received Catholic Press Association awards for two other Liturgical Press publications, The Unread Visionand Liturgy for the New Millennium. \\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OYgX_t6X5SUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Original Sin: Clarence Thomas and the Failure of the Constitutional Conservatives","description":"Originalism is the practice of reviewing constitutional cases by seeking to discern the framers' and ratifiers' intent. Original Sin argues that the \\"jurisprudence of original intent,\\" represented on the current Supreme Court by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, has failed on its own terms. Attempts to determine the framers' intent have not brought greater determinacy and legitimacy to the process of constitutional interpretation. Instead, the method has been marked by the very flaws including self-interested reasoning and the manipulation of doctrine that originalists argue marred the jurisprudence of the judicial \\"activists\\" of the Warren Court. Original Sin brings a rigorous review of the performance of the \\"new originalists\\" to the debate, applying their methodology to real cases. Marcosson focuses on the judicial decisions of Clarence Thomas, an avowed originalist who nevertheless advocates \\"color blind\\" readings of the Constitution which are at odds with the framers' ideas concerning anti-miscegenation and other laws. After critiquing what he sees as a troubling use of originalism and explaining why it has failed to provide a consistent basis for constitutional decision-making, the author goes on to offer an alternative approach: one that lends greater legitimacy to the Court's interpretations of the Constitution.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kfOgBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sketches in Clay for Projects by Gian Lorenzo Bern: Theoretical, Technical and Case Studies","description":"Bringing together established and emerging specialists in seventeenth-century Italian sculpture, Material Bernini is the first sustained examination of the conspicuous materiality of Bernini s work in sculpture, architecture, and paint. The various essays demonstrate that material Bernini has always been tied (whether theologically, geologically, politically, or in terms of art theory) to his immaterial twin. Here immaterial Bernini and the historiography that sustains him is finally confronted by material Bernini. Central to the volume are Bernini s works in clay, a fragmentary record of a large body of preparatory works by a sculptor who denied any direct relation between sketches of any kind and final works. Read together, the essays call into question why those works in which Bernini s bodily relation to the material of his art is most evident, his clay studies, have been configured as a point of unmediated access to the artist s mind, to his immaterial ideas. This insight reveals a set of values and assumptions that have profoundly shaped Bernini studies from their inception, and opens up new and compelling avenues of inquiry within a field that has long remained remarkably self-enclosed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_jz7CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With Fire and Sword, Vol. 1","description":"\\"It was a day like any other for Dara Brighton, a promising young college student, until three powerful strangers knocked on her door, looking for a mysteriously powerful sword.

Since its dedication in 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial has become an American cultural icon symbolizing the war in Vietnam--the defining experience of the Baby Boom generation. The black granite wall of names is one of the most familiar media images associated with the war, and after three decades the memorial remains one of the nation's most visited monuments. While the memorial has enjoyed broad acceptance by the American public, its origins were both humble and contentious. A grassroots effort launched by veterans with no funds, the project was completed in three and a half years. But an emotional debate about aesthetics and the interpretation of heroism, patriotism and history nearly doomed the project. Written from an insider's perspective, this book tells the complete story of the memorial's creation amid Washington politics, a nationwide design competition and the heated controversy over the winning design and its creator.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rEgjCgAAQBAJ&dq=VIETNAM+VETERANS+MEMORIAL&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wellington's Military Machine","description":"This comprehensive, one-volume work on the British armed forces during the Napoleonic era is a must-have for every military history library.

At loose ends after college, Ellis Barstow drifts back to his hometown and a strange profession: reconstructing fatal traffic accidents. After meeting up with his half-brother s high school girlfriend, Heather, he takes a job with her husband, John Boggs, a forensic reconstructionist specializing in fatal traffic accidents whose causes are unknown. Ellis takes to the work naturally, becoming absorbed in the fascinating challenges of reclaiming the hidden truths behind seemingly random accidents. But Ellis is harboring secrets of his own haunted by the fatal crash that killed his half-brother, Christopher. Boggs, in his exacting way, would argue that  accident  is the wrong word, that if two cars meeting at an intersection can be called an accident then anything can where we live, what we do, even who we fall in love with. And for Ellis these things are certainly no accident. And Ellis also harbors a second, more dangerous secret one that threatens to blow apart the men s lives and which leads to a frenzied race towards confrontation, reconciliation, and the unresolved mystery surrounding the accident that killed his brother. Like an episode of CSI: The Midwest rewritten by Samuel Beckett, The Reconstructionist is a gripping novel of love, betrayal, and existential desperation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HC9bjItVm-8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The dance of Tahiti","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N2a1AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+dance+of+Tahiti&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Unspeakable Sadness: The Dispossession of the Nebraska Indians","description":"Of all the interactions between American Indians and Euro-Americans, none was as fundamental as the acquisition of the indigenous peoples  lands. To Euro-Americans this takeover of lands was seen as a natural right, an evolution to a higher use; to American Indians the loss of homelands was a tragedy involving also a loss of subsistence, a loss of history, and a loss of identity. Historical geographer David J. Wishart tells the story of the dispossession process as it affected the Nebraska Indians Otoe-Missouria, Ponca, Omaha, and Pawnee over the course of the nineteenth century. Working from primary documents, and including American Indian voices, Wishart analyzes the spatial and ecological repercussions of dispossession. Maps give the spatial context of dispossession, showing how Indian societies were restricted to ever smaller territories where American policies of social control were applied with increasing intensity. Graphs of population loss serve as reference lines for the narrative, charting the declining standards of living over the century of dispossession. Care is taken to support conclusions with empirical evidence, including, for example, specific details of how much the Indians were paid for their lands. The story is told in a language that is free from jargon and is accessible to a general audience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TgLHoEwA0fgC&dq=An+Unspeakable+Sadness:+The+Dispossession+of+the+Nebraska+Indians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encounters with the Invisible: Unseen Illness, Controversy, and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (MEDICAL HUMANITIES SERIES)","description":"The author weaves a history of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) with her personal experience with CFS, detailing her frustration dealing with extreme exhaustion, debilitating symptoms, and the lack of a definitive diagnosis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n385AQAAIAAJ&dq=Encounters+with+the+Invisible:+Unseen+Illness,+Controversy,+and+Chronic+Fatigue+Syndrome+(MEDICAL+HUMANITIES+SERIES)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moderatto En Directo ...

This was the book that launched the hugely successful 'Secret Projects' series and the writing career of renowned historian and author Tony Buttler. This completely revised and redesigned second editiontakes the original primary source material and adds to it new material that has come to life in the decades since the original edition was published. Particular emphasis is placed on the tender design competitions and the decisions at the Air Ministry to reject many promising projects, yet allow others to be built and flown. Aircraft types covered include the Hawker P.1103/P.1116/P.1121 series, the extraordinary jet and rocket mixed power-plant interceptors from Saunders-Roe, the equally impressive Fairey 'Delta III' and the origins of today's Hawk and Eurofighter. The book includes appendices that list all the British fighter projects and specifications for this period. There are also a number of specially commissioned color renditions of 'might-have-been' types in contemporary markings, plus photographs and general arrangement 3-view drawings--over 400 illustrations in total. The result is a unique insight into the secret world of British jet fighter projects through the 'golden years' of the British aerospace industry, while also presenting a coherent picture of British fighter development and evolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3przjwEACAAJ&dq=British+Secret+Projects+:+Jet+Fighters+Since+1950&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gates Of Paradise","description":"Now a major Lifetime movie event, from New York Times bestselling author and literary phenomenon V.C.

His landscapes are perhaps the least well known of his masterpieces, although they were the closest to his heart. Indeed, in his later years, Parrish dedicated himself almost entirely to landscape scenes, sometimes reworking earlier pieces to remove human figures. In this witty and illuminating book, Parrish expert Alma Gilbert argues persuasively that Parrish s better-known illustration career was a thirty-five-year detour on his path to achieving his true goal, a dedication to reproducing nature in all its splendor. The 50-plus color plates in this book show how masterfully he achieved that goal, while the text provides fascinating insight into the stories behind these glorious images. Also featured are lovely photos of Parrish s estate, The Oaks, where he found refuge and inspiration, shots of the artist and his family, and hitherto unpublished correspondence. Together, these elements help sketch in the context surrounding this remarkable man and his extraordinary art. A feast for the senses, this is truly a book for any art lover, whether familiar with Parrish s marvelous landscapes, or on the brink of a wonderful discovery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vDr3wAEACAAJ&dq=Maxfield+Parrish:+The+Landscapes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Axe,","description":"A wonderful book that covers the vast range of axes used throughout time and throughout the world, starting with the early stone hand-axes of the paleolithic period through the flint, copper, and bronze axes of early civilizations, the early iron axes of the medieval ages, and the production of steel axes made possible by the Industrial Revolution. Included are discussions of all axe types from celts to hand axes, tomahawks to hatchets, pebble tools to broad axes, plus a chapter on special axes. The author gives detailed descriptions of the axes, how they were made and the materials used, and the evolution of their design over time. Accompanying the descriptions are over 100 photographs of the axes, many seen only in museums. The axe was one of man's earliest tools, and remained one of his most important almost until the present day. Yet over the tens of thousands of years of its use, the changes in its design have been surprisingly small. What have changed dramatically are its methods and materials of fabrication, reflecting the advances in man's technological skills.

Although he worked on this project in the late 1940s, Sartre never completed it to his satisfaction, and it remained unpublished until after his death in 1980. Presented here for the first time in English, Notebooks for an Ethics is Sartre's attempt to articulate a moral philosophy. In the Notebooks he addresses any number of themes and topics relevant to an effort to formulate a concrete and revolutionary socialist ethics, among them the differences between force and violence, the relationship of means and ends, and the relationship of oppression and alienation. Most important, he tries to show that there can be an authentic mutual recognition among free individuals where no one steals another's freedom. While remaining committed to the basic principles of Being and Nothingness, Sartre here seeks to locate the foundation for action in history and society. The Notebooks thus form an important bridge between the early existentialist Sartre and the later Marxist social thinker of the Critique of Dialectical Reason. Sartre grapples anew with such central issues as \\"authenticity\\" and the relation of alienation and freedom to moral values. In dealing with fundamental modes of relating to the Other, among them violence, entreaty, demand, appeal, refusal, and revolt, he highlights the notions of conversion and creation as they figure in the necessary transition from individualism to historical consciousness. The Notebooks themselves are complemented here by two appendixes, one on \\"the good and subjectivity\\", the other on the problem of blacks in theUnited States as a case study of oppression.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KXydHTojO9QC&dq=Notebooks+for+an+Ethics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The U.S. Merchant Marine at War, 1775-1945","description":"As the U.S. Merchant Marine has declined over the last several decades, so too has the memory of the countless acts of unflinching courage and patriotism performed by its civilian officers and seamen in America's armed struggles.

Pharmaceutical companies are mass marketing hormones as fast as doctors can prescribe them, and menopausal seminars sponsored by these companies are crisscrossing the country in an effort to educate women on easing the physical pains of hormone deficiencies. Books like The Silent Passage, What Your Doctor Won't Tell You About Menopause, and Listening To Your Hormones are flying off the shelves because women are desperate to learn even more. And yet, these doctors, seminars, and books still haven't addressed what every transitional woman instinctively knows: Menopause is much more than just a list of physical ailments, menopause is a spiritual journey. The Seven Sacred Rites of Menopause: The Spiritual Journey to the Wise-Woman Years is a groundbreaking work that will usher in a new way for women to cope with the emotional and physical challenges of menopause. Venturing into uncharted territory, Kristi Meisenbach Boylan takes an intriguing and original look at the seven rituals that menopausal women move through on their voyage to the wise-woman years. Author Meisenbach Boylan believes that these seven ceremonial milestones should be viewed as celebrations not as symptoms of an illness and that the menopausal life passage isn't just about a woman's body fighting to correct hormonal imbalances, but is really about the soul trying to find its spiritual balance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oogMAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Seven+Sacred+Rites+of+Menopause:+The+Spiritual+Journey+to+the+Wise-Woman+Years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","description":"With an essay by Elizabeth Tilley.

As a kid, I put more into getting ready for my turn to present than I put into the rest of my homework. Show-and-Tell was real in a way that much of what I learned in school was not. It was education that came out of my life experience. As a teacher, I was always surprised by what I learned from these amateur hours. A kid I was sure I knew well would reach down into a paper bag he carried and fish out some odd-shaped treasure and attach meaning to it beyond my most extravagant expectation. Again and again I learned that what I thought was only true for me . . . only valued by me . . . only cared about by me . . . was common property. The principles guiding this book are not far from the spirit of Show-and-Tell. It is stuff from home that place in my mind and heart where I most truly live. P.S. This volume picks up where I left off in All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten, when I promised to tell about the time it was on fire when I lay down on it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4TfPpi0uaVUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","description":"Stephen King's bestselling unsolved mystery, THE COLORADO KID -- inspiration for the TV series HAVEN -- returns to bookstores for the first time in 10 years in an all-new illustrated edition.

The contributors find commonalities in the globalized economy in which all cities compete and in the mixes of squalor and splendor found in urban environments east and west, north and south.

Controversial in both life and art, Francis Bacon was one of the most important painters of the 20th century. His monumental, unsettling images have an extraordinary power to disturb, shock and haunt the spectator, 'to unlock the valves of feeling and therefore return the onlooker to life more violently'. Drawing on his personal knowledge of Bacon's inspirations, intentions and working methods, David Sylvester surveys the development of the work from 1933 to the early 1990s, and discusses critically a number of its crucial aspects. He also reproduces previously unpublished extracts from his celebrated conversations with Bacon in which the artist speaks about himself, modern painters and the art of the past. Finally, Sylvester gives a brief account of Bacon's life, correcting certain errors that elsewhere have been presented as facts. Divided into the sections 'Review', 'Reflections', 'Fragments of Talk' and 'Biographical Note', Looking Back at Francis Bacon is a unique portrait of one of the creative geniuses of our age by a writer of comparable distinction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KE94zgEACAAJ&dq=Looking+Back+at+Francis+Bacon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marvels of Charity: History of American Sisters and Nuns","description":"A treasure house of particulars and peculiarities, this is the only comprehensive history of American sisters and nuns ever written.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=06X-AQAACAAJ&dq=Marvels+of+Charity:+History+of+American+Sisters+and+Nuns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","description":" A free-wheeling vehicle . . . an unforgettable ride!

Prof. Dr. Martin Haspelmath, Max-Planck-Institut f r Evolution?re Anthropologie The authors propose a revision of views on a number of central issues of Indo-European studies. Based on findings of typology, they suggest a new analysis of the phonological system of Proto-Indo-European (the  Glottalic Theory ); they offer novel assumptions about the relative chronology of changes in PIE vowels and laryngeals. Their conclusions are compared with data from Proto-Kartvelian. In the second part of the book, semantically organized presentation of material from the lexicon is combined with analyses of the use of forms and formulae in a broadly defined cultural context. Again similarities with properties of primarily Kartvelian and Semitic are described , and extended close contacts with these language families are postulated.

Now she turns her investigative skills to a controversial case that exposed the increased suicide rates among adolescents taking antidepressants such as Paxil, Prozac, and Zoloft. Side Effects tells the tale of a gutsy assistant attorney general who, along with an unlikely whistle-blower at an Ivy League university, uncovered evidence of deception behind one of the most successful drug campaigns in history. Paxil was the world's bestselling antidepressant in 2002. Pediatric prescriptions soared, even though there was no proof that the drug performed any better than sugar pills in treating children and adolescents, and the real risks the drugs posed were withheld from the public. The New York State Attorney General's office brought an unprecedented lawsuit against giant manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Paxil, for consumer fraud. The successful suit launched a tidal wave of protest that changed the way drugs are tested, sold, and marketed in this country. With meticulous research, Alison Bass shows us the underbelly of the pharmaceutical industry. She lays bare the unhealthy ties between the medical establishment, big pharma, and the FDA relationships that place vulnerable children and adults at risk every day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=inZ4EAAAQBAJ&dq=Side+Effect&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World Turns Round and Round","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AmRiAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Skyborn (Omni, No 3)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8CYZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Skyborn+(Omni,+No+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GM Chevrolet Mid-Size Cars, 1964-88 (Chilton's Total Car Care Repair Manuals)","description":"All models of Chevelle, Malibu, Laguna S-3, Monte Carlo & El Camino, including SS models & diesel engines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WJ0rGwAACAAJ&dq=GM+Chevrolet+Mid-Size+Cars,+1964-88+(Chilton%27s+Total+Car+Care+Repair+Manuals)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Infosense: Turning Information Into Knowledge","description":"It has been called everything from the new gold standard to the fundamental building block of the universe.

The Magician opens in a provincial German city at the turn of the twentieth century, where the boy, Thomas Mann, grows up with a conservative father, bound by propriety, and a Brazilian mother, alluring and unpredictable.

The approaches adopted by the authors of the essays range from the largely theoretical to the more popular forms of the interview and the review.

But today we know that it s made up of fanciful legends set down by power-seeking priests eager to inspire awe and fear in their flocks. And as Deceptions and Myths of the Bible illustrates, these tales of scriptural tyranny aren t even original but rather retold and revised mythologies. The story of Adam and Eve was derived from a Babylonian account. Noah s dilemma is the exaggerated accumulation of over four hundred years of flood accounts from various ancient civilizations. Even the names of Noah s sons are hand-me-downs, as was the tale of Isaac s sacrifice, Solomon s judgment, and Samson s pillar act. Moses? Fashioned from the Syrian story of Mises. As for the laws of the Bible, they were patterned after the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi. Revealed here, too, are the 137 similarities between the story of Jesus and the story of the Egyptian god Horus, and nearly twice as many parallels between the story of Christ and the Hindu god Krishna, and many more faith-shaking revelations. For any reader interested in theology, this is an essential read. For atheists, it s an irrefutable argument of support; for agnostics, evidence to tip the scale. For the devout, it offers an enlightening, history-based awareness of the derivation of your religion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WkJ1EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The planetarium and atmospherium;: An indoor universe,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=03_vAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+planetarium+and+atmospherium%3B:+An+indoor+universe,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"the tale of squirrel nutkin","description":"Fully illustrated throughout, Beatrix Potter's famous tale of a naughty squirrel who loses his tail is as popular today as it was when it was first published over 100 years ago.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zE42EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rough Rider: Buckey O'Neill of Arizona","description":"Buckey O'Neill was famous in Arizona Territory as a gambler, lawyer, newspaperman, miner, sheriff, and politician.

Many of these New Christians persevered in their Jewish prayers and rituals in secret and at great risk; the hidden, arcane practices of the kabbalists, a mystical sect of Jews, continued as well. One such secret Jew was Berekiah Zarco, an intelligent young manuscript illuminator. Inflamed by love and revenge, he searches, in the crucible of the raging pogrom, for the killer of his beloved uncle Abraham, a renowned kabbalist and manuscript illuminator, discovered murdered in a hidden synagogue along with a young girl in dishabille. Risking his life in streets seething with mayhem, Berekiah tracks down answers among Christians, New Christians, Jews, and the fellow kabbalists of his uncle, whose secret language and codes by turns light and obscure the way to the truth he seeks. A marvelous story, a challenging mystery, and a telling tale of the evils of intolerance, The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon both compels and entertains.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=szuEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three Worlds Gone Mad: Dangerous Journeys through the War Zones of Africa, Asia, and the South Pacific","description":"Follows the author's harrowing journeys to warn-torn Sierra Leone, the republic of Chechnya, and the South Pacific island of Bourgainville, during which he encountered terrorists, suicide squads, and rebel leader Francis Ona.

An ambitious twenty-three-year-old, Maas moved to Hollywood and launched her own writing career by drafting a screenplay of the bestselling novel The Plastic Age for \\"\\"It\\"\\" girl Clara Bow. On the basis of that script, she landed a staff position at powerhouse MGM studios. In the years to come, she worked with and befriended numerous actors and directors, including Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, and Eric von Stroheim, as well as such writers and producers as Thomas Mann and Louis B. Mayer. As a professional screenwriter, Fredderica quickly learned that scripts and story ideas were frequently rewritten and that screen credit was regularly given to the wrong person. Studio executives wanted well-worn plots, but it was the writer's job to develop the innovative situations and scintillating dialogue that would bring to picture to life. For over twenty years, Freddie and her friends struggled to survive in this incredibly competitive environment. Through it all, Freddie remained a passionate, outspoken woman in an industry run by powerful men, and her provocative, nonconformist ways brought her success, failure, wisdom, and a wealth of stories, opinions, and insight into a fascinating period in screen history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sGDdwkBkA2oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reading, Writing & Language: A Practical Guide for Primary Teachers","description":"Reading & Writing with English Learners offers kindergarten through fifth grade reading and writing educators a user-friendly guide and framework for supporting English learners in balanced literacy classrooms.

Hudson)","description":"How does a bird experience a city? A backyard? A park? As the world has become more urban, noisier from increased traffic, and brighter from streetlights and office buildings, it has also become more dangerous for countless species of birds. Warblers become disoriented by nighttime lights and collide with buildings. Ground-feeding sparrows fall prey to feral cats. Hawks and other birds-of-prey are sickened by rat poison. These name just a few of the myriad hazards. How do our cities need to change in order to reduce the threats, often created unintentionally, that have resulted in nearly three billion birds lost in North America alone since the 1970s? In The Bird-Friendly City, Timothy Beatley, a longtime advocate for intertwining the built and natural environments, takes readers on a global tour of cities that are reinventing the status quo with birds in mind. Efforts span a fascinating breadth of approaches: public education, urban planning and design, habitat restoration, architecture, art, civil disobedience, and more. Beatley shares empowering examples, including: advocates for  catios,  enclosed outdoor spaces that allow cats to enjoy backyards without being able to catch birds; a public relations campaign for vultures; and innovations in building design that balance aesthetics with preventing bird strikes. Through these changes and the others Beatley describes, it is possible to make our urban environments more welcoming to many bird species. Readers will come away motivated to implement and advocate for bird-friendly changes, with inspiring examples to draw from. Whether birds are migrating and need a temporary shelter or are taking up permanent residence in a backyard, when the environment is safer for birds, humans are happier as well.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mKr5DwAAQBAJ&dq=Birds+in+town&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Essential Guide to Prescription Drugs 2001","description":"Be an active partner in your health care!

It argues that the undoubted strength of Catholicism in these years may have come less from its traditionalism, and its resistance to change, than from its ability to embrace reforming principles. The humanist elements within Henry VIII's religious policies encouraged the development of the Erasmian potential already well established in English Catholic thought. A dominant strain of Catholic ideology emerged which attempted not only to defend, but also to reform the Catholic faith, and to promote the study of Scripture, the use of the vernacular, and the refashioning of doctrine. This provided the basis for attempts to launch a Catholic Reformation under Mary I, and remained influential during the early years of Elizabeth, until reconfigured by the experience of exile and the drive for Counter-Reformation uniformity.\\" \\"Dr. Wooding shows that Catholicism in this period was neither a defunct tradition, nor one merely reacting to Protestantism, but a vigorous intellectual movement responding to the reformist impulse of the age. Its development illustrates the English Reformation in microcosm: scholarly, humanist, practical, and preserving its own peculiarities distinct from European trends. It shows that reform was not a Protestant reserve, but a broad concern in which many participated. Rethinking Catholicism in Reformation England makes an important contribution to the intellectual history of the Reformation.\\"--BOOK JACKET.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LHPnCwAAQBAJ&dq=Rethinking+the+Purpose+Of+Business:+Interdisciplinary+Essays+from+the+Catholic+Social+Tradition+(CATHOLIC+SOCIAL+THOU)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rare Jewel of Christian Contentment","description":"A classic work on contentment in a Christian by the Puritan Jeremiah Burroughs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RmOgngEACAAJ&dq=Rare+Jewel+of+Christian+Contentment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"St. Barth: French West Indies (A concepts book)","description":"Photographs and descriptive text reveal the natural beauty and unique culture of the Caribbean island of St. Barthelemy","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PlP_JX6NMYMC&dq=St.+Barth:+French+West+Indies+(A+concepts+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mapping Biology Knowledge (Science & Technology Education Library Volume 11) (Contemporary Trends and Issues in Science Education)","description":"Mapping Biology Knowledge addresses two key topics in the context of biology, promoting meaningful learning and knowledge mapping as a strategy for achieving this goal.

Various strategies are proposed for helping instructors focus on the big picture, using the \`need to know' principle to decide the level of detail students must have in a given situation. The metacognitive tools described here serve as support systems for the mind, creating an arena in which learners can operate on ideas. They include concept maps, cluster maps, webs, semantic networks, and conceptual graphs. These tools, compared and contrasted in this book, are also useful for building and assessing students' content and cognitive skills.

However, many Church ministers (priests, deacons, religious, and laypersons) do not have the time to make the full thirty-day Ignatian retreat with a spiritual director. This helpful resource seeks to lead a retreatant prayerfully into the heart of an Ignatian retreat by using contemplations and themes from the Spiritual Exercises as well as other meditations on the life of Jesus-but within an eight-day time frame. With a particular focus on ministry, both ordained and nonordained, the short chapters present mysteries from the life of Jesus and considerations that correspond to the dynamics of the Exercises. They represent a preparation for prayer, not to instruct but to move the imagination and hopefully the heart. An appendix offers additional scriptural texts. An 8 Day Ignatian Retreat for Priests, Religious, Deacons, and Lay Ministers enables busy and hardworking Church ministers to apply the Ignatian insights to their own interior life, which will result in rejuvenation and growth in their pastoral ministry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pYehvpvpMl4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 2nd Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles and Diversions","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ohFSAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+2nd+Scientific+American+Book+of+Mathematical+Puzzles+and+Diversions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Wave Pharmaceutical Selling","description":"Pharmaceutical Selling Skills Book","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fS8HPQAACAAJ&dq=New+Wave+Pharmaceutical+Selling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lights, Camera, Sex!","description":"Christy Canyon's flamboyant debut into the world of adult video in 1984 rocked the porn industry like never before.

Rachel Shteir's The Steal is the first serious study of shoplifting, tracking the fascinating history of this ancient crime. Dismissed by academia and the mainstream media and largely misunderstood, shoplifting has become the territory of moralists, mischievous teenagers, tabloid television, and self-help gurus. But shoplifting incurs remarkable real-life costs for retailers and consumers. The \\"crime tax\\"-the amount every American family loses to shoplifting-related price inflation-is more than $400 a year. Shoplifting cost American retailers $11.7 billion in 2009. The theft of one $5.00 item from Whole Foods can require sales of hundreds of dollars to break even. The Steal begins when shoplifting entered the modern record as urbanization and consumerism made London into Europe's busiest mercantile capital. Crossing the channel to nineteenth-century Paris, Shteir tracks the rise of the department store and the pathologizing of shoplifting as kleptomania. In 1960s America, shoplifting becomes a symbol of resistance when the publication of Abbie Hoffman's Steal This Book popularizes shoplifting as an antiestablishment act. Some contemporary analysts see our current epidemic as a response to a culture of hyper-consumerism; others question whether its upticks can be tied to economic downturns at all. Few provide convincing theories about why it goes up or down. Just as experts can't agree on why people shoplift, they can't agree on how to stop it. Shoplifting has been punished by death, discouraged by shame tactics, and protected against by high-tech surveillance. Shoplifters have been treated by psychoanalysis, medicated with pharmaceuticals, and enforced by law to attend rehabilitation groups. While a few individuals have abandoned their sticky-fingered habits, shoplifting shows no signs of slowing. In The Steal, Shteir guides us through a remarkable tour of all things shoplifting-we visit the Woodbury Commons Outlet Mall, where boosters run rampant, watch the surveillance footage from Winona Ryder's famed shopping trip, and learn the history of antitheft technology. A groundbreaking study, The Steal shows us that shoplifting in its many guises-crime, disease, protest-is best understood as a reflection of our society, ourselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EchKhEduEBwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GM: Malibu, Alero, Cutlass & Grand Am, '97'00 (Haynes Automotive Repair Manual Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3I3FzgEACAAJ&dq=GM:+Malibu,+Alero,+Cutlass&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alison's Gift: The Song of a Thousand Hearts Opening","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BskJAAAACAAJ&dq=Alison%27s+Gift:+The+Song+of+a+Thousand+Hearts+Opening&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Autobiography of Anthony Trollope (The Seaside library.

The characters represent a cross-section of the upper classes of imperial Germany: a philandering baron, his jealous wife, a gallant cavalry officer, the elderly widow of a general, a cynical government official, a lady's companion. Their lives, even on holiday, are regulated by rigid protocol and archaic codes of honour.

What exactly does it mean to \\"evangelize\\" in a Christian sense? And how is such evangelizing supposed to be done? Longtime pastor, evangelist, and professor of evangelism Timothy K. Beougher answers these questions and more from theological, historical, and practical perspectives. Beougher demonstrates God's goodness in evangelism through relatable anecdotes, Bible teaching, and encouraging instruction. Invitation to Evangelism welcomes believers into the experience of stepping out in faith of behalf of people God loves. Most Christians know that they should be sharing the good news of Jesus Christ with nonbelievers, and most also know they aren't witnessing very well, or even at all. They need help internalizing the content of gospel proclamation and identifying the best way to go about making evangelism a natural part of their lives. Invitation to Evangelism guides readers through the essential issues of the gospel message, evangelism methods, and witnessing models so they are ready and excited to move out in faith as everyday evangelists. Beougher's biblical, theological, historical, and practical teaching revolves around following essential aspects of being an evangelist: Having compassion as the motivation for evangelism Understanding the good news of Jesus Christ Seeing lost people as persons God loves Relying on the power of the Holy Spirit Paving the way for new believers to share their faith eagerly with others","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OVo7EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Innocent Deceit (Mills & Boon Historical)","description":"A Lady's Deception","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I2JMAgAAQBAJ&dq=Innocent+Deceit+(Mills&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christmas stories;: A Christmas carol, The chimes, The cricket on the hearth","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1NZMAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With Fire and Sword, Vol. 2: A Tale of the Past","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cuYHAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","description":"FORETOLD IN THE BIBLE: Two nuclear wars. Three asteroids. Demonic madness. Into this, a savior will rise, cloned from Christ. It's not fiction. It's prophecy. The Messiah of the New Age. His coming is prophesied by more than a dozen major religions. Cloned from live cells of Jesus Christ found on the Shroud of Turin, Christopher Goodman was born into the most turbulent time in human history. Mentored by former UN Assistant Secretary-General Robert Milner, Christopher rises in position and power, and displays remarkable wisdom and compassion. But through disjointed bits of dreams that sometimes haunt him, Christopher reveals significant troubling errors in the biblical record of Jesus life. Soon the reason for Robert Milner 's interest in Christopher becomes clear: the world is about to undergo a time of destruction and chaos darker than any in history, with impending nuclear war merely a faint precursor. Milner explains that without Christopher, humanity will not long survive. Under Christopher 's leadership, however, mankind stands on the threshold of a final great evolutionary leap that will bestow on the human race god-like powers. This is the reason, Milner says, that Christopher was born. In Israel, an unexpected threat to Christopher 's ascension is growing: two men, possessed of incredible supernatural powers, one claiming to be the 2000-year-old Apostle John, the other an apostate Hasidic rabbi named Saul Cohen. Together, the men lead an outlawed cult of 144,000 followers, each branded with the names Yahweh and Yeshua on their foreheads. ------------------------------------------------- PRAISE FOR THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY \\"BeauSeigneur knows how to write, deploying a tough, driving style in perfect cadence.\\" Booklist (Starred Review) \\"Astoundingly intelligent...inventive...dizzyingly well-described.\\" Kirkus Reviews (Starred Review) \\"Undeniably riveting... daring...wonderfully creepy...Readers will be enthralled by the author's science-fortified vision of the Apocalypse.\\" Publishers Weekly ------------------------------------------------- PUBLICATION HISTORY IN HIS IMAGE is Book One of a revised, expanded, and re-edited release of THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY, originally published in 1997 by SelectiveHouse and in 2003 by Warner Books.

The volume brings together all known examples of categorical perception, from research on humans and animals, infants and adults, in all the sense modalities: hearing, seeing, and touch. The perceptual findings are then interpreted in terms of the available cognitive and neuroscientific theories of how categorical perception is accomplished by the brain. Research on elementary perceptual and psychophysical categories is then compared with work on higher order categories such as objects, patterns, and abstract concepts. The book proceeds to an integrative view of categorization in general by exploring the most thoroughly investigated case of categorical perception--speech perception.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eY5iQgAACAAJ&dq=Categorical+Perception:+The+Groundwork+of+Cognition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flashlight Walking: The Inspiring Story of One Family's Struggle Through Cancer and the Enron Nightmare","description":"Imagine that you are living the \\"American Dream\\": a family man with a respected position at a Fortune 500 company, a two-story home, two kids, two cars, and money in the bank.

How much would this test your faith and the faith of your family? For Bill Peterson, the American dream became a nightmare.

Including interviews with over one hundred fathers - from truck drivers to insurance salesmen, physicians to artists - Doucet illustrates how men are breaking the mould of traditional parenting models. This edition expands her argument wider and deeper, building on changes to the theoretical work that informs the field, her own intellectual trajectory, and the fieldwork of revisiting six fathers and their partners a decade after her initial interviews. She continues to examine key questions such as: What leads fathers to trade earning for caring? How do fathers navigate through the 'maternal worlds' of mothers and infants? Are men mothering or are they redefining fatherhood? In asking and unravelling the question 'Do men mother?' this study tells a compelling story about Canadian parents radically re-envisioning child care and domestic responsibilities in the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bRBaDwAAQBAJ&dq=Do+Men+Mother%3F:+Fathering,+Care,+and+Domestic+Responsibility&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Date With A Diva: Single In South Beach (Harlequin Blaze)","description":"Lainie Reynolds's long-ignored libido has picked a fine time to wake up.

You must know that. We use those people; it s as simple as that. . . . I can t tell you any more.  from Warlock, a new novel by Perry Brass, author of Angel Lust, The Harvest, and How to Survive Your Own Gay Life.  Submission, passion, power, and the kind of unleashed gay sexuality that I like to write about   these were the elements I wanted in my new book, Warlock, A Novel of Possession,  says gay poet and novelist Perry Brass.  I also wanted to create characters that leap off the page. I think that s one of the problems with so many gay books   the characters seem interchangeable. They never have to work hard at anything. Life for them seems like a big cocktail party, with a play room attached. I wanted to write about the struggle for survival that so many of us have   and that we try to transcend with the special gifts we bring to our own lives. I also wanted to tell a hell of a story, which Warlock does.  And what is that?  Two men meet under fairly common circumstances   in a popular gay bath house in Manhattan. One of them, Allen Barrow, is sexually inhibited, has a small penis that embarrasses him, is shy, soft-spoken, polite, and has a low-paying job in a bank. His whole life will change when he meets Destry Powars.  Powars is, indeed,  destiny s child : he is larger than life, a true urban cowboy, sexually wild, smart, uncouth, vulgar   from generations of footloose losers. He has reinvented himself over and over again and has become spectacularly rich and successful. He has learned the language that moves money, the language of power, force, success at any means. But who has taught him this, and at what price? The price is his own goodness, his own real soul  and he can find this again, only by merging with Allen.  Warlock is a book of hypnotic splendor and power, full of gorgeous eroticism and total suspense. If you ever wanted to find your own  man of destiny,  who will pull you away from the problems of your life, who will satisfy your every wish   Warlock will tell you how to find and recognize him, as well as make you see the ancient and hard work of warlocks.  I think,  Perry Brass says,  the message of Warlock is that the business of business is . . . often evil. Just how evil it is, I write about in Warlock. Many of the excesses of the last ten years are coming back to roost. I m glad that I have published a very powerful gay book that deals with so much of what we have seen, but in a way that is both entertaining and very moving. The real message of this book is our own submission to love and sexual fulfilllment   how much we really want this and how difficult it is to achieve, as much as we want it. That is a message I have written about many times, but I m glad to do it in this really unique way in this book.

His team s discovery of the fructose-powered survival switch a metabolic pathway that animals in nature turn on and off as needed, but that our modern diet has permanently fixed in the  on  position, where it becomes a fat switch revolutionized the way we think about why we gain weight.

This book is inspired by Eric Voegelin, one of the major political scientists of the last century, who developed an interest in the very early symbolism associated with the caves and rock shelters of the Upper Paleolithic, but never finished his analysis. Cooper, who has written extensively on Voegelin s theories, takes up the enterprise of applying Voegelin s approach to an analysis of portable and cave art. He specifically applies Voegelin s philosophy of consciousness, his concept of the compactness and differentiation of consciousness, his argument regarding the experience and symbolizations of reality, and his notion of the primary experience of the cosmos to images previously regarded as pedestrian. Cooper demonstrates the political significance of the earliest expressions of human existence and is among the first to argue that political life began not with the Greeks, but 25,000 years before them. Archaeologists, prehistorians, and political scientists will all benefit from this original and provocative work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wsjZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enduring Liberalism: American Political Thought Since the 1960s (Modern War Studies)","description":"\\"Enduring Liberalism pursues two objectives.

Pikeville, Kentucky, is high in Appalachian coal country, an outpost rife with lawlessness dating back to the Hatfields and McCoys. As a rising star in the bureau, however, Putnam soon was cultivating paid informants and busting drug rings and bank robbers. But when one informant fell in love with him, passion and duty would collide with tragic results. A coal miner s daughter, Susan Smith was a young, attractive, struggling single mother. She was also a drug user sometimes described as a con artist, thief, and professional liar. Ultimately, Putnam gave in to Smith s relentless pursuit. But when he ended the affair, she waged a campaign of vengeance that threatened to destroy him. When at last she confronted him with a shocking announcement, a violent scuffle ensued, and Putnam, in a burst of uncontrolled rage, fatally strangled her.

From the moment Joseph the carpenter carves a puppet that can walk and talk, this wildly inventive fantasy takes Pinocchio through countless adventures, in the course of which his nose grows whenever he tells a lie, he is turned into a donkey, and is swallowed by a dogfish, before he gains real happiness. This new translation does full justice to the vibrancy and wit of Collodi's original. Far more sophisticated, funny, and hard-hitting than the many abridged versions (and the sentimentalized film) of the story would suggest, Ann Lawson Lucas's translation captures the complexity of Collodi's word-play, slapstick humour, and immediacy of dialogue. An adult reader will recognize social and political satire, and the invaluable introduction and notes illuminate the cultural traditions on which Collodi drew. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9m8vEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spectral Analysis and Time Series, Two-Volume Set, Volume 1-2: Volumes I and II (Probability and Mathematical Statistics)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=plG_bwAACAAJ&dq=Spectral+Analysis+and+Time+Series,+Two-Volume+Set,+Volume+1-2:+Volumes+I+and+II+(Probability+and+Mathematical+Statistics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under the Greenwood Tree (Penguin Classics)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jb2xAQAACAAJ&dq=Under+the+Greenwood+Tree+(Penguin+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hawaiian Magic & Spirituality","description":"A stunning power lies at the heart of the Hawaiian islands.

Marx was a leading designer in the first generation to make a distinctive contribution to the growing practice of industrial design in Britain. Her design work, much of it anonymous, including wartime utility fabrics, book illustration and cover patterns, tube train seat fabric and postage stamps, was, in its time, ubiquitous in British public life. As a whole, it remains utterly emblematic of post-war popular visual culture. Drawing on a wealth of research and thoroughly illustrated with high-quality reproductions - many previously unpublished - Alan Powers' account adds considerably to the existing literature available on Enid Marx and reveals an artist whose work was perfectly poised at the intersection of traditional craft and abstract modernity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K1BbtAEACAAJ&dq=The+pleasures+of+pattern&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Waiting for the New Fuhrer: The German Euro-Apartheied","description":"This book is a sharp analysis of Germany's old and new strategies. It explains in great detail why Germany suddenly drifted to the right wing and even gave up its postwar modest foreign policy in order to join the bellecists fraction. The book also reveals hidden agendas and lays open the deep crisis Germany is in since the Social Democratic-Green government of Gerhard Schr?der has assumed power, relying on neo-liberal economic, social and cultural reforms while on the horizon a new charismatic rightist leader is flexing his muscles. \\"We might not know his name yet, but it is certain that he will steal power once the red-green coalition has crashed against the concrete wall,\\" says the author, Ralph T. Niemeyer, who is known for provoking controversies as he criticizes his country's course from a liberal but so far unheard viewpoint. This book is a must for anyone who wants to understand Germany's ambitions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p2TKWmRKvmgC&dq=Waiting+for+the+New+Fuhrer:+The+German+Euro-Apartheied&hl=&source=gbs_api"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:L},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},I=["disabled"],P={key:0},E={key:1};function q(s,i,t,u,r,a){const g=f("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),n("div",M,[(e(!0),o(m,null,b(a.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",E,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",P,"See more"))],8,I)):c("",!0)])}const J=d(B,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-d3d76afc"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/19.md","filePath":"drive/19.md"}'),x={name:"drive/19.md"},_=Object.assign(x,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[w(J)]))}});export{H as __pageData,_ as default};
