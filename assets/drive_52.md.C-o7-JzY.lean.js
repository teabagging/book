By the end, The Light Ages didn t just broaden my conception of science; even as I scrolled away on my Kindle, it felt like I was sitting alongside Westwyk at St. Albans abbey, leafing through dusty manuscripts by candlelight.\\"  Alex Orlando, Discover Soaring Gothic cathedrals, violent crusades, the Black Death: these are the dramatic forces that shaped the medieval era. But the so-called Dark Ages also gave us the first universities, eyeglasses, and mechanical clocks. As medieval thinkers sought to understand the world around them, from the passing of the seasons to the stars in the sky, they came to develop a vibrant scientific culture. In The Light Ages, Cambridge science historian Seb Falk takes us on a tour of medieval science through the eyes of one fourteenth-century monk, John of Westwyk. Born in a rural manor, educated in England s grandest monastery, and then exiled to a clifftop priory, Westwyk was an intrepid crusader, inventor, and astrologer. From multiplying Roman numerals to navigating by the stars, curing disease, and telling time with an ancient astrolabe, we learn emerging science alongside Westwyk and travel with him through the length and breadth of England and beyond its shores. On our way, we encounter a remarkable cast of characters: the clock-building English abbot with leprosy, the French craftsman-turned-spy, and the Persian polymath who founded the world s most advanced observatory. The Light Ages offers a gripping story of the struggles and successes of an ordinary man in a precarious world and conjures a vivid picture of medieval life as we have never seen it before. An enlightening history that argues that these times weren t so dark after all, The Light Ages shows how medieval ideas continue to color how we see the world today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F9rVDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Europe on a Shoestring (Europe on a Shoestring, 2nd ed)","description":"Lonely Planet's Discover Europe is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

It was first used to describe a group of radical patriots cooped up in Cadiz, refugees from the French invasion of 1808. In 1812 they drew up a constitution enshrining the sovereignty of the people which struck the very basis of the old monarchy and became the model for advanced democrats from St Petersburg to Naples. Universal male suffrage was established in Spain in 1890 - earlier than Britain. The imposition ofadvanced liberal institutions on a conservative society, both economically and socially backward, inevitably caused tensions, and these, Raymond Carr argues, explain much of modern Spanish history. His analysis, incorporating much new research, starts at the 'September Revolution' of 1868 and goes right up to the present day. In the 1970s and 80s the country suffered less from the violent social disruption experienced in previous decades, but - as always - Spain is beset with acute regional problems which become more pressing the longer they remain unsolved.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ckgyP_k0xjAC&dq=Modern+Spain,+1875-1980+(Opus)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rebound to Better Health","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"What Are They Teaching Our Children","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ozZx3o8G3-wC&dq=What+Are+They+Teaching+Our+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Golden swords and pots and pans","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Uncle Wiggily in the Country","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Arithmetic 5-8 Concept Cards","description":"Support third-grade students with 180 daily practice activities to build their mathematical fluency.

Since the late 1960s, a legendary cadre of artists including the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen, Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles, Black Sabbath, and the Who has revolutionized popular culture and the sounds of our lives. While their songs still get airtime and some of these bands continue to tour, its idols are leaving the stage permanently. Can classic rock remain relevant as these legends die off, or will this major musical subculture fade away as many have before, Steven Hyden asks. In this mix of personal memoir, criticism, and journalism, Hyden stands witness as classic rock reaches the precipice. Traveling to the eclectic places where geriatric rockers are still making music, he talks to the artists and fans who have aged with them, explores the ways that classic rock has changed the culture, investigates the rise and fall of classic rock radio, and turns to live bootlegs, tell-all rock biographies, and even the liner notes of rock s greatest masterpieces to tell the story of what this music meant, and how it will be remembered, for fans like himself. Twilight of the Gods is also Hyden s story. Celebrating his love of this incredible music that has taken him from adolescence to fatherhood, he ponders two essential questions: Is it time to give up on his childhood heroes, or can this music teach him about growing old with his hopes and dreams intact? And what can we all learn from rock gods and their music are they ephemeral or eternal?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zJElDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Escape to Prosperity","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lucky to Be a Yankee","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1M5fnQEACAAJ&dq=Lucky+to+Be+a+Yankee&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came in from the Sea (Florida Historical Fiction for Youth)","description":"Fourteen-year old Frank Hollahan moves to Florida in 1943, at the height of World War II, to join his father, a navy seaman.

In his new school, his tendency toward exaggeration quickly builds him a reputation as a teller of tales. He wanders to the beach one night and sees what seems to be a man coming ashore from a submarine. When he informs his family, friends, and teachers that he saw a spy from a German U-boat land on the local beach, no one believes him. Is the spy real, or is he only a part of Frank's imagination and exaggeration? Frank is certain the spy has plans for sabotage. With the aid of Rosemarie Twekenberry, who has eyes only for Frank, and a mysterious beach recluse known as Weird Wanda, Frank sets out to prove the spy's existence. With time running out, Frank must figure out a way to stop him. Each rumor and discovery whether a buried chest, a secret code, or a mysterious note presents new problems.

Leon Higginbotham, Jr. A winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, he has distinguished himself over the decades both as a professor at Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard, and as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals. But Judge Higginbotham is perhaps best known as an authority on racism in America: not the least important achievement of his long career has been In the Matter of Color, the first volume in a monumental history of race and the American legal process. Published in 1978, this brilliant book has been hailed as the definitive account of racism, slavery, and the law in colonial America. Now, after twenty years, comes the long-awaited sequel. In Shades of Freedom, Higginbotham provides a magisterial account of the interaction between the law and racial oppression in America from colonial times to the present, demonstrating how the one agent that should have guaranteed equal treatment before the law--the judicial system--instead played a dominant role in enforcing the inferior position of blacks. The issue of racial inferiority is central to this volume, as Higginbotham documents how early white perceptions of black inferiority slowly became codified into law. Perhaps the most powerful and insightful writing centers on a pair of famous Supreme Court cases, which Higginbotham uses to portray race relations at two vital moments in our history. The Dred Scott decision of 1857 declared that a slave who had escaped to free territory must be returned to his slave owner. Chief Justice Roger Taney, in his notorious opinion for the majority, stated that blacks were \\"so inferior that they had no right which the white man was bound to respect.\\" For Higginbotham, Taney's decision reflects the extreme state that race relations had reached just before the Civil War. And after the War and Reconstruction, Higginbotham reveals, the Courts showed a pervasive reluctance (if not hostility) toward the goal of full and equal justice for African Americans, and this was particularly true of the Supreme Court. And in the Plessy v. Ferguson decision, which Higginbotham terms \\"one of the most catastrophic racial decisions ever rendered,\\" the Court held that full equality--in schooling or housing, for instance--was unnecessary as long as there were \\"separate but equal\\" facilities. Higginbotham also documents the eloquent voices that opposed the openly racist workings of the judicial system, from Reconstruction Congressman John R. Lynch to Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan to W. E. B. Du Bois, and he shows that, ironically, it was the conservative Supreme Court of the 1930s that began the attack on school segregation, and overturned the convictions of African Americans in the famous Scottsboro case. But today racial bias still dominates the nation, Higginbotham concludes, as he shows how in six recent court cases the public perception of black inferiority continues to persist. In Shades of Freedom, a noted scholar and celebrated jurist offers a work of magnificent scope, insight, and passion. Ranging from the earliest colonial times to the present, it is a superb work of history--and a mirror to the American soul.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NM_rf6TndMsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life of Richard Wagner","description":"Best known for the challenging four-opera cycle The Ring of the Nibelung, Richard Wagner (181383) was a conductor, librettist, theater director, and essayist, in addition to being the composer of some of the most enduring operatic works in history, such as The Flying Dutchman, Tannh?user, and Tristan and Isolde. Though his influence on the development of European music is indisputable, Wagner was also quite outspoken on the politics and culture of his time. His ideas traveled beyond musical circles into philosophy, literature, theater staging, and the visual arts. To befit such a dynamic figure, acclaimed biographer Martin Geck offers here a Wagner biography unlike any other, one that strikes a unique balance between the technical musical aspects of Wagner s compositions and his overarching understanding of aesthetics. Wagner has always inspired passionate admirers as well as numerous detractors, with the result that he has achieved a mythical stature nearly equal to that of the Valkyries and Viking heroes he popularized. There are few, if any, scholars today who know more about Wagner and his legacy than Geck, who builds upon his extensive research and considerable knowledge as one of the editors of the Complete Works to offer a distinctive appraisal of the composer and the operas. Using a wide range of sources, from contemporary scholars to the composer s own words, Geck explores key ideas in Wagner s life and works, while always keeping the music in the foreground.

Edith and Frederick Farrell. Bachelard uses his extensive knowledge of the poetry of Poe, Blake, Shelley, and Nietzsche to amplify the images of the airy elements. THE BACHELARD TRANSLATIONS are the inspiration of Joanne H. Stroud, Director of Publications for The Dallas Institute of Humanities and Culture, who in 1981 contracted with Jose Corti to publish in English the untranslated works of Bachelard on the imagination. Gaston Bachelard is acclaimed as one of the most significant modern French thinkers. From 1929 to 1962 he authored twenty-three books addressing his dual concerns, the philosophy of science and the analysis of the imagination of matter. The influence of his thought can be felt in all disciplines of the humanities - art, architecture, literature, language, poetics, philosophy, and depth psychology. His teaching career included posts at the College de Bar-sur-Aube, the University of Dijon, and from 1940 to 1962 the chair of history and philosophy of science at the Sorbonne. One of the amphitheaters of the Sorbonne is called \\"L'Amphi Gaston Bachelard,\\" an honor Bachelard shared with Descartes and Richelieu. He received the Grand Prix National Lettres in 1961-one of only three philosophers ever to have achieved this honor. The influence of his thought can be felt in all disciplines of the humanities-art, architecture, literature, poetics, psychology, philosophy, and language.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bKzvPgAACAAJ&dq=Water+and+Dreams:+An+Essay+on+the+Imagination+of+Matter+(Bachelard+Translation+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moonflower Child","description":"When the sun sets, the night comes alive.

Li, however, has delivered more than a straight thriller here, especially in the parts that depict the despair Will and his pals feel at being displaced, overlooked, underestimated and discriminated against. This is as much a novel as a reckoning.\\"  New York Times Book Review Ocean's Eleven meets The Farewell in Portrait of a Thief, a lush, lyrical heist novel inspired by the true story of Chinese art vanishing from Western museums; about diaspora, the colonization of art, and the complexity of the Chinese American identity. History is told by the conquerors. Across the Western world, museums display the spoils of war, of conquest, of colonialism: priceless pieces of art looted from other countries, kept even now. Will Chen plans to steal them back. A senior at Harvard, Will fits comfortably in his carefully curated roles: a perfect student, an art history major and sometimes artist, the eldest son who has always been his parents' American Dream. But when a mysterious Chinese benefactor reaches out with an impossible and illegal job offer, Will finds himself something else as well: the leader of a heist to steal back five priceless Chinese sculptures, looted from Beijing centuries ago. His crew is every heist archetype one can imag-ine or at least, the closest he can get. A con artist: Irene Chen, a public policy major at Duke who can talk her way out of anything. A thief: Daniel Liang, a premed student with steady hands just as capable of lockpicking as suturing. A getaway driver: Lily Wu, an engineering major who races cars in her free time. A hacker: Alex Huang, an MIT dropout turned Silicon Valley software engineer. Each member of his crew has their own complicated relationship with China and the identity they've cultivated as Chinese Americans, but when Will asks, none of them can turn him down. Because if they succeed? They earn fifty million dollars and a chance to make history. But if they fail, it will mean not just the loss of everything they've dreamed for themselves but yet another thwarted at-tempt to take back what colonialism has stolen. Equal parts beautiful, thoughtful, and thrilling, Portrait of a Thief is a cultural heist and an examination of Chinese American identity, as well as a necessary cri-tique of the lingering effects of colonialism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U_E3EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Johnny Under Ground","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tLgmwQEACAAJ&dq=Johnny+Under+Ground&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crazy Quilt Circus Pony: The Story of a Piebald Pony","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Tris Speaker: The Rough-and-Tumble Life of a Baseball Legend","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Much prayer--much power!: Including a chapter on \\"How to conduct prayer meetings\\"","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R3l6tAEACAAJ&dq=Much+prayer--much+power!:+Including+a+chapter+on+%22How+to+conduct+prayer+meetings%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Growing Up Female in Nazi Germany (Social History, Popular Culture, and Politics in Germany)","description":"Growing Up Female in Nazi Germany explores the world of the Bund Deutscher M?del (BDM), the female section within the Hitler Youth that included almost all German girls aged 10 to 14. The BDM is often enveloped in myths; German girls were brought up to be the compliant handmaidens of National Socialism, their mental horizon restricted to the \\"three Ks\\" of Kinder, K che, Kirche (children, kitchen, and church). Dagmar Reese, however, depicts another picture of life in the BDM. She explores how and in what way the National Socialists were successful in linking up with the interests of contemporary girls and young women and providing them a social life of their own. The girls in the BDM found latitude for their own development while taking on responsibilities that integrated them within the folds of the National Socialist state. \\"At last available in English, this pioneering study provides fresh insights into the ways in which the Nazi regime changed young 'Aryan' women's lives through appeals to female self-esteem that were not obviously defined by Nazi ideology, but drove a wedge between parents and children. Thoughtful analysis of detailed interviews reveals the day-to-day functioning of the Third Reich in different social milieus and its impact on women's lives beyond 1945. A must-read for anyone interested in the gendered dynamics of Nazi modernity and the lack of sustained opposition to National Socialism.\\" --Uta Poiger, University of Washington \\"In this highly readable translation, Reese provocatively identifies Nazi girls league members' surprisingly positive memories and reveals significant implications for the functioning of Nazi society.

From a daring Confederate raid that nearly seized Washington, D.C., to a stunning reversal on the bloody fields of Cedar Creek, the summer and autumn of 1864 witnessed some of the fiercest fighting of our Civil War in mighty battles now all but forgotten. The desperate struggle for mastery of Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, breadbasket of the Confederacy and the South's key invasion route into the North, pitted a remarkable cast of heroes in blue and gray against each other: runty, rough-hewn Phillip Sheridan, a Union general with an uncanny gift for inspiring soldiers, and Jubal Early, his Confederate counterpart, stubborn, raw-mouthed and deadly; the dashing Yankee boy-general, George Armstrong Custer, and the brilliant, courageous John Brown Gordon, a charismatic Georgian who lived one of the era's greatest love stories. From hungry, hard-bitten Rebel privates to a pair of Union officers destined to become presidents, from a neglected hero who saved our nation's capital and went on to write one of his century's greatest novels, to doomed Confederate leaders of incomparable valor, Ralph Peters brings to life yesteryear's giants and their breathtaking battles with the same authenticity, skill and insight he offered readers in his prize-winning Civil War bestsellers, Cain at Gettysburg and Hell or Richmond.

A remarkable story by a remarkable woman' Irish Times 'Always inspirational' National Women's Council of Ireland @NWCI 'Fiona Doyle is a hero' Roisin Ingle @roisiningle 'Well worth reading' Colette Fitzpatrick, MidWeek, TV3 Too Many Tears is the moving and inspiring story of how Fiona Doyle came through the agony and humiliation of being sexually abused by her father, how she foudn the strength to seek justice, and how she coped when, at the final hurdle, it appeared that he was about to escape prison. For as long as she can remember, and well into her teens, Fiona's father raped and abused her. Her mother blamed Fiona for leading him on. The effects on her life were catastrophic. Fiona first reported her father, Patrick O'Brien, to the authorities in the early nineties but the police investigation went nowhere. She made a second complaint in 2010 and this time, it appeared, O'Brien would face the consequences of his crimes . He, pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting his daughter and Fiona assumed the next time she came to court, he would be going to jail. Instead, shockingly, having suspended nine years of a twelve-year sentence, the judge released O'Brien on bail. Three days later, following a national outcry and questions in parliament, the presiding judge expressed his 'profound regret' to Fiona Doyle and sent O'Brien to jail. Too Many Tears is Fiona Doyle's story of abuse and its aftermath - the turmoil and isolation she experienced as a child and young girl, the devastating price she continued to pay in her adult life, and how finally she had the courage and tenacity to take on her father - and the authorities - to make him face up to what he had done.

And more than the weapon itself, it was the sword's metal fittings that reflected the complexities of samurai life, from codes of honor to flamboyant leisure - and that remain among the most sophisticated and accomplished metalwork ever created. Lethal Elegance presents 150 of these remarkable sword fittings, and is one of the few books in a Western language to focus on their styles and techniques. It discusses the visual effects achieved with different alloys, the evolution of fittings following changes in warfare, the symbolism of motifs, and standards for connoisseurship. Nearly all these fittings were once owned by trained swordsmen, and the weapons they ornamented could surely inflict fatal wounds. But their extraordinary variety and beauty also reveal them as wonders of self-expression and personal style.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mx7rAAAAMAAJ&dq=Lethal+Elegance:+Samurai+Sword+Fittings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mississippi run","description":"From Jay Feldmen comes an enlightening work about how the most powerful earthquakes in the history of America united the Indians in one last desperate rebellion, reversed the Mississippi River, revealed a seamy murder in the Jefferson family, and altered the course of the War of 1812. On December 15, 1811, two of Thomas Jefferson's nephews murdered a slave in cold blood and put his body parts into a roaring fire. The evidence would have been destroyed but for a rare act of God or, as some believed, of the Indian chief Tecumseh. That same day, the Mississippi River's first steamboat, piloted by Nicholas Roosevelt, powered itself toward New Orleans on its maiden voyage. The sky grew hazy and red, and jolts of electricity flashed in the air. A prophecy by Tecumseh was about to be fulfilled. He had warned reluctant warrior-tribes that he would stamp his feet and bring down their houses. Sure enough, between December 16, 1811, and late April 1812, a catastrophic series of earthquakes shook the Mississippi River Valley. Of the more than 2,000 tremors that rumbled across the land during this time, three would have measured nearly or greater than 8.0 on the not-yet-devised Richter Scale. Centered in what is now the bootheel region of Missouri, the New Madrid earthquakes were felt as far away as Canada; New York; New Orleans; Washington, DC; and the western part of the Missouri River. A million and a half square miles were affected as the earth's surface remained in a state of constant motion for nearly four months. Towns were destroyed, an eighteen-mile-long by five-mile-wide lake was created, and even the Mississippi River temporarily ran backwards. The quakes uncovered Jefferson's nephews' cruelty and changed the course of the War of 1812 as well as the future of the new republic. In When the Mississippi Ran Backwards, Jay Feldman expertly weaves together the story of the slave murder, the steamboat, Tecumseh, and the war, and brings a forgotten period back to vivid life. Tecumseh's widely believed prophecy, seemingly fulfilled, hastened an unprecedented alliance among southern and northern tribes, who joined the British in a disastrous fight against the U.S. government. By the end of the war, the continental United States was secure against Britain, France, and Spain; the Indians had lost many lives and much land; and Jefferson's nephews were exposed as murderers. The steamboat, which survived the earthquake, was sunk. When the Mississippi Ran Backwards sheds light on this now-obscure yet pivotal period between the Revolutionary and Civil wars, uncovering the era's dramatic geophysical, political, and military upheavals. Feldman paints a vivid picture of how these powerful earthquakes made an impact on every aspect of frontier life and why similar catastrophic quakes are guaranteed to recur. When the Mississippi Ran Backwards is popular history at its best.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OB75l5upMJQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Things You Either Hate or Love","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Apocalypse Movies","description":"Vivid images of the apocalypse proliferate throughout contemporary cinema, which pictures the death of civilization in wildly different ways.

Covering pivotal films from the silent era to the present day, including Metropolis, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Dr. Strangelove, Contagion, and Avengers: Endgame, Stephen Prince explores how these dark visions are rooted in religious and prophetic traditions, and he considers how our love for apocalypse cinema is tied to fundamental existential questions and anxieties that never go out of fashion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jIkpEAAAQBAJ&dq=Apocalypse+Movies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going Away","description":"National Book Award Finalist: This autobiographical road-trip novel exploring life and politics in the 1950s became  an underground bestseller  (The Village Voice). The year is 1956, and a blacklisted Hollywood agent sets off on a cross-country adventure from Los Angeles to New York City. Along the way stopping at bars, all-night restaurants, and gas stations the twenty-nine-year-old narrator, at once egotistical and compassionate, barrels across the  blue highways  to meet, fight with, love, and hate old comrades and girlfriends, collecting their stories and reflecting on his own life experiences. Driven by probing stream-of-consciousness prose and brutally honest self-analysis, Going Away is a sprawling autobiographical journey into a kaleidoscope of American mindsets; most significantly, that of its radical narrator. Crammed with acute social and political observations, this urgent novel captures the spirit of its times, so remarkably like that of today. An odyssey in the spirit of Jack Kerouac s On the Road, Going Away is  a novel of major importance. There hasn t been anything like it since TheGrapes of Wrath  (San Francisco Chronicle).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RZIVAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A short history of technology from the earliest times to A.D. 1900,","description":"Highly readable, profusely illustrated survey relates technology to history of every age: food production, metalworking, mining, steam power, transportation, electricity, and much more. 354 black-and-white illustrations. 1961 edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mf88HKKYEbQC&dq=A+short+history+of+technology+from+the+earliest+times+to+A.D.+1900,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The reign of Jesus through Mary","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Book of Legends: Hallowed Ground","description":"THE BOOK OF LEGENDS: HALLOWED GROUND is a tale of adventure and mystery set in the far-flung future, or perhaps a long-forgotten past, with swordplay and sorcery traveling hand-in-hand with romance and intrigue. wandering shaman, the Shepherd, appears, and soon gains control of the throne.

At the completion of his arduous 6,000-mile journey, he was feted by Thomas Jefferson, presented to Napoleon and, after the publication of his findings, hailed as the greatest scientific genius of his age. Humboldt s Cosmos tells the story of this extraordinary man who was equal parts Einstein and Livingstone, and of the adventure that defined his life. Gerard Helferich vividly recounts Humboldt s expedition through the Amazon, over the Andes, and across Mexico and Cuba, highlighting his paradigm-changing discoveries along the way. During the course of the expedition, Humboldt cataloged more than 60,000 plants, set an altitude record climbing the volcano Chimborazo, and introduced millions of Europeans and Americans to the great cultures of the Inca and the Aztecs. In the process, he also revolutionized geology and laid the groundwork for modern sciences such as climatology, oceanography, and geography. His contributions would profoundly influence future greats such as Charles Darwin and shape the course of science for centuries to come.

Spanning one thousand years of historiography in England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland, the essays map historical thinking across literary genres and expose the rich veins of national mythmaking tapped into by medieval writers. Additionally, they attend to the ways in which medieval histories crossed linguistic and geographical borders. Together, they trace multiple temporalities and productive anachronisms that fuelled some of the most innovative medieval writing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dJgjEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forty Years Behind The Lid","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OjzRPwAACAAJ&dq=Forty+Years+Behind+The+Lid&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The master's violin,","description":"Reproduction of the original: The Master ?s Violin by Myrtle Reed","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XuhaDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+master%27s+violin,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Psychology of Early Sufi Sam\`: Listening and Altered States (Routledge Sufi Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Gardener's Labyrinth: Portraits of People, Plants and Places","description":"Includes chapters on gardeners and others associated with gardening.

This case-study approach based on years of immersion in the killers' diaries, confessions, psychiatric interviews, statements to the press, videotapes, and photographs  led the way in defining serial and mass murders not as the acts of alien creatures with deranged minds but rather as personalized protests by alienated men against the society that they believe has excluded them. Leyton also provides an analysis of the Washington, D.C. sniper case. While uncovering the central themes of modern culture that motivated their deeds, Leyton provides vivid and chilling portraits of Edmund Kemper, Ted Bundy, Albert DeSalvo, and David Berkowitz, serial murderers whose prolonged killing campaigns provided them revenge against the world and celebrity careers; and other mass murderers whose brief but horrific murder sprees constituted their own enigmatic suicide notes. The author shows that the motives of multiple murderers are not simply sexual or psychotic; but rise from the very core of American mass culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=esbEswEACAAJ&dq=Hunting+Humans+:+The+Rise+of+the+Modern+Multiple+Murderer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A DISTANT CHALLANGE The U.S. Infantryman in Vietnam, 1967-1972","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YUJz09p6tF4C&dq=A+DISTANT+CHALLANGE+The+U.S.+Infantryman+in+Vietnam,+1967-1972&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sound of Music: The Making of America's Favorite Movie","description":"The Sound of Music is a classic film cherished in the hearts of millions.

The United States has had twelve systemic banking crises since 1840, while Canada has had none. The banking systems of Mexico and Brazil have not only been crisis prone but have provided miniscule amounts of credit to business enterprises and households. Analyzing the political and banking history of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil through several centuries, Fragile by Design demonstrates that chronic banking crises and scarce credit are not accidents due to unforeseen circumstances. Rather, these fluctuations result from the complex bargains made between politicians, bankers, bank shareholders, depositors, debtors, and taxpayers. The well-being of banking systems depends on the abilities of political institutions to balance and limit how coalitions of these various groups influence government regulations. Fragile by Design is a revealing exploration of the ways that politics inevitably intrudes into bank regulation. Charles Calomiris and Stephen Haber combine political history and economics to examine how coalitions of politicians, bankers, and other interest groups form, why some endure while others are undermined, and how they generate policies that determine who gets to be a banker, who has access to credit, and who pays for bank bailouts and rescues.\\"--Publisher's description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XW2YDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+history+of+banks+(Reprints+of+economics+classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The House of Dolls","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

If you are a Jehovah s Witness, no doubt you have a deep love for the truth. Chances are, you would also agree that  no matter how much Bible reading we have done, we would never have learned the truth on our own  (The Watchtower, December 1, 1990, p. 19). Most of what you know about Jehovah God and his Word you learned from the  faithful and discreet slave class.  This is why you go door to door: to share what you have learned with others. But isn t it possible that some of the Watchtower Society s teachings could be wrong? After all, they ve been wrong in the past. Wasn t C. T. Russell wrong when he expected to be taken to heaven in 1914? Wasn t J. F. Rutherford wrong when he predicted that men like Moses and David would soon be resurrected and live in the Watchtower s mansion in San Diego? And isn t it possible that N. H. Knorr and F. W. Franz were wrong in saying that the generation of 1914 would live to see the end of this wicked system of things? If  God s organization  was wrong about these things, shouldn t we consider the possibility that they are still wrong about other, more important doctrines as well? Why is it, then, that most Witnesses will never question the Society s teachings, even when they  teach commands of men as doctrines  (Matthew 15:9)? What gives them this kind of authority? As you know, their claim to authority rests entirely on their interpretation of Jesus  parable of the  faithful and discreet slave :  Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics, to give them their food at the proper time? Happy is that slave if his master on arriving finds him doing so. Truly I say to you, He will appoint him over all his belongings  (Matthew 24:45-47). They believe this text makes them God s channel for providing spiritual food to his people.  In 1919 that slave was identified as the remnant of anointed Christians. Since then, as represented by the Governing Body of Jehovah s Witnesses, it has been the center of theocracy on earth  (The Watchtower, January 15, 1994, p. 16). Since so much rests on this passage, it is only right that we examine just what Jesus meant in this parable. The Society insists that Jesus was speaking not of individuals, but of a group of people who are members of an organization. The problem is, in Luke s account, Jesus specifically applies the parable to individuals.  Indeed, everyone to whom much was given, much will be demanded of him; and the one whom people put in charge of much, they will demand more than usual of him  (Luke 12:48). The parable has to do with Christian stewardship. In fact, it follows the same pattern as the parable of the talents (Matthew 25:14-30) or minas (Luke 19:12-27). A master departs, leaving work for his slaves. When he returns, he evaluates their faithfulness and rewards or punishes them accordingly. It s interesting that the Society applies these parables to individuals, while applying the  faithful and discreet slave  parable (Matthew 24:45-51) to an organization. Their interpretation is inconsistent. This teaching on the faithful stewardship of individuals is reflected elsewhere in Scripture.  In proportion as each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God s undeserved kindness expressed in various ways  (1 Peter 4:10).  Let a man so appraise us as being subordinates of Christ and stewards of sacred secrets of God. Besides, in this case, what is looked for in stewards is for a man to be found faithful  (1 Corinthians 4:1, 2). Can you say that Jesus is your Master? If so, think about what it says of your stewardship when you accept the Watchtower s teachings without question, knowing that the Bible never approves of such a practice. Have you noticed that the Society often encourages others to examine their religion, but discourages you from doing the same? How ironic that the Society s first president, C. T. Russell, wrote:  If any one knows anything better, let him take it. If any of you ever find anything better, we hope you will tell us  (The Watchtower, December 1, 1990, p.19). We think we have something better! We encourage you to compare the teachings of the Watchtower Society with those of solid evangelical Christians. Otherwise, how will you know you ve really been feeding on the best spiritual food? As a suggestion, start by reading a book (like Systematic Theology by Wayne Grudem) which examines the biblical basis for the different views of all the major doctrines. We pray that Jehovah will guide you as you seek to be a faithful slave of our Lord, Jesus Christ.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-KCasfC9Lo4C&dq=The+War+Within:+Gaining+Victory+in+the+Battle+for+Sexual+Purity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Renaissance to Rococo: Masterpieces from The Collection of the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Retrospect: An Anecdotal History of Sullivan County, New York","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EfEKAAAACAAJ&dq=Retrospect:+An+Anecdotal+History+of+Sullivan+County,+New+York&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Person/Planet: The Creative Disintegration of Industrial Society","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nxwwAAAAMAAJ&dq=Person/Planet:+The+Creative+Disintegration+of+Industrial+Society&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Concept Of Law","description":"The Concept of Law is one of the most influential texts in English-language jurisprudence. 50 years after its first publication its relevance has not diminished and in this third edition, Leslie Green adds an introduction that places the book in a contemporary context, highlighting key questions about Hart's arguments and outlining the main debates it has prompted in the field.

Many books have been written on Chinese porcelain as an exotic import from Asia, but this book tells the history of the Central European reinvention and mass production of the material. Porcelain was first invented in medieval China, but the evolution of what its first producers called \\"white gold\\" was set in motion by Saxon king Augustus the Strong. Augustus obsessed over owning a personal alchemist, Johann B?ttger, whom he imprisoned in his castle, first to make gold, and when that failed, to make porcelain. Trained in chemistry by an apothecary, B?ttger took advantage of the king's obsession with porcelain and eventually produced the first European ceramic vessels whose delicacy and strength resembled those of Asian imports. Augustus funded the creation of a Saxon royal manufactory, which became the famous Meissen factory, and which to this day stands for the highest quality in porcelain. By the time of B?ttger's death in 1719, Meissen porcelain had become famous throughout Europe and the world, its wares in high demand by other monarchs and aristocratic consumers. Soon after the porcelain maker's death, his secret recipe was stolen, and dozens of Central European princes opened their own manufactories. Here, author Suzanne L. Marchand shows how the story of European porcelain is an intertwined history of the mercantile state policy that built these factories, the luxury trades that sustained them, the debates about what counted as \\"art,\\" and the changes in consumer and material culture driving the business. Throughout the eighteenth century, porcelain production was an industry of competitive, mercantile production under royal ownership. By 1850, however, after only a few state-backed firms survived the financial crises of 1815-1830, the Central European porcelain industry had become the domain of mass producers and trademark forgers. Marchand then traces the story of Central European porcelain into the twentieth century, exploring the new challenges of cartelization, the rise of Japanese and Czech competition, and the impact of the two world wars, following several porcelain firms through the Nazi era and the Russian seizures of companies in the German East. At each point, Marchand uses the history of porcelain to link the businesses, and the states that helped sustain them, to the broader history of culture and consumption\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b-HFDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Story+of+Porcelain+(First+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Myth of the Great War: A New Military History of World War I","description":"Based on previously unused French and German sources, this challenging and controversial new analysis of the war on the Western front from 1914 to 1918 reveals how and why the Germans won the major battles with one-half to one-third fewer casualties than the Allies, and how American troops in 1918 saved the Allies from defeat and a negotiated peace with the Germans.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xt4ki0fgmDUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Listen & Learn Modern Greek (Dover's Listen and Learn Series)","description":" A memorable experience.

Soloveitchik, the rabbi known as  The Rav  by his followers worldwide, was a leading authority on the meaning of Jewish law and prominent force in building bridges between traditional Orthodox Judaism and the modern world. In THE LONELY MAN OF FAITH, a soaring, eloquent essay first published in Tradition magazine in 1965, Soloveitchik investigates the essential loneliness of the person of faith in our narcissistic, materially oriented, utilitarian society. In this modern classic, Soloveitchik uses the story of Adam and Eve as a springboard, interweaving insights from such important Western philosophers as Kierkegaard and Kant with innovative readings of Genesis to provide guidance for the faithful in today s world. He explains prayer as  the harbinger of moral reformation,  and discusses with empathy and understanding the despair and exasperation of individuals who seek personal redemption through direct knowledge of a God who seems remote and unapproachable. He shows that while the faithful may become members of a religious community, their true home is  the abode of loneliness.  In a moving personal testimony, Soloveitchik demonstrates a deep-seated commitment, intellectual courage, and integrity that people of all religions will respond to.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cA89WQYyNCcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Box Of Crocheted Hats And Scarves","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Out of the Black Shadows: The Amazing Transformation of Stephen Lungu","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Power, Morals, and Founding Fathers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vnFZMQEACAAJ&dq=Power,+Morals,+and+Founding+Fathers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Honda Prelude 1979 Through 1989: All Models (Haynes Manuals)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Open Immediately: Straight Talk on Direct Mail Fundraising : What Works, What Doesn'T, and Why","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J4y9m4eSnbsC&dq=Open+Immediately:+Straight+Talk+on+Direct+Mail+Fundraising+:+What+Works,+What+Doesn%27T,+and+Why&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Animation Book","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"511 THINGS ONLY WOMEN UNDERSTAND","description":"Men just don't get it.

Yet, God intended that Christians be enriched by its enduring message. Even though Revelation has a blessing for those who read it, many believers still avoid this inspired book. Could one reason be they have been taught that most of Revelation does not apply to the Church? In this first volume of The End Time Apologetics Series, the author challenges the pretribulation rapture position and uncovers how many Christians may not be prepared for prophetic events to come. Although many promote pre-trib as a fact, in reality it's a \\"theory\\" that gained traction in America in the 19th century. Further popularized after being published in an immensely popular reference bible, pre-trib quickly became the preferred rapture position. As we witness the fulfillment of prophetic events around the world, the real question is \\"What happens if the pre-trib rapture theory is wrong?\\" What happens if the Church is not gone before the events of Revelation starts? Do modern-day Christians have the courage to deal with that possibility? In this powerful book, discover how facts concerning the Antichrist, Angels, and the Abyss, disprove major tenets of the pretribulation rapture theory. This book also includes actual correspondence between the author and the late great Dispensational pillars John Walvoord and J. Dwight Pentecost, who makes some surprising admissions about \\"the restrainer\\" of Second Thessalonians. All Christians should have their hearts attuned to what the Scriptures teach as opposed to placing their trust in theoretical positions. After reading this book, you will have a renewed perspective on how the book of Revelation applies to the Church and the glorious future for those who remain faithful until the end.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1vKSzQEACAAJ&dq=Revolution+of+the+End-Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mrs. Tim carries on","description":"There is so much War News in News Bulletins, in Newspapers, and so much talk about the war that I do not intend to write about it in my diary. Indeed my diary is a sort of escape from the war . . . though it is almost impossible to escape from the anxieties which it brings. Bestselling author D.E. Stevenson's charming fictional alter-ego, Hester Christie--or \\"Mrs. Tim\\" as she is affectionately known to friends of her military husband--was first introduced to readers in Mrs. Tim of the Regiment, published in 1932. In 1941, Stevenson brought Mrs. Tim back in this delightful sequel, to lift spirits and boost morale in the early days of World War II. With her husband stationed in France, Hester finds plenty to keep her busy on the Home Front. From her first air raid and a harrowing but hilarious false alarm about a German invasion, to volunteering at the regiment's \\"Comforts Depot,\\" guiding the romantic destinies of her pretty houseguest and an injured soldier, and making a flying visit to a blacked-out, slightly bedraggled London with its fighting spirit intact, Mrs. Tim does indeed carry on--in inimitable style. Mrs. Tim returns in two subsequent novels, Mrs Tim Gets a Job (1947) and Mrs Tim Flies Home (1952), all back in print for the first time in decades from Furrowed Middlebrow and Dean Street Press. This new edition features an introduction by Alexander McCall Smith. \\"She admirably preserves her lightness of touch, with a tinge of melancholy added, which perfectly suits the mood of 1940.\\" Glasgow Herald \\"This is not merely a war book to which cheerfulness keeps breaking in, it is a book of cheerfulness from which the war cannot be kept out . . .

Even though national systems have inherited different institutional arrangements and trajectories, analyses show three major converging trends in their public policies. There has been a retraction from support to large firms and programmes and a shift toward small to medium enterprises and the innovation infrastructure; the focus on public research and training capabilities is growing; and there has been a redesign of public intervention with the growing role of regions and states on one hand and multinational authorities on the other, particularly in the European Union.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fNUvQVGLjT8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Laughter in the dark,","description":"Albinus, a respectable, middle-aged man and aspiring filmmaker, abandons his wife for a lover half his age: Margot, who wants to become a movie star herself.

Each attained absolute power, and misused it in a gargantuan fashion, leaving in his wake a trail of hatred, devastation, and death.In A Brotherhood of Tyrants, D. Jablow Hershman and Julian Lieb uncover manic depression as a hidden cause of dictatorship, war, and mass killing. In comparing these three tyrants, they describe a number of behavioral similarities supporting the contention that a specific psychiatric disorder - manic depression - can be one of the key factors in such political pathologies as tyranny and terrorism.Manic depressive disorder has also produced the great destroyers in history - when in addition to ambition and egotism have been added large measures of ruthlessness, willfulness, utter intolerance of criticism, a consuming need to dominate others, paranoia, and megalomania.Focusing on these three dictators, A Brotherhood of Tyrants argues that manic depression has always been, and continues to be, a critical factor in compelling some individuals to seek political power and to become tyrants. It powerfully demonstrates how this disorder is the source of many of the typical characteristics - including grandiosity and megalomania - of a tyrannical personality and provides a manual for the identification of the psychotic tyrant.In their epilogue, the authors outline the clinical signs of manic depression as described in the classic studies of the German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926). They apply these clinical signs and symptoms to the pathologies of four notorious mass killers of recent times: David Koresh, Jeffrey Dahmer, Jim Jones, and Colin Ferguson. They argue that if these individuals had been identified in time as manic depressives, they could have been successfully treated, and hundreds of innocent lives could have been saved.. . . fascinating material. . . -Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XRAE2_6UKdAC&dq=A+Brotherhood+of+Tyrants:+Manic+Depression+and+Absolute+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amy Girl","description":"Eight-year-old Amy Kaslov possesses the power to make people do things against their will, and someone must unlock the secret to that power to save the little orphan from destruction","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UmvYVheIQlEC&dq=Amy+Girl&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poiret Fashion Design Paper Dolls in Full Color","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mother of Purl: Friends, Fun, and Fabulous Designs at Hollywood's Knitting Circle","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"When Kids Kill: Shocking Crimes of Lost Innocence (Virgin True Crime)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Little Soul and the Sun: A Children's Parable Adapted from Conversations With God","description":"A parable from \\"Conversations with God, Book 1\\", this book helps readers remember the angel within us all, as it gracefully explains spiritual concepts to children.

Eighty years old, Ebenezer has lived his whole life on the Channel Island of Guernsey, a stony speck of a place caught between the coasts of England and France yet a world apart from either. Ebenezer himself is fiercely independent, but as he reaches the end of his life he is determined to tell his own story and the stories of those he has known. He writes of family secrets and feuds, unforgettable friendships and friendships betrayed, love glimpsed and lost. The Book of Ebenezer Le Page is a beautifully detailed chronicle of a life, but it is equally an oblique reckoning with the traumas of the twentieth century, as Ebenezer recalls both the men lost to the Great War and the German Occupation of Guernsey during World War II, and looks with despair at the encroachments of commerce and tourism on his beloved island. G. B. Edwards labored in obscurity all his life and completed The Book of Ebenezer Le Page shortly before his death. Published posthumously, the book is a triumph of the storyteller s art that conjures up the extraordinary voice of a living man.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_tTBAK0nADgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DR BLOODMONEY OR HOW WE GOT ALONG AFTER THE BOMB","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Mapping of the World: Early Printed World Maps 1472-1700","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mMAYAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Mapping+of+the+World:+Early+Printed+World+Maps+1472-1700&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God's Covenant for Your Family","description":"Eckhardt's previous series on prayer has sold more than half a million copies.

Pitenis There is a more complex society in middle school than one would ever believe. This story delves into the experiences of elementary school students from kindergarten to grade 8. The Rubber Band Wars is targeted for ages 10, 11 and 12, but appeals to all. The characters have been developed to reflect the various personalities found at school. There are six main characters that walk the readers through one month near the end of a school year. The book opens up with an accusation, as the opening line to the introduction states,  Korter started it.  Conflicts develop right from that moment as the reader is puzzled as to what sort of events had taken place. Meeker, the antagonist, starts the conflict as he relentlessly pesters Korter, the main character, and the conflict escalates from here. Tension develops between these two and the story deals with how Meeker and Korter recruit students to support their side, trying to prove the more support for either Meeker or Korter represents a win. Korter thought that by recruiting more people to support his efforts, Meeker would leave him alone. As tensions mounted, Meeker and Korter found a harmless method of annoying each other s team members. The choice of tools used to provoke each other was rubber bands, hence the title of this fast-paced story, The Rubber Band Wars. As the story unfolds, these characters create clubhouses to hold secret meetings during recess, safe from any spies sent from the other side. As the conflict progresses well into the story, there arises more twists in the story as the members in Korter s elite group separate and new members join and Meeker has his own share of troubles when the only information of Korter s next move is drenched in lemon juice and is nothing more than heaps of pulp on the floor. To make the story even more interesting, Korter despises substitute teachers and everyone knows it, and he will do anything to keep them away from his class, including his most famous pranks. As the month comes to a close, the conflict starts to resolve itself. Teachers finally get involved, and resolutions begin to diffuse the conflict. The story doesn t leave the reader hanging on to last words, however. The story offers how the characters end up in their lives and what they become as adults, and it proves that just because someone seems to be a particular type of person at the moment, it doesn t necessarily mean that is the way that person will be their entire life. This is a highly recommended story for young adults who have the same sense of adventure as the characters in this book. Angela Pitenis gives us an astoundingly original story that will change nearly everything you ever thought about middle school with a timeless tale, appealing to all young readers, this is a book that readers of children s fiction will treasure. It is a story that one can read over and over again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nrAfttKZ92kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What I believe, (To-day and to-morrow)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O4xCAAAAIAAJ&dq=What+I+believe,+(To-day+and+to-morrow)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bernard Spilsbury, his life and cases, (Penguin books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eitBzAEACAAJ&dq=Bernard+Spilsbury,+his+life+and+cases,+(Penguin+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Friday Nights of Nana","description":"Jennie helps her grandmother prepare for a family Sabbath celebration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6U4kAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Friday+Nights+of+Nana&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frugal Indulgents: How to Cultivate Decadence When Your Age and Salary Are Under 30","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Street scene,: A play in three acts,","description":"A slice of life in a poor neighborhood.

When Henry Tillotson comes back from the war with a mysterious new bride from Egypt, everyone is intrigued. But intrigue turns to outright confusion when his new wife retreats to her room and refuses to leave her bed, much less the house, stranding poor Henry in a loveless marriage. Antonia and Barbara are captivated by Henry and his lavish country estate, Cotteshaw, from the very first time they are asked to visit for a dinner party with their boyfriends. Drawn by his charm, his wife s madness and beauty, and his unusual lifestyle, they cannot help but be intrigued by their host. But as time passes, their relationships grow and change, bringing weddings, engagements, children, and even the occasional illicit liaison as the strange heritage of Cotteshaw begins to affect all who pass through its doors.

This book attempts to answer those questions. The author/compiler has spent 47 years investigating these problems and his conclusion is that severe unconscious bisexual conflict and confusion lie at the root of all mental illness, as difficult to comprehend as this idea may be. The book itself consists of 639 quotations, from a variety of sources, all of which point to the unshakable truth of this hypothesis. This is a fixed law of nature, unassailable and constantly operative in every case. No other species but man is afflicted with mental illness because no other species has either the intellectual power to repress their sexual feelings nor the motivation to do so. The disease we call schizophrenia is but an arbitrary name, which is used to designate the end-stage of a process beginning with a slight neurosis. The more severe the bisexual conflict and confusion in the individual, the more severe the degree of the mental illness which is experienced. Several other investigators in the past have reached this same conclusion, but unfortunately their wisdom went largely unheeded. Hopefully this book will remedy that ill-advised neglect.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-En5NhkohMIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Is Size Important?","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Power of a Praying Parent","description":"Offers insight and sample prayers for parents to recite on behalf of their children.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rcLaAQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Power+of+a+Praying+Parent&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"George Gershwin: A New Biography","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Johann Ludwig Bach: Motets (Recent Researches in the Music of the Baroque Era)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VpD7wAEACAAJ&dq=Johann+Ludwig+Bach:+Motets+(Recent+Researches+in+the+Music+of+the+Baroque+Era)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Film Actors Directory--1998: 4th Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bring 'em back alive,","description":"The intrepid Texas jungle adventurer Frank Buck spent his life capturing alive every kind of animal, and enthralled generations of readers with the stories of danger and daring collected here.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UNnhbq9gwTUC&dq=Bring+%27em+back+alive,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret Agenda: The United States Government, Nazi Scientists, and Project Paperclip, 1945 to 1990","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Disneys Treasury of Childrens Classics","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"My Big Book of Pictures and Words","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZP1LtVe8R_oC&dq=My+Big+Book+of+Pictures+and+Words&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Genesis Adult Magazine: May 1976","description":"Argues that recent archaeological findings verify an unbridgeable gap between modern man and the last \\"pre-man\\" creature and advocates divine intervention as the explanation for the \\"sudden appearance\\" of modern man","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WktyVKkXcs8C&dq=Genesis+Adult+Magazine:+May+1976&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Brontes: Three Great Novels","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Poetry","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Process Plants: A Handbook for Inherently Safer Design (Chemical Engineering)","description":"How far will an ounce of prevention really go?

In 1983, four self-described \\"knuckleheads\\" burst out of the mosh-pitted mosaic of the neo-punk rock scene in L.A. with their own unique brand of cosmic hardcore mayhem funk. Over twenty years later, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, against all odds, have become one of the most successful bands in the world. Though the band has gone through many incarnations, Anthony Kiedis, the group's lyricist and dynamic lead singer, has been there for the whole roller-coaster ride. In Scar Tissue, Kiedis delivers a compelling life story from a man \\"in love with everything\\" -- the darkness, the death, the disease. Even his descent into drug addiction was a part of that journey, another element transformed into art. Whether he's honoring the influence of the beautiful, strong women who have been his muses or remembering the roaring crowds of Woodstock and the Dalai Lama's humble compound, Kiedis shares a compelling story about the price of success and excess. Scar Tissue is a story of dedication and debauchery, of intrigue and integrity, of recklessness and redemption -- a story that could only have come out of the world of rock.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VUSZAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flying Home: and Other Stories","description":"These 13 stories by the author of The Invisible Man \\"approach the elegance of Chekhov\\" (Washington Post) and provide \\"early explorations of (Ellison's) lifelong fascination with the 'complex fate' and 'beautiful absurdity' of American identity\\" (John Callahan).

The tales in Too Beautiful for You, Rod Liddle s dazzling debut, sweep readers into the lives of characters whose sexual frustrations and deviant desires lead them to the very edge of acceptable behavior and sometimes way beyond. In a mischievous, macabre tale about a man who loses his arm in an accident on the way back from an assignation, Liddle shows just how far a husband will go to hide his infidelity from his wife. Another philandering husband, operating much closer to home, doesn t let fleeting pangs of guilt curtail his hunger for the sexual treats proffered by his mother-in-law. Bizarre happenings are not confined to the sexually adventuresome: one woman notices that her skin is hardening into a sort of insect carapace after she uses a depilatory gel; a suicide bomber is forced to acknowledge his abysmal failure as a terrorist when he tries to blow up a Jewish art gallery with a package of trout; and a man planning to jump out a window finds some of his colleagues all too ready to assist him. Liddle presents his panoply of misfits and miscreants without passing judgment. The passions they harbor and the acts they commit may be shocking and scandalous, but Liddle shows that these hapless men and women are not so very different from the rest of us. Sharp-witted, sexy, and psychologically astute, Too Beautiful for You breaks through literary and social taboos with style and humor, reminiscent of the early work of Martin Amis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-TZPh9QB1f0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Troy Chimneys","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fast Stocks/Fast Money: How to Make Money Investing in New Issues and Small Company Stocks","description":"\\"Fast Stocks/Fast Money\\" shares Natale's expertise on everything from buying and selling strategies and risk reduction to analyzing stock reading prospectuses, and working with brokers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1KJZAAAAYAAJ&dq=Fast+Stocks/Fast+Money:+How+to+Make+Money+Investing+in+New+Issues+and+Small+Company+Stocks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tarzan and the Leopard Men.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Engagement Calendar for the Year 1970 the 100th Anniversary of The Metropolitan Museum of Art","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NGOVjgEACAAJ&dq=Engagement+Calendar+for+the+Year+1970+the+100th+Anniversary+of+The+Metropolitan+Museum+of+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learning From the Tanya: Volume Two in the Definitive Commentary on the Moral and Mystical Teachings of a Classic Work of Kabbalah","description":"Understanding the Tanya guides the reader through one of the most extraordinary books of moral teachings ever written.

What sort of everyday rules-in-use do people play by when there are no fixed standards to explain why some succeed and others fail?

P. Thompson and Herbert Gutman, David Roediger s widely acclaimed book provides an original study of the formative years of working-class racism in the United States. This, he argues, cannot be explained simply with reference to economic advantage; rather, white working-class racism is underpinned by a complex series of psychological and ideological mechanisms that reinforce racial stereotypes, and thus help to forge the identities of white workers in opposition to Blacks. In a new preface, Roediger reflects on the reception, influence, and critical response to The Wages of Whiteness, while Kathleen Cleaver s insightful introduction hails the importance of a work that has become a classic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SulOEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Wages+of+Whiteness:+Race+and+the+Making+of+the+American+Working+Class+(Haymarket+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Communes, 1860-1960: a Bibliography (Sects and Cults in America--Bibliographical Guides ; vol. 13 / Garland Reference Library of Social Science ; vol. 402","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Listen & Learn Swedish (Listen and Learn Series)","description":" A memorable experience.

She became a teacher not because she cared passionately about educating the young, but for the traveling opportunities the career provided. Aviva's best friend, Aisha, has visited her mother's family in Cairo on several occasions. When she's twenty-four, she decides to move to Egypt to live with them for a year or two. But there are problems from the beginning. When Aviva's roommate abandons her, the two friends become roommates, setting them up for some unforgettable exploits. Aviva and Aisha's worldly adventures range from hilarious to traumatic, taking them from Egypt to its neighbors and even farther east. Together, they suffer from culture shock that is worse the second year than the first. It comes from realizing that they've been desensitized to things that once stunned or saddened them-and causes them to question their own sanity. They get into and out of trouble, both at work and on vacation; learn new languages; and make friends and enemies along the way. One important lesson is reiterated everywhere they go-if they don't try to apply American logic, everything makes more sense!

In Taiwan that process evolved over more than three decades before leading to the formation of an opposition party under martial law in late September 1986 and the blossoming of full democracy in March 2000 when that opposition party replaced the ruling party. In Mainland China and Hong Kong, limited electoral competition has only evolved over the last fifteen years or so. This volume examines why and how limited electoral competition developed in Greater China. The editors use a typology and different concepts to analyse how the political centre in these three Chinese societies historically interacted with society and how different regime change took place. Their analysis attributes Taiwan's robust electoral competition under martial law to political breakthroughs in the political, ideological, economic, and organizational marketplaces. Without similar political breakthroughs in Mainland China and Hong Kong, their limited electoral processes are not likely to lead to the election of one or more opposition parties in Mainland China and the direct election of a Hong Kong governor and parliament. These two authoritarian regimes have adopted different institutions, or rules, to limit electoral competition. Moreover, different changes have been taking place in their political, ideological, economic, and organizational marketplaces than occurred in Taiwan. Therefore, whether these two Chinese societies can mimic the Taiwan democratization path remains problematic. Only the passage of time will reveal whether their limited electoral competitive processes can transform into full democracy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=upDNEYtw4uYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BEYOND TERROR (GHOSTWORLD 1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Cadet: The Adventures of a New World Pioneer in the 17th Century - A True Story","description":"In this groundbreaking book, theoretical physicist Dr. Vitalij Garber discusses the existence of a new \\"force field\\" related to the spiritual domain!

Offering the first extended look at pop masculinity as exhibited by boy bands, this volume links the evolving expressions of gender and sexuality in the boy band to wider economic and social changes that have resulted in new ways of representing what it is to be a man. The popularity of boy bands is unquestionable, and their contributions to popular music are significant, yet they have attracted relatively little study. This book fills that gap with chapters exploring the challenges of defining the boy band phenomenon, its origins and history from the 1940s to the present, the role of management and marketing, the performance of gender and sexuality, and the nature of fandom and fan agency. Throughout, the author illuminates the ways in which identity politics influence the production and consumption of pop music and shows how the mainstream pop of boy bands can both reinforce and subvert gender and class hierarchies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wQWQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Churchill: Visionary.

Today, Professor Veatch believes, the time may be ripe for a belated recognition that Aristotle is \\"a truly live option in philosophy.\\" The discussion begins with the Physics--for Aristotle, the discipline embracing all aspects of the natural world--and examines Aristotle's doctrine of categories and his celebrated \\"four causes.\\" Turning to the De Anima, Professor Veatch casts aside many errors of interpretation which have come about because of mistaken readings of the term soul and gives an intelligible account of Aristotle's psychology, seen within the context of his system as a whole. Next, the varieties of human achievement are surveyed in Aristotelian terms, with introductory discussions of the Ethics, Politics, and the Poetics. Turning to the Metaphysics, the author demonstrates that the question of the unity of subject matter in Aristotle's metaphysics does not warrant the great difficulty that has been made of it. Finally--reversing to good effect the traditional order--Aristotelian logic is presented with superb clarity and ease.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dKZW1Jv3RgEC&dq=Aristotle+(Discussion+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saturated Fat May Save Your Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q_pFAAAAYAAJ&dq=Saturated+Fat+May+Save+Your+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Initial climate change scenario for the western United States (SuDoc I 27.2:G 51/4)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DGACAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Criminology: A Sociological Understanding (2nd Edition)","description":"Ideal for allied health and pre-nursing students, Alcamos Fundamentals of Microbiology, Body Systems Edition, retains the engaging, student-friendly style and active learning approach for which award-winning author and educator Jeffrey Pommerville is known.

One hundred raids by irregular forces (guerrilla groups, terrorist organizations, and private individuals) and elite units (organized military units belonging to a country's national armed forces) were examined in terms of: (1) previous training of the personnel involved in the mission; (2) the geographical position from which the raiding parties embarked; (3) the effectiveness of methods of transportation used; (4) the character of the mission (destruction, stand-off assault, rescue, kidnap, or assassination); (5) the size of the raiding party; and (6) the effect of disguise and/or deception on mission outcome. Seventy-seven percent of the raids accomplished their objective, indicating that obstacles such as geographic distances and well-defended enemy positions can be overcome by the stealth and mobility of small paramilitary and military units. The author concludes that commando warfare and small-group raids may be a useful adjunct to U.S. military policy for responding to terrorist attacks or provocations.

After a careful consideration of the costs of the investment and its anticipated benefits, a decision is made as to whether the benefits of the investment outstrip the costs and by how much. If the benefits are competitive with other investment alternatives (say, a major marketing campaign), then the business will commit financial resources to the IT proposal. Otherwise it won't. This decision making process is at the heart of capital budgeting. Senior executives have been making IT investment decisions for well over three decades. So why is the measurement of IT investment payoff so difficult and controversial? Why do we need a book dealing with contemporary approaches to measuring IT investment payoff? Why have earlier approaches to measuring IT investment payoff proven unsatisfactory? In what respects have earlier approaches fallen short? Do we need to scrap earlier approaches entirely or can we find important improvements to these approaches such that they can be newly applied to effectively measure IT investment payoff in ways that are convincing to senior management?

Under this definition, simulation is a very old discipline. Probably the first applications of simulation were to scale models of various types of dynamical structures or mechanical devices. Man has always looked for ways to \\"try things out\\" before building the real thing; this is the motivation behind any form of simulation. Thus, simulation of communication systems is concerned with imitating some aspects of the behavior of communication systems. It is implicit in our use of simulation that the medium (so to speak) for carrying it out is the digital computer. Computer-based modeling and simulation of communication systems has only developed in the last 20 years or so, since the advent of modern digital computers. A variety of modeling and simulation techniques have been developed and described in widely scattered journals, but until now there has not been a single volume devoted to the subject. We have tried to provide a unified framework that describes both the disciplines involved and the methods of modeling and simulating communication systems and subsystems. In the electronic era, the first type of computer simulation, in today's use of the term, took shape in the form of analog computers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=553xBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jewish Marriage: Rabbinic Law, Legend, and Custom","description":"Part II of this volume deals with divorce in Jewish law and custom.

Writing in direct, jargon-free style, often quoting her patients' descriptions of their own experience of illness and recovery, Bruch describes the relentless pursuit of thinness and the search for superiority in self-denial that characterizes anorexia nervosa. She emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and offers guidance on danger signs. Little-known when this groundbreaking book was first published, eating disorders have become all too familiar. Sympathetic and astute, The Golden Cage now speaks to a new generation. \\"The story of the disorder itself is beautifully written, presented with a deftness, lightness, and accuracy that make the reader yearn to turn the page, to watch the unfolding of this very enigmatic disorder.

A leader in applying game theory to the understanding of institutional analysis, Elinor Ostrom provides in this book a coherent method for undertaking the analysis of diverse economic, political, and social institutions. Understanding Institutional Diversity explains the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, which enables a scholar to choose the most relevant level of interaction for a particular question. This framework examines the arena within which interactions occur, the rules employed by participants to order relationships, the attributes of a biophysical world that structures and is structured by interactions, and the attributes of a community in which a particular arena is placed. The book explains and illustrates how to use the IAD in the context of both field and experimental studies. Concentrating primarily on the rules aspect of the IAD framework, it provides empirical evidence about the diversity of rules, the calculation process used by participants in changing rules, and the design principles that characterize robust, self-organized resource governance institutions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LbeJaji_AfEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Towards a new architecture,","description":"Published in 1923, Toward an Architecture had an immediate impact on architects throughout Europe and remains a foundational text for students and professionals.

As Jesus's teachings spread across the eastern Mediterranean, hammered into place by Paul, John, and their successors, they were transformed in the space of three centuries into a centralized, state-backed creed worlds away from its humble origins. Christian Beginnings tells the captivating story of how a man came to be hailed as the Son consubstantial with God, and of how a revolutionary, anticonformist Jewish subsect became the official state religion of the Roman Empire. /div","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fe-uji2OKB8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TIME FOR THE STARS","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Effectively Managing Human Service Organizations (SAGE Sourcebooks for the Human Services)","description":"Now in its Fourth Edition, Effectively Managing and Leading Human Service Organizations continues to provide invaluable creative ideas for achieving managerial success.

Instead of the economic disasters, underdevelopment, and serious food shortages that have plagued its neighbors, Kenya has enjoyed an expanding economy and agriculture. And instead of a corrupt and incompetent public administration, Kenya has established several successful rural development programs run by public servants with integrity and professional commitment. What accounts for these Kenyan successes? In this innovative study, David Leonard illustrates the way public policy is made and implemented in Kenya by focusing on four public officials who have had a great impact on rural development. He skillfully weaves his analyses of Kenya's political, economic, and administrative systems into evocative biographical portraits of Charles Karanja, General Manager of the Kenya Tea Development Authority, Harris Mule, administrative head of Finance and Planning, Ishmael Muriithi, head of the Veterinary Department, and Simeon Nyachae, Cabinet Secretary and chief of the Civil Service. The result is a fascinating glimpse of Kenyan political life from the inside, set in the context of the historical and social forces that have shaped that country's government.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mVS8EOTZqQoC&dq=African+Successes:+Four+Public+Managers+of+Kenyan+Rural+Development&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MacArthur: General Douglas MacArthur & The Occupation That Changed Japan","description":"Under siege on the island of Corregidor, General Douglas MacArthur received a warning from the enemy. \\"You are well aware that you are doomed,\\" the Japanese general wrote. \\"The end is near.

In the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, Lanny Budd s financial acumen and his marriage into great wealth enable him to continue the lifestyle he has always enjoyed. But the devastation the collapse has wrought on ordinary citizens has only strengthened Lanny s socialist ideals much to the chagrin of his heiress wife, Irma, a confirmed capitalist. In Germany to visit relatives, Lanny encounters a disturbing atmosphere of hatred and jingoism. His concern over the growing popularity of the Nazi Party escalates when he meets Adolf Hitler, the group s fanatical leader, and the members of his inner circle. But Lanny s gravest fear is the threat a national socialist government poses to the German Jewish family of Hansi, the musician husband of Lanny s sister, Bess a threat that will impel the international art dealer to risk his wealth, his future, even his life in a courageous attempt to rescue his loved ones from a terrible fate. Winner of the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, Dragon s Teeth brilliantly captures the nightmarish march toward the Second World War. An astonishing mix of history, adventure, and romance, the Lanny Budd Novels are a testament to the breathtaking scope of Upton Sinclair s vision and his singular talents as a storyteller.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gOMlCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Desert sailor: A war of mine","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rglVAAAACAAJ&dq=Desert+sailor:+A+war+of+mine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Perfect Man","description":"Michael Maxwell McCallum lives in a world just like ours, but peopled by superheroes.

Shortly after the United States declares war on Japan in response to Pearl Harbor, Japan's Tripartite Treaty allies, Germany and Italy, declare war on America. The United States finds itself in a two-theater war. President Franklin Roosevelt sets as America's first priority the defeat of Nazi Germany, electing to wage a more-or-less holding war in the Pacific. In the beginning, the only force opposing the Japanese onslaught in the Pacific is the U.S. Submarine Service. Jake Lawler begins the war as executive officer aboard USS S-49, an aged S-class submarine, with orders to conduct unrestricted warfare against the enemy in the Pacific. When a freak, mid-sea grounding causes the loss of S-49, Jake assumes command of USS Orca, a new Gato-class submarine under construction in Groton, CT. As Jake prepares a new boat and a freshly assembled crew for war, the conflict in the Pacific is going badly for the Allies. This is the story of Captain Lawler's eleven war patrols, including an ongoing conflict with Imperial Japanese Navy Captain Hiriake Ito of the destroyer Atsukaze. The crew of the Orca is made up of grizzled veterans and wet-behind-the-ears youngsters, all working together for a single purpose: to bring an implacable enemy to its knees. Along the way, friendships are forged, and love affairs and marriages are created-and destroyed. Pour yourself a glass of your favorite libation, grab a comfortable chair, and enjoy a tale that's sure to hold your interest in Silent Warriors by Gene Masters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rf7QvAEACAAJ&dq=Submarine+Warriors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Grove of Eagles","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iPYIAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Grove+of+Eagles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inu-Yasha : A Feudal Fairy Tale, Vol. 1","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Christian Wisdom of the Jedi Masters","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Eastern Front 1914-1917","description":"'Without question one of the classics of post-war historical scholarship, Stone's boldly conceived and brilliantly executed book opened the eyes of a generation of young British historians raised on tales of the Western trenches to the crucial importance of the Eastern Front in the First World War' Niall Ferguson 'Scholarly, lucid, entertaining, based on a thorough knowledge of Austrian and Russian sources, it sharply revises traditional assumptions about the First World War.'

The book s articles, all written by experts in the field, seek to answer such questions as: What has been the legacy, not just economically but politically and socially as well, of President Eisenhower s modern interstate highway system in America? With that system and the infrastructure that supports it now in a state of decline and decay, what s the best path for the future at a time of enormous fiscal constraints? Should California politicians plunge ahead with plans for a high-speed rail that every expert says despite the allure will go largely unused and will never pay back the massive investment while at this very moment potholes go unfilled all across the state? What path is best for emerging countries to keep pace with dramatic economic growth for their part? What are the social and financial costs of gridlock in our cities? Features: Approximately 675 signed articles authored by prominent scholars are arranged in A-to-Z fashion and conclude with Further Readings and cross references. A Chronology helps readers put individual events into historical context; a Reader s Guide organizes entries by broad topical or thematic areas; a detailed index helps users quickly locate entries of most immediate interest; and a Resource Guide provides a list of journals, books, and associations and their websites. While articles were written to avoid jargon as much as possible, a Glossary provides quick definitions of technical terms. To ensure full, well-rounded coverage of the field, the General Editor with expertise in urban planning, public policy, and the environment worked alongside a Consulting Editor with a background in Civil Engineering. The index, Reader s Guide, and cross references combine for thorough search-and-browse capabilities in the electronic edition. Available in both print and electronic formats, Encyclopedia of Transportation is an ideal reference for libraries and those who want to explore the issues that surround transportation in the United States and around the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0p-kBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why a Duck?

Thankfully, he hit a creative brick wall (since he doesn't really know anything about pottery from China or anywhere else). Then came similar failures to write books about sea turtles, circumnavigation of the globe, building jet engines at home, the sociology of chickens, or fungi of the skin. Luckily, Mr. Klein's paramount concern was the consumer. He knew that if we, his publishers, were going to boldly ask you to purchase his book (see above for price), he would have to write something so good, so worthwhile, so meaningful as to make you want to send additional money to your bookseller in gratitude for having allowed you to partake in this reading experience. So Mr. Klein set out to write about what he knows best: himself. This book is about the adventures of a child who becomes a young man: how he thinks and dreams and lusts and fears and laughs and handles adversity. From the beginning of his distinguished career as a comedian, Robert Klein established himself as a pioneer in observational humor and razor-sharp routines that are infectiously funny. Now -- for the first time -- Klein brings his trademark humor and honesty to the printed page. In this portrait of a comic as a young man, Klein takes us back to the people and streets of his Bronx neighborhood, the eccentric cast of characters in the Catskills hotels and bungalow colonies where he worked, the college dorms where he received more than an academic education, the 1964 World's Fair where he fell in love, New York City and Chicago in the 1960s as he developed his talent, and Los Angeles just as he was about to embark on a show business career. Throughout, Klein reveals the hilarity of growing up and explores the mysteries and his own foibles in sex and relationships. He recounts with wit and poignancy losing his virginity with a prostitute, bringing home a German girlfriend to his Jewish family, and the amorous adventures of the busboy he once was. With an ego more fragile than Chinese pottery, Robert Klein has written a funny and evocative coming-of-age memoir -- well worth the price (if we say so ourselves). Enjoy. All the best, The Publisher","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=469bCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Farmhouse Kitchen Cookbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qZ7iAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Farmhouse+Kitchen+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gifted Sophomores","description":"Three socially mismatched teens are trapped in the school darkroom during a violent earthquake.

Upon awakening in the hospital the following day, each of them discovers that in addition to being healed, they have been given supernatural gifts. Tiffany can see people's darkest, most painful moments, Josh can identify those in need, and MO cannot stop himself from spouting scripture and encouragement. Individually, they may feel they are going crazy, but together they are an evangelism task force that cannot be stopped - until the gifts are abruptly taken away.

This short novella was somewhat surprisingly included in the early Christian versions of the Old Testament and has played an important role in the Western tradition ever since. This commentary provides a detailed analysis of the text's composition and its meaning in its original historical context, and thoroughly surveys the history of Judith scholarship. Lawrence M. Wills not only considers Judith's relation to earlier biblical texts--how the author played upon previous biblical motifs and interpreted important biblical passages--but also addresses the rise of Judith and other Jewish novellas in the context of ancient Near Eastern and Greek literature, as well as their relation to cross-cultural folk motifs. Because of the popularity of Judith in art and culture, this volume also addresses the book's history of interpretation in paintings, sculpture, music, drama, and literature. A number of images of artistic depictions of Judith are included and discussed in detail.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EPasDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wiley CPA Examination Review, 1999-2000, 2 Volume Set (26th Edition. 2 Volume Set)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Massengill","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9P_SnQEACAAJ&dq=Massengill&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jordan's Star","description":"After receiving word of her husband's death at sea, Oregon farm widow Jordan eventually remarries and begins to enjoy an unforeseen happiness, but when her first husband returns, the entire community is thrown into an uproar and Jordan is forced to make a difficult decision.

Martin Rochester takes the reader on a field trip that begins with his own upper-middle class suburban school district in St. Louis and then moves on to inner-city locales and some of the best private schools, in showing how  pack pedagogy  has steamrolled parent resistance in promoting disasters such as whole-language, fuzzy math, multiple intelligences theory, teacher-as-coach, the therapeutic classroom, and all the other latest fads found in today s schools. A college professor, Rochester became deeply involved in public education as a result of his children s misadventures in the classroom. After several years of trying to improve the status quo as a dogged volunteer, he graduated from involved parent to informed critic of a system in which  progressive  educators continue to assault the techniques of traditional schooling (ability-grouping, grades, homework, etc), allow nonacademic diversions to crowd out academic study, and subordinate a commitment to excellence to an obsession with  equity.  As a result of his experiences, Rochester concludes that all children are being victimized, not only the most gifted, but especially  average  students and those lower achieving kids whose needs are now supposedly driving the entire curriculum. Martin Rochester began as a concerned parent and wound up creating a fever chart of what is wrong in our nation s classrooms.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CPj7euzX3hIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Educating the Gifted: A Sourcebook","description":"A concise reference for the education of the gifted.

Her study focuces on headhunting, a practice that remained active among the Ilongots until at least 1972. Indigenous notions of 'knowledge' and 'passion' are crucial to the Ilongots' perceptions of their own social practices of headhunting, oratory, marriage, and the organization of subsistence labour. In explaining the significance of these key ideas, Professor Rosaldo examines what she considers to be the most important dimensions of Ilongot social relationships: the contrasts between men and women and between accomplished married men and bachelor youths. By defining 'knowledge' and 'passion' in the context of their social and affective significance, the author demonstrates the place of headhunting in historical and political processes, and shows the relation between headhunting and indigenous concepts of curing, reproduction, and health. Theoretically oriented toward interpretive of symbolic ethnography, this book clarifies some of the ways in which the study of a language - both vocabulary and patterns of usage - is a study of a culture; the process of translation is presented as a method of cultural interpretation. Professor Rosaldo argues that an appreciation of the Ilongots' specific notions of 'the self' and the emotional concepts associated with headhunting can illuminate central aspects of the group's social life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=va8rnrn_9Z4C&dq=Knowledge+and+Passion+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Cultural+Systems)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Heart of Conflict","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FnVHN-pnWSgC&dq=The+Heart+of+Conflict&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Reader's Encyclopedia of Shakespeare","description":"Provides a wealth of information on Shakespeare and his works with more than 2,700 entries arranged alphabetically","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mdW5AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Reader%27s+Encyclopedia+of+Shakespeare&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't You Know...Queens Don't Stand on the Corner?","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Oregon trail: Sketches of prairie and Rocky-Mountain life (Francis Parkman's works.

As a field, Public Economics is defined by its objectives rather than its techniques and much of what is new is the application of modern methods of economic theory and econometrics to problems that have been addressed by economists for over two hundred years. More generally, the discussion of public finance issues also involves elements of political science, finance and philosophy. These connections are evidence in several of the chapters that follow. Public Economics is the positive and normative study of government's effect on the economy. We attempt to explain why government behaves as it does, how its behavior influences the behavior of private firms and households, and what the welfare effects of such changes in behavior are. Following Musgrave (1959) one may imagine three purposes for government intervention in the economy: allocation, when market failure causes the private outcome to be Pareto inefficient, distribution, when the private market outcome leaves some individuals with unacceptably low shares in the fruits of the economy, and stabilization, when the private market outcome leaves some of the economy's resources underutilized. The recent trend in economic research has tended to emphasize the character of stabilization problems as problems of allocation in the labor market. The effects that government intervention can have on the allocation and distribution of an economy's resources are described in terms of efficiency and incidence effects. These are the primary measures used to evaluate the welfare effects of government policy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Wp3W8tRdGKAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hip to Crochet (Hip to . . .

The author might, for example, devote his attention exclusively to a special type, such as shell roofs or pressure vessels, and consider all the minor details of stress calculations and even the design. On the other hand, he might stress the mathematical side of the subject to such an extent that he virtually writes a book on differential equations under the guise of the mechanical subject. The present hook has been kept away from these extremes. At first sight it may look to many people like a mathematics book, but it is hoped that the serious reader will soon see that it has been written by an engineer and for engineers. In a theoretical subject such as this one, it is, of course, not possible to get very far with the multiplication table and elementary trigonom etry alone. The ma,thematical prerequisites vary widely in different parts of the book, depending on the subject.

His attacks on Nazism led to the banning of his books, his dismissal from Frankfurt University and, ultimately, his departure for the United States in November 1933. He continued to live and work in America after the war, engaging in many lecture tours around the world. Professor Heywood Thomas reviews critically the philosophical background to Tillich's theology, including his debts to Schelling, Kant and Husserl. He surveys Tillich's achievement as a philosophical theologian, examining his ontological approach to Christology and salvation and his understanding of the Church as a spiritual community. He concludes with an exploration of Tillich's contribution to the changed situation of theology today. Tillich's many points of contact with key thinkers in theology and philosophy (including Heidegger, Otto, Bultmann, Adorno and Barth) make him a compelling figure for those interested in the history of ideas in the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b7Jjn2b-lz0C&dq=Tillich+(Outstanding+Christian+Thinkers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vegas Sunrise (Bookcassette(r) Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"From Viking glory: Notes on the McCorkle family in Scotland and America","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Apache Server Unleashed","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hOFikgEACAAJ&dq=Apache+Server+Unleashed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cantarella Vol. 1 (v. 1)","description":"The soul of Cesare Borgia, the illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI, is sold to the devil at his birth, and so Cesare, hopelessly torn between good and evil, begins a career of political machination, aided by the assassin Chiaro.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y7PSlh_8i3cC&dq=Cantarella+Vol.+1+(v.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Light That Failed","description":"A landmark book that completely transforms our understanding of the crisis of liberalism, from two pre-eminent intellectuals Why did the West, after winning the Cold War, lose its political balance? In the early 1990s, hopes for the eastward spread of liberal democracy were high. And yet the transformation of Eastern European countries gave rise to a bitter repudiation of liberalism itself, not only there but also back in the heartland of the West. In this brilliant work of political psychology, Ivan Krastev and Stephen Holmes argue that the supposed end of history turned out to be only the beginning of an Age of Imitation. Reckoning with the history of the last thirty years, they show that the most powerful force behind the wave of populist xenophobia that began in Eastern Europe stems from resentment at the post-1989 imperative to become Westernized. Through this prism, the Trump revolution represents an ironic fulfillment of the promise that the nations exiting from communist rule would come to resemble the United States. In a strange twist, Trump has elevated Putin's Russia and Orb n's Hungary into models for the United States. Written by two pre-eminent intellectuals bridging the East/West divide, The Light that Failed is a landmark book that sheds light on the extraordinary history of our Age of Imitation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B5eGDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Light+That+Failed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Klondike Christmas","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w393GwAACAAJ&dq=A+Klondike+Christmas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Sing a New Song","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Backcountry Avalanche Awareness","description":"This book is based on the Canadian Avalanche Association's introductory avalanche course.

When a distraught man storms into her bakery one morning, Neala's life is turned upside down. In moments, she's plunged into a fairytale world - and she's the star of the show. When she learns that the fate of Ireland, if not the entire world, rests on her shoulders, Neala is ready to turn tail and run for the hills - but she's stopped in her tracks by the storm she sees in the eyes of her handsome protector, Dagda.

Unable to resist a challenge, Neala throws caution to the wind and joins an unlikely group of magickal humans and fae alike as she finds herself pulled into the adventure of a lifetime.

M. Montgomery (Canadian Biography Series)","description":"Lucy Maud Montgomery was born with the storyteller's gift. Throughout her life she would use this talent to tangle and reinforce the intersecting threads of her experience: her Scots heritage, her early years in nineteenth-century Prince Edward Island, her teacher training at Prince of Wales College in Charlottetown, her unhappy marriage to a Presbyterian minister, and her powerful, tormenting ambition. With the creation of Anne of Green Gables, Montgomery quickly became Canada's most enduring and celebrated author. Yet this biography presents the Montgomery legend with a darker cast. Rubio and Waterston reveal Montgomery to be a subversive writer, who interjected messages of resistance into her superficially pleasant stories. The authors pay attention to Montgomery's private journals, which pulse with open resentment at the structures of daily life that caught her ambition in cobwebs. Trapped in her marriage, confined by motherhood, and bound by the need to present a smiling face of domestic and feminine amiability in accord with the romantic tales she was producing, Montgomery's journals testify to her struggles with emotional depression and her self-destructive dependence on her increasing popularity. Before long, she became caught by her very facility in creating narratives, unconsciously adapting her life to suit her writerly needs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t7QfAQAAIAAJ&dq=Writing+a+Life:+L.+M.+Montgomery+(Canadian+Biography+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bert Wilson, wireless operator (Bert Wilson series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gkl6vgAACAAJ&dq=Bert+Wilson,+wireless+operator+(Bert+Wilson+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A ride to India across Persia and Baluchistan","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4M0oAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dictionary of the English Language","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sing in Praise","description":"This joyous book sings thanks and praise for everything in land, sea, and sky-from the sun and moon to plants and animals to all people, young and old.

From the deliberate creation of organisms that live three times their natural span to the isolation of human genes that may allow us to do the same, The Clock of Ages also examines the latest discoveries in geriatric genetics.

Jones describes how, in 1839, Joseph Cinqu  led a revolt on the Spanish slave ship, the Amistad, in the Caribbean. The seizure of the ship by an American naval vessel near Montauk, Long Island, the arrest of the Africans in Connecticut, and the Spanish protest against the violation of their property rights created an international controversy. The Amistad affair united Lewis Tappan and other abolitionists who put the \\"law of nature\\" on trial in the United States by their refusal to accept a legal system that claimed to dispense justice while permitting artificial distinctions based on race or color. The mutiny resulted in a trial before the U.S. Supreme Court that pitted former President John Quincy Adams against the federal government. Jones vividly recaptures this compelling drama--the most famous slavery case before Dred Scott--that climaxed in the court's ruling to free the captives and allow them to return to Africa.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XIBJCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The twelve chairs,","description":"\\"Originally published in Russian under the title Dvenadtsat' Stul'ev in 1928.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4sP2uccUtAUC&dq=The+twelve+chairs,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ADVENTURES IN MY YOUTH: A German Soldier on the Eastern Front 1941-45","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Spiritual Healing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5vD7PQAACAAJ&dq=Spiritual+Healing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cross and Salvation: The Doctrine of Salvation (Foundations of Evangelical Theology)","description":"Features singular, comprehensive discussion and analysis of key evangelical doctrines including the doctrine of salvation, sin, the Holy Spirit, man, and the person and work of Christ.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YNPjwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Cross+and+Salvation:+The+Doctrine+of+Salvation+(Foundations+of+Evangelical+Theology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Law Firms: The Vault.com Guide to America's Top 50 Law Firms (Vault Reports)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u40S_gAACAAJ&dq=Law+Firms:+The+Vault.com+Guide+to+America%27s+Top+50+Law+Firms+(Vault+Reports)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eating & Drinking: An A-Z of Great Food and Drink Combinations","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Universal Donor (Norton Paperback Fiction)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Michelangelo (The World Art Library Artists)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dark Ruby: Travels in a Troubled Land","description":"Burma -- renamed Myanmar by the governing military junta in 1989 -- has recently begun a huge campaign to attract tourists.

There's nothing new or unusual about conflict between mothers, sisters, and other female family members but that doesn't make it any less painful or destructive. Adding to the hurt of relational abuse within the family is the permanent nature of the relationship: you can sever relations with an abusive friend, but you can't stop being the sister/daughter/niece of an abusive relative.

Against the steady flow of stories highlighting \\"mainline decline,\\" The Practicing Congregation suggested that there is a new and often overlooked renaissance occurring in mainline Protestant churches. The success of The Practicing Congregation made it clear that the next step was to provide examples that would illustrate the concepts laid out in that initial work. In From Nomads to Pilgrims, the editors continue to build this narrative, gathering specific stories of congregational vitality and transformation from participants in their research at the Project on Congregations of Intentional Practice, a Lilly Endowment Inc. funded study at Virginia Theological Seminary. Including stories from a variety of faith traditions across the U.S., From Nomads to Pilgrims explores: how intentional congregations develop ; how they negotiate the demands of interpreting traditional Christian practices in a postmodern culture ; how these practices lead to congregational and personal transformation. Each chapter is an instructive case study, illustrating a unique expression of the vitality experienced by a congregation that intentionally reclaims a traditional Christian practice. The pastors who have been involved in these congregations' stories share their practical wisdom gained through the experience of leading these churches.- how intentional congregations develop- how they negotiate the demands of interpreting traditional Christian practices in a postmodern culture- how these practices lead to congregational and personal transformation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jqUCBAAAQBAJ&dq=From+Nomads+to+Pilgrims:+Stories+from+Practicing+Congregations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"School for husbands","description":"\\"The School for Husbands\\" by Moli re.

The author recounts the dramatic search for and discovery of a proof of a counting formula conjectured in the late 1970s: the number of n x n alternating sign matrices, objects that generalize permutation matrices. While it was apparent that the conjecture must be true, the proof was elusive. As a result, researchers became drawn to this problem and made connections to aspects of the invariant theory of Jacobi, Sylvester, Cayley, MacMahon, Schur, and Young; to partitions and plane partitions; to symmetric functions; to hypergeometric and basic hypergeometric series; and, finally, to the six-vertex model of statistical mechanics. This volume is accessible to anyone with a knowledge of linear algebra, and it includes extensive exercises and Mathematica programs to help facilitate personal exploration. Students will learn what mathematicians actually do in an interesting and new area of mathematics, and even researchers in combinatorics will find something unique within Proofs and Confirmations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aM14tAEACAAJ&dq=Proofs+and+Confirmations:+The+Story+of+the+Alternating-Sign+Matrix+Conjecture+(Spectrum)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"National Water-Quality Assessment program: The Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River basin (Water fact sheet)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Loving Man: How a Woman Can Change a Man and Why She Must","description":"Steve Harvey, the host of the nationally syndicated Steve Harvey Morning Show, can't count the number of impressive women he's met over the years, whether it's through the \\"Strawberry Letters\\" segment of his program or while on tour for his comedy shows.

Each story carries the depth of authenticity and the power of a twenty-first-century construct. These sophisticated, subversive, and prophetic tales represent contemporary science fiction at its best.Among the contributors are Glenn L. Anderson, Virginia Ellen Baker, Elizabeth H.

At last he is following his own advice to students, to do their anthropological fieldwork 'somewhere where the inhabitants are beautiful, friendly, where you would like the food.' Barley explores the island on horseback and in buses jammed to the gunnels, and meets priests faithful to the old animist rituals. With his customary wit, he takes the reader deep into this complex but adaptable society. Reversing the habitual patterns of anthropology, Barley then invites four Torajan carvers to London to build a traditional rice barn at the Museum of Mankind. The observer becomes the observed. Now, it is Barley's turn to explain the absurdities of an English city to his bemused guests, in a glorious finale to a trilogy of anthropological journeys that began with The Innocent Anthropologist and continued with A Plague of Caterpillars (both published by Eland). A postscript, penned thirty years after these adventures had been concluded, confirms the rich arc of this story-line of role reversals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9-DZvQEACAAJ&dq=Not+a+Hazardous+Sport&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letterhead and Logo Design 9","description":"This latest edition in the best-selling annual Letterhead and Logo Design series features the most innovative and exciting work in the field from well-known design leaders, new design firms, and cutting-edge artists.

And short of a medical elixir, it's the next best thing for emboldening you, your board members and volunteers to ask with skill, finesse   and powerful results.Jerold Panas, who as a staff person, board member and volunteer has secured gifts ranging from $50 to $50 million, understands the art of asking perhaps better than anyone in America.

These chapters develop the \\"building blocks\\" that make up an instrument--the construct map, the design plan for the items, the outcome space, and the statistical measurement model. The next three chapters focus on quality control. They rely heavily on the calibrated construct map and review how to check if scores are operating consistently and how to evaluate the reliability and validity evidence. The book introduces a variety of item formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended, and performance items; projects; portfolios; Likert and Guttman items; behavioral observations; and interview protocols. Each chapter includes an overview of the key concepts, related resources for further investigation and exercises and activities. Some chapters feature appendices that describe parts of the instrument development process in more detail, numerical manipulations used in the text, and/or data results.

An accompanying downloadable resources feature control files, output, and a data set to allow readers to compute the text's exercises and create new analyses and case archives based on the book's examples so the reader can work through the entire development of an instrument. Constructing Measures is an ideal text or supplement in courses on item, test, or instrument development, measurement, item response theory, or rasch analysis taught in a variety of departments including education and psychology.

Many Classic Maya hieroglyphic texts were written in an earlier form of these languages, as were many important colonial documents. In addition to being a valuable record of an ancient language, Andrew Hofling's Itzaj Maya Grammar contributes greatly to the study of these older documents. This exemplary grammar completes a basic documentation that began with Itzaj Maya Texts and Itzaj Maya-Spanish-English Dictionary. Its coverage of the linguistic structures of Itzaj includes the phonological, morphophonological, and syntactic structures. Each morphological and grammatical construction is carefully explained, with additional examples of each construction included. Itzaj Maya Grammar is a landmark contribution to the study of discourse in Maya languages. When used with Hofling's previous texts, it provides a thoroughly dynamic documentation of the language, useful to all interested in the study of Yukatekan languages or linguistics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LrhkAAAAMAAJ&dq=Itzaj+Maya+Grammar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Narrative of William W.

From Freud to Babbitt, from Relativity to Susan Sontag, from Proust to Henri Bergson to Saul Bellow, the books range is encyclopedic, covering the major writers, artists, scientists, and philosophers who produced the ideas by which we live. Beginning with four seminal ideas that were introduced in 1900 -- the unconscious, the gene, the quantum, and Picasso's first paintings in Paris-Peter Watson has produced a fluent and engaging narrative of the intellectual tradition of the past century. The book is divided into four parts -- Freud to Wittgenstein; Spengler to Animal Farm; Sartre to the Sea of Tranquillity; the counterculture to Kosovo -- and there are forty-two chapters. Watson emphasizes that \\"the century may be understood as a period during which the scientific method colonized all modes of thought and changed the way thinking is done.\\" He sees the first half of the century as a period of discovery and the last half as a period of analysis, synthesis, and understanding, and he explores the role of the United States in setting the century's agenda in many areas. Unlike more conventional histories, in which the focus is on political events and personalities, The Modern Mind is an illuminating blueprint of twentieth-century thought and culture and the men and women who created it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hTOrQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Modern+Mind:+An+Intellectual+History+of+the+20th+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Cognitive Theory of Cultural Meaning.","description":"Reviews a range of current psychological theories of cultural meaning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tyhdo9R0cDcC&dq=A+Cognitive+Theory+of+Cultural+Meaning.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Duffy","description":"A #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER!

What Harder wants salvaged is his reputation. After a long career as a seaman, he was piloting a boat the night his employer fell overboard. Harder is certain he s been set up, but to help him, McGee must prove that a dead man is actually alive.  John D. MacDonald is a shining example for all us in the field. Talk about the best.

As parents, how much influence do we have over what kind of people our children will grow up to be? In the follow-up to her critically acclaimed Our Babies, Ourselves, Cornell anthropologist Meredith Small now takes on these and other crucial questions about the development of preschool children aged one to six. While Our Babies, Ourselves explored the physical and cultural preconceptions behind child-rearing and offered new clues to parenting practices that might be detrimental to a baby's best interest, Kids delves even deeper. Unraveling the deep-seated notions prescribed in most parenting books, Kids combines the latest scientific research on human evolution and biology with Small's own keen observations of various cultures for a lively, eye-opening view of early childhood in America. Small not only reveals how children in this age group socialize and absorb the rules that underlie the societies they live in; she also explains the extent to which parents enhance or hold back the emotional and psychological growth of their kids. In her engaging style, Small blends memorable accounts from her own experiences raising a preschooler with fascinating findings from her pioneering cross-cultural research, which spanned the country as well as the globe. Covering myriad aspects of the miraculous process of human growth, Small breaks new ground on topics such as why childhood is the optimum time for acquiring language skills; how children absorb knowledge and learn to solve problems; how empathy, and morality in general, make their way into a child's psyche; and the ways in which gender impacts identity. Underlying each chapter is an illuminating discussion of how the roles parents assign children in America shape the self-esteem and self-image of a future generation. Rich with vivid anecdotes and profound insight, Kids will cause readers to rethink their own parenting styles, along with every age-old assumption about how to raise a happy, healthy kid.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V-q3CKzopL4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Yukon [Rivers of America]","description":"AWARDS: 2006 Outstanding Academic Title, by CHOICE The 2005 Award for Excellence in Professional and Scholarly Publishing by the Association of American Publishers (AAP) Best Reference 2005, by the Library Journal Rivers of North America is an important reference for scientists, ecologists, and students studying rivers and their ecosystems.

Those who had ventured to return to Poland after liberation soon found that their homeland had become a new killing ground, where some 1,500 Jews were murdered in pogroms between 1945 and 1947. Facing death at home, and with Palestine and the rest of the world largely closed to them, they looked for a place to be safe and found it in the shelter of the Allied Occupation Forces in Germany. By 1950 a little community of 20,000 Jews remained in Germany: 8,000 native German Jews and 12,000 from Eastern Europe. Ruth Gay examines their contrasting lives in the two postwar Germanies. After the fall of Communism, the Jewish community was suddenly overwhelmed by tens of thousands of former Soviet Jews. Now there are some 100,000 Jews in Germany. The old, somewhat nostalgic life of the first postwar decades is being swept aside by radical forces from the Lubavitcher at one end to Reform and feminism at the other. What started in 1945 as a  remnant  community has become a dynamic new center of Jewish life. /DIV/DIV","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1uMg048oX_IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Missouri Sampler Cookbook: A Collection of Favorite Recipes From All Counties","description":"\\"A revealing look at the history of Missouri cookbooks from the 1800s to today.

First meeting as delegates to the Continental Congress in 1775, they initiated correspondence in 1777, negotiated jointly as ministers in Europe in the 1780s, and served the early Republic--each, ultimately, in its highest office. At Jefferson's defeat of Adams for the presidency in 1800, they became estranged, and the correspondence lapses from 1801 to 1812, then is renewed until the death of both in 1826, fifty years to the day after the Declaration of Independence. Lester J. Cappon's edition, first published in 1959 in two volumes, provides the complete correspondence between these two men and includes the correspondence between Abigail Adams and Jefferson. Many of these letters have been published in no other modern edition, nor does any other edition devote itself exclusively to the exchange between Jefferson and the Adamses. Introduction, headnotes, and footnotes inform the reader without interrupting the speakers. This reissue of The Adams-Jefferson Letters in a one-volume unabridged edition brings to a broader audience one of the monuments of American scholarship and, to quote C. Vann Woodward, 'a major treasure of national literature.'","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GDHqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blackbird Singing : Poems and Lyrics, 1965-1999","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Photosynthesis (Studies in Biology)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Software Engineering","description":"Tough Test Questions?

The authors present a deep analysis of the ways that industrial states  both developed and developing  are currently unsustainable and how economic and social welfare are related to the environment, to public health and safety, and to earning capacity and meaningful and rewarding employment. The authors offer multipurpose solutions to the sustainability challenge that integrate industrial development, employment, technology, environment, national and international law, trade, finance, and public and worker health and safety. The authors present a compelling wake-up call that warns of the collision course set between the current paths of continued growth and inevitable unsustainability in the world today. Offering clear examples and real solutions, this textbook illustrates how the driving forces that are currently promoting unsustainability can be refocused and redesigned to reverse course and improve the state of the world.

The phrase conjures images of Louis Armstrong holding court at the Sunset Cafe in Chicago, Duke Ellington dazzling crowds at the Cotton Club in Harlem, and star singers like Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey. But the Jazz Age was every bit as much of a Paris phenomenon as it was a Chicago and New York scene. In Paris Blues, Andy Fry provides an alternative history of African American music and musicians in France, one that looks beyond familiar personalities and well-rehearsed stories. He pinpoints key issues of race and nation in France s complicated jazz history from the 1920s through the 1950s. While he deals with many of the traditional icons such as Josephine Baker, Django Reinhardt, and Sidney Bechet, among others what he asks is how they came to be so iconic, and what their stories hide as well as what they preserve. Fry focuses throughout on early jazz and swing but includes its re-creation reinvention in the 1950s. Along the way, he pays tribute to forgotten traditions such as black musical theater, white show bands, and French wartime swing. Paris Blues provides a nuanced account of the French reception of African Americans and their music and contributes greatly to a growing literature on jazz, race, and nation in France.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kOexAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American Country Inn and Bed & Breakfast Cookbook, Volume II (American Country Inn & Bed & Breakfast Cookbook)","description":"Presents hundreds of recipes from inns around the country and gives a state-by-state description of the best inns, with information on the facilities and activities available at each inn","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_BzNnQEACAAJ&dq=The+American+Country+Inn+and+Bed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Her Majesty's Dog Vol. 1 (v. 1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Radiance in Stone: Sculptures in Colored Marble from the Museo Nazionale Romano","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Complete Guide To Boat Maintenance & Repair","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Overlord: D-Day and the battle for Normandy (Leather-bound library of military history)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=opWBngEACAAJ&dq=Overlord:+D-Day+and+the+battle+for+Normandy+(Leather-bound+library+of+military+history)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wildlife-Friendly Plants: Make Your Garden a Haven for Beneficial Insects, Amphibians and Birds","description":"A practical and inspiring guide.

Once before, during the period of the Iranian revolution and hostage crisis of 1979 to 1981, Americans found themselves targeted as a consequence of a militant interpretation of Islam. Daniel Pipes wrote In the Path of God in response to those events, and the heightened interest in Islam they generated. His objective was to present an overview of the connection between in Islam and political power through history in a way that would explain the origins of hostility to Americans and the West. Its relevance to our understanding of contemporary events is self evident. Muslim antagonism toward the West is deeply rooted in historical experience. In premodern times, the Islamic world enjoyed great success, being on the whole more powerful and wealthier than their neighbors. About two hundred years ago, a crisis developed, as Muslims became aware of the West's overwhelming force and economic might. While they might have found these elements attractive, Muslims found European culture largely alien and distasteful. The resulting resistance to Westernization by Muslims has deep roots, has been more persistent than that of other peoples, and goes far to explain the deep Muslim reluctance to accept modern ways. In short, Muslims saw what the West had and wanted it too, but they rejected the methods necessary to achieve this. This, the Muslim trauma, has only worsened over the years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5DxftAEACAAJ&dq=In+the+Path+of+God:+Islam+and+Political+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hannibal (Hannibal Lecter)","description":"You remember Hannibal Lecter: gentleman, genius, cannibal.

The first of Midland Publishing's new 'Military Aircraft in Detail' series provides a detailed history of the development and operation of the Ar-234, supported by many photos, line drawings, and speciallly commissioned artworks. The camouflage schemes applied to the aircraft are also examined: many of the illustrations are previously unpublished, making the book an essential addition to the limited range of publications available on this important aircraft type.

So when the respective CEOs of these companies discuss a merger, it is only natural that Manning be interested in the proceedings. What's more, Manning's lover Neil, an architect, is designing a new house for Ashton's CEO, Gillian Reece. Reece is a business friend of Manning but not a friend to many else; she is generally considered overly aggressive and fastidious. When Manning assigns Glee Savage, the newspaper's society reporter, to cover Reece's new home, the subsequent meeting between the two does not end well: Savage huffs off in a fury but not before ferociously bitch slapping Reece in front of everyone. With Reece's cheek still smarting, more bad news comes as the accountant performing due diligence for the merger reports some very questionable items regarding Ashton's books. It seems as though things couldn't go much worse for the unpleasant Reece. That is, until she is murdered. The discovery of her body is greeted with great surprise, but perhaps not much regret on the part of most who knew her. Still, with Manning's friend and employee Glee Savage as the obvious and primary suspect, he cannot resist wading in to this most unsound of business dealings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ei8cTVvSXDEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Minny's Dream","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Child Safety Made Easy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4JEBAAAACAAJ&dq=Child+Safety+Made+Easy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The sketch book (Silver series of classics)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2PWgAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chow Chows (Barron's Pet Owner's Manual)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Glimpses of Raja yoga","description":"In Glimpses of Raja Yoga, Vimala Thakar introduces the basic concepts of Patanjali s Yoga Sutras by focusing on a different sutra, or aphorism, in each of the twelve chapters.

According to Shaiken, understanding the links between sports and politics allows for a more realistic appraisal of the games and their role in society. In conclusion the book evaluates--and generally rejects--various proposals for Olympic reform, contending that attempts to minimize the political nature of the Olympics are futile because politics are so entrenched in the games at present.

Now, to mark the centenary of this epochal event, historian Steve Smithpresents a panoramic account of the history of the Russian empire, from the last years of the nineteenth century, through the First World War and the revolutions of 1917 and the establishment of the Bolshevik regime, to the end of the 1920s, when Stalin simultaneously unleashed violentcollectivization of agriculture and crash industrialization upon Russian society.Drawing on recent archivally-based scholarship, Russia in Revolution pays particular attention to the varying impact of the Revolution on the various groups that made up society: peasants, workers, non-Russian nationalities, the army, women and the family, young people, and the Church.In doing so, it provides a fresh way into the big, perennial questions about the Revolution and its consequences: why did the attempt by the tsarist government to implement political reform after the 1905 Revolution fail; why did the First World War bring about the collapse of the tsarist system;why did the attempt to create a democratic system after the February Revolution of 1917 not get off the ground; why did the Bolsheviks succeed in seizing and holding on to power; why did they come out victorious from a punishing civil war; why did the New Economic Policy they introduced in 1921fail; and why did Stalin come out on top in the power struggle inside the Bolshevik party after Lenin's death in 1924.A final chapter then reflects on the larger significance of 1917 for the history of the twentieth century - and, for all its terrible flaws, what the promise of the Revolution might mean for us today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_4SuDQAAQBAJ&dq=RUSSIA+IN+REVOLUTION&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Junkie: Confessions of an Unredeemed Drug Addict","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bHvznQEACAAJ&dq=Junkie:+Confessions+of+an+Unredeemed+Drug+Addict&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Japan Since 1945: The Rise of an Economic Superpower (Studies in Contemporary History)","description":"Few historians have attempted an account of Japan since 1945 yet the country's emergence as the second largest economy in the world has been one of the most dramatic and significant developments since the Second World War.

The book serves as an important tool to normalize the sleep paralysis experience by attempting to remove its often-publicized mystical and supernatural aura. Specifically, the book is a serious contribution to the psychological and social scientific literature as an example of behavioral/social methodology in clarifying psychological phenomena that can be misinterpreted individually or by culture as \\"paranormal.\\" However, the book does not refute the very real phenomenology of the experience and is intended as a practical guide for recognizing and managing the disorder in creative and self-enhancing ways. Moreover, this work reiterates the aesthetic and creative power of uncanny dreaming regardless of its origin. This aesthetic dimension of sleep paralysis and lucid dreaming is part of mythical, shamanic, creative, personal and scientific multidisciplinary approach to studying and describing dream phenomenology. Additionally, this work provides a retrospective look at the history of this uncanny disorder in human evolution, its recent western medical history and its most recent empirical descriptions as so-called alien abduction cases, including a presentation of Jungian and Freudian mythical perspectives. The empirical data is presented in balance with traditional cross-cultural and folklore accounts of the disorder as well as in the context of numerous recent cases researched in conjunction with the long-term study. Part of the data presented includes a proposal about psycho-geographical and psycho-geomagnetic distributions of \\"ghost\\" stories, dream attacks, and other SP related phenomena. These geographical zones correlate with geodynamic areas such as the Pacific \\"Ring of Fire\\" region where an increased number of cultural names for SP and its frequencies are reported (my \\"ring of fire\\" hypothesis). This book is written and intended for a general educated audience; anyone interested in dream phenomenology and behavior; the medical profession; folklorists; psychologists interested in dream phenomenology and behavior; sleep researchers; and the clinical psychologist. The book expands the work of Dr. David Hufford, who published the now classic account of sleep paralysis as Newfoundland's \\"Old Hag\\" phenomenon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0CiiPwAACAAJ&dq=Wrestling+With+Ghosts:+A+Personal+And+Scientific+Account+Of+Sleep+Paralysis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The ABCs of Windows Nt Workstation 4","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v4lVtwAACAAJ&dq=The+ABCs+of+Windows+Nt+Workstation+4&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lilith","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Not Just Another Moose","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Charles Francis Adams, 1807-1886","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0rR2AAAAMAAJ&dq=Charles+Francis+Adams,+1807-1886&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clinical aviation medicine","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WmpsAAAAMAAJ&dq=Clinical+aviation+medicine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essentials of Environmental Toxicology: The Effects of Environmentally Hazardous Substances on Human Health","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"On religion: Speeches to its cultured despisers (The Library of religion and culture)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lone cowboy: My life story","description":"First publishing in 1930 and accepted as Will James' autobiography, Lone Cowboy is regarded today as a fictionalized account of the author's life.

It's 6:30 A.M. My Wife is peeing on what looks like a scale model of the spaceship from 2001: A Space Odyssey. It's an early pregnancy test called something like First Alert, or Early Response, some name that sounds like a smoke detector or a piece of EMS equipment.\\" From this unavoidable physiological fact follows the greatest psychological crisis of his life, a story that eventually illuminates the journey of all men and women as they make the passage to becoming parents. What really goes through a \\"pregnant\\" man's mind? Combining his personal story with interviews with doctors, midwives, evolutionary scientists, and other fathers-to-be, Gordon Churchwell delivers the gritty, intimate details, as well as important new information, in an irreverent style that mixes poignancy, wit, and laugh-out-loud humor. He covers all the issues without flinching. On relationships: \\"There are moments when you are not just individuals trying to solve a personal problem, but representatives of your gender, acting out some social drama. Over Julie's shoulder I see a chorus of angry women. . . .\\" On sex: \\"While the party line is that Julie remains 'my beautiful partner to whom I am devoted,' to Mr. Weenie, she is beginning to look like Danny DeVito in Batman Returns. . . .\\" On why men find change difficult: \\"Why do I feel like a bystander in the most important 280 days of my life? Where are the stories that make a man feel like he's in it, and not out of it? The answer is simple. When it comes to the stories of fatherhood, our culture has discarded them.\\" When he starts having morning sickness, Churchwell turns science detective and makes some startling discoveries: He finds out that male pregnancy symptoms are extremely common and uncovers evidence of a physiological paternal response-men have hormonal changes, too, which help prepare them emotionally for fatherhood. Does nature make fathers out of men? Working with a leading evolutionary psychologist, Churchwell argues for a revolutionary new perspective on a man's role in reproduction. Parental investment on both sides is not automatic. Pregnancy behavior is part of a continual process of negotiation about parental commitment. A man's response to pregnancy, including sympathetic symptoms, may signal his plans about investing in the child. His behavior can directly affect the mother's own response, including the quality of her maternal care. By showing that men have a physiological transformation of their own that integrates them into the biology of the family, Churchwell restores men to the story of reproduction. Expecting is an important contribution to the new literature of fatherhood that will amuse and inspire men and women as they transform themselves into parents. This personal story ends where it began, with him and his wife, Julie, struggling-this time as a team-through a harrowing thirty-five-hour birth ordeal, and welcoming their daughter, Olivia, into the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1iGoHAAACAAJ&dq=Expecting+:+One+Man%27s+Uncensored+Memoir+of+Pregnancy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Picassos Guernica","description":"The destruction of a town, and the creation of a masterpiece--On April 26, 1937, in the late afternoon of a busy market day in the Basque town of Gernika in northern Spain, the German Luftwaffe began the relentless bombing and machine-gunning of buildings and villagers at the request of General Francisco Franco and his rebel forces. Three-and-a-half hours later, the village lay in ruins, its population decimated. This act of terror and unspeakable cruelty--the first intentional, large-scale attack against a nonmilitary target in modern warfare--outraged the world and one man in particular, Pablo Picasso. The renowned artist, an expatriate living in Paris, reacted immediately to the devastation in his homeland by creating the canvas that would become widely considered one of the greatest artworks of the twentieth century--Guernica. Weaving themes of conflict and redemption, of the horrors of war and of the power of art to transfigure tragedy, Russell Martin follows this monumental work from its fevered creation through its journey across decades and continents--from Europe to America and, finally and triumphantly, to democratic Spain. Full of historical sweep and deeply moving drama, Picasso's War delivers an unforgettable portrait of a painting, the dramatic events that led to its creation, and its ongoing power today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dzzAMuRX3PYC&dq=Picassos+Guernica&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introductory Astronomy and Astrophysics","description":"This advanced undergraduate text provides broad coverage of astronomy and astrophyscis with a strong emphasis on physics.

Left as an infant to die in the desert, his real origins were unknown. When he won his freedom from the tribe who enslaved him by slaying a deadly sandtiger, he joined the elite brotherhood of Southron sword-dancers, swearing a lifelong oath to abide by their code of honor. Del was a woman of the North. She had seen her family brutally murdered and her brother carried away to the South to be sold into slavery. Motivated by revenge, she studied with the greatest of Northern sword-masters and became the deadliest sword-singer in the North. Together these two legendary fighters had forged an unlikely partnership of equals, sharing adventures, danger, and eventually love. But when Tiger forfeited an important sword dance to rescue Del, he broke his sworn code of honor and his sentence was death. Fugitives from both the North and the South, Tiger and Del flee to the distant island of Skandi. Tiger has been told he resembles the people who comes from this remote land, and now, Tiger seeks his true identity. But Skandi proves no safe haven. Abducted by priest-mages, altered in mind and body, Tiger is forced to acknowledge that he possesses his own special brand of magic. A personal magic that carries its own price: Tiger will only have ten or twelve more years to live. But as Tiger and Del struggle to escape, Tiger s long-dormant power begins to manifest. He falls victim to visions he cannot dismiss, dreams of a dead woman luring him into the crystal sands of the Punja, the South s deadliest desert.  Find me,  she bids him,  and take up the sword.  Initially, Tiger rebels, refusing the siren song of his dreams. But at last, helpless to deny the compulsion in his own blood, Tiger must accept his magic and his fate.

With John gone, Diane was indeed \\"on her own,\\" coping with the inevitable practical issues and, more important, with the profoundly emotional ones. What to do, how to react, reaching out again into the world--struggling to create a new reality for herself while clinging to memories of the past. Her focus is on her own roller-coaster experiences, but she has also solicited the moving stories of such recently widowed friends as Roger Mudd and Susan Stamberg, which work to expose the reader to a remarkable range of reactions to the death of a spouse. John's unnecessarily extended death--he begged to be helped to die--culminated in his taking matters into his own hands, simply refusing to take water, food, and medication. His heroic actions spurred Diane into becoming a kind of poster person for the \\"right to die\\" movement that is all too slowly taking shape in our country. With the brave determination that has characterized her whole life, she is finding a meaningful new way to contribute to the world. Her book--as practical as it is inspiring--will be a help and a comfort to the recently bereaved, and a beacon of hope about the possibilities that remain to us as we deal with our own approaching mortality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=23raCwAAQBAJ&dq=On+My+Own&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Real Life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hands: A Pictorial Archive from Nineteenth-Century Sources (Dover Pictorial Archive)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea: Why the Greeks Matter","description":"In Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea, his fourth volume to explore  the hinges of history,  Thomas Cahill escorts the reader on another entertaining and historically unassailable journey through the landmarks of art and bloodshed that defined Greek culture nearly three millennia ago. In the city-states of Athens and Sparta and throughout the Greek islands, honors could be won in making love and war, and lives were rife with contradictions. By developing the alphabet, the Greeks empowered the reader, demystified experience, and opened the way for civil discussion and experimentation yet they kept slaves. The glorious verses of the Iliad recount a conflict in which rage and outrage spur men to action and suggest that their  bellicose society of gleaming metals and rattling weapons  is not so very distant from more recent campaigns of  shock and awe.  And, centuries before Zorba, Greece was a land where music, dance, and freely flowing wine were essential to the high life. Granting equal time to the sacred and the profane, Cahill rivets our attention to the legacies of an ancient and enduring worldview.

By focusing on the character type of the ward, or young female dependent, this book examines the narrative strategies used by such writers as Pushkin, Zhukova, Tolstoy, Herzen, and Dostoevsky to represent socially marginal women in their works. Drawing on Bakhtin's concepts of dialogue and polyphony, this volume examines the following question: does he present them dialogically, i.e., as subjects in their own right, with their own point of view. By proposing this new way of approaching the texts, the book corrects the charges of misogyny leveled at classical Russian literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uk4YbsBNl-sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An outline of the history of music, (Columbia university studies in musicology)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KTbFngEACAAJ&dq=An+outline+of+the+history+of+music,+(Columbia+university+studies+in+musicology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Davis's Drug Guide for Nurses","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A History of Greek Literature","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"History of St. Paul's Cathedral","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fgtJAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Face-to-Face Safari","description":"Features rhyming text and large pop-up illustrations for six popular animals from Africa.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oi9wswEACAAJ&dq=Face-to-Face+Safari&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rivers of Shadow, Rivers of Sun","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"College physics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IQd4MwEACAAJ&dq=College+physics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The house on the canal (Bibliotheca Neerlandica)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X4gjtAEACAAJ&dq=The+house+on+the+canal+(Bibliotheca+Neerlandica)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chemical Sensitivity: The Truth About Environmental Illness (Consumer Health Library)","description":"Chemical sensitivity (or multiple chemical sensitivity) describes people with numerous troubling symptoms attributed to environmental factors, from simple housepaint to complex building structures and materials in offices and schools. Many such people are seeking special accommodations, applying for disability benefits, and filing lawsuits claiming that exposure to common foods and chemicals has made them ill. Their efforts are supported by some physicians who refer themselves as clinical ecologists. They use questionable diagnoses and treatment methods, while critics charge that these approaches are bogus and that chemical sensitivity is not a valid diagnosis.The complaints associated with chemical sensitivity include depression, irritability, poor memory, fatigue, drowsiness, constipation, sneezing, wheezing, skin rashes, headache, chest pain, pounding heart, swelling, upset stomach, paralysis, AIDS-like illnesses, psychotic experiences, and just about every other symptom noted in medical textbooks. One prominent clinical ecologist even claimed that chemical sensitivity patients may well be human canaries on an increasingly poisoned planet, and others have actually labeled chemical sensitivity as a disease. While some people are adversely affected by exposure to some chemicals, there is an overwhelming increase in false claims and reports from misled obsessive patients and opportunistic doctors.Chemical Sensitivity examines this phenomenon in depth and the scientific, legal, ethical, and political issues that surround it. The authors explore the speculations about environmental exposure in the light of scientific knowledge of human physiology, allergy and immunology, pathology, toxicology, and clinical medicine. They evaluate cases of chemical sensitivity relative to controlled tests, and reveal that symptoms were brought on by psychological factors rather than physical ones. Chemical Sensitivity also critically assesses claims related to sick building syndrome, mercury-amalgam toxicity, yeast allergy, and Gulf War syndrome.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9Vmm9tGIiX8C&dq=Chemical+Sensitivity:+The+Truth+About+Environmental+Illness+(Consumer+Health+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scatterbrain Sam","description":"Nicknamed Scatterbrain Sam by his whispering neighbors, our adorable yet scattered main character finds himself in all kinds of sticky situations.

Leaving a farm management job at Columbiana Ranch near Eldred, Illinois, they bought a 75-acre farm in partnership with Gerald's brother Keith and wife Barbara in southern Illinois and rented another. Their big old farm house on the rented land had been standing empty except for mice. Sue cleaned, painted, and helped the children adjust to a new community. Gerald rushed to be ready for the arrival of baby pigs and started to install the house's first plumbing. Then there was a fire. Pregnant with their fourth child, Sue recorded their rural adventures and misadventures in the 1960s. Finally they moved even deeper into the country to the hog farm. Down on the Farm, a good story for the young or old, captures the universal struggle of young couples who set out to achieve their dreams. With ambitions to write and raise a large family, Sue Glasco did both when she married an agriculture major who also loved rural life. Their four children provided much subject matter.

Despite its formidable reputation throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the army was vanquished by the Allied powers during World War I. How did his renowned army come to suffer such a surprising defeat? What political, social, and military forces left the German army vulnerable in 1914? Challenging previous scholarship on the topic, author Eric Dorn Brose offers here a provocative new interpretation of this fascinating period in German history.

In August 1914, as the army strove for western victory, its shortcomings became obvious.

Editors are the subject of adoration and worship, or of scorn and ridicule, depending upon whether the topic of discussion is your editor or someone else's. vi has been the standard editor for close to 30 years. Popular on Unix and Linux, it has a growing following on Windows systems, too. Most experienced system administrators cite vi as their tool of choice. And since 1986, this book has been the guide for vi. However, Unix systems are not what they were 30 years ago, and neither is this book. While retaining all the valuable features of previous editions, the 7th edition of Learning the vi and vim Editors has been expanded to include detailed information on vim, the leading vi clone. vim is the default version of vi on most Linux systems and on Mac OS X, and is available for many other operating systems too. With this guide, you learn text editing basics and advanced tools for both editors, such as multi-window editing, how to write both interactive macros and scripts to extend the editor, and power tools for programmers -- all in the easy-to-follow style that has made this book a classic. Learning the vi and vim Editors includes: A complete introduction to text editing with vi: How to move around vi in a hurry Beyond the basics, such as using buffers vi's global search and replacement Advanced editing, including customizing vi and executing Unix commands How to make full use of vim: Extended text objects and more powerful regular expressions Multi-window editing and powerful vim scripts How to make full use of the GUI version of vim, called gvim vim's enhancements for programmers, such as syntax highlighting, folding and extended tags Coverage of three other popular vi clones -- nvi, elvis, and vile -- is also included. You'll find several valuable appendixes, including an alphabetical quick reference to both vi and ex mode commands for regular vi and for vim, plus an updated appendix on vi and the Internet. Learning either vi or vim is required knowledge if you use Linux or Unix, and in either case, reading this book is essential. After reading this book, the choice of editor will be obvious for you too.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KUvMAQAAQBAJ&dq=Learning+the+vi+Editor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Keep It Real (From the Files of Madison Finn, Book 19)","description":"Seventh grade is anything but calm for Madison Finn and her group of cyber-savvy friends.

A one-time household name synonymous with the superlative Spitfire, Johnnie s aerial combat successes inspired schoolboys for generations. As a  lowly Pilot Officer , Johnnie Johnson learned his fighter pilot s craft as a prot g  of the legless Tangmere Wing Leader, Douglas Bader. After Bader was brought down over France and captured on 9 August 1941, Johnnie remained a member of 616 (South Yorkshire) Squadron, in which he became a flight commander and was awarded the DFC a month after Bader s devastating loss. In time, Johnnie came to command a Canadian wing in 1943, when the Spitfire Mk.IX at last outclassed the Fw 190, and participated in some of the most important battles of the defeat of Nazi Germany, including Operation Overlord and the D-Day landings in 1944, Operation Market Garden and the airborne assault at Arnhem, and the Rhine Crossings, throughout all of which Johnnie also commanded Canadian wings. Johnnie s remarkable career is revealed through this unparalleled collection of archive photographs, the majority of which are drawn from his own personal album or from other members of the Johnson family. Many have not been published before. Between them, they present a fascinating insight into the man himself, the machines he flew, and the men he served alongside.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HYE0EAAAQBAJ&dq=Spitfire+Ace+(CD)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jewish Spiritual Practices","description":"The Jewish mystic path and its practices to attain God-consciousness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D3DLtspv7u4C&dq=Jewish+Spiritual+Practices&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An introduction to the Gothic language,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Water and American Government: The Reclamation Bureau, National Water Policy, and the West, 1902-1935","description":"Donald Pisani's history of perhaps the boldest economic and social program ever undertaken in the United States--to reclaim and cultivate vast areas of previously unusable land across the country shows in fascinating detail how ambitious government programs fall prey to the power of local interest groups and the federal system of governance itself.

By examining the obscured histories of publication, circulation, and reception of widely consumed literary works from late Edo to the early Meiji period, Jonathan Zwicker traces a genealogy of the literary field across a long nineteenth century: one that stresses continuities between the generic conventions of early modern fiction and the modern novel. In the literature of sentiment Zwicker locates a tear-streaked lens through which to view literary practices and readerly expectations that evolved across the century. Practices of the Sentimental Imagination emphasizes both qualitative and quantitative aspects of literary production and consumption, balancing close readings of canonical and noncanonical texts, sophisticated applications of critical theory, and careful archival research into the holdings of nineteenth-century lending libraries and private collections. By exploring the relationships between and among Japanese literary works and texts from late imperial China, Europe, and America, Zwicker also situates the Japanese novel within a larger literary history of the novel across the global nineteenth century.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dqTaDwAAQBAJ&dq=Practices+of+the+Sentimental+Imagination:+Melodrama,+the+Novel,+and+the+Social+Imaginary+in+Nineteenth-Century+Japan+(Harvard+East+Asian+Monographs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marijuana","description":"Over the next decade, the United States is likely to face a flood of debate and state referendums proposing the legalization of marijuana production and use.

Lee. Jackson played a prominent role in nearly all military engagements in the Eastern Theater of the war until his death, and played an important part in winning many significant battles. Jackson was born in what was then part of Virginia. He received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He served in the U.S. Army during the Mexican-American War and distinguished himself at Chapultepec. From 1851 to 1863, he taught at the Virginia Military Institute, where he was unpopular with his students. During this time, he married twice. His first wife died, but his second, Mary Anna Morrison, outlived him by many years. When Virginia seceded from the Union in 1861 after the attack on Fort Sumter, Jackson followed it and joined the Confederate Army. He distinguished himself commanding a brigade at the First Battle of Bull Run the following month, providing crucial reinforcements and beating back a fierce Union assault. It was there that Barnard Elliott Bee Jr., allegedly for Jackson's courage and tenacity, compared him to a \\"stone wall,\\" which became his enduring nickname.... Mary Johnston (November 21, 1870 - May 9, 1936) was an American novelist and women's rights advocate from Virginia. She was one of America's best selling authors during her writing career and had three silent films adapted from her novels. Early life: Mary Johnston was born in the small town of Buchanan, Virginia, the eldest child of John William Johnston, an American Civil War veteran, and Elizabeth Dixon Alexander Johnston. Due to frequent illness, she was educated at home by family and tutors. She grew up with a love of books and was financially independent enough to devote herself to writing. Career as novelist Johnston wrote historical books and novels that often combined romance with history. Her first book, Prisoners of Hope (1898), dealt with colonial times in Virginia as did her second novel, To Have and to Hold (1900), and later, Sir Mortimer (1904). The Goddess of Reason (1907) uses the theme of the French Revolution, and in Lewis Rand (1908) the author portrayed political life at the dawn of the 19th century. To Have and to Hold was serialized in The Atlantic Monthly in 1899 and published in book form 1900, by Houghton Mifflin. The book proved enormously popular and was the bestselling novel in the United States in 1900. Johnston's next work, titled Audrey, was the fifth bestselling book in the U.S. in 1902, and Sir Mortimer, serialized in Harper's Monthly magazine from November 1903 through April 1904, was published in 1904. Her best-selling 1911 novel on the American Civil War, The Long Roll, brought Johnston into open conflict with Stonewall Jackson's widow, Mary Anna Jackson. Beyond her native America, Johnston's novels were also very popular in Canada and in England. During her long career Johnston wrote, in addition to 23 novels, numerous short stories, two long narrative poems, and one play. She used her fame to advocate for women's rights and strongly supported the women's suffrage movement. Her book titled Hagar (1913), considered to be one of the first feminist novels as well as somewhat autobiographical, captures the early days of women's rights. Johnston's deep focus on female suffrage in the United States is documented by her letters and correspondence with women working for the right to vote. But Hagar created a controversy among men and tradition-minded women, who were upset by the book's progressive ideas. Many refused to purchase it and subsequent Johnston novels......... Newell Convers Wyeth (October 22, 1882 - October 19, 1945), known as N. C. Wyeth, was an American artist and illustrator.

She is a master of incantation, stories, joes, mediation --and always, always the language, which she weaves in astonishing ways, almost as if it were light\\" --Jeanne Murray Walker.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1EMgAQAAIAAJ&dq=Granite+Dives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hide and seek pets","description":"Simple text challenges the reader to find a dog, a kitten, and a rabbit hidden in photographs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RNHmHAAACAAJ&dq=Hide+and+seek+pets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Orbitals in Chemistry: A Modern Guide for Students","description":"This text presents a unified and up-to-date discussion of the role of atomic and molecular orbitals in chemistry, from the quantum mechanical foundations to the recent developments and applications. The discussion is mainly qualitative, largely based on symmetry arguments. It is felt that a sound mastering of the concepts and qualitative interpretations is needed, especially when students are becoming more and more familiar with numerical calculations based on atomic and molecular orbitals. The text is mathematically less demanding than most traditional quantum chemistry books but still retains clarity and rigour. The physical insight is maximized and abundant illustrations are used. The relationships between the more formal quantum mechanical formalisms and the traditional chemical descriptions of chemical bonding are critically established. This book is of primary interest to undergraduate chemistry students and others taking courses of which chemistry is a significant part.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f2kYm62CrkQC&dq=Orbitals+in+Chemistry:+A+Modern+Guide+for+Students&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jenny","description":"In Jenny Goes to Sea, our heroine makes her passage on the good ship Sea Queen with her master, Captain Tinker, and her adopted brothers, tiger cat Edward, and black-and-white cat Checkers.

Seasonal festivals are combined with the rediscovery of shamanic techniques and an emphasis on grounded empiricism. Considering the everyday world of food, health, sex, work, and leisure to be sacred, Pagans oppose that which threatens life such as deforestation, overdevelopment, nuclear power and invoke ancient deities in this struggle for the well-being of the earth and its inhabitants. Contemporary Paganism presents a broad-based introduction to the main trends of contemporary Paganism, revealing the origins and practical aspects of Druidry, Witchcraft, Heathenism, Goddess Spirituality and Magic, Shamanism, and Geomancy among others. Making use of both traditional history and the movement's more imaginative sources, Harvey reveals how Paganism and its central focus on individual and social life is evolving and how this new religion perceives and relates to more traditional ones.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IjZ_tPnW7VgC&dq=Contemporary+Paganism:+Listening+People,+Speaking+Earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pittsburgh memoranda","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FZEBAAAAMAAJ&dq=Pittsburgh+memoranda&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pain Free at Your PC","description":"Using a computer doesn't have to hurt.

Consider Dorothy Gilliam, who in 1961 became the first black woman reporter hired by The Washington Post, or Bob Herbert, who in 1993 became the first black columnist at The New York Times, or even Mark Whitaker, who in 1998 became the first black editor of one of America's three major newsweeklies, Newsweek. These are just a few of the trailblazers who overcame obstacles to rise to the highest echelons of the media world. Prior to the 1960s, however, African Americans working for the predominantly white media were few and far between. After the subsiding of the dramatic civil rights demonstrations that shook most of America out of complacent acceptance of the status quo, the hiring of African-American news people slowed for a time before accelerating in the 1970, gaining real speed in the 1980s and 1990s. By the dawning of the new millennium, African Americans in the news media had achieved a sort of critical mass. This two-volume biographical encyclopedia chronicles the success stories and considerable strides made by over 240 African American media figures from newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and the Internet. The most influential and often groundbreaking reporters, columnists, editors, publishers, broadcasters, and even talk show hosts are all included here. Each in-depth biography discusses the individual's achievements and struggles along with more personal and career information. Numerous primary source documents-including newspaper and magazine articles, columns, and radio and television transcripts-give readers first-hand accounts from the newsrooms. Unlike other reference workscurrently available, this timely encyclopedia emphasizes those African Americans who are currently working in the news media. Among the featured: BLBob Herbert, syndicated columnist, The New York Times BLRichard D. Parsons, CEO, Time Warner BLLeonard Pitts, syndicated columnist, Tribune Media Services BLClarence Page, syndicated columnist, Chicago Tribune BLStanley Crouch, columnist, New York Daily News BLDerrick Johnson, columnist, The Boston Globe BLEd Bradley, correspondent, 60 Minutes on CBS BLLester Holt, anchor and show host, MSNBC BLCharlayne Hunter-Gault, foreign correspondent, NPR BLGwen Ifill, correspondent and moderator, PBS BLRobert L.

Educators using the theory have achieved remarkable success in helping all students, including those who learn in nontraditional ways, to navigate school (and life outside it) with confidence and success. Within the context of classroom instruction, no author besides Gardner has done more to popularize MI theory than Thomas Armstrong, whose best seller Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom has become a bona fide education classic in its own right. This expanded fourth edition provides educators at all levels with everything they need to apply MI theory to curriculum development, lesson planning, assessment, special education, cognitive skills, career development, educational policy, and more. In addition to the many strategies, templates, and examples that have made Armstrong s book so enduringly popular, this edition is updated to examine how emerging neurodiversity research, trends toward greater instructional personalization, and rapidly evolving virtual learning tools have affected the use of MI theory to enhance student achievement. It also includes brand-new lesson plans aligned to nationwide standards and a revised list of resources for further study.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3NRBDwAAQBAJ&dq=Multiple+Intelligences+in+the+Classroom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One time, I saw morning come home;: A remembrance","description":"A young couple growing up in a small Utah town in the 1930's.
