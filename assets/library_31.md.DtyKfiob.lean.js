It gave a great sense of how life changed for him as lifestyles were changing for all Americans (and the entertainment industry) during wartime and the advent of television. I learned much about his various films and projects. I definitely recommend this for anyone who is a fan (not fanatic) of Gene Kelly's work.

This \\"biography\\" by Alvin Yudkoff is filled with so much inaccuracy and conjecture I started marking the pages where I could prove his information was wrong. There were at least a hundred post it notes by the time I was done. I even turned it into a paper for my film class- proving how inaccurate this biography is. I got an A. All the proof you need is to watch any of Gene Kelly's movies, read his ex-wife Betsy Blair's autobiography, or read Clive Hirschhorn's biography. Yukoff even took direct quotes from Hirschhorn's book and twisted them around to suit his own agenda. Unlike Yudkoff, Hirschhorn DID personally interview Kelly and his friends.And it was so maddening to read while Yudkoff purported to know direct conversations between Kelly and his family and friends, or the thoughts running through Kelly's head while at the AFI celebration of his work. I can't figure out why someone who claims to be a fan would churn out such drivel and paint the fabulous Gene Kelly as a horrible person who thinks he's better than everyone. I have read other biographies of Debbie Reynolds, Stanley Donen, and Betty Garrett and I am not fooling myself into thinking Kelly wasn't fallible. I realize he had drive that was hard for other people to take, but NO ONE else painted him out as mean just to be mean. Just as a man dedicated to his craft. Yudkoff should never have written this book of lies."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"Film students will find this biography of Gene Kelly provides new insights on the man, based on new research and interviews with people who knew and worked closely with the danger. From Kelly's early Depression year dance schools to his fame on the Broadway stage and his move to Hollywood, biographer Alvin Yudkoff provides an excellent coverage."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"I'm going to second (third, fourth, etc.) the comments about the technique used in this book. To pretend to know what Gene Kelly was thinking during the AFI awards night is misleading at best. There was quite an uproar with the Reagan biography &quot;Dutch&quot; because its author inserted himself in the book and fictionalized conversations, etc. I kept thinking about that as I read this book. It's true, as some others have stated, that Yudkoff probably based these &quot;thoughts&quot; on things Kelly said in other interviews or contexts. That doesn't excuse the his attempts to claim these were Kelly's actual thoughts, reactions, and emotions. I truly think this is an unforgivable technique. Another customer reviewer mentioned the style used in a Masters/Ph.D thesis (and was happy it *wasn't* used here). My thought is that anyone writing such a thesis would never have been allowed to create thoughts and conversations to illustrate his/her points/assumptions about his/her subject. Why was Yudkoff allowed to do so by his editor(s)?I also have to agree with others who believe that more time should have been given to the latter part of Kelly's life. Or, alternatively, the author should have dropped the last few pages and stated from the outset that the book deals only with a specific period of Kelly's life. If Kelly could somehow read this book, I wonder what his reaction would be to having the last forty years or so of his life dismissed as being so unimportant and bereft of significance that they warranted a mere thirty pages.The lack of direct quotes from the author's own interviews, and especially the lack of quotes from people closest to Kelly, makes me wonder what support Yudkoff had for this book, and, more importantly, WHY he got that reaction from them.On the plus side, I learned things about Kelly that I never knew, including that I've missed a lot of his movies. The information about his childhood and dance background certainly makes me appreciate him even more. But I think that I'll look for Hirschhorn's biography to read what I hope is a more objective work."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"This is a rather strange little tome that succeeds to some extent almost in spite of itself. It has a cheap look and feel. It is not especially well-written, and it contains many, many factual errors. But it nevertheless turns out to be a fairly interesting read -- especially once Gene hits the big-time on Broadway and in Hollywood. (The first -- and dullest -- part of the book contains way too much detail about Gene's life and times running his chain of dance studios in Pittsburgh, PA, and the surrounding 'burghs. This part may be of some regional interest to those from the Pittsburgh area, but otherwise it can easily be skipped by the reader.) In any event, the author takes the high road throughout, focusing almost exclusively on Gene's many professional successes (and, of course, a few major failures) as he climbed the ladder to 1940s and 1950s superstardom. A bit more information about Gene's family life, particularly with his first wife, actress Betsy Blair (who was blacklisted as a Commie sympathizer during the Red scare of the '50s, and had to leave the United States to find work -- which this book doesn't mention, by the way, and who, also by the way, a few years ago wrote a wonderful and heartfelt memoir of her exceptional life -- including the periods before and after her marriage to Gene -- entitled \\"The Memory of All That,\\" that is well worth reading) and his three children, might have added some additional interest. But it would also appear Gene may have had a few . . . ummmmm . . . pecadillos (concerning his attraction to \\"barely legal\\" young ladies -- one of whom, the aforementioned Betsy Blair, he married when he was over thirty and she was just 18) that are best left to the imagination, so the author's discretion in terms of Gene's personal life may be a blessing in disguise. Anyway, this is not a bad book for what is it, and it may come in handy as a ready-reference the next time \\"For Me and My Gal,\\" \\"Cover Girl,\\" \\"An American in Paris,\\" \\"Singin' in the Rain,\\" \\"Brigadoon,\\" and many other film's graced by Gene's one-of-kind talent appears on TV. But if you want a true taste of Gene's genius, get ahold of a copy of the DVD entitled \\"Gene Kelly: Anatomy of Dancer.\\""},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"It is sad that the errors that were noted by the other reviewers have marred the book. I did not know they were there and so what I got from this book was this fantastically gifted man and the passions of his life. This compact life is really full of drama. The monologues, debated in other comments, are based on the things Kelly expressed in other ways, as I understand it, but they weren't necessary. I was not bothered by the concise description of the many long years of fizzles and disappointments in Kelly's later life. I can recommend this book as a very enjoyable read, and quite good for young readers, but it seems clear a big, fat, long, unimpeachably correct bio would make a lot of other people happy."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"I love Gene Kelly but I don't love this book. I don't see the point in the AFI tribute, just get to the history. The only good thing I can say about this book is that Gene Kelly's talent and determination come through, but that is nothing the author did, that was Gene Kelly and you can get that from any book, any movie, and any story told about him."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"I'm glad I read this book. I've admired Gene Kelly's dancing and his movies, and I learned enough from this book to really enhance my appreciation the next time I watch his work. I enjoyed the glimpses provided by this book of Broadway, Hollywood, and politics of his time. It was fun to get to know some of the famous characters Kelly encountered, and imagine what the evenings might have been like at Gene and Betsy Kelly's open houses.That having been said, the book clearly could have been more. In most of the text, I felt like I was observing Kelly from a distance, seeing interesting pieces of him that begged for more elaboration, more insight. I had a hard time trusting the device the author used to get us closer to him, Gene's internal dialog while at the awards show, because it seemed to go beyond what the author could have known about him, based on the rest of the text. And the writing itself could have used closer editing: I found unclear sentences, erratic paragraph transitions, and the same Gene Kelly quote repeated in the space of about ten pages.Not having read anything else substantial about Gene Kelly, I would recommend this book as a good way to learn a lot about him."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"As a great fan of Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire I am pretty familiar with many facts concerning both of their lives. Apart from the misleading &quot;thoughts&quot; that Gene Kelly should have had during the AFI Awards, which is the author's invention,nearly 60 % of the describing of this Gala is wrong: Fred Astaire could not have talked to his younger wife, as she was not there. The younger lady with him was his daughter Ava! The author also let Fred Astaire's first wife die five years prior to her original death. So that was not the reason for Mr.Astaires first retirement. The list could go on forever. The book makes a nice reading, unfortunately many facts are totally wrong."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"This is a very poorly-written biography, and a particular disappointment in that it is the first substantial work on the dancer for 25 years. In fact, the author Alvin Yudkoff seems to rely heavily on Clive Hirschhorn's earlier work, along with many other secondary sources. What it lacks is an original perspective on an undoubtedly complex, yet pioneering Hollywood star.Yudkoff meanders between hero worship and tell-tale anecdote. He uses Kelly's 1985 acceptance of the AFI Life Achievement Award in an attempt to enter the star's psyche, a highly presumptious framework for any biographer to use. And shoddy research is apparent in a number of factual errors, incuding misspelt names (the director Leo McCarey becomes McCrary; Evelyn Keyes is Evelyn Knight) and chronological discrepancies (for instance, Fred Astaire did not retire from films in 1946 because he was mourning his wife's death; she died in 1954).I hope Gene Kelly's long-awaited autobiography, in the hands of his third wife, will do justice to the memory of the man himself. I do not doubt that he was a difficult, often egocentric person. But without that side to his personality, we would not have his legacy. Do yourself a favour: watch Cover Girl or On the Town to honour Gene Kelly's memory, and leave this feeble book on the shelf."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"I dislike 'chummy' biographies, the kind where the biographer latches on to a phrase or two that was probably a chance observation or private joke, then over-uses it to show his subject's funny, human side. In A LIFE OF DANCE AND DREAMS by Alvin Yudkoff, that term that so annoyed me was 'cloop,'a description of seedy nightclubs the Kelly's sometimes worked in, which combined the words 'club' and 'chicken coop.' Ad nauseum. There is a running account of Kelly ungraciously sitting through still another ceremony of recognition of his accomplishments while celebrity friends like Shirley MacLaine and Jimmy Stewart praise him to the appreciative audience. Kelly's mind wanders, he fidgets and daydreams, and often begins to speak or stand out of turn. We are privy to what he is 'really' thinking while tired clips of his films are shown. He comes across as crass, and I suppose he must have been. Much time is spent prattling about &quot;The Game.&quot; The Game was apparently the hottest event in Hollywood at one time. Stars like Sinatra would often fly in for a mad evening of cut-throat charades at the Kelly house, risking ridicule from the host if they didn't play well, followed by hard-core volleyball once the sun rose. Who knew? So we hear that Kelly was overbearing and forced his way into every aspect of productions he worked on, had a black-listed communist for a first wife and skipped the country to his beloved France, for tax purposes, but he was an exceedingly nice guy, especially to Judy Garland-lug of a hard-working Irish Catholic boy form Pittsburgh that he was. His life seems full of resentment despite his easy smile, and whether accurate or not, it is NOT interesting reading. It took a long time to finish this book. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, let alone a fan."},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"I have a hunch the authors of the two customer reviews I have just read - - one from Bloomington, Indiana, the other from Philadelphia - - are very much like me; female, long-time Gene Kelly devotees with a passion for his films, who have gone out of our way over the years to absorb the countless interviews (thousands by Kelly's own reckoning) in print and radio and TV when Gene reminisced about his life and career, the joyous moments and the disappointing ones, and expressed his forthright opinions and ideas.And because he was and is our idol, the head of the class, we surely paid attention. What he had to say really sunk in. Accordingly, self-appointed scholars of Gene Kelly's life and times, we tend to grade ourselves as the only Phi Beta Kappas around. We are the smartass know-alls who own the guy.But familiarity breeds conceit; the danger for us overheated Kelly fans is we begin to think we are the sole keepers of the flame. When somebody comes along with a fresh perspective, as does Alvin Yudkoff in the new biography &quot;Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams,&quot; all too often we go ballistic. We feel angry, almost violated and immediately join the &quot;gotcha!&quot; gang, almost lusting to ferret out inaccuracies of fact or attitude. We resist any imaginative approach to the telling of the life of a remarkable, and very complicated, man.A perfect example of such behavior is offered up by Lisa from Bloomington who, perhaps because Gene was a magnificent tap dancer, obsessively looks for footnotes, footnotes and more footnotes. (Sorry, I can't resist this not-so-wisecrack but I am always irritated by someone who primly expects a readable, riveting biography like this one to be a heavy PhD thesis with droning sidebars identifying sources - - such as a 1947 article in Cahiers du Cinema or snatches from a long-ago conversation on the Hillcrest golf course - - that only interrupt the overall narration flow.)So Lisa buys the book and is &quot;disappointed&quot; with the author's technique which she finds &quot;irritating.&quot;She is referring, of course, to the author's choice of the American Film Institute's honoring of Gene Kelly in a 1985 CBS telecast, a very real event, as the launching pad, the imaginative matrix for the biography, allowing us to go back and forth in time, taking in the flow of Gene's feelings and thoughts, so we can begin to understand his life as he saw it. A cinematic technique, if you will, but what better way to render a film icon?And the point that this particular &quot;gotcha!&quot; groupie still hasn't got is that Kelly's thoughts, like his voice-over in a film, are not flights of fancy, cobbled together by the author. They are based (surely we, the avid Kellyites, know this) on the above cited, wide-ranging interviews Gene gave out for over fifty years. So when Kelly &quot;thinks&quot; badly of Cary Grant... or dwells on his creative differences with Stanley Donen and Barbra Streisand... or worries about his aging mother and the upbringing of his own family (and where oh where does Lisa get the idea that this book implies Kelly was a lousy father?)... or, like Fred Astaire incidentally, suffers from a phobia of being at a social event only to be asked by a well-meaning woman to dance with her - - like Vivian Leigh in the encounter cited by Lisa - - expecting an unrehearsed Nirvana on the dance floor with Kelly, as gallant as ever, hating to disappoint - - all these truly biographical nuggets of interest obviously come out of the author's extensive archival research. It's what he does with the research that makes his book worth reading.As it happens, just to show I'm not a consummate grouch, let me say I am much more in accord with your second reviewer, the Gene Kelly Home Page host from Philadelphia. She points out an error involving Vera-Ellen but doesn't make a fuss about it. In a calm and measured way she praises the research and writing. Most importantly she appears to be in tune with the way the book is organized but feels there should have been much more attention to the post-stardom years, 1952-1996 when rock and roll came in and Kelly was literally out of the picture. I agree with her when she says &quot;the second half of Gene's life deserves at least as much time as the first half.&quot;One thing is almost certain, to come back to Lisa who ends her tirade with: &quot;Anyway, it makes me hope Gene Kelly's autobiography will still be published. There is definitely a place for it.&quot;So do I - - but let's do a reality check, please; the odds are that it does not exist. It is four years since his passing. As the book under discussion goes into very sympathetically Gene had a lot of trouble completing his own literary, playwriting and screenwriting endeavors. He set standards for himself that were difficult to meet. Evidence points toward the certainty that his notes were incinerated when his Beverly Hills home burned down in the Christmas fire of 1983. So until something comes along that does it better, I'll continue to recommend &quot;Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams.&quot;"},{"Title":"Gene Kelly: A Life of Dance and Dreams","review":"I should start by saying I didn't read the whole book.

In fact, he says in the Introduction that the fierce controversy over the kingdom of heaven in the past hundred years is actually &quot;a rich source of instruction to the attentive observer. It is above all the confirmation that the power of divine truth which finds its sublime and most variegated expression in the gospel of the kingdom of heaven again and again triumphs over all human limitations and commitments.&quot;Ridderbos puts the kingdom of God in its rightful place at the very center of the gospel preached by Jesus: &quot;the whole of the preaching of Jesus Christ and his apostles is concerned with the kingdom of God, and...in Jesus Christ's proclamation of the kingdom we are face to face with the specific form of expression of the whole of his revelation of God.&quot;If reading this book attentively does not bring you into a quietly intense frame of worship and thanksgiving, you're just not paying attention. It's not pop theology. But it does amply reward the effort it requires."},{"Title":"The coming of the kingdom","review":"'The history of salvation is the heart of the New Testament kerygma.'p xxiiiGerman liberal theology had shown an upsurge in eschatological analyses when Ridderbos re-stated the authenticity of Scripture. Especially the Gospel narratives had come under intense scrutiny and criticism by anti-supernaturalists. Of course, as the obvious title (and quote above) to this present volume implies, they have to be rejected. The claims of Jesus, Ridderbos will show, take precedence over everything else.To the future revelation of kingly glory Ridderbos attached certain provisos:'The kingdom of God is not a state or condition, not a society created and promoted by men. It will not come through an immanent earthly evolution, nor through human moral action; it is not men who prepare it for God. The kingdom of heaven is, therefore, absolutely transcendent in its origin, it is the revelation of God's glory. Viewed from the human standpoint, therefore, the kingdom of heaven is in the first place something to keep praying and waiting for with perseverance.' p 24In opposition to every kind of metaphysics, Ridderbos believes the revelation of the kingdom is the revelation of Christ, thereby emphasizing the christological character of the evangelical message. The incarnation led to the proclamation which led to the realization. 'The manifestation of the kingdom of heaven cannot be conceived as an impersonal metaphysical event, but the coming of God Himself as king. This conception is borne out by a whole series of parables about the kingdom of God.' p 25 The stage is set for a redemptive-historical supremacy in hermeneutics by doing justice to both the eschatological view and the present character of the kingdom. 'On the other hand, the parables indicate the special veiled way in which the kingdom has come. The wisdom offered in it, the mysteries revealed in it, are only knowable to those who have been privileged to understand the fundamental truth: the coming of the kingdom in Christ.' p 127Much modern exegesis equates Israel's rejection of their Messiah as a postponement of the coming of the kingdom, yet both John the Baptist and then Jesus Himself proclaimed that the kingdom of God was at hand in the person of Christ the Messiah. To be sure, New Testament writers linked the coming of the kingdom with the first advent of our Messiah. 'We have seen that the Old Testament most often speaks of its coming as the coming of a person. The same observations hold for Jesus' use of the word 'basileia'. Until now we have translated it as kingdom, but in Greek it may mean kingship, kingly dominion, and kingdom. There is no doubt that the former sense, especially that of dominion as the exercise of royal dignity, is the most prominent usage of the word in various central pronouncements.' pp. 24-25 'Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!' exclaimed Nathanael.Moreover, Ridderbos cautions us not to forcibly narrow the meaning of the kingdom by absolutizing only a certain aspect at the expense of others. 'It may not for a moment be doubted that John saw the Messiah in Him. Nor is there any doubt possible that John's description of the Messiah's importance passes far beyond the nationalistic Messiah-ideal, and is entirely dominated by the thought of the transcendent and universal judgment which will attend the appearance of the coming king.' p 29 It is not to be exclusively restricted to the perspective of the restoration of Israel and the subjugation of her enemies.'In Col 2:15 Paul speaks of the conquest of the principalities and powers as having in principle been accomplished in the cross of Christ. In Rom 8:38-39 he assumes that even now Christ so reigns over and controls death and life, and principalities and powers, as to preclude every separation of the Christian from the love of God in Him.' Geerhardus Vos,The Pauline Eschatologyp 245Conversely, Ridderbos cautions 'Yet it should not be conceived of as exclusively future. Again and again it appears that the salvation of the kingdom is assigned to the disciples and the faithful in general as a present reality. To Zacchaeus of Jericho Jesus says with great emphasis: 'This day is salvation come to this house.' (Luke 19:9) The 'receiving' of the kingdom must needs be understood as something that precedes the 'entry' into it.' p 79 Central to the messianic mission of the incarnate Redeemer, Ridderbos asserted that 'The evangelists want to indicate that Jesus' word and work revealed the absolute, the supernatural, and the divine in such a way that even the multitude could not but be aware of it.' p 74An illuminating study on the already-and-not-yet character of the kingdom is realized here. The persistent interpolation in Ridderbos' work between the coming of the kingdom in Christ, and its future coming in glory, Ridderbos ontologically interrelates as 'the fact that the final coming of the kingdom of God is entirely based on God's action.' p 146 The reader evokes much comfort from the fact that Ridderbos, who was highly familiar with Scripture, did not impose his own theory or ideas, but remained conscious of letting the Word speak for itself, as if he were determined to fix his mind, heart and strength exclusively on the Lord Jesus Christ. Only this can account for why Ridderbos invests in this monumental study so much attention to the testimony of the synoptic gospels.'There can be no doubt that in Jesus' preaching the great future perspective has been maintained. So every conception that the kingdom of heaven is an exclusively religious-ethical good, a spiritual community or a social order within the limits of this world is in open conflict with the gospel.' p 43"},{"Title":"The coming of the kingdom","review":"I bought this book hoping to obtain a deeper understanding and appreciation for what the Kingdom of God as understood biblically. Ridderbos' work is of the highest caliber and exhaustive in its scope. The only reason I gave it four stars is beacause it is a very challenging read. It's not a book you can simply pick up and read, you have to really work at understanding it and following it. Mainly I think because of the abruptness due to it being a translation. (Doesn't flow as fluently as a native English book would).For someone completely unfamiliar with the Kingdom of God idea and/or not needing a seminary-level discussion of the idea, I would strongly recommend looking at George Eldon Ladd's Book on the same topic. Much less dense. Probably not as scholarly in terms of dealing with liberal lines of thinking (Such as Culmann, Barth, Bultmann, Schweitzer, etc.) but my guess a good start for someone not adept at liberal theology and the historical debates raging around the gospels and the nature of the kingdom."},{"Title":"The coming of the kingdom","review":"Ridderbos does an excelent job at interpreting Jesus' preaching of the kingdom in the synoptic gospels.

I used this book while designing new pages for my website and found that every question I could pose was answered. Some of the features that I found exceptionally useful in the HTML section were the browser comparison charts and the character entities chart. The CGI section is broken down in easy to understand categories, making your search for information a breeze. The overview at the beginning of the section is also a very good refresher or introduction. If you ever wondered what those pesky HTTP error codes mean, such as the infamous &quot;Error 404 - Not Found&quot;. The HTTP section is the place to find out. The JavaScript section like the CGI section is very well organized with excellent explanations and examples. The Server Configuration section has sections for Unix based servers, (i.e. Apache, CERN), as well as Windows based servers, (i.e. Website for Windows95 and Windows NT server). A section on Netscape server configuration is also included. My thought on the book is that it is a &quot;must have&quot;. Then O'Reilly goes and makes it the Deluxe edition by adding the Web Developer's library on CD-ROM. On this CD you have electronic access to Webmaster in a Nutshell, plus four other outstanding books. The books included on the CD are: HTML: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition., JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition., CGI Programming on the World Wide Web, Programming Perl, 2nd Edition., and Webmaster in a Nutshell. Not only can you read them, they have dynamic search engines that make finding the right section a snap. I could write a book singing the praises of this CD, or at least a very long short story.

Motzkin's explanations of the vowels and consonants and various exceptions to rules were clear, and the book is well organized, too. After completing the ten lessons, I can follow along in services. If that is your goal, too, then this is the book for you.

At the end of &quot;Aleph Isn't Tough&quot;, most of our students were clamouring to go on to &quot;Aleph Isn't Enough&quot; and we will be starting that class shortly.I would highly recommend this book to anyone thinking of teaching a Hebrew class or anyone wishing to learn to READ Hebrew on their own.

The first page sets off the mysterious tone that is consistent through out this original novel. Szerb is not afraid to explore unconventional themes such as androgyny, homoeroticism, and incest.

Each chapter is a new adventure and unravels new clues to piece Mihaly's obsession with finding Eva, who is the closest thing to Tamas he can physically see and hear. This book posses many questions about the way each mind works. Each mind is a different world. Mihaly's infatuation with death is an extension of his childhood. He refuses to let go of the past and as a result, it is interfering with his present life. He cannot grow mentally, emotionally, or spiritually if he does not give up his unhealthy idolization towards Tamas and figure out his feelings towards Eva. This book also serves as a great tool towards art history and culture. The story is a journey through many cities as well as the self. Through Mihaly's longing for death, encounters with old friends and new relationships he finally learns how to live and appreciate life.

Throughout the story, the reader is forced to wonder what Milhay is going to do next, and what his final decision regarding his wife will be.Like so many of us do today, Milhay allowed the ghost of his past to overtake and write his future. As morally wrong as it was to abandon his wife on their honeymoon, I could not help but relate with him. Szerb gave me the opportunity to remember what it was like to feel that first obsession and devotion to best friends, and dwell upon the ghosts of the past follow one through everyday routines. I can't deny I felt the pangs of sadness as he did when he thought of his old love and could not help feel the same vulnerability as he did when wanting to bring the past to life again.\\"The Traveler,\\" is a heartening story of a man who was lost, found himself in the heat of passion, and got lost again, while affecting the lives of others through his decisions."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"This novel is about a man named Mihaly who is trying to find happiness with his life and with himself.

On his journey the author subtly reveals though Mihaly topics that would be considered to be taboo especially since the book was written during the era around World War II. These topics include homosexuality, bondage, masochism, and the idea of death being tied to eroticism. I give the book 5 stars because these topics are still almost taboo today.

The best way for me to describe \\"The Traveler\\" without giving away any crucial details, would be to say that it's like a puzzle that is half way done, when a gust of wind takes the pieces and scatters them in all directions.I personally felt that the story was intriguing. To see these people go back and forth and make mistake was refreshing, realistic, and very original. Although one would think it was that perfect and expected ending the truth is it wasn't. I appreciated reading this story because unlike other books I have read in the past it left me with a sense of closure and understanding. On the other hand I found that there were times when I didn't know who was saying what, which had me having to reread many passages.

The novel is focused mainly on one man, Mihaly, but delves into the lives of a few other important characters and their involvement with him.The novel begins in Italy where Mihaly is on his honeymoon with his wife, Erzi. Here they encounter a childhood friend of Mihaly's. This encounter leads to Mihaly telling his wife about the strange childhood he had and his special group of friends. She finds out that he was really close to two siblings, Tamas and Eva. Mihaly even claimed to love this Tamas but not in a homosexual way. After they both disappear and Tamas commits suicide, Mihaly is left depressed.

At the end of the novel, Mihaly regains his will to live and he returns home with his father.This translation by Peter Hargitai does a good job of delivering the story in a most profound way. The novel deals with the underlying ideas of homosexuality, androgyny, death eroticism and the femme fatale. All of these ideas were not apparent to me at first but the translator clarifies these references in his insightful afterword. This novel is definitely worth reading and I can see why it is considered a Hungarian classic."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Antal Szerb challenged the stereotype of the sexes and conventional morality, but he also helped show us that if we conform to society's values then we won't find who we really are.The book is about a man named Mihaly who on his marriage night left his wife and was on a quest to find himself. At a young age he loved a women named Eva, and Tamas, Eva's brother was his best friend. This is where we see the androgyny of the sexes come into play; Tamas and Mihaly both had feminine characteristics and tended to be very passive. Eva was the aggressive dominating type such as a males characteristic, and when they were young she would do some weird things to both of them. Tamas was in love with his sister and wanted to be with her, but that wasn't possible so he committed suicide. Mihaly was infatuated with Tamas which creates the idea of homosexuality in the book.

In the past, unspoken topics such as death eroticism, homosexuality, and incest, would have never reached classrooms. As unconscious movements have been opening doors and loosening the screws of life- books like these- are now appreciated and studied all around the world. Looking at the title, The Traveler, and analyzing it-Mihaly- the main character definitely traveled far beyond the expectations of the social world. By placing a profound amount of attention of character description, a reader is easily connected to each character and is able to empathize with precarious subjects. As the novel progresses, questions such as if Mihaly is a closeted homosexual or a friend, Tamas, is commiting sexual acts with his own sister keeps the suspense of it all alive. Mihaly clearly betrayed his youth by getting married young and is on a last minute search for what he wants in life while on his honeymoon.

Some of the issues discussed in the novel include androgyny, death eroticism, and one's rite of passage. The main character, Mihaly, is a man who goes on a honeymoon with his wife, Erszi. During this time, Mihaly begins to distance himself from his wife and seeks to find his true self. While on his journey to find himself, he meets several different people along the way, many of whom were from his past.

He begins to reason with the situation which he is faced with and decides that it is best for him not to go home until he truly finds himself. He remains isolated from the people who want him home including his wife and family who have no idea where he is. Throughout his quest for self discovery, Mihaly's many characteristics are seen. The most noticeable attribute that he possesses deals with the androgyny issue which seems to be a big part of his personality. As the story unfolds, the reader will come to find how Mihaly is very dependent upon his family as well as his wife for various different reasons. Also, Mihaly tends to be a passive person compared to his wife Erzsi and his long time friend Eva who hold aggressive personalities.

Peter Hargitai's translation made it very easy for me to understand. The novel starts of with the first section called \\"The Honeymoon\\". The main character Mihaly is on his honeymoon in Italy, a place where he has always wanted to visit. Although this time with his new wife should've been magical and romantic, Mihaly leaves his wife Erzsi during their honeymoon. She is madly in love with him, but Mihaly feels differently. As Mihaly roams Italy, he begins to recap his past with friends and memories of his loves Tamas and Eva. We learn how Mihaly and his friend Tamas loved each other so much, that they even tried to kill themselves together. Antal Szerb's constant connection with death eroticism kept me flipping pages. We also learn how Mihaly and Tamas were great examples of androgyny. Androgyny indicates a blurring of the traditional role of men and women. He revisits the childhood games and how they would sometimes be the hopeless ones being thrown around by a dominant woman such as Eva. The second section of this novel is \\"The Fugitive.\\" In this section of the novel we learn how Mihaly is trying to escape a life of consistency, in which he had with Erzsi before he abandoned her. Section three is called \\"Rome\\". In this part of the book he tried to find his answers to his obsession with death while traveling Rome, but only makes his life even more confusing. Lastly the final section is entitled \\"Hell's Gate\\". Here Antal Szerb ties in the entire book. In this section the character understands that the past is the past. He learns he can not change what has happened and he needs to move on. In this novel we discover how Mihaly longed to find himself. I believe Antal Szerb chose the right title for this book. Mihaly is definitely traveling in life to find himself. I gave this book four out of five stars because it is very well written and many readers could unquestionably relate to this novel. I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler, written by Antal Szerb and translated by Peter Hargatai is an interesting story depicting the journeys of a man in search of meaning in his life. The book is divided into four sections. The first section, \\"The Honeymoon\\", describes Mih&aacute;ly's first trip with his new wife to Italy. The trip itself makes Mih&aacute;ly reminisce in great detail of his childhood spent in the home of the Ulipus's with his two childhood friends Ev&aacute; and Tam&aacute;s. Mih&aacute;ly is reminded of the death of Tam&aacute;s, which still haunts him. The second section is \\"The Fugitive\\", in this section Mih&aacute;ly is desperately trying to escape from a life of conformity, which is what his new wife, Erzsi represented and whom he leaves abandoned in a train station bound for Rome. Mih&aacute;ly is still dealing with his past and with the confusion of his life purpose. He has these desires with death that he can not explain. He locates his childhood friend, Ervin in the mountains of Italy and seeks his advice. After meeting with Ervin, he instructs that Mih&aacute;ly go to Rome. Section three, \\"Rome\\" is Mih&aacute;ly's searches for the answers to his problems. Rome, however brings many more complications that cause Mih&aacute;ly to become further hopeless. The very last section, \\"Hell's Gate\\" ties the other sections in, to bring an end to the book. It is the end for Mih&aacute;ly, he overcomes his weak character and victimizing role and realizes the past is dead and can not be brought back to life, it shows that Mih&aacute;ly has overcome his fears and would rather choose to live life. The book was very interesting to read, being as the setting took place in Italy, in which I have visited many times I was able to relate a little more. I think that Mih&aacute;ly's childhood really set the storyline for his future. In the Ulpius house, he, Ev&aacute;, and Tam&aacute;s had broken away from the world of conformity; they had immersed themselves into historical and fantasy themed theatrics. After the death of Tam&aacute;s and disappearance of Ev&aacute;, Mih&aacute;ly began to conform to the normality's of life.

It may take a few reads to truly understand the deep ties that lie between Mihaly and his old friends and to understand the internal conflicts that Mihaly faces but it is a good story about finding your own way in life."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"\\"The Traveler\\" written by Hungarian author Antal Szerb and translated by Peter Hargitai is a unique novel. The story is about the struggle of a man trying to find himself. Mihaly is the main character, a thirty-six year old man who is celebrating his honeymoon in Italy, a country where he has always wanted to visit. Mihaly during his honeymoon travels to many different cities and recounts his childhood thoughts about death which he shared with his childhood loves Tamas and Eva. He reminisces about Eva, who he claims he never loved the way he loves his wife. He also speaks about his friend Tamas who he loved very much and was so close to that they even attempted to kill themselves together. He is mainly concerned with his past and trying to figure out who he was through his past experiences. The Traveler is a novel which I thoroughly enjoyed reading. The unique story of a Mihaly's journey keeps you interested as soon as you start to understand his past. The book is captivating because it is very easy to understand and the main character grasps your attention the moment you start reading. I enjoyed reading this novel because it was very well written and easy to understand. I give this book four out of five stars."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Did you have a best friend growing up? Do you still have a best friend? If you did, or if you do, you know that a child's best friend could easily mold and influence the person they are to become in the future. A friendship can barely scrap the surface of someone's life or affect it crucially. Imagine having two best friends growing up, one with whom you are infatuated, and who in reality are not the two people you believe them to be? \\"Show me who your friends are and I will show you who you are\\"; this is something that my mother has always repeated to me time and again -for Mih&aacute;ly, the book's main character, this is an inevitable and inescapable truth.Mih&aacute;ly grew up in Hungary with a very select group of friends whom all accompanied him throughout the book, from the beginning to the very end. As time went by all of them dispersed and continued with their individual lives but on Mih&aacute;ly's honeymoon, everyone all of a sudden emerged almost from thin air and caused Mih&aacute;ly's life to take very interesting twists and turns. Mih&aacute;ly's friends had influenced every one of his decisions, actions, and thoughts and throughout the book they continued to do so until the bitter end. The Traveler is the story of a man's codependency on his friends to be able to accept and be comfortable with his life and himself.The Traveler, by Antal Szerb, is truly mind perplexing literature; each chapter the author skips to and from new characters on different corners of the globe and at different time periods. Because of Szerb's maze-like writing you never want to put the book down. The ending of one page just makes you more eager to read the next just to be able to see what will happen, to whom, where, and when. The Traveler will keep you guessing and on your toes till the very end."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"I must say this Novel is very interesting. The way it flows from one scene to another may be a bit confusing at first. However, this is a coming of age Novel about love, trust, and deceit. Mihaly, the main character marries Erszi, who is intended to be the love of his life among his peers, or is she? He strangely leaves her to search for his true love, Eva. Erszi surprisingly catches on to his deviancy early on. She notices he is very taken by younger women. As he continues to travel in the opposite direction as Erszi. Zoltan appears. Zoltan is Erszi's ex-husband who is still and always will be in love with. In his twisted mind he believes he is the only one who can bring her truly happiness. With Mihaly looking for a way out, Zoltan was ready and waiting to give him one. They join forces. Nonetheless, through all the places he travels and old friends he sees, he finds Eva but before they meeting thoughts of suicide dwelled in his mind, for his childhood friend Tamas took his life but he decides to go home instead. Again, this book is interesting, and Mihaly finds himself. There are parts of the Novel that are unclear but all your misconceptions are summed up in \\"The Afterword\\" by Peter Hargitai. Although the Novel is a some what difficult read it is worth it, I give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler by Antal Szerb, is a book that takes you on a great journey. It is about Mihaly's passage through life. He falls in love with two people, Eva and Tamas. They are two siblings. The book has through some very important themes which are androgyny, homosexuality, and death eroticism. Those were very tough things to write about back in the days that Antal Szerb wrote it. The story goes through Mihaly's life jolurney to find his destiny, which is probably death or being together with the woman he loves. Throughout the book, he encounters many old friends and that helps him reach his destiny. I recommend this book to someone who would like to read something completely different than other books. The beginning of the book is a little weird but once you start to read it, you will probably get hooked. I rate this book with four stars because of the themes it teaches readers."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The protagonist, Mih?ly, in Antal Szerb's The Traveler, seems to be an androgynous fellow whom cares more about his wants then others. He seems to be passive and introverted. The well-done translation by Professor Peter Hargitai talks about Mih?ly's life starting from his honeymoon with his wife, whom he leaves, to going back home to work for his father. There are occasional flashbacks in the book, though, the stories continuity remains intact. The book captivates the reader's interest and talks about a love/hate relationship between what is should be done and what Mih?ly wanted to do. The book goes through Mih?ly's trials and tribulations to find what he is looking for in life. He travels all over Europe, and meets another woman while he was technically still married. This is another example of Mih?ly either doing what was right, or what he wanted to do. This is a great book if you're interested in what goes on in some people's heads, and also if you're into the Hungarian experience."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"I really enjoyed this book on just how it started out. This book covers many obscure topics and the storyline takes you through the alleys of Italy, to the countryside. Mihaly is a certain character to be analyzed many ways; he has such a complex story about his past with his friends Tamas and Eva and his weird marriage. He marries Erszi and has his honeymoon in Venice, Italy. There he digresses from the honeymoon and spends time wandering the streets at night. Eventually, the couple is confronted by Zoltan, an old friend of Mihaly, and tells him that Ervin is in Italy, another friend. The story is split into two with Mihaly and Erszi taking physically different paths during their honeymoon and eventually intertwines with them. Androgyny is very present in this story as well. I liked the fact that this book had death eroticism as one of the main topics drew me in and I was always fascinated by it. This was a little slow on some parts and not much of a page turner but overall, a great book!"},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"From the beginning of this novel, it is clear the main character, Mihaly, is not your typical groom. Firts, he is thirty-six a little old for a groom. Second, the weirdest of the reasons in my opinion is how he leaves his new wife to wander the alleys of Venice all alone after they just finished getting married. There is more to Mihaly than meets the eye and his wife starts to catch that on really early on the book. She starts to recognize how little women really interest him and how he has secrets that he even doesnt confess to himself. The relationship is odd from the beginning you could tell in the firts pages of the novel. Moreover, as he recounts his story in the novel is clear that he has no hint of his own sexuality so therefore he surrounds himself with androgynous people to complement his own lack of sensuality and sexual feelings. Also in the novel you will notice how Mihaly has no feelings for anyone but himself and his friend Tamas. So in my opinion \\"The Traveler' is such and easy and enjoyable reading because of Mihaly's feelings towards everything in the world. I highly recommend this book to intense readers who like to analyse books."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"\\"The Traveler\\" was written by Antal Szerb and was translated by Peter Hargitai. The novel is very interesting. It starts off with a section called \\"The Honeymoon.\\" The main character is Mihaly and he is on his honeymoon in Italy. This is a place that he had always wanted to go to and visit. It's weird because you would think that he would spend the whole time with his new wife and be all romantic and sweet, but it turns out that he left in the middle of his honeymoon. His wife is madly in love with him, but he is not. As Mihaly wanders around Italy, he begins to reminisce about his life in the past and about his two loves Tamas and Eva. This book has a lot of death eroticism in it. As you keep on reading it you start to see how much Mihaly and his friend Tamas loved each other. Their love was so strong and so great that they even tried to kill themselves together. The book also deals with the topic of androgyny. It indicates that the traditional roles of men and women are not always black and white. They sometimes have a gray line in between. You also see that Mihaly and Tamas are both great examples of androgyny. Eva was a strong woman and would be the dominant ones when they all played games or whatever it was that they would do. The second section titled \\"The Fugitive,\\" shows how Mihlay is trying to escape a life of consistency, which he had with Erzsi before he left her. Section three is titled \\"Rome.\\" In this part he tries to find his answer to his obsession with death, while traveling Rome. This only makes life even more confusing. Lastly, the final section is titled \\"Through Hell's Gate.\\" Here is where the whole book is all tied together and finally comes to be as one. This is when the character finally understands that the past is the past. He realizes that he needs to move on because he can't change what has already happened. This is a good book, and I felt that I could really connect to it because I have once felt that if I could not be with a person in life, then the only way to go was death. I eventually realized that it was done with and that I had to move on. I would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"\\"The Traveler\\" is a translation written by Peter Hargitai of Antal Szerb's novel.

When is informed that his best friend as a child, Tomas, committed suicide he desires to do the same. He plans to meet Eva the next day but due to certain circumstances he cannot make it. He then realizes that he no longer wishes to take his own life and returns home. I found this book to be very interesting because despite the hardships, Mihaly was able to overcome the obstacles and find himself. Although at times I did ask myself \\"What was Mihaly thinking?\\" in some of the decisions he made, reading this novel and taking the journey along side him, help me understand him and his choices a little better. Even those things which were not made clear to me in the novel itself were made clear to me in \\"The Afterword\\" by Peter Hargitai. This portion of the book helped uncover and explain some of the vague ideas in the story.

Written by Antal Szerb, it was first published in 1937. The novel follows Mih?ly, a Budapest native from a bourgeois family on his honeymoon with Erzi, they are a well-to-do but fundamentally lazy couple, and both are happy when they become separated in the middle of their honeymoon in different countries. Mihaly has many problems hidden inside of him and an obsession with his past memories with the Ulpius house so through the book he is just trying to find his identity and search for his true self. The novel presents rhetorical devices such irony and imagery. The irony could be found in the fact that Erzi is left by Mihaly on their honey moon, when she left her husband to be with Mihaly. This is a well written book. It has an exciting plot which makes the reader not want to put the book down. It may not have a \\"happily ever after\\" ending but that is what makes this book unique as well."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler is a translation by Peter Hargitai of Antal Szeb's novel. The central character of the novel is a middle-age male name Mihaly, who struggles to find a common ground between realism and idealism and brake away from his past. Mihaly's journey and metamorphosis are the underlying theme of the novel. The Traveler is about following the omens and realizing your destiny. The novel ranges from Venice to Rome, Perugia, Sienna, and several other Italian cities, each having a specific meaning and wisdom for Mihaly about becoming self-empowered, overcoming depression, seeking his destiny and breaking away form the past. The novel also illustrates themes such as death eroticism and androgyny. The afterword written by Peter Hargitai uncovers some of the secrets of the novel. Other moving characters in the novel include Mihaly's wife, his father, his childhood friends, and several other remarkable people such as a fortune teller, a doctor, and a ghost."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"In the Traveler, Antal Szerb takes us through Milhay's journey. It is not the standard excursion to Italy among breathtaking landscapes and antique ruins, but it is the character's inward journey, his own passage toward a painful nostalgia and an acceptance of life in the here and now. This proves to be an intolerable and almost impossible task to complete as Mihlay roams through each Italian city seeking guidance from his old friends and acquaintances to free himself of the bittersweet connections to his past: his lust for Eva and the haunting of Tamas's ghost.Mihlay's inward journey is unique because Szerb ingeniously crafts a series of coincidences which seemed destined to happen as Mihlay can gain closure about his friend Tamas' death and Eva. Events such as accidentally getting on the train to Perugia, finding a doctor who treated Eva and a monk who just happens to be Mihlay's friend Ervin, send Mihlay on the path that will eventually save him. This array of coincidences allows the story to twist and to make it easier to stay involved with. More importantly, it makes The Traveler powerful and uplifting since it gives the message that it is possible for the forces on this earth to help us find peace within ourselves. This book is captivating because it is very easy to understand and feel for the character. Antal Szerb's storytelling along with Hargitai's translation delivers an unforgettable literary feast that will stand the test of time."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Antal Szerb's, The Traveler, is a narrative about a journey of self-discovery where death is erotic and the past expunges the present. The novel, translated into English by Peter Hargitai, introduces Mih&aacute;ly, a thirty-six year old man, who is separated from Erzsi, his wife, fortuitously, on their honeymoon. The middle-aged man is depicted as a sexually frustrated individual who refuses to become mature due to his lack of understanding life. The title insinuates a journeyer who is searching for something which accurately fits the plot of Mih&aacute;ly traveling across Europe for self-identity. His personal journey allows him to ultimately enter adulthood and rid himself of the memories of his past that continue to haunt and distort his reality.Mih&aacute;ly is absorbed within the past and cannot seem to let go of his death grip on his childhood. In the beginning of the novel, he continuously drinks sweet wine, such as \\"Samosian and Mavrodaphne\\" (Szerb 4), which represents the sweetness of youth. He claims he is not accustomed to the Italian wines because of their bitter taste, indicating that he has not become a mature man yet. During the start of his friendship with the Ulpiuses, Mih&aacute;ly states, \\"I had to break with the world of real objects. I also gave up reading newspapers and lost touch with my studious friends\\" (Szerb 28). I believe this action, performed by a young Mih&aacute;ly, is the beginning of his imprisonment within his adolescence. The statement shows that he gave up the forms of adulthood that existed within his life, such as reading the newspaper, to enter the imagination of childhood games with Tamas and Eva.After Mih&aacute;ly's disastrous honeymoon and his separation from his wife, he becomes more and more enthralled with his childhood fantasies. He journeys throughout Europe in seek of something, which later he claims is Eva according to the quote, \\"he had come to Rome because Eva was here\\" (Szerb 165). However, I believe he is not seeking to find Eva but to become free of her. When Mih&aacute;ly is writing his suicide letter he is interrupted by Vannina and must fulfill his promise to attend the baptism. This is ironic and the point that Mih&aacute;ly begins his rites of passage into adulthood because he loosens the hold Eva has on his life and for the first time, he says, \\"not once did he think of her\\" (Szerb 261). The novel comes to an end with Mih&aacute;ly's rebirth through his godson, according to the Afterword. He leaves his childish fantasies of death behind and is no longer indulged with its \\"sweet aura\\" (Szerb 266). Overall, the protagonist's struggle to bring meaning to his life and leave his familiar past to create a future, makes this narrative an inspiring and original piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Antal Szerb's \\"The Traveler\\" is the amazing story of a man misunderstood by everyone, even himself. The beginning of the novel does drag but as the story begins to unravel it is made clear why the author chooses to tell it this way. The protagonist, Mihaly, is a sexually confused man who refuses to accept adulthood. He goes through life avoiding all things \\"grown up\\". It seems to me that his reason for distancing himself from adulthood stems from his failure to understand what his role truly is in life and society. He does not even quite understand what it is to be a husband. While on his honeymoon, he sends his wife off to walk the streets alone while he goes off to get a glass of wine, an adventure that ends up taking several hours. His wife does not even understand him but does not ever really try to. \\"Erzsi had known for some time that she would never really understand Mihaly, because he had secrets which he did not even confess to himself.\\" He is married because it is what people do and not because he wants it for himself. Furthermore, he does not make the usual associations with gender. He obsesses over his friend Tamas and is more compassionate towards him than anyone else. \\"As a rule i spoke to Tamas gently and politely, as i would to girls; and with Eva I did not fell that tiresome restlessness I often felt with Edit's girl friends.\\"His obsession with death and his need to victimize himself, as well as the despair he feels over his best friend, Tamas' death make his own death that much more tragic in my mind. By the end of the novel i had come to feel close to Mihaly and cared for him very much. It is a touching story that would make anyone feel the pain and confusion that plagued Mihaly's life right up until the very end. I loved this novel and would recommend it whole-heartedly to anyone."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"I thought that the book The Traveler by Antal Szerb was a very good book that made you look at life in a different way. I can&#8217;t say that it was great because it had a lot of dull and boring periods where there wasn&#8217;t very much going on. This is not the type of book that I would probably read in my spare time because it is very slow moving and I like a lot of action in the books that I read. But I did enjoy the book and it gave me a different perspective on these types of books. The reasons that I did like the book was because you never knew what was going to happen between all the characters in the book. I also liked the main character of the book, Mihaly, because he was very mysterious and you did not know what was going on through his head. It was also kind of neat how all the childohood friends met up somehow."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"\\"The Traveller\\" is a novel about a man named Mihaly who has a constant battle with the ghost from his past who gains control of his actions and gets inside of his head. The novel elucidates Mihaly's life story as it follows him travelling to his honeymoon in Italy. What's supposed to be just another \\"grown up\\" moment quickly escalates into a journey that explores the very essence of life itself. While on his Italian honeymoon, Mihaly soon discovers strange signs which bring up old memories from his past that he has been trying to bury. He soon comes to realize that the girl he fell in love with during the early years of his life, still holds a big place in his heart. Throughout his childhood, he falls in love with this girl named Eva. They grow up together in a house which basically holds no boundaries. He then begins to reminisce about the past. When he notices all of this, he begins to spend all of his time trying to find this girl. The plot thickens when Mihaly breaks off his marriage so he can try to find \\"the love of his life.\\" By reading the novel you noticed how Mihaly abandons his wife by pretending to get a cup of coffee and never returning back to the right train. I felt like he was trying to free himself from all the things that he has been deprived of.Their relationship is odd from the beginning, and it is clear Mihaly is an androgynous man who does not understand himself, or the people around him. As he recounts his story, it is clear that he has no hint of his own sexuality, and so, he surrounds himself with androgynous people who complement his own lack of sensuality and sexual feeling. Throughout this story, the plot thickens again when his former rival Janos Szepetneki tracks him down. He encounters a few old friends which bring a twist to the story. He has no money and no where to go. His best friend committed suicide and Mihaly speaks of following in his friend's footsteps. The book takes you through the highs and lows of an ordinary person's life. The book shows you what life is like when you're trying to find yourself. It also shows you what its like to find something that you feel is missing. This is Mihaly's dark and mysterious past catches up with him, and leads him on a desperate search across the Italian countryside for answers to the events leading to his friend's murder. He seems to blame much of his insecurities on his childhood and adolescence, but it is clear throughout the book that Mihaly is simply a bland personality, who ultimately has no thoughts or deep feelings for anyone but himself and the dead Tamas.\\""},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler, filled with interesting themes, had little to do with my life. However, the passion and/or romanticism found in death struck a nerve in my understanding. I once knew a pastor who was terminally ill. He did not commit euthanasia because he believed it a sin. Lying on his deathbed he will come in and out of consciousness. One time he woke up and said, \\"I want to slip away, but I just can't slip.\\" He was a funny man, and in that attempt of comedy he expressed that he wanted to die so that his next vision would be of God. He was not scared of dieing, and he did not have an idea that would not make him not want to die. This little scenario touched my heart as I read the story of Pater Severinus. A man of God that was not afraid of dieing instead he accepted it. It seems as if he would have embraced his death certain of the uncertain. His beliefs were so firm, so strong, that it seems as he longed to die only to reach the, \\"great unknown.\\" For him the unknown was known at heart, and that romanticism is expressed in an artistic way. No gore, no fear, no anger, and most of all, no regret.When you discover what happens to Tamas his death also seems artistic. A poor man tired of life, and his one love in the world (not a sister, but a person.) All he wants is to have his final moments memorable. These pages in the book express some sort of pride. Proud to die, I believe that it is important for all people to feel that pride when they die. Sadly, it is not always so, but for Tamas I think it was his final, \\"scene.\\" After that the curtain will close and then he is off into the great wide open. When he takes the poison he takes death, also embracing it as his destiny. When Eva kisses him it is almost as if her lips were his final life source, that was all he lived for. When his spirit left Eva understood that his final moment were spent in her arms, and he would have not had it any other way.That one part of the book reminded me of when the girl that I loved had to move from the country, that was the, \\"death\\" of our relationship, for her final moments here we spent them together, and all we did was kiss each other. Our lips were the life source to our relationship, however I have another chance, Tamas does not. The book in itself I did not like, but its ideas I loved.

And although a honeymoon should be a significant time in the life of this newly married couple, Mihaly is overwhelmed by a past created by suffering Mihaly, Szerb is able to effectively question the roles of the sexes by developing the theme of androgyny. Androgyny, which indicates a blurring of the traditional role of men and women, is seen quite often in the way Mihaly and Tamas are not the typical aggressive male as compared to the extremely dominant Eva. For one, Mihaly loves playing the part of the victim while Eva is able to hold her liquor better than any of the men.

There are many parts of the story that grab you interest, but at the same time there is too much description about things that the reader doesn't have to care too much about, such as all the detail the author uses to describe the scenery. Many readers might enjoy this, but I just found it to be quite dragging. Other than that the novel still has many different parts about it that make it enjoyable.The characters in this story are very unique and different from each other. One of the most interesting things I found about the novel is how strange Mihaly's childhood friends are. All the stories he said about the suicidesand all the other strange things they did really caught my attention. I also enjoyed Mihaly's personality, he admits about the way he is and he doesn't seem to care what anyone else thinks.

The novel begins on his honeymoon (at 36 years old) with his newlywed Erszi in Italy. He begins telling his wife for the first time about the childhood he shared with his best friends Tamas and Eva. Here is when he realizes that he is obsessed with his childhood memories and realizes that his childhood games became the basis of his sexual fantasy. He is haunted by the spirit of his dead friend Tamas, and because of this, is forced into deep depression. He eventually leaves his wife and begins his journey to find the memories and the people that at one time made him feel alive. He becomes obsessed, not only with his childhood friend, but with the idea of death, which was included in the games they played as children. His nostalgia is finally healed after he becomes free of his past demons in a moment where he feels he is going to die, but then notices he is afraid of death.

Like countless books, theater and cinema from years past and current day, this novel tackles the concept of individuals searching for themselves, trying to resolve who they really are. Early in the novel we learn that Mihaly is a troubled soul, teetering on the edge of an abyss that constantly torments his mind. His quest for himself, the person that is quietly dwelling deep inside, begins in Venice and drags him about Italy. One rewarding aspect of this book is that through the author's vivid and precise descriptions of Italy the reader is able imagine the Italian hillsides and towns, alleyways and ancient monuments.Yet, the most intriguing aspect is perhaps the concept of Mihaly's death-wish. We are constantly reminded of his fascination with death, first when we are introduced to the Ulpias house, Tam&aacute;s and &Eacute;va, and later when we see how he loves to be the victim. We establish how he would invent dozens of ways to die when performing with Tamas and Eva. He even divulges that no one could feign death better than he. Mihaly finds death almost erotic. His yearning for it, his longing for it, is a constant in this book and key to the essence of his journey. I found these sections to be the most fascinating. Mihaly's mind is just as dark and lonely, provoking and tired, as the Italian alleyways that he so frequently walks."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"\\"The Traveler\\" is an excellent story of the struggles a man goes through in life.

It's one of those books that you can't put down because you want to see what will happen next."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The traveler is basically Peter Hargitai's translation of Antal Szeb's novel. The novel is very interesting; it takes place at the time of Milhaly and Elzi's honeymoon. As soon as the honeymoon starts we see that problems will arise in the future for them. Many funny things happen to this newly wed couple, which in time will end up causing loads of drama. In the book we see how these two \\"love birds\\" get separated and end up in different trains. This is where Mihaly discovers that it was a mistake getting married. He then travels around many places and meets new people, he is basically trying to find himself. The chronology and word choice of the author are exceptional, they are used to emphasize on certain events that are happening now and will happen in the future."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler by Antal Szerb is eye-catching writer. I reviewed the novel The Traveler and it is an extremely incredible story. As I read the book by Antal Szerb I realize how agonizing it was in the past and how blessed I am today. The suspense that is created in The Traveler leaves the reviewers wanting to know more of what will happen next. The novelist creative ideas and settings capture the reader's attention. Every chapter I read was brilliant and it grabbed my fully attention. The Traveler is the work of an artist and talented author. I have to say this book is a master piece, the novel kept plowing threw pages and wanting to know more and wondering what happen next. If I had to rate the novel The Traveler from one to ten or by stars, I would give it ten and five stars."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler is a very intense journey into the human mind, and a pathway to the many extremes of human nature. Antal Szerb does a wonderful job bringing his characters to life. It is ultimately about Mihaly's journey of self discovery, and we are taken into his mind in the novel. Throughout out the novel the reader sees concepts of androgyny, and lots of death eroticism. Androgyny is when the male and female souls are blurred. Throughout the novel, the male characters are sometimes mistaken for the female characters. An example from the novel was when the characters played a game and the female characters played male part. This is similar to Shakespeare times when males played female parts, because females were not allowed in the theatre. The biggest concept I saw was this concept of death eroticism. This is when people see pleasure in death or in dying. There is a part in the book where \\"Waldheim\\" explains to \\"Mihaly\\" that death is erotic because it is like a \\"second birth,\\" and sex is part of birth. \\"Sex\\" is erotic so this is why it is called \\"death eroticism.\\" The novel mentions females as \\"sirens\\" luring men to their death through erotic acts. Also, the character of \\"Waldheim\\" explains to \\"Mihaly\\" that death eroticism is still practiced today, but in a different manner. Catholics for example, believe that there is an afterlife. Therefore, the \\"sirens\\" are replaced by angels and heaven. Catholics are lured by angel hymns and paradise. In conclusion, I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes to read something truly out of the ordinary. This novel makes you look at life in a whole new way. It makes you wonder about the norms of human nature."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The novel, The Traveler, is not just a novel that focuses on one storyline. There are many \\"ideas\\" that are touched on throughout. Androgyny, death eroticism, and the novel as a right of passage are just a few. Antal Szerb uses these different storylines to capture the reader's attention, in my opinion at least. Instead of just focusing on one theme, Antal Szerb keeps the reader's interest with his unique writing style. Even though the novel has different themes, it is ultimately about Mihaly's search of self; self discovery. This novel is by no means a traditional one. It is very unpredictable which in turn makes it very fascinating. Antal Szerb definitely took risks with this novel and in the end it turned out to make it all that better. In addition, this isn't just a novel that you can read and understand. In order to fully understand the meaning behind the words, one must analyze the different themes and how they interconnect with each other. This novel involves thinking outside the box, which consequently helps the reader experience the full effect of the novel. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody who is daring enough to read something different. It was brilliantly written and thought out. I enjoyed reading this book wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Antal Szerb's book The Traveler is the story of Mihaly. While on his honeymoon, he finds himself remembering his past and his old friends. His memories take him in a journey in search for answers of his past. This book is very unique in the themes it brings in; Androgyny, where the sexes are blurred. Mihaly and Tamas, although being males, show their feminine side. They like feeling dominated by Eva, who in her case takes the masculine role. Another theme is Death Eroticism, which is the idea that death is a beautiful thing. Mihaly and Tamas would play games with Eva, where they pretended she killed them. Both Milhay and Tamas made various attempts to commit suicide; Tamas succeeded killing himself. On his journey, Milhay, planed his death. Instead he found himself really drunk at a reception; his plan failed. In this part, I think is the main part because it shows how Milhay ended his urges to kill himself. He is then saved by his father, who takes him home where Milhay starts a new life. This novel was really interesting. As I read it, I found myself not wanting to stop because of the themes it portrayed. It was good to read a novel that shows an idea, which although we may not notice it is all around us."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"\\"The Traveler\\", written by Antal Szerb, is a novel which displays the characters in the story traveling throughout their past to discover their true identity. The newlywed couple, Mihaly and Erzsi, comes across a separation on the day of their honeymoon when Mihaly takes the opposing train from his wife. Mihaly never seemed to overlook his childhood with his friends, Tamas and Eva, who all had an obsession with the desire of suicide. Tamas and Mihaly loved the fact that they were both Eva's victims in their childhood games. Just the idea of death was an arousing tool that filled them with extreme curiosity. Mihaly seems to continue with this infatuation of death until he is faced with a time that he is going to die and becomes terrified of it. Not only does this book deal with the thought of death eroticism, but it also deals with the idea of androgyny throughout the novel. Personally, I would highly recommend this book to anyone and rate it with five stars."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler, written by Antal Szerb, tells the story of a man and his journey towards self discovery.

He eventually meets up with Eva and together they plan his death, however everything does not go according to \\"plan\\".

It is not a traditional story where you already know what is going happen next; instead, the story is unpredictable and interesting. It talks about great subjects that most authors had never taken the risk to talk about. Some of them are death erothism, the androgyny effect, and homosexuality.I was especially attracted to death erothism because I had never before heard about it. Also, the author explained it as if it was the most natural subject. I got really involved in it, and I loved the way Antal Szerb portrayed the subject.The story talks about a man named Mih?ly. He was in his mid-thirties, but still he was a very dependent man. The story talks about his past and his present, and how does he starts growing up and maturing.

Throughout the novel, he journeys to find himself and to gain his rite of passage from boyhood to manhood. THE TRAVELER teaches us many themes such as Androgyny, which means sexes are blurred, and Death Eroticism, the idea that death is a beautiful thing.The three main characters, Mihaly, Tamas, and Eva, all show a lot of these themes throughout the novel. Tamas and Mihaly, being the male characters, should be thought of as masculine, instead, in the story, they are the more feminin ones, while Eva, the female, is more on the masculine side. The two male characters Tamas and Mihaly are also really obsessed with being dominated by Eva. This being another form of feminism, and also shows a form of Femme Fatal.I rate this book by giving it five stars, because of the ideas it teaches its readers. I also recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a great novel that contains many beleifs and ideas that might go on in the world today."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The novel, The Traveler, is a travelogue about the character Mihaly on the journey to find himself and to gain his rite of passage from boyhood to manhood. The novel also touches on other interesting issues such as androgyny, the femme fatal and the idea of death eroticism.The Traveler explores the theme of androgyny where the sexes are blurred. The male characters Mihaly and Tamas tend to be more on the feminine side of the fence while Eva displays more masculine traits. Mihaly and Tamas are more passive and yielding, while Eva is more aggressive. The males enjoy being dominated by Eva and being mastered by her which leads to the idea of the femme fatal, where Both Tamas and Mihaly are obsessed with dying by Eva's hand. They thoroughly enjoy being seduced and overpowered by her.This novel takes us on a very interesting journey with Mihaly as he recaps his peculiar past growing up at the Ulpius house and the reemergence of this past as he is reunited with certain characters from his childhood who played an integral part in his life. The novel ultimately ends with Mihaly finally gaining his rite of passage into his manhood as he comes to the realization that it is possible for an individual to live in a common place reality.On a whole this is a very interesting novel, as it focuses on themes such as androgyny and death eroticism which you don't find in a typical book. It dares to be different and it works. Peter Hargitai's afterword in the novel also adds a twist to it as he enlightens and provides the reader with insight into Antal Szerb's life and how the characters may have come into existence which makes it even more interesting. I give this book four out of five stars."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler, by Antal Szerb, is a great book that is mainly about a man named Mihaly that is on a journey to find himself through his past. The story starts off with Mihaly on his honeymoon with his wife. As they visit many places, memories of Mihaly's past and memories of his old friendships start to occur. These memories and weird feelings lead to Mihaly leaving his new wife and lead to Mihaly traveling to different places to figure out his past. \\"Things happen for a reason\\", are words that can best explain the motivation of Mihaly's new journey. This journey is not only to find unanswered questions of the past, but to find out the cause of death of his best friend Tamas, and his love Eva. I definitely recommend this book to everyone. The story is amazing and keeps you interested throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler, was written by Antal Szerb, a Hungarian Jew in Balf who was executed and buried in a mass grave along with 2000 others near the end of World War II. Peter Hargitai, the Traveler's translator resurrected this authors words for all to read. By making the material modern and keeping the natural cadence it truly transcends through the ages. What I loved most about this book was that androgyny permeates through almost all the characters. My favorite character would most definitely have to be the femme fatale Eva. Even from a young age she masterfully accepts the most commanding role. Eva is a character I can relate to. She is strong and willful and uses almost an imperceptible power to get what she wants in life. Her brother Tamas on the other hand is the female sibling in my eyes. He is weak and almost infantile. Whatever personality disorder Tamas was suffering from Mihaly would have been diagnosed accordingly. Reading this makes me want to live in Italy, travel throughout Rome, see the old cathedrals with their ancient, crumbling halls. Many characters had to go through psychological struggles, mostly Mihaly. It seemed he fought hardest to find freedom but our hero failed. So what can this mean? I believe the message that Antal Szerb was trying to reveal was that the journey to self-actualization can sometimes be clouded by reality."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"I find myself stranded inside Mih&aacute;ly's eyes as Antal Szerb takes us through his 278-page journey, The Traveler. I see obstacles I must face, things expected of me and for some reason I have no clue where I want to go. I can definitely relate to Mih&aacute;ly who didn't know exactly what he wanted. He travels through his life, undecided in the manner of a woman, and allows his emotions kind of guide him. Perhaps the author wanted to portray how he sometimes feels like giving up on being in control of his life - perhaps allowing life to take him away. Finally in the end, his desire was fulfilled; he was tired of his journey.After reading this book, its grand ideas made me think about many things. But most of all, it made me think about life in general and what direction I am headed. Although I know what I want to do, my family makes it extremely hard for me to move forward. After the divorce and me moving into friend's homes, I find myself as a traveler, wondering the world. In hope to find my calling, I struggle with my father's harsh words. I try to prove myself to him. However, I never seem to get him to realize my success and potential. Relating to Mih&aacute;ly, I moved on and found out what I needed to do.

His father expects one thing and society another. The one place he finds where he can be himself is at the Ulpius' home. The only problem is that nothing can last forever and life changes everything.

Eventually, after many struggles, Mih&aacute;ly begins to find his way even after considering giving up on everything.The Traveler is amazing story. Everyone should read it because it captures how difficult it is to find one's place in the world with all of life's changes.

It talks about his childhood and how as an adult Mihaly wants to remain a child. He does not want to deal with all the responsibilities and commitments that come with adulthood. Mihaly does not like the life that society dictates he has to live as an adult. He spends most of his life chasing things from his childhood, until he finally is able to put it all behind him and move on.During the time period that the book takes place people were trying to be perfect, something that is impossible. Mihaly himself was in a way in search of the perfect life were he could be an adult but a child at the same time and this is something that is not possible. You are either and adult or a child, you can not be both. People during this time period desired to be perfect so much that they desired death because they believed in the after life. I do believe that when someone dies if they are a good person then they will go to haven were everything is perfect. I believe that it is impossible to be perfect so people shouldn't worry about being perfect, just trying their best. No one is perfect."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler by Antal Szerb goes into the mind of a man named Milahy and his problem while on his honeymoon. Ever since Milahy was a little boy he loved to be killed or play dead but it wasn't until the death of his friend Tamas that he really considered death. He wanted to die, he desired death but not suicide, no he wanted to be overpowered by someone he like the feeling and thought that it was sexy and erotic and wanted to experience it. Weird but that's what he wanted even though he never got it. Some where along the line the question of whether or not he is gay pop up because of certain thing that he say's. For example he was afraid to go to Italy (which is where his honeymoon takes place) for some reason and he's traveled everywhere but Italy he wanted to leave that one if he could until his dying day. For some reason he feared strong sunshine, fragrant flowers, and very beautiful women. I really don't know why but it just makes you assume that he is a homosexual and that he's afraid that if he lets himself like those things he'll turn or something. You'll have to read it to get a good perspective but overall the book is really good and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"This story was a very unique one. The way the males and females are complete opposites catches your eye in the beginning of the novel. Mihaly, the main character, is not sure if he is ready to become an adult yet. He seems that he still wants to depend on someone in his life. As if he was a woman. He makes friends with Eva and Tamas which are brother and sister. Tamas has a fetish for death eroticism and he wants his friend to join in. This story is very controversial and the characters have many weaknesses. The ending was nothing that I expected it to be like. Why Mihaly runs away from his wife is unknown but he ends up giving up in the end. He is still a child in his mind. This novel was a rollercoaster of growing up and finding yourself underneath all the darkness.

It is a very unusual book that portrays the author's deepest feelings. I believe it pulls the reader into great sadness and uneasiness. One of the main themes of the book is Androgyny. It is mostly reflected on the characters Tamas and Eva, they are siblings who have opposed characteristics; they together make up the perfect person. The confusion with the sexes is not only portrayed in those two characters but also on the protagonist Mihaly, a feminine male. In the novel Szerb plays with the reader by making the characters exactly the contrary of the conventional expected way. Females have the control and males like to be controlled or at least they can't help it. Mihaly is depicted a victim and will always be a victim because he likes to be the victim. The book addresses or implies briefly homosexuality but leaves it open for the reader to discuss I personally think that Mihaly did have homosexual thoughts and desires haunting him, but that is up t the reader. It is a book worth reading."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler by Antal Szerb provided an interesting look into the life of a somewhat average person. Throughout the extent of the novel, Mikaly deals with an immense amount of internal conflict. He reminisces about his best friend Tamas and how he longs for him deeply. He fantasizes about Tama's sister Eva and looks to her as the femme fatale. With all of this under the context of his having just gotten married to his love Erzi, the novel is cleverly twisted. The themes in this novel, I felt, were very relevant to everyone. We all have secrets and try to conceal them from society in an effort to hide from the world who we truly are. The ability of the author to express Mikaly's feelings in such an open way provides readers with the idea that they can be who they are. I enjoyed reading this novel because it didn't focus merely on one specific theme. Instead it dipped into different ones providing the text with a well-rounded plot. Experimenting with the theme of homosexuality as is an aspect in the lives of Tamas and Mikaly, the author really made great leaps. I would definitely recommend this novel to others. It certainly provides a refreshing look into the different aspects of life as opposed to those that prefer to censor themselves."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler by Antal Szerb is a controversial novel that discusses touchy subjects such as homosexuality, androgyny, and death eroticism. It is a story in which you are taken through the life of a man named Mihaly, who is on a journey to find himself by rekindling the past. Szerb carefully crafts a series of events which Mihaly is able to gain closure about the death of his close childhood friend Tamas Ulpius. Along for the unexpected journey is Mihaly's new wife Erszi. Unrenowned to her, she finds herself in an awkward position while on their honeymoon in Italy to discover a chapter in her groom's past that has not yet finished. Mihaly becomes obsessed and cannot stop reenacting childhood memories with Tamas and his sister Eva Ulpius. The difficult journey seems to only drive him deeper and deeper into an irrational world where adolescent figures and recollections begin to take over. To eventually tie the torn links between his childhood and adult life, Mihaly is able to eventually accept the incidents of the past and find peace within. I would recommend this book to a reader who is able to follow a good lead. The story may become confusing at times because Mihaly is the narrator to the story of his own na?ve, twisted life, but in the end it is all worth it. The Traveler is a powerful read of self-discovery and mixed emotions which leads the reader left with a sense of calmness and satisfaction.

The poems are very in depth some will leave you in disgust and some will even frighten you.

The author has embellished this piece with rhetorical devices such as irony and imagery. One such example which displays the irony is how Erzsi, the main character's wife, leaves her ex-husband to be with Mih&aacute;ly, only to be left by him during their honeymoon and separate into two different countries. The beginning of the novel was not as interesting then the rest since it did not start to intensify and get more enjoyable until Part two, the fugitive. The imagery that is provided along with the characters realism helps the reader envision what is going on with the character and with the story, as well as visualize themselves in his position since a lot of people have problems within themselves.

The most impacting part of this book is the pleasure of death. Mihaly desired to feel that pleasure ever since he was a kid, playing games pretending he was getting killed. After hearing about his friend Tamas' suicide, he desired death himself but he did not contemplate suicide because Eva was not with him. (Eva was a girl in Mihaly's childhood who would pretend to kill both Tamas and himself.) There was no pleasure in killing himself, he had to feel overpowered and defeated by Eva. He found that to be erotic and sexy and that is what he wanted to experience. Mihaly finally finds Eva and sets up a date for death, but it never happened because Mihaly had something else planned for that day. When he goes back to meet with Eva, she had already left and he did not have a chance to conduct his own death with her. He realized how much he wanted to live but his obsession for death was pushing him to reach that limit. After that, he returned to the life he had left on hold in Hungary. It is interesting how the characters in this book are different. Some males portray to be feminime in their way of expression, and some women portray the characteristics of a male and their manly way of being.

There are many prevalent themes in the novel but one that is very captivating, is the one of death eroticism. It seems that the protagonist Mihaly, is obsessed with death and the beauty of it. Death to him it is the final ecstasy in life. The greatest fulfillment one can achieve. His obsession with death, comes from his childhood years, when he would play with his friends Eva and Tamas they would conduct little theater plays in which Eva would kill both Tamas and Mihaly. Eva the powerful female figure had her grasp over the weaklings Mihaly and Tamas, which both desired to be the victims in the plays. After hearing about Tamas' suicide, Mihaly became all the more infatuated with death. The only reason he could not commit suicide, is because he needs Eva there, like their childhood plays, like Tamas needed her in his death. Mihaly searches for Eva and eventually finds her, they set a date for the assisted suicide. But as fate has planned, the death does not take place, because of a prior engagement to a baptism that Mihaly had made. When Mihaly returns home the next day, Eva is already gone and left the country. Mihaly is still alive. It is then that Mihaly goes into a self-realization, that he never really wanted to die, he was just obsessed over the beauty of death. Before Mihaly has even time to thoroughly analyze the situation, his father arrives, to pick him and take him back home to Hungary. Mihaly returns to the life he once had.The novel was interesting and the characters were dynamic hand-picked personalities. Eva's strong character, aggressive, practical, unemotional personality traits were perfectly antagonistic to Tamas's gentle character, weak, sensitive, idealistic personality traits. Janos' skeptical, sneaky, annoying, manipulative but charming character was also perfectly antagonistic to Ervin\`s saint-like, secluded, giving, but detached character. Erzri's naive, spoiled, love-crazed character was very similar to Mihaly's indecisive, childish, obsessive, spontaneous character. Each character brings a different yet important mark to The Traveler, their personalities give the novel an edge. Each character is greatly described holds their character throughout the novel. The two exceptions are Mihaly and Erzri, as they discover who they are in their time of personal growth, their personalities switch a little but by the end of the novel, they are right back where they started. The story takes several twists and turns, leaving the reader in awe as to what will happen next. As the new characters and old character cross paths, everything seems to fall into place. Overall the novel was entertaining and refreshing, the characters were the most captivating feature of the novel. Although the ending, was quite disappointing, it was too abrupt and did not have any flow with the rest of the novel. It seems too harsh and realistic compared to the rest of the spontaneously idealistic novel."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler by Antal Szerb is eye-catching writer.

At first you hesitate to identify with this young lost soul, but before you realize it, you have become a part of the story and you have transcended identifying with Mihaly; you identify with all the aspects of the book. This novel also captures the details of it's surroundings. One can almost feel the crisp air in Paris around the shoulders of Mihaly's desperately lonely wife or even faintly hear the chanting of the monks in Umbria that must have reached Mihaly's ears at dusk.

I guess the fact that it was about a man struggling with his identity that began to catch my attention. I really enjoyed it because as you read it just gets more interesting. Mihaly made all of these strange decisions and the story took such turns that never made it boring, even though it seemed in a way as though everything was already planned. I found that Mihaly's character was a great character to analyze and follow, partly because he was so human."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"THe Traveler is a book that takes the reader through a journey of the life of Mihaly, the protagonist. This novel is plalgued with conflict between fantasy and reality. Mihaly finds himself using any method to escape reality, including marrying a women, Erzsi, in an attempt to assimilate. The novel takes a close look at his preoccupation with conforming to society's norms. In his childhood this meant conforming to the norms of the people around him, irrespective of how morose. Overall I would say the book is intriguing and holds the reader's interest. The reader is able to go journey through Mihaly's morbid life and experience his conflicts with reality."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler is a very interesting book.I really enjoyed reading it.

It has an exciting plot which makes the reader not want to put the book down. It may not have a &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending but that is what makes this book unique as well."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Antal Szerb THE TRAVELER translated by Peter Hargitai is an excellent read. It is a very interesting story with an odd plot to go along with an even odder main character. Mihaly the protagonist throughout the novel is struggling to find himself. Mihaly is a character unlike any other created in other novels. He has an odd sense of contentment as he claims his highlight of his childhood was dying. Throughout the novel he is trying to find himself and he finally grasps the point of his life when dying is no more than a phase of life you go through instead of something that sends you to ecstasy. Mihaly is an interesting character with a bizarre past who finally finds the point to his life. This book is great for people who are experiencing problems of enlighten and do not know what their purpose in life is."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"This book is really ahead of its time. Antal Szerbs genius is obvious with unhindered ideas and concepts his world was not ready for. Death, sex, passion, lust, all under the umbrella of taboo is wonderfully expressed in the English language by its translator Peter Hargitai. He should be recognized for his wonderful talent with language. Every point stressed as it should be the English reader is enthralled by the ambiguous relationships careening in and of taboo. No one knows what to expect from Mihaly and he himself is just as clueless. Although it may be slow the over all concept of the book demands intellect and is filled with the essence of what it is to be a sexual, death bound human, whose pleasures and interests are governed only by nature or some force other than self. Though he was condemned for his thoughts Antal is definitely a force to be reckoned with. Antal is a true rebel, martyr, and artist. If not for Peter Hargitai's brilliant translation I would not have been able to enjoy this work of art."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler is a very captivatiing and interesting story. It starts off talking about Mihaly and Erzsi's honeymoon and everything that went on during it. It shows all the struggles Mihaly is facing to find out who he really is.

Overall, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"This book was great. It was a little slow in the begining but once you got to part II the book completely changed. This book always has you wondering whats going to happen next. This is about a journey all through Italy that starts in Venice and ends back at his home. Mihaly had a very intriguing journey in this novel translated by Peter Hargatai. I would defenitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in this novel."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The book The Traveler, by Peter Hargitai is amazing. Once I picked up the book I was not able to put it down, it is a captivating novel. This book takes the reader into the life of a Hungarian Jew, during the devastating period of the Holocaust. The main character of the book is a man named Mihaly who is trying to find his true self and is confused by his sexuality. From the beginning of the novel is notable that something is wrong. On the first day of his honey moon Mihaly gets separated from his wife Erzi, by boarding two different trains and ending up in separate cities. Mihaly is constantly thinking of his friend Tamas, as more than just a friend. This is what makes him confused about which sex is he actually attracted to. He is constantly thinking of Tamas in sexual ways and having fantasies with him. Mihaly spends most of his journey all over Italy trying to find his true self and ending up in dark allies. The novel presents rhetorical devices such irony and imagery. The irony could be found in the fact that Erzi is left by Mihaly on their honey moon, when she left her husband to be with Mihaly. As the novel progresses and the drama intensifies the reader feels the need to keep on reading and he/she is left in a limbo as what is to happen next. In my opinion Peter Hargitai did an awesome job, at translating this book, the reader is able to find itself relating to the characters in the novel, since it deals with issues presented in real life like; love, jealousy, lust and many other."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"When I read \\"The Traveler\\", I felt free Mihaly's character seems to get rid off all the barriers and borders life seems to put us in, Mihaly seems to escape those conventional thoughts into a world, where he can be himself, a world where he can find satisfaction and happiness, even if this happiness is tied into his own death and the pleasure of it."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Antal Szerb's The Traveler is a very interesting and adventurous novel.

The author uses a lot of detail throughout the story, which allows the reader to create mental pictures of what's going on.

I would definitely recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler is a descriptive love novel, written by Antal Szerb and translated by Peter Hargitai.

This book inspires one to \\"find\\" themselves in this vast and crazy world. In my opinion this book was titled \\"The Traveler\\" because it defines what the characters are doing; not traveling from place to place but traveling inside themselves to find their true beings. Szerb gives his characters passion ultimately giving them personas allowing the reader to become part of the novel. Many relationships can associate with the story of Mihaly and Erzsi through all their hardships and struggles. Not only did Antal Szerb manipulate the lives of his characters but in some way he has touched and helped shape other peoples lives as well."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The book the Traveler is about a man named Mihaly and his quest to discover who he really is and of how childhood can influence actions adults make in their everyday lives. Mihaly, the main character, left his wife to travel around Italy to locate his old friends and along the way learned things he himself never knew before. He longed to find his real lost love, Eva the \\"femme fatale\\" of the story. Eva, his friend with whom he grew up in his childhood years is said to be the femme fatale because she had the tendency to make men want to die in her presence. Even though it wasn't intentional on her part, that's how they used to play as children and when she would kill them in plays it created a sense of erotic stimulation among the friends. They were all in love with her. Ervin, Tamas, and Mihaly after a while had associated death with Eva because it was like she was seducing them to die in a way; however, Tamas didn't die for her, he committed suicide, but he did want to die near her. And at the end Mihaly ended up not killing himself for her even though he always dreamed about it. In the book, it was like death and Eva were one."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"\\"The Traveler\\" is the story of a mental struggle a man goes through to discover himself. Anyone who reads this book will be able to relate to the general subject of going through a journey, whether it includes an actual trip through a city, country, or your past and present thoughts. In this case, the protagonist experiences both the physical and mental journey.Everyone at one point or another in their life has to figure something out about themselves by looking into the past. But knowing how to control your own emotions will be key in keeping yourself from obsessing about the past and not being able to live happily in the present.The reader would expect Mihaly to be settled in his ways because of his age and current marriage, but we soon learn that he is in a struggle to find himself. His past becomes a major issue in his unconventional self discovery. It also occurs during a very ackward and yet perfect time in his life- his honeymoon. This is brilliantly written. He has just committed his entire life to someone, and yet he comes to realize that he knows not who she is. I give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler is the story of a man in search of himself. Throughout his journey, Mihaly comes to realization his love for death and his love for his childhood friend Eva, with whom he used to act out games in which she would seduce him and then kill him. Mihaly's attitude changes as he edges more towards the suicide that he could not have when he a child.The moral depicts Mihaly in a psychic journey for himself as he searches for the true meaning of his life and where that road will end. His agoraphobia, with the endless abyss in his mind that he is afraid will swallow him, contributes to his panic.

He only needs his life to be pointed in the right direction.This is a great book with a compelling story that leaves you wanting to know just what is going to happen in the next chapter. My favorite character in the book is Eva because she was able to make the men around do whatever it was that she wanted. I give this novel five stars."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Reading The Traveler by Antal Szerb and translated by Peter Hargitai was very intriguing. I was fascinated at the fact on how Mihaly and Tomas found dying so erotic. Their obsession with dying, searching for relief of heartache and rage seemed to soothe their souls. Everyone has different feelings towards death and they felt comfort in it. As, you read you really begin to understand them and where they are coming from, being aroused by the curiosity of death. They longed for their devoid of life. Mihaly's fatal role made him feel good in his own skin. These complicated minds can be yet understandable to many people today. The mystery of death can be fascinating.As I began to read this book, I couldn't stop just because I wanted to know what Mihaly was thinking next. Being a victim to him was sensuous. He got a thrill and an adrenaline rush from it. Once you go one way there is no going back. It's realistic and it's part of human nature. Even, when you do want to go back, it's just not the same because you're missing that rush you used to get when you were more daring, searching the mysterious."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Throughout our lives we are confronted with many different challenges and ambitions that disturb our inner peace. Some of us find that challenge to be the search of our true self. Self discovery can be the most difficult quest since the outcome is never definite and may taunt those who seek it. The Traveler by Antal Szerb deals with the journey of a man who was driven by love to find his inner being. This novel covers many unconventional topics that make the book one of the most intriguing I have read. Mihaly was a tormented character who was possessed by his own anxiety and penetrating thoughts. His fixation with death and his obsession with Eva gave way to a circle of love that seemed endless. It is expected for every man to follow a series of steps to make the transition from child to adult, yet following these steps were quite challenging for Mihaly, for he dwelled on his childhood and was bound by the memory of his first love, Eva. It seemed he could not fully grasp the role of a man because he was trapped by his unfulfilled passions. His journey to Italy and the events that preceded helped his transition into an adult. I personally was captured by every character in this book. It was so well written that I was able to experience first hand the endless cycle of intrigue and mystery."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler, written by Antal Szerb, and translated by Peter Hargitai, is a novel exploring the difficulties of an individual learning how to deal with past demons. Throughout the novel, the main character, Mihaly, is in constant struggle with his feelings of nostalgia. Mihaly's nostalgia is vividly expressed as his obsession over his dead friend, Tamas. Since Mihaly is unable to solve his inner struggles with a dead Tamas, Mihaly forces himself to search for Eva, Tamas' beautiful sister. Besides suffering from nostalgia, the main character finds himself uncertain of his sexuality. Although he is married to an attractive woman, Mihaly's obsession over Tamas leads the reader to believe that Mihaly may have had more than the typical brotherly love that exists between two male friends.Once nostalgia takes over his body and mind, Mihaly feels stalked by something or someone whose sole purpose is to prevent him from finding that sweet sense of comfort. The sweet comfort for either his erotic longing for death or peace of mind with his past, no one is for sure, not even Mihaly. The mysterious figure stalking him can be two things. It can be Tamas' ghost haunting his beloved friend or Mihaly's intense fixation and love for Tamas, even after his suicide. Once Mihaly uncovers the whereabouts of Eva, he is determined to find her. He hopes in finding Eva, he may achieve a sense of comfort and leave the uncertainness that plagues him. I would rate this novel as excellent giving it five out five stars. It is rich with references of ancient civilizations such as Ancient Greece and Rome. The Traveler expresses the longing for a past euphoric life of pure adolescence and a sweet departure from the dull conformity of adulthood."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Antal Szerb (1901 - 1045) is recognized as one of the mayor Hungarian writers of the twentieth century. Szerb was born in Budapest in a Jewish family. Hegot a doctorate (1924) in Hungarian, German and English. After his graduation he decided to try his luck in another country. He went to France, Italy and London for five years. Later on, Antal Szerb became a professor of literature at the university of Szeged, and he was twice awarded the Baumgarten Prize. Afterward Szerb was deported to a concentration camp during World War II, and was killed during a forced march. Szerb's novel was published in 1934 followed by several well-known books, among them \\"The Traveler\\" (translated by Peter Hargitai). It tells about the struggles of a man who is trying to find his true self between lovers, friends and family. One of the characters that help him in this search was Professor Rodolfo Waldheim a renowned anthropologist and religious historian and an old friend of Mihaly. Waldhein tried to teach him the importance of the simple things, that no matter how much money you have or if you eat in the most expensive restaurant, It is important that you enjoy and live your life appreciating what you have around you."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"There are numerous themes and details a person can explore when reading Antal Szerb's The Traveler. One in particular that I found fascinating is his ability to use geographical references as symbols to represent Mihaly (main character) and Erzsi's state of mind and their journey to find who they are. The book starts out in Venice, Italy in Mihaly's and Erzsi's honeymoon. It's in this city that Mihaly's past begins to haunt and allure him. His fascination and curiosity with Venice's narrow and dark alleys can be attributed to the trapped feeling he experiences because he is leading a life that is expected of him, not the one he desires. As for his wife Erzsi, she begins to realize that her recent marriage is a charade, yet she does not see herself content being alone. Their next stop- Ravenna, intensifies Mihaly's restlessness. The Byzantine Mosaics remind him of the childhood friends he still longs for: Ervin, Tam&aacute;s, and &Eacute;va Ulpius. His encounter with J&aacute;nos Szepetneki in the piazza also wakes in Mihaly the possibility of giving closure to the early chapter of his life left unread. Ravenna and the encounter with her husband's old schoolmate show Erzsi a glimpse of why her husband is distant and idealistic. It gives her a better understanding of Mihaly's dual nature- his attempts to be a fitting husband and his obsessive longing for a surreal reality.Florence, home of the Renaissance plays an integral part of Mihaly's travel. It is here when he has the epiphany that Erzsi already experienced- his marriage is an illusion, a mask to hide his true feelings. \\" He was conscious of the fact that Erzsi had never given him so much pleasure as now, when he loved her not as an adult or a passionate lover but as immature adolescent in a Spring outing.\\" His suppressed desired to relive his youth and solve some of the questions left unanswered mark the beginning of his journey to find himself. Without meaning to, he triggers Erzsi's voyage as well. He deliberately misses the train in order to have an excuse to get separated from his wife. He secludes himself in Foligno, falls into depression, is saved by doctor Ellesley who becomes his friend and who ultimately leads him to Ervin. Once Mihaly's curiosity to know the whereabouts of Ervin is satisfied, he follows Ervin's advice to go to Rome. Rome is where &Eacute;va, his unattainable love resides and the only one who can answer his pressing questions. Rome represents to Mihaly what Erzsi feels for Paris. Rome is where Mihaly's death wish is fulfilled, where he sees that &Eacute;va will never be his because she never belonged to anyone, not even to her brother Tam&aacute;s. He comprehends Eva's role in the suicide of his best friend Tam&aacute;s. As for Erzsi, she acknowledges the reasons she likes Paris, her ex-husband, Zoltan, and a character referred to as The Persian: they are exotic, or mysterious in nature which she, as a middle class madam does not identify with. She accepts that she is content just the way she is, and that her need for comfort is greater than her sense of adventure. Overall, Italy for Mihaly is where he finally begins to matures, where he lets go many of his youth fears and ideals. \\"For Italy a country he had placed along things grown up, like siring urchins, and he feared it secretly just as he feared strong sunshine, fragrant flowers and very beautiful women. I recommend this book to those who are quite taken by historical references and who want to take a free ride into one of Europe's most beautiful countries- Italy."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"There are two versions of Antal Szerb's novel, one by Peter Hargitai(The Traveler), the other by Len Rix(Journey by Moonlight). There are many differences in them. Perhaps the most significant is style. While Hargitai's translation suggests a sense of history, culture, and elegant language, the Rix version is rather simplistic. The Traveler is more precise in diction, yet at the same time it evokes the 1930's. Rix strips a novel published in 1937 of its authenticity, sense of time and place. His characters sound like if they just walked out of Burger King. It could have been in Utah instead of Venice. If Antal Szerb's original Hungarian sounds like Rix's English, then one wonders why Szerb is considered such a great writer. He is certainly not a stylist. I definitely recommend Hargitai's version of Szerb's novel."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler is an interesting work with a clear underlying theme of one who is trying to find himself.

He embarcks on a quest for self discovery that leads to places like Italy and to even experiences with other sexual preferences.

Through the novel, he keeps meeting up with his old childhood friends and starts to try to find out whom he really is all the while paying little or no attention to his wife. At one point, he and his wife even get on two different trains and head towards two different countries but it really does not seem to matter all that much to Mih&aacute;ly because he becomes consumed with trying to find pure contentment.

Throughout the book Mihaly is in search of his childhood because it is something he has never really gotten over and he still has a great love for his childhood best friend.

This causes Mihaly to struggle with who he really is and causes him to be suicidal. The idea of death eroticism is heavily touched on throughout the book and it helps you understand the concept of it. One of Mihaly friends from the past helps him deal with some of his problems without Mihaly even realizing it.

Mihaly is finally broken from his past and his immaturities when he is put in an awakening situation."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"From the beginning of this novel, it is clear the main character, Mihaly, is not your typical groom. Firts, he is thirty-six a little old for a groom. Second, the weirdest of the reasons in my opinion is how he leaves his new wife to wander the alleys of Venice all alone after they just finished getting married. There is more to Mihaly than meets the eye and his wife starts to catch that on really early on the book. She starts to recognize how little women really interest him and how he has secrets that he even doesnt confess to himself. The relationship is odd from the beginning you could tell in the firts pages of the novel. Moreover, as he recounts his story in the novel is clear that he has no hint of his own sexuality so therefore he surrounds himself with androgynous people to complement his own lack of sensuality and sexual feelings. Also in the novel you will notice how Mihaly has no feelings for anyone but himself and his friend Tamas.

I highly recommend this book to intense readers who like to analyse books."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler was definitely an interesting novel. I have never read anything like it. It told the story of a man named Mihaly's life when he was an adult, but it reminisced a lot about his childhood. Throughout the whole novel Mihaly travels around Europe looking for friends of his past and he could not let go of his childhood. Mihaly was really immature and showed it throughout the novel. The Traveler is a novel which is also about Mihaly's rite of passage from childhood to adulthood. He eventually progressed in life into a more mature adult. I found this novel to be a little hard to follow. All the characters were a bit strange and I did not like the story line. I continued to read hoping the story would get better, but it never did. In life when we do not understand something we cross it off. That is what I think about this book. It is very different than any other piece of writing I have read, so I do not like it.

The Traveler by Antal Szerb deals with the journey of a man who was driven by love to find his inner being. This novel covers many unusual topics that make the book one of the most interesting I have read. Mihaly was a tormented character who was possessed by his own anxiety and penetrating thoughts. His fixation with death and his obsession with Eva gave way to a circle of love that seemed endless. It is expected for every man to follow a series of steps to make the transition from child to adult, but following these steps were very challenging for Mihaly, he constantly dwelled on his childhood and was bound by the memory of his first love, Eva. It seemed he could not fully take hold of the role of a man because he was trapped by his unfulfilled passions. His journey to Italy and the events that progressed helped his transition into an adult."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"\\"The Traveler\\" by Antal Szerb and then translated by Peter Hargitai in 2003 is a very well written book. The main character, Mih?ly, goes through Europe on his honeymoon with his newly wed wife Erzsi. However, during his honeymoon he goes on this quest to find himself, to see what he is really like, and to see how he should act. Throughout the reading one sees that he suffers from androgyny, which means that the male acts like the female and the female acts like the male. Mih?ly also displays signs of death eroticism by getting excited over the fact that you are coming close to death. Death eroticism is seen more predominantly in the beginning than any of the other problems that he suffers from. Mih?ly has a friend who tries to commit suicide by hanging himself just to see what it would feel like. Mih?ly and his friend also try to commit suicide by overdosing on pills. It is also seen that his trip is a rite of passage from childhood into adulthood. Until he married Mih?ly never wanted to go to Venice because he thought of it as an adult place and believed that he was not yet an adult. This trip to Venice would be his rite of passage. \\"The Traveler\\", is a wonderful novel and Professor Hargitai did a wonderful job with the translation.

Peter Hargitai, an award-winning translator and novelist, recaptures the depth and strong literature of Antal Szerb. I was extremely fascinated by the androgyny of the characters, a theme that is evident from beginning to end. Eva, a character whose demeanor consists of domineering tactics, is the equivalent representation of a man while her brother Tomas is the total opposite and succumbs to Eva's every word. Mihaly, who may be considered peculiar for his idiosyncrasies, carries readers on a mysterious journey throughout Italy. Never quite sure where he might end up, Mihaly is determined to find his destiny which may possibly include \\"his spectacular nature of love\\" also known as death. I have been exposed to themes such as death eroticism and androgyny as a result of reading this book. The complexity of these themes kept me intrigued from the start, and allowed me to introspect with the characters. Tomas's concupiscence was baffling at first, but added to the controversial effect of the novel.Truth, controversy, honesty, and reality in concordance with androgyny and death eroticism is ingeniously delivered in one novel. The Traveler is a must read for avid readers of beautiful literature."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler, by Antal Szerb, is a captivating novel which takes the reader into the life of a young Hungarian Jew during the devastating period of the Holocaust. Throughout the majority of the book, the main character, Mihaly journeys all over Italy in a pursuit to find his true self, only to encounter obstacles that prevent him from reaching the happiness he once had. The beginning of the novel was nowhere near as interesting as the rest since due to the fact that it did not start to intensify and get more enjoyable until Part two, the fugitive. The imagery that is provided, along with the characters realism helps the reader to envision what is going on with the character and with the story, as well as visualize themselves in his position since a lot of people have similar problems within themselves. As you continue to read the book you find that there is more action and conflict coming into play creating a greater feeling of suspense. The suspense that is produced in The Traveler leaves the reader wanting to know more about what will happen next.

The main character Mihaly is a man who was on his honeymoon in Venice, Italy, with his wife Erszi. This is a place he had always wanted to go. The honeymoon should've been romantic and relaxing and it was anything but that. Mihaly and Erszi were not meant for each other. She was deeply in love with him whereas he didn't share such strong feelings for her in return. Mihaly abandoned her on the train. She was on her way to Rome while he continued his trip in a small Italian village. This is when the voyage begins; Milhaly goes on much needed expeditions to recover his past and find his true self.His childhood means a lot to him as he has good memories of his good friends Tamas and Eva, who meant a lot to him. He had even told his wife about the Ulpuis house where Tamas and Eva lived at the time. His past really had a huge effect on him. Although, their is a unique relationship between Mihaly and Tamas. Mihaly had a great love for Tamas, which soon led to obsession. The book involves androgyny, which is when the sexes are blurred, and having some of the same characteristics. Eva was very powerful and carried masculine traits and Tamas and Mihaly had feminine characteristics such as being sentimental. It was not something society accepted in their time though. At the end of the book, Mihaly has realized most of his adult life was spent longing for his childhood and that he has to face reality. The translation by Peter Hargitai didn't let you miss a thing, by revealing secrets and keeping you interested. I gave this book five starts because it was daring and completely different from any other book I have read. Many people dwell on the past and this book really opens your eyes to see how you can overcome."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"\\"The Traveler\\" by Antal Szerb is without a doubt one of the greatest novels I have ever read. It keeps you hooked from the beginning to the end; it keeps the audience wondering what is going to happen with Mihaly (the traveler) and his journeys around Italy. The novel contained detailed descriptions of cities in Italy; also it has a historical background of many of his journeys like: paintings and sculptures. I think that the title of the book is very accurate, Mihaly indeed was a traveler, he was traveling to find Eva, which in my opinion symbolizes death to Mihaly. Eva was the female siren which the Etruscans believed in, they believed that death was represented by a female, and in this case Mihaly knew that he had to die by Eva's hand. So his death could be pleasurable, in other words dying by Eva's hands was erotic to him. It was a great translation by Peter Hargitai. He managed to transmit the philosophical message that this book contained to the audience; it is a great piece of work a masterpiece in my opinion. This is the kind of book that makes you think about what death could be like, makes you wonder... is there something after death? The book made me reflect on this topic which has always remained a mystery, but everyone wants to discover. I give it two thumbs up! Believe me is a must have."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Antal Szerb's The Traveler was a very interesting book to read. It was about the journeys of Mihaly and all the obstacles he had to overcome to find his true self. He leaves during his honeymoon to find a bottle of wine and leaves his wife, Erzsi, alone worrying about him. Erzsi is madly in love with Mihaly, but Mihaly feels differently. He is a very strange character and not like other men. He has some feminine characteristics in him that will make some people think that he is a latent homosexual.During the story, Mihaly is in a constant struggle with his feelings of nostalgia. He talks about his childhood games with Tamas and Eva at the Ulpius house and how those were the best times of his life. As you read the book, you will find the death and eroticism in it. Mihaly has a fantasy of dying in the hands of Eva, just like Tamas. He admits to loving Tamas more than anything in the world, and that Eva was a bonus to have around. It seemed as if Mihaly was confused about his sexuality.The Traveler depicts the roles of men and women in the 1930s. Men were supposed to be the aggressive and dominant ones in a relationship, but Mihaly did not have any of these attributes. At thirty-six, he didn't even know what he wanted in life and at times depended on others. On the other hand, Erzsi knew what she wanted in her future. She was more of a man than Mihaly ever was. It was a shame that Mihaly couldn't take care of a woman as beautiful and complete as Erzsi."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Antal Szerb's The Traveler tells the story of Mih&aacute;ly and his struggle to accept his past.

That very past, the one he is trying to escape, comes back in the form of his devious friend J&aacute;nos Szepetneki, the religiously devout Ervin, the unforgettable Eva, and the forever young Tam&aacute;s. Szerb takes the reader on a trip across both the famous and often overlooked cities of Italy with Mih&aacute;ly on the forefront of it all. Through the characters of Mih&aacute;ly and the Ulpius siblings, Szerb is able to effectively question the previously unquestioned roles of the sexes by developing the theme of androgyny. Androgyny, which indicates a blurring of the traditional role of men and women, is seen quite often in the way Mih&aacute;ly and Tam&aacute;s are passive creatures when compared to the extremely dominant Eva. For one, Mih&aacute;ly loves playing the part of the victim while Eva is able to hold her liquor better than any of the men.

I think this book is a revelation for it touches topics such as androgyny, suicide, homosexuality and incest, to name a few. The fact that most of the book storyline is developed in Italy, guides the reader to imagine every single circumstance deeply. I do not know why, but for me Italy does not only represent love and passion, but also intrigue. Mihaly (the main character) signifies the blurry idea of a man living the present. He dresses in a fashion that in those days might have been seen with indifferent eyes. Also, he is in a continue search for his own personality. In many cases one can confuse his sexual preferences and think he is gay. But there is also the idea of him just being a desperate lover and a true soul. To a certain point, I thought this man was just in need of someone to support him. I must think this, because of his thought on committing suicide (which in my world is just cowardice) and then changing from being such a dedicated mind for studies to a \\"no mattering anything\\" kind of like person. It is a strange book, but at the same time, this is what captures the reader to ask for more about the future of Mihaly. I personally think he is just living in another world full of idiotic messages that do not form a real idea of what he wants to do with his life. Perhaps, one day he would realize all the time he has wasted on imaginary desires wanting to change his surroundings."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The book The Traveler by Antal Szerb is a story of a man named Mihaly who is trying to find himself. The book contains themes that during the time the book was written were unthinkable and controversial. Today, even though the topics like androgyny, suicide and homosexuality are controversial people tend to accept them a little bit more than back in the late 1930s. Mihaly's experiences in the Ulpius house give the reader a sense that the characteristics of man and woman are mixed. Mihaly's childhood friends, Eva and Tamas Ulpius are the characters in those games. Eva usually played the role of the aggressive and violent character which in real life tends to be the characteristics of a man, on the other hand, Mihaly and Tamas used to play the role of the weak, passionate victim who get killed by the role which Eva plays. These games make the reader think about the exchange of characteristics and make the man and female roles blurry. The exchange of gender roles and Mihaly's obsession with Tamas make the reader think that Mihaly is a homosexual. The author's way to use the topics make the reader think because it is not straight forward but rather in a symbolic way. For example, the games in the Ulpiuses house and also Mihaly's [passion for wine and art, which show his soft side. Mihaly realizes that each person is different and that every person we meet in life will have some effect in our own life, which was the case in Mihaly's life, where each person he ran into taught him something.

Issues such as androgyny, homosexuality, one's rite of passage, and death eroticism are included in the story. All these issues were never dared to be spoken of in 1937. Therefore, the way the author boldly chose to illustrate them is absolutely extraordinary. He takes the idea that men and women are said to have certain roles in life, and changes all of it around. In life, men are said that they must be aggressive, rough, crude, and like sports, while women should be passive, delicate, practical, polite, and like the arts. In the book, he is trying to say that it doesn't have to be that way. He tells us that it's okay for men to like art and Greek wine, and that it's okay for women to be dominant and be good with money, although those characteristics should be liked by the opposite gender. From the moment you begin the story, you always have the slightest feeling that Mihaly may possibly be homosexual. From the search for wine and interest in arts, to the obsession he has towards his old friend, Tamas, it was occurrences such as these that definitely got me thinking. Moreover, the fact that Mihaly is chooses dark, secretive places like dark alleys shows us that he is also obsessed with death. You find out later one that this obsession began from childhood, and every character introduced in the novel plays an important role in his life. Likewise, you come to realize that in reality, everyone you are introduced to also plays an important role in your life. These people, and the encounters you go through in life, mold you into the person you are today.

Antal Szerb writes of issues that would have been unthinkable at the time he wrote it. Through his story he was able to break barriers that others would have never even attempted. In a time where issues such as androgyny, death eroticism and homosexuality were unspoken, the author clearly depicts such things as he is on a quest to try and find his true self. On a honeymoon in Italy, Mihaly is fascinated by all the art that surrounds him. Something which was not common at the time, a man loving art. He leaves his new wife and goes out to find a drink and to see more art, instead of being with his wife on their honeymoon. The novel itself questions our male and female roles in society. The many characters that are introduced throughout the story such as Eva also convey the question to the readers. Along with this, the characters all play an important role in Mihaly's life. As with the character Tamas, he tells Mihaly to grow up. This is where the issue of Mihaly's rite of passage is introduced. The book's dark and somber scenes give way to the reader's thoughts that Mihaly is fascinated with death. When first reading the book, it is possible to think that the main character is a homosexual. As one reads on, it is very clear that the Mihaly is obsessed with death which begins from his childhood with Tamas and Eva, and continues on through his adulthood. This novel is one in which will keep you turning the pages to find out what happens next. It is a story of bravery and courage, and that of being honest and true to oneself even though it does not comply with the standards society has set. I recommend that everyone read this book because it will teach to love oneself and to not be afraid to question who one really is.

This book was written in 1937 and the topics that it deals with were very taboo at the time. In his novel Antal Szerb thoroughly investigates the subject of androgeny and the femme fatale.It is clear in this novel that Antal Szerb was writing from personal experiences a point that is reinforced by the superbly done afterword by Peter Hargitai. I really enjoyed the fact that the afterword explained alot of things that may have gone unnoticed on a first read. It truly explains Antal's work the way he may have wanted it.The novel is about a man named Mihaly who is separated from his wife on their honeymoon and his journey to fix the missing links between his childhood and his adult life. On this journey he learns alot about himself as he travels throughout europe in search of his childhood love Eva and the reason for his friend Tamas' suicide.The Traveler to me is a masterful piece of literature that has one of the most enthralling story lines ever.

They were real close as childhood friends and always played roles with Tamas' sister, Eva, who was the one that dominated the two and always found a way to end their role play in death or sacrifice of the two. This book has a lot to do with death eroticism and the feeling that one might get from being dead or coming close to death. A good example of death eroticism would be when Tamas and Mihaly took some morphine to try and end their lives. Mihaly was not sure about wanting to die, but when he found out that the morphine was provided by Eva, he was all for it. While Mihaly was on his honeymoon with his wife Erzsi in Italy, he manages to get away from her and go his own way. He wants to explore the world and doesn't seem to be content with anything that he has. He ends up meeting his old childhood friends while he is in Italy and asks about Tamas.

Of course, if a person is fluent with both of these languages, the process of translation becomes easier. There is art involved in writing poems; and most of this art is lost when a poem is translated. Reading Hargitai's translation is amazing. I feel all of the art in those poems is not forgotten by the translation. If the poems were a movie I would give it two thumbs up, and if they were a hotel, I would say it is a five star hotel. This translation does not make the peom simple; instead, Hargitai gives it a special rhythm that does not need of rhyme schemes. This is poetry!I could only relate to real poetry, and these are the perfect peoms that could get into my mind and actually mean something to me. Personally, I believe that all the poems concerning madness, sadness, and death, are the ones I could relate to the most. I could never write a love poem, and the first real poem I wrote was about death. On the other hand, I think that \\"My Love\\" is such a beautiful poem. This is love; in my case, the line \\"How long I waited for you to find me\\", relates to me because I thought I was never going to find the one I wanted for me.

Hargitai reveals all the dark and confusing secrets that the novel and his author had. For example: Mihaly's sexuality. After reading the whole novel, the reader gets a very confusing idea of it, but thanks to Hargitai's discovery of Tamas and Eva being the same person, the whole mystery is exposed and the reader is able to understand the novel's androgyny theme.In a one to five scale, I'll give the book a five because of its excellent content and even tough it was originally written by Antal Szerb I think that Hargitai deserves a big part of the credit because of his translation and brilliant Afterword."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Antal Szerb introduces into the world of literature a story about the journey to self discovery.

In recounting Mihaly's past, the most intriguing part is his double life, so-to-speak, at the Ulpius House.I refer to a double life in Mihaly because at the Ulpius house he finds an escape. Tamas and Eva provide for him a fantastic world of stories, epics and plays which allow him to be anything. He is not just the son of a traveling salesman or a student.

While reminiscing about the past, Mih&aacute;ly came to realize that he was not over it and that he wanted to revert back to that lifestyle of adolescence. He even mentions how he cannot have anyone be dependent on him because he cannot tolerate the responsibility that comes with being the reliable one. Therefore, he leaves his wife by abandoning her on a train and then sends her a letter saying, \\"not to look for him,\\" which already shows how he is back to acting like an adolescent running away from his responsibilities.Through the following events that Mih&aacute;ly encounters, it is evident that he is obsessed with his childhood friends and cannot let go of the past. He experiences several hallucinations of his deceased friend, Tam&aacute;s, whom he loved and desired to be like at one point because of his way of being, especially when referring to death. Mih&aacute;ly also goes in search of &Eacute;va, the girl whom he found beauty in and saw a piece of her in every girl he was with afterwards. This relentlessness with his adolescence is what causes Mih&aacute;ly to turn his life upside down by leaving his wife, his job, and his family, which is suggested he married and joined the family business because it was his way of growing up and being a \\"respectable adult.\\" However, while on his journey through Italy he comes to realize that to be an adult he has to deal with the past and let it go in order to move on to the next stage in his life.Mih&aacute;ly was ready to commit suicide, as his friend Tam&aacute;s had done, because he felt that because of him his family was going through a financial crisis, making him responsible for their suffering, which is not part of being an adolescent. Furthermore, he felt alone because he was not with his family and &Eacute;va would no longer be in the same city. Therefore, by dying he would be staying true to his adolescent self and not have to deal with anymore responsibility.However, he is asked to be a godfather, accepts and realizes that these Italians are good people and that he is not alone anymore. Moreover, his father comes back into his life and urges him to come back home to Budapest where his family needs him. These last two events cause Mih&aacute;ly to realize that he does not want to die and thus, has finally let go of the past and made the transition from adolescence to adulthood."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Most of us have experienced a moment in our lives when we realized that our thoughts as well as actions have changed and feel that we might be entering adulthood. As an adult, perceptions about life as well as the world change, we become more aware of different aspects of life. For example, children have a worry-free view on life, while adults usually have a more worrisome view on life. In The Traveler we are introduced to a character named Mihaly who seems like he has not gone through transformation from adolescence to adulthood. In various occasions he even mentions that he believes himself not to be ready for marriage or any responsibilities, like a child. We all have responsibilities that we have to face, whether it is during adolescence or adulthood. However, our age doesn't determine our level of maturity, our actions do. Mihaly is the perfect example of a person who is an adult but doesn't act like one."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The quest for the self is something that everyone experiences throughout his or her life and for this reason, everyone can relate in some way to the book, The Traveler by Antal Szerb. This book grasps the curiosity of the reader in the first few sentences and the interest is not lost until the final page. The title of the book is very appropriate because it depicts one man's travels and how he discovers new things about himself in every location he visits. With intricate themes as well as unusual characters, the plot gets more and more interesting as the story unfolds. On his laborious journey, Mih&aacute;ly is on a relentless search for answers to many of his unanswered questions about his life and in the end eventually discovers himself.While on his honeymoon in Italy, Mih&aacute;ly begins to vividly describe his eccentric childhood friends and experiences. Consequently, this causes him to feel a sense of nostalgia. Many of his pleasant memories are in the Ulpius house, where Mih&aacute;ly and his friends, Eva and Tam&aacute;s, acted out several theatrical productions. In the Ulpius house, the children were able to disconnect from the outside world and enter a world of creativity. In discussing his past with his wife, Mih&aacute;ly discovers that the strange signs he has been trying to repress are all around him. Janos Szepetneki, an old jealous friend, finds Mih&aacute;ly in Venice and reminds him of his odd past, leading Mih&aacute;ly into an obsessive search for questions about his adolescent life. He then purposely leaves his wife and escapes his life of conformity, experiencing a sense of confusion as to the purpose of life.When Mih&aacute;ly arrives at a monastery in Gubbio, he is astonished when he runs into his childhood friend Ervin, who has now become a monk. Ervin suggests that Mih&aacute;ly go to Rome to search for answers to his many questions. However, in Rome he becomes more confused and he finds more complicated situations which cause him to become very frustrated. Feeling defeated, Mih&aacute;ly confesses that \\"nothing has sense anymore\\" (207). Mih&aacute;ly wanted desperately to relive the nostalgia of it all and this almost brought about his fatal end. However, it was Mih&aacute;ly's weak character and conformist attitude that ultimately saves him. In the end, he chooses life due to his countless doubts and the realization that death is no longer desirable.At the end of his journey, Mih&aacute;ly finally puts to rest his burning desire to relive his past once and for all. The appearance of Mih&aacute;ly's father, who had been absent all of his life, played a major role in his self-actualization process. His obsessive longing for Tam&aacute;s' death as well as his desire to die were not in existence anymore (233). Mih&aacute;ly finally concludes his desperate search to find himself and no longer yearns to experience his childhood again. Mih&aacute;ly experiences a complete transformation of his inner self, which in turn allows him to discover and be content with the person he had become."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler, by Antal Szerb, is a thought provoking novel documenting the journey of a man named Mihaly. Mihaly's story is based on Szerb's own experiences and the book can be viewed somewhat as an autobiography. One of the themes in The Traveler is that of the psychic journey in search of the one's self. Mihaly embodies this theme in that he is not sure of who he is or wants to become. In an attempt to please his family and feel normal, he takes a job at his father's firm and gets married as all men in society do, however, on his honeymoon, a midlife crisis begins to surface as he starts to doubt who he has become and what he has accomplished. Mihaly is not ready to take on the responsibilities of a husband or that of an adult. When he is in Italy, his repressed childhood past is unleashed and he is haunted by his best friend, Tamas, who killed himself many years ago. Mihaly is drawn into the dark of his past which conflicts with his present and future. As a result, he eventually unknowing separates himself from his wife, Erzsi, justifying that it was fate; in his own mind, however, he believes Tamas is guiding him. Mihaly is searching for an answer in his mind and channeling that search through exploring various cities, hoping to find a sign that will lead him to where he thinks he should be: near death. The nostalgia, which he blames as his downfall, interferes with Mihaly's duties as an adult, husband, son, and even a person. To resolve his desire and move on with living, Mihaly must locate who was closest to Tamas at his death, Eva, Tamas's sister, or he will destroy himself and the lives of those who love him.As a boy and young man, he was always exposed to death in the Ulpious house and because of that, Mihaly followed in the actions of Tamas and Eva. Now after both of them are gone he has difficulty adjusting to focus on life and living as opposed to death and dying. Through his hunt to find Eva, he is indirectly searching for himself and when he finally sees her he is unsure of what is next. Mihaly's whole being is uncertain but when he meets Eva he makes a choice, to follow in Tamas's footsteps. However, in the end Eva reveals to Mihaly that he is not Tamas nor does he want to be, all he is, is himself and in order for him to discover who that is, he must let go of the past and stay away from her forever.The novel is written in a manner portraying an elegant time period and a refined setting. The language is simple yet detailed, but overall the book contains a deep message which can be interpreted in numerous ways by each of its readers. Initially when beginning the book, I found it hard to follow the story, but then it became increasingly complex and engrossed me with its unusual content. I ended up enjoying it and I recommend everyone, if given the chance, to read it because it makes you think and exposes you to a different and more relaxed culture."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler to me was a book of a man coming to be, the self-reflection of the character and his journey to find what makes him complete. . He always hid certain characteristics of himself which would embarrass him, a characteristic many humans have. You see it everyday as people get plastic surgery and garnish themselves in trendy clothes and flashy cars. It's to show society the perfect self, and that is something constructed through socialization. The problem wasn't Mihaly's odd behavior, but the society that pressured him into living a certain lifestyle so he wouldn't be judged by his family and peers.Mihaly is from a middle class business family in Budapest, Hungary. As a child he starts having hallucinations, yet he never tells his parents. \\"The abyss reached me,\\" he says, \\"The earth slid from under my feet, and I was hanging there in space, my hands holding fast to the railing\\"(19). Shows the obvious sign of an anxiety attack Yet there is something instilled in Mihaly making him think that such hallucinations are not normal and shouldn't be shared with anyone. An outcast in his own family he is led to the feeling of belonging at the Ulpius's household. As the story progresses you see how he feels he can truly be himself only in the Ulpuis house, the only ones who can accept the real Mihaly. Not even Tamas or Eva knew all of Mihaly. Mihaly recalls, \\" Still I felt contrite about the Ulpiuses. Felt I was betraying them. What they regarded as natural and free was for me a difficult and fitful rebellion\\" (27), it shows that Mihaly still couldn't assimilate fully into the Ulpius lifestyle because there were certain things he chose not to share.As a result, Mihaly lead so much of his life in disguise, with a mask over his true character. After him and his childhood gang dissolved he pursued to portray the perfect image of a successful Hungarian businessman, and with all the acting experience he received as a young teen, he succeeded in this role. Even with his own wife he is ashamed of his true character. For example\\" There are men who, like Mihaly, prefer this carefree variety of love to the earnest and official type of lovemaking. Mihaly was immensely ashamed of this tendency\\" (59). You start noticing in the middle of the story how he is exhausted with playing this role and escapes in a quest to find his true self. Even though there are clues in the text hinting of Mihaly's homoerotic tendencies I believe his love for Tamas and wish to be with him was only because his need for closure, not because of sexual desires.Moreover in The Traveler there are various themes discussed. As I embraced Mihalys personality, unlike the character himself I embraced his flaws. But it shows the extent individuals will go through to reform for a sense of a homogenous identity, a perfect identity. Some follow other measures such as cars, jewelry and a perfect fit body to fulfill that sense. If Mihaly as a child would have learned to share his eccentricity instead of shunning it the outcome of The Traveler would have been much different. One should not withhold distinctive traits yet buff them into your personality to give you a greater sense of self."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler, written by Hungarian writer Antal Szer and translated in English by Peter Hargitai, tells the story of the cyclical journey of the main character of the book, Mihaly. The author indicates how Mihaly's whole life and his search for self-identity depends on his journey in Italy, after Mihaly left his wife during their honeymoon. Mihaly is an androgynous person. The author draws him as a heterosexual man who likes women, but who at the same time is confused in his emotions towards two best childhood friends, Tamas and Eva, brother and sister, who also carry inside them certain levels of androgyny. Typical female and male characteristics are eroded between these young people. Mihaly and Tamas are sensitive, gentle, and emotional, and at some level, indecisive characters, who like to play victims' roles during their childhood games. At the same time, Eva is presented as a strong, practical, manipulative character, who during the same games handled the cruel roles of invaders and torturers. It seems as if Mihaly's feelings, his adoration of his best friend Tamas, is about to go outside the pale of regular men's friendship, but he doesn't admit to himself his possible homosexuality, and finally finds himself involved in a bewildering pursuit of Eva. It is hard for Mihaly to realize that he loves Eva, and she becomes his apparition, the phantom from his childhood who persecutes his conscience through the years. Only after his marriage with Erzsi, Mihaly understands that he has to find Eva at all costs. However, androgyny is not the only main topic that is covered in The Traveler. In addition, much attention is paid book to the topic of death-eroticism, and awareness of the difference between a wish for death and a fear of death. The idea of death, like a thin needle, goes through the plot of the story. The main characters are anxious about the idea of a beautiful, romantic, and pleasant way to leave this world. It starts from the games that they play as children in which Eva kills Mihaly and Tamas, and they experience the highest level of satisfaction from dying. It continues when Tamas and Mihaly try to commit suicide as teenagers. Finally, Tamas succeeds in his desire for death and kills himself with Eva's help. When Mihaly gets to know that, he feels something close to envy. It appears to be the greatest pleasure for him, something extremely erotic to leave this world with the help of his muse, the only real love of his life. Moreover, it seems to be one of the main reasons that motivates him during his search for Eva. No, he does not want to just simply die; he is afraid of ordinary death. That is why he is so terrified at night when he baptizes an Italian boy. He is drunk, and it seems to him that those strange Italian people are going to steal his money and kill him; this fear of being killed horrifies him. Nevertheless, he wishes for death in front of Eva. There are also many other important and interesting topics covered in this book. The Traveler really surprised me. I did not expect to find in the book that was assigned for my English class so many interesting thoughts about life, people, characters, and relationships. I would recommend that everybody pick up a copy. It is definitely a five-star story."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler, by Antal Szerb is a story about a the journey the main character, Mihaly, faces on his path to find himself. The story begins in the midst of his honeymoon. Coincidentally through the sudden urge for coffee Mihaly becomes separated with his wife and is now placed on a path in which he must travel alone. As they depart each other via separate trains, the two unalike characters travel Europe on similar tracks that mirror one another to the tee.The matrimony between the two was odd from the very beginning due to their diverse personalities and their split, no matter how accidental, was inevitable. Erzsi is shown to be the epitome of a true lady with a proper upbringing. With her congenial nature, she was the typical woman a man ought to marry. Mih&aacute;ly was depicted as an aloof individual with a mysterious aura. Zoltan did not even consider Mih&aacute;ly a man, I think, because of his childish desires and obsession to preserve his youth. \\"As his wife ends up in Rome and Mih&aacute;ly in Perugia, he is thrilled that \\"he had personally discharged of her\\" (Szerb 83). He travels to Foligno where he befriends Dr. Ellesley, the man attempting on bringing Mih&aacute;ly back to health. He then meets an American girl named Millicent, who he is captivated by. Erzsi overwhelmed with sadness because of her failed marriage, journeys to Paris and finds Sari, whom she creates a relationship with that resembles the friendship of Dr. Ellesley and Mih&aacute;ly. Erzsi comes across Janos again, and like Mih&aacute;ly, obtains a new lover. As they continue in residing in separate cities, the two begin to have financial problems that force them to live simple, mediocre lives and become \\"thrifty\\".As the plot thickens, both characters are visited by their past. Mih&aacute;ly sees Eva again after several years and Erzsi dines with Zoltan, whom she hasn't seen since their divorce. Once again the two cross paths, through the conspiracy of Janos and Zoltan, mirroring each other in the fact that they were both betrayed for money. When the story begins to come to and end they both are placed in situations where they realize that their current situations are no longer what they desire. Mihaly no longer desires this \\"death wish\\", \\"his longing had been satisfied\\"(Szerb,266), and Ezsri no longer wishes to live the life of a student. Eventually they both become rescued by the male figures in their lives, Ezsri by her ex-husband, and Mihaly by his father. Ironically the story ends with both characters returning to their lives at the state in which it was before they married each other."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"This novel tells a story of a man that fights hard to find himself and his true passions. It is a book that remained locked away from the eyes of many readers and brought to light the many secrets hidden about the author. The author of this great masterpiece was unable t express his true passions and loves to the world around him. Even though the author had many censors, he was able to write a magnificent story that held true to him. The chaos and wonderful drama embodied in this novel catches the reader by surprise. There is adventure, love, confusion and much more portrayed in The Traveler. There is a lot of passion through every page as the protagonist keeps amazing the reader."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Finding out that you've been lying to yourself your whole life and see yourself not even sure what you want in life is something that doesn't normally happend on yur wedding night. But it did to Mihaly (the protagonistof the book The Traveler) and Erzsi on theirs. Mihaly, I thought through the beginning of the book was confused about his sexuality as he says he has feelings for his best friend Tamas. But as I was intrigued by this love story I find it's more of a self dicovery. Him and his wife get seperated by getting on two different trains, but it seems to Mihaly that it was maybe more of a favor to him. Being obsessed with his passed he goes on a journey to find something like it or to discover who he really is.

He goes on a journey on his own to find himself, and heals the many problems he has and is going through. This book kept my attention from beginning to end. Mihali, the main character, will not let you put this book down. You'll be surprised when you finish it in one day...I was."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"I have read many of Hargitai's books and I think they are all great, but this translation that he made of Antal Szerb's Traveler is magnificent. The book itself is a masterpiece, but the Afterword written by Peter Hargitai makes this version the best one ever written. Hargitai reveals all the dark and confusing secrets that the novel and his author had. For example: Mihaly's sexuality. After reading the whole novel, the reader gets a very confusing idea of it, but thanks to Hargitai's discovery of Tamas and Eva being the same person, the whole mystery is exposed and the reader is able to understand the novel's androgyny theme.In a one to five scale, I'll give the book a five because of its excellent content and even tough it was originally written by Antal Szerb I think that Hargitai deserves a big part of the credit because of his translation and brilliant Afterword."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler was an interesting book, but I was not that interested in the book that much. I'm the type of guy that likes action in a book or movie, and this book was more like a strange love story. This guy named Mihaly is married, but he has some weird obsession with his best friend, Tamas. Mihaly had more than just a friendly relationship. He actually had some feelings for this guy, but yet he still dates women. Mihaly even followed this English-man down the streets and alleyways because the man almost looked like Tamas. Mihaly and Tamas used to be schoolmates, but they went their separate ways. Throughout his travels, Mihaly has been in many flings with women, which tends to make this book a romance novel. He tries to find his true self, while all these romances and signs of lust with these women.I recommend this to those who love romance novels. It's not an action novel, but there is lots of love and lust during his travels. I personally didn't like the book. It seemed like the story dragged a little. Even though I am not a fan of romance stories, but if you do....this is diffinitely the book."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Peter Hargitai made a great job translating this novel. He captured the exact emotions and detail the Antal Szerb was portraying. Antal Szerb shares a magnificent story about the finding of &quot;self&quot; with his readers through his fiction THE TRAVELER.Mihaly, the novel's protagonist, goes on a spiritual journey. He is obssessed with his past and struggles to let go of it. He seeks to find something like it, whether it be his beloved best friend Tamas or Eva, the girl he claimed to have never loved.Szerb touches on many of the famous Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Jung's conclusions of the collective unconscious. The collective unconscious is made up of &quot;primordial images&quot;. For one, he included fantasies that Mihaly had about Eva. He loved it when they acted out a play because she always played as his superior. He called her an &quot;enchanting princess.&quot; He also included experiences such as the confrontation of death which is at least mentioned throughout half of the book. Finally, he included the symbolic abyss that Tamas saved Mihaly from falling into and this was how Mihaly became very much attached to him.If you enjoyed Hermann Hesse's novels, SIDDHARTHA AND DEMIAN, you will surely enjoy this book as well. If Szerb might have not intenionally taken the approach to Carl Jung's ideas, it was still genius."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"After I read this book, I looked for other pieces of literature from this writer. But I had soon discovered that Mr. Szerb was killed in the concentration camps under Hitler's brutal reign of terror. It is a shame for the world to lose such a gifted writer as this.This book is probably one of the most risque books I have ever read in my entire life. If it were to one day reach popularity at the levels of \\"Harry Potter\\", it would gain a great amount of controversy. This books subject matter ranges from incest all the way through homoeroticism. It is the \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" of its day. This book is filled with adult content, so my recommendation goes to those in a very mature high school level and above.Although the book is filled with the kinds of things that people would see daily on \\"Jerry Springer\\", the reader cannot deny its artisitc quality, being very well written, and having strong sentence structure. When everyone thinks that people in that day and age were innocent, \\"The Traveler\\" proves just the opposite.

Now in his thirties and just married he finally decides to clean out his closet by telling Erzsi about his dark adolescent secrets at the Ulpius house. The reader becomes intrigued to find out all about Eva and Tamas Ulpius, two outcasts who accepted Mihaly in their home and life. The story begins in this way and takes on from there.\\"The Traveler\\" was well written. The storyline was quite interesting yet a little monotonous. This novel is complex and a slightly difficult to read and understand. In order to truly understand and appreciate this novel the reader must keep in mind that it's partly fictional and symbolic. Themes such as androgyny, incest, and homo-eroticism are heavily focused on.I give this novel three stars.

I give it five stars."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Antal Szerbs novel The Traveler portrays the lives of many interesting characters. Each of their distinguished personalities and motives eventually come together to enhance the novels incredible plot. Tamas is mentioned many times, however, he never actually appears (except as a ghost which Mihaly sees in the cemetery) because he is only spoken of as someone in the past. The main character, Miahaly is obsessed with Tamas and Eva. Although he tells his wife, Erezi different, she is not oblivious to his feelings for Eva which are later confessed.I was intrigued with the idea of Mihaly trying to move forward in life by searching for pieces of his past. He refused to go back to Budapest because he longed to find Eva in Rome. When he finally meets with Eva he basically implies that he would like to continue life through death, just as Tamas. He loved his childhood friend so much that he wanted to die like him, with Eva by his side.Many truths are unveiled throughout the book. However, the deepest secrets of the novel are told in the afterword. Here, the The Traveler\`s translator Peter Hargitai reveals certain things that allows readers understand Antal Szerbs inspiration and other hidden themes. I give The Traveler a four star rating, because I deem it a page turner. I continued to read with anticipation of upcoming excitement and drama."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"In The Traveler by Antal Szerb, the main character, Mih&aacute;ly forces himself to live in a world that he has created only in his mind. According to him, the Ulpius house was the perfect house to live in. Every time he steps into this house, his world changes. \\"Tam&aacute;s Ulpius lived in an old, ramshackle place. But only old and ramshackle on the outside; the interior was very pleasant and homey\\". This house was part of this perfect world he has created for himself. Tam&aacute;s was his ideal character, which at the same time was Eva, Tam&aacute;s's sister. When Szerb's translator, Peter Hargitai visited Szerb's widow in 1988 and asked her for Tam&aacute;s and Eva Ulpius, she directed him to a picture where only Tam&aacute;s was showing. \\"This is also Eva. Tam&aacute;s and Eva are one and the same\\". This explains Mih&aacute;ly's obsession with these two characters throughout his life. It is this world the one which constantly keeps him away from his reality.Inside the Ulpius house their lives was an \\"ongoing theatre, and endless commedia dell'arte\\". \\"The smallest thing was enough to set things in motion\\". There was always a tragic final to all of these plays, the death. Eva, Tam&aacute;s and Mih&aacute;ly always performed the plays. Mih&aacute;ly was obsessed with death as well, for him it could be the end to his imaginary life, which does not let him evolve as a normal person. We see how the three of them have to be involved in all of these plays in order for it to work out perfectly, which was part of Mih&aacute;ly's fantasy. As a result of these games, Tam&aacute;s tried to suicide many times. By creating these types of characters, Szerb makes the novel interesting and suspenseful. The reader is always expecting something to happen next.Although the love story of these three characters may seem unreal and crazy, their struggle between idealism and reality is true to life. How often we idealize something or someone so much that we end up avoiding our own reality, just to don't hurt ourselves. Mih&aacute;ly gave up on soccer and all the things he enjoyed the most in order to be part of the Ulpius house, as someone who may fall in love with her or his significant other may change his or her way of life forever."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The book \\"The Traveler\\" by Antal Szerb and translated by Peter Hargitai, is an interesting book that keeps you wanting more.

The plot would unwind, and then rewind, and for entertainment's sake unwind again. The novel is full of mysterious lines and sentences that left me wanting more. I couldn't wait to find out the answers to my questions.Then suddenly and without any warning I found myself locked in my room for 5 hours while I finished the rest of the novel. I suddenly became entranced with the mysterious aura that surrounded Antal Szerb's characters. The novel consists of a bombardment of plot twists and cliffhanger sentences and paragraphs. Almost every chapter and section ended with one or two lines that would take control of my curiosity and I was unable to put the book down. The character development was incredible and every single character was interesting. Upon completion of the novel I finally understood what the author was trying to accomplish in the first 100 pages. The web of intrigue that Antal Szerb created made this novel worth reading. I would say that the novel was very easily one of the most enthralling books I have ever read.

He is very specific when he gives details and that takes deep inside the story. I wish I could speak Hungarian though, I'm sure it must be even better in its original version. It's like watching a movie in a foreign language. It's very hard for translators to express as much energy and emotion as the actual characters.I like how the story is set like a journey. It reminds me of another book I read not long ago that follows the same pattern. It's called the Celestine Prophecy. I recommend it to anybody who enjoyed this book and has questions about the way us, living things, interact with each other.I did learn some things in this book through the characters and their various personalities.I still don't understand what in this book got the author executed. I will inquire about it andfigure it out on my own.As for Journey by Moonlight, I had been told that the Traveler had been translated by some British individual.

He tells Erszi all about his childhood memories at the Ulpius house where Tamas and Eva lived. Tamas was Mihaly's very best friend who led Mihaly toward a fatal obsession, along with Tamas sister Eva whom they all longed for. Eva was the girl that all the boys in the Ulpius longed for, making each boy think she was in love with each of them. Janos was another friend of the Ulpius house that was a crook and an imposter, not to be trusted and who became even more untrustworthy in his adult years. Ervin was always the \\"good\\" one. He introduced religion to the others and appropriately grew up to be a monk. Mihaly was always the very sensitive young man who grew up to be an adult who would become haunted by his childhood, something he longed for most of his adult life.

The story begins in Venice, Italy, the place where Mih&aacute;ly (the main character) is celebrating his honeymoon with his wife Erzi. Suddenly, an unexpected encounter with J&aacute;nos Szepetneki, an old friend of Mih&aacute;ly, stirred up the protagonist's past. It is when Mih&aacute;ly mistakenly boards the wrong train where his journey truly begins and launches his pilgrimage to find his true self. Clearly, Mih&aacute;ly was determined to visit different places, but what he was truly doing was exploring his character.

Evidently, he's obsessed with his past, with the Ulpius house, where he used to play the victim with Tam&aacute;s and where they would die through or for &Eacute;va. He doesn't seem to let go of his past and later decides to commit suicide just like his friend Tam&aacute;s did. He arranges everything with &Eacute;va but an unexpected event changes his intention and he's finally cured of his past. The style of the language is poetic, elegant as it suggests the time of the 1930's."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"This novel is a journey through spiritual and emotional turmoil to death characterized via Mihaly. The novel is full of suspenseful events transporting readers to the places and to the lives of the main characters. The chief character's obsession with death originated from his childhood games and is a dominant theme. Emphasizing the extremity of his emotion, the mysterious attraction between a man and a woman is colored by an inscrutable death wish. The poetic flavor of the prose gives the novel an authentic historical and cultural dimension to compliment its exotic content.The novel reminds me of the movie Gloomy Sunday. It is about love and death; it is a love triangle. Similar to the main character in the novel, the primary character in Gloomy Sunday experiences an extreme emotion, passion. Through his emotion he creates a melody that stimulates people to commit suicide. Eventually, like Mihaly, he desires to die as a result of his passion and the effects of it in others. It is the mystical aspect I mentioned, the obsession, seduction and the symbolism around death that intrigues me.The subject of death provokes curiosity because of its enigmatic nature. Because of man's curiosity about his origin and destiny, death continues to be a reoccurring theme in many creative masterpieces."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The novel \\"The Traveler\\", by Antal Szerb takes us on one mans journey through life as he tries to unravel the mysteries of his past. It begins with a couple on their honeymoon, Mihaly and Erzsi, and they are taking a trip through Italy. Erzsi is madly in love with Mihaly, where as Mihaly is still stuck in his past and still preoccupied with his childhood friends. There are two in particular, Tamas and Eva, that he constantly dwells on. He and Tamas had a special bond fortified when Tamas in a sense rescued him from Mihaly's panic about falling into an imaginary abyss. They all shared a death wish. They were fascinated with the \\"art\\" of death. Tamas even gets Mihaly to attempt suicide after Tamas had already tried once and failed. They view suicide as embracing thier deaths. They decided that they wanted to be ready and embrace death rather than have it happen by chance one day and not be ready.The book also seems to have an androgynous theme. This resurfaces throughout the book. When questioned, Klari Szerb indicated that Tamas and Eva were both derived from one of her husbands beloved schoolmates. This is also shown in the book when Mihaly is explaining to Erzsi about his childhood at the Ulpius house. He says, \\"But with Tamas and Eva, our adolescent fantasies were to a considerable extent titillated by the way the differences between the sexes would somehow dissolve and acquire a certain androgynous character. As a rule I spoke to Tamas gently and politely as I would to girls; and with Eva I did not feel that tiresome restlessness I often felt with Edit's girl friends.\\"Throughout the book Mihaly is traveling through Italy and ends up in Rome under the advice of another childhood friend of his, Ervin. Here he sees Eva and becomes obsessed with finding her. When he finally finds her, the news about Tamas's suicide and her leaving the country nearly leads a tired and spiritually bankrupt Mihaly to his own suicide. The book is a masterpiece that takes us on a rollercoaster of emotions through the life of Mihaly. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler By one of the best authors Antel Szerb, completes with its inimitable and convincing tales of sweet romance of three lives that lived together as one, and causes problems with friends and lives around him. The Authors use of metaphors gives us a complete detailed surrounding of what to expect with Milhay (one of the main characters in this story) adventures unexpected twist. As you begin to become more inclined in this novel you are forced to ask yourself \\"exactly what will he do next!\\" with sudden changes of the story and exciting new characters that come into play, no one will be able to get there eyes off of this book.In the story, Milhay allowed the ghost of his past to be able to gain control of his actions, to get inside his head. During the story I couldn't help to notice how on his honeymoon he abandoned his wife for a cup of coffee not to mention he did not get back on the same train. He found himself going the complete opposite way as his wife. I felt like he was trying to free himself from all the he has been deprived of. He was not able to be alone for most of his life. He needed the time to be able to let out all his emotional fears and be able to control himself from all of his suicidal intentions.The entire book is wonderful. I really would suggest that you go to your local book store and pick up a copy of it."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"As I began reading Antal Szerb's The Traveler, adroitly translated by Peter Hargitai, I was instantly intrigued by Mihaly's bizarre character. The writer lures you into the book when an old friend of Mihaly's mysteriously interrupts their honeymoon in a not so friendly fashion. The book takes a turn of events after this and the couple end up splitting up. Although Mihaly and Erzsi are going their separate ways, they both travel through the same yet distinct journey in which they try to find themselves. Erzsi arrives in Paris seeking refuge from family, gossip and her ex-husband, and while she is there she finds the girl she once was. The character discovers this new passion to be free of all the standards placed upon her class; at the same time Mihaly is seeking a way out of the monotonous life he has complied with. He tries to reconnect with his past relationship and childhood games with Tamas by searching for Eva. Though Mihaly and Erzsi were separated and had very different experiences throughout their journey, their paths were parallel. Both wanted to be free spirited and to be stripped of their social obligations, yet they both settled for the average life they had before, but before settling, both reached a significant point in their lives. They could either choose what they desired or lead the life they were expected to live. Mihaly did accomplish his desire for death through Vannina so it is understandable that he was able to conform to his life and responsibilities. And Erzsi also got her chance with the Persian, but did not pursue it. It was slightly disappointing to see that in the end they both conformed to being ordinary as opposed to allowing themselves to be free. In a way everyone is on a journey to find themselves or at some point in their lives realize that they are living according to society's standards rather than their own. Therefore it is not difficult for the reader to relate to Mihaly or Erzsi in this sense. In the end of each crossing everyone must choose which road to take. The Traveler brought out the harshness and reality of the decisions one must make in life."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"\\"The Traveler\\" written by Antal Szerb is a very interesting book. It takes us trough the life of a man who struggles with his identity. Mih&aacute;ly, the main character, gets married and becomes a grown up man but he is still attached to his childhood memories. The feelings attached to his friends and way of live when he was younger kept him from having a peaceful life. Mih&aacute;ly, Eva, Ervin, Tam&aacute;s and J&aacute;nos grow up together and each of them represented something special in each of their lives. In the case of Mih&aacute;ly, losing one of them or not knowing how they were doing after several years was like not knowing what happened to a part of his life. That is when he decided to search for his friends, search for his self.Mih&aacute;ly travels to different cities where he meets people and finds his lost friends. In this journey he learns about incest, homophobia, mental disturbances, death and drugs. Once he realized he lost his wife he starts his traveling and finds his way to the past. There was no turning back.In each chapter of the book we learn a new adventure and more questions waiting to be answered: Is Mih&aacute;ly going to get back with his wife? Is he going to die? There is a battle between reality and idolatry. Mih&aacute;ly has Tam&aacute;s as an idol because he is constantly thinking, hearing and seeing him. But the reality is that Tam&aacute;s is dead and there is nothing that can change it. After going though a lot of experiences, Mih&aacute;ly finally leaves his obsessions behind him and goes on with his life.This book is a five star book and I recommend it to anyone who tries to escape from reality and enjoy a mysterious story."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Antal Szerb manages to describe human emotions very profoundly. The main character, Mih&aacute;ly, suffers from a constant paranoia, a feeling of being hunted. Antal Szerb transmits Mih&aacute;ly's persona in a way that the reader can get into the character's mind and understand why and what he is experiencing. The relationship between people in the novel is also well depicted. The mystery of man, woman, death, and rebirth, all of these very profound themes, are found throughout the novel as the character travels through Italy encountering very different and interesting people who are perhaps his guides to what ultimately ends up being his last decision. The Traveler is a novel that climaxes almost every chapter, a very intense and unusual love story, the story of a man, whose search for a meaning in life carries him through many amazing situations, discovering how simple life can be, liberating himself from many curses that had him alienated from the true nature of living.Note worthy how the author portrays the only American character, Millicent. Millicent is a young traveling student of arts that the main character meets at a caf&eacute; along with an English doctor. It was funny how they both, after talking to her, refer to her as naive and pseudo-intellectual, as the typical American girl that will never have the charm or complexity of an European woman. Despite these comments both, Mih&aacute;ly and his friend, are attracted to Millicent. Mih&aacute;ly has a small adventure with her that ends when she must move on to visit another city in Italy. Doctor Ellesley resigns to the fact that Mih&aacute;ly courts her but later in the novel sends a letter telling Mihaly that they are engaged. Truly the innocence and purity of this willowy girl captivated the men used to more complicated and perhaps exhausting European women. She was simple, simple as the conclusion Mih&aacute;ly reaches at the end of the novel."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The book Selected Poems, written by Attila Jozsef, and translated by Peter Hargitai, consists of intimate poetry written through tragic moments. I enjoyed reading through many of the poems, especially ones that expressed the heartbreaking events Attila has experienced in his life. He would write in such great detail and emotion that you could almost feel the agony he was going through at the time. One of my favorite poems in the book was, Too Late for Eulogy. It is about how Attila is angry that his Mother died and left him alone. A particular verse that stands out for me in this poem is, \\"You're a gypsy! Whatever love you gave me, you stole back in your last hour\\". I feel like Attila poured his heart out in this poem.Some other poems in the book had me confused. Attila would write about two totally different issues in one verse. I would have to read these poems over and over again to gain a little clue of what it was about. For example, this is a stanza from a poem called, Dance of Flames (which I really did not understand), \\"We slumber in dry lumber, blaze in coal piles, in the hands of women in love. We crackle under the kettle, our sparks hiss, sputter. We sear great slabs of meat above us. We make even the stone blush.\\" I really did not understand the purpose of this poem. At first he talks about sleeping in the woods and then he talks about making stones blush.Overall I give this book 3 stars. I highly recommend it to mature readers who enjoy reading personal and deep poetry."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Mihaly and his new wife set off on their honeymoon to Italy, not knowing what would happen to them. As the story evolves, Mihaly began on a journey to find himself. The people that he has encountered in his life shaped who he's become and who he will be. I can relate to Mihaly leaving to discover his meaning in life because I have left a place where I was comfortable to venture out on my own and find out who I truly was. Being on his own opend Mihaly's life to his surroundings and where he wanted to be.

The novel, through its twists and turns, and unexpected climaxs proved that the true being of oneself is not perfect and not neccessarily who they want to be but indeed are."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"In The Traveler, Antal Szerb takes us through Mih&aacute;ly's journey. Not the conventional excursion among breathtaking landscapes and sentimental ruins, but through a man's inward journey, his own passage toward insufferavle nostalgia and, finally, an acceptance of life in the here and now. This proves to be an unbearable and almost impossible task to complete as Mih&aacute;ly roams from each historical city to the next seeking guidance from old friends and new acquaintances to free himself of the bittersweet connections to his past: his longing for &Eacute;va and the haunting of Tam&aacute;s's ghost.This highlights one of the principal themes of Szerb's thought provoking novel, the presence of an intimate relationship between death and love, as can be witnessed through the androgynous siblings, as well as in Mih&aacute;ly's death wish. Mih&aacute;ly is torn in two as he searches for &Eacute;va, the embodiment of love, but his constant death fixation draws him towards Tam&aacute;s's ghost, the personification of death. Mih&aacute;ly's suicide date would then lead to the mingling of the love and death forces that are &Eacute;va and Tam&aacute;s. This would culminate as Mih&aacute;ly's ecstasy because longing for love is erotic and death is its fulfillment. Thus, Szerb teaches us that life is the intermingling of love and death.The seemingly emotionally detached Mih&aacute;ly shows us that there is an even deeper sense to the emotion of love. His feelings for &Eacute;va and especially for Tam&aacute;s are of unconditional devotion that surpasses the boundaries of love. The affection for them is so strong that it burdens his soul to be apart from them until he learns to master his longing. This is the profound purpose of his complex journey. Antal Szerb's storytelling along with Peter Hargitai's translation deliver an unforgettable literary feast that will stand the test of time."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler offers an engrossing look at the life of Mihaly, whose psychic struggles engage the reader. Antal Szerb, writes a story that is as compelling as it is witty. The themes in the novel are instense and the symbolism suggestive. It takes you on a spiritual journey, that touches taboo subjects such as homoeroticism and incest, which, along with some supernatural events, make the book very absorbing.It was surprising, yet welcome how the tone of the book shifted in the middle of the novel. The protagonist's despondent death-wish is transcended by a tone of optimisim as Mihaly decides to live his life. I enjoyed the novel very much because, in the end, it was uplifting . The translator's style of language would suggest that the original Hungarian must be very elegant and sophisticated.5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Antal Szerb's The Traveler recounts one man's personal journey through Italy, childhood bonds and suicide. It's main character Mihaly journeys within himself to find his place in the world and in the end free himself from a death obsession which he shared with his childhood loves Tamas and Eva. This is a storyline that as been used in various forms many times before. What is special about this story though is the way in which it unravels as an almost supernaturally destined journey for Mihaly.Mihaly's inward journey is so different because Szerb cleverly crafts a series of coincidences which seemed destined to happen so Mihaly can gain closure about his friend Tamas' death and find Eva. Events, such as accidentally getting on the train to Perugia, finding a doctor who treated Eva and a monk who just happens to be Mihaly's friend Ervin, send Mihaly on the path that eventually saves him. What this does for the story is allow it twists that make the story easier to stay involved with. More importantly, it makes The Traveler powerful and uplifting since it gives the message that it is possible for the forces on this earth to help us find peace within ourselves.The Traveler is a novel which I thoroughly enjoyed reading.

Szerb approaches his principal players with gusto, giving them personas that mesh and ultimately grow. You can see quite clearly that it is the personalities in the book that go on a type of journey, one in themselves and not in the physical sense of jumping from city to city.The story of Mihaly appears fragmented at times as you certainly must ponder why he got married to Erzsi in the first place. He is a haunted man for whom some kind of security is needed. If you analyze his relationships a little bit you get to see the need for companionship as he is not particularly happy in his own skin. The drawback that becomes evident is that he is conflicted when he is with people and almost suicidal when he is alone. He seems unable to escape himself.I would wholeheartedly recommend that you read this book purely for entertainment, but with the added bonus that you may find you learn something about yourself.

Hargitai, is a very entertaining novel that journeys through Italy and through Mih&aacute;ly jointly, as he strives (strains/ attempts) to find his spiritual, emotional, and sexual self. After being separated from his wife, Erzsi, Mih&aacute;ly, the protagonist, goes on his search for self, while his wife, moves to Paris to begin her life anew. The protagonist struggles with his ever-present adolescence that seems to bear down on his life almost to a point of asphyxiation. Themes and taboos that are explored include the idea of androgyny- the balance between the male and female sexes- represented by &Eacute;va and Tam&aacute;s and the subtle indication of Mih&aacute;ly's homoerotic self. This novel is bursting with life, love, death, betrayal; through many twists and turns, it thrills and mystifies the reader as the protagonist has close encounters during his search for his past.One concept that is introduced in the early chapters of the novel is the idea of a m&eacute;nage trois- composed of Tam&aacute;s, &Eacute;va and Mih&aacute;ly. They make up the idea of the original trio that comes together to role play. During Mih&aacute;ly's description of his adolescence in the beginning of the book, he described his relationship with Eva and Tam&aacute;s as well as the trio's relationships with their families. He reveals to Erzsi that if he loved anyone it would have to have been Tam&aacute;s. The fact that Mih&aacute;ly is never able to determine what exactly happened to him causes his ever-present, stifling adolescence. Mih&aacute;ly describes to Erzsi how he also loved &Eacute;va but in a very different way than his love for her. In the end, his love for both &Eacute;va and Tam&aacute;s causes him confusion. It is not until the afterword that P.

While they were on a train going to Rome, Mihaly got off at one of the stations and he got in the wrong train when coming back. This was when his personal journey began. Mihaly didn't have a plan in mind; he just visited each town because of causality. During his stays at each town, he suffered from old memories from his past with the Ulpiuses, especially with Eva. Once in a while he felt death was near and he saw the abyss in front of him. He was deeply marked by the death of his friend Tamas; he just couldn't be a normal human being with no remorse of what it happened to his loved friend. His journey got worse with every second to such a point that he felt the need to kill himself, for the second time in his life. Eva, who was the woman Mihaly always loved, had an important role in Tamas death. When Mihaly saw Eva coming to him before she left to India, his suicidal feelings urged her to be with him at the moment of his death. This was the only rational thing to do for Mihaly. They agreed to meet again the next day so he can die being with her, but Vannina, whom Mihaly met her at a caf&eacute; with his friend Janos, went to his room the next morning and forced him to go to the baptism of her cousin. If it weren't for this woman, Mihaly might have committed suicide, but he got very drunk with red wine, the drink that he always had before something remarkable was going to happen. While he was drunk, he thought Vannina was going to kill him and he also felt his wallet wasn't with him any more, he just felt being stolen and almost dead. But none of that happened, in fact, he has saved from death that day. After all, his father came to take him back to his home, to Budapest. It just wasn't the time for Mihaly to die, and especially to die because of the ghost of Tamas. He continued back to Budapest with his father and found a job at the family company. The novel was very interesting. At the beginning it was a little slow, but then things started to happen quickly to Mihaly to the point that I couldn't stop reading it. I will rate it 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"This novel is a travelogue about a character named Mihaly who is on a journey. He wants to gain his rite of passage from boyhood to manhood. This novel also talks about androgyny, the concept in which the sexes are blurred. Both males, Tamas and Mihaly, tend to act in a more feminine way while Eva, a female, displays more masculine traits. Tamas and Mihaly are more passive and sentimental while Eva is more aggressive. Both males enjoy being mastered by Eva, and both are obsessed with the idea of dying from Eva's hand. Both males enjoy greatly being seduced and controlled by Eva.This story takes us on an interesting journey where Mihaly remembers his past. He recalls growing up at the Ulpius house and he re-encounters with his childhood friends who played an essential part in his earlier life. The story eventually ends when Mihaly finally gained his rite of passage into his manhood, as he comes to the realization that it is possible for an individual to live in a common place called reality. On a whole this novel is very interesting since it focuses on themes such as androgyny and death eroticism which isn't typically found in other books. Antal Szerb dares to be different and his work turns out great. Peter Hargitai's did an excellent job in translating this novel, in which he adds a little personal twist that include some insights into Szerb's life."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"A book that intrigues the intellect as well as the emotions is The Traveler by Antal Szerb. The author makes the novel extremely interesting by addressing topics that were uncomfortable for many people at the time it was published.Even though The Traveler may not be a classic that many scholars analyze, it is very good and worthy of being read by anyone who has a remote interest in it. The story is action-packed and every scene of the story serves the purpose of inducing the reader to find out more about Mihaly, a man who seems to be distraught and tired of doing what the society he grew up in has told him to do. He was a man who was troubled by his past and was not ready to let it go. He continued to live in it and let it effect the decisions he made and the way he acted. He was far from normal and the author did a very good job of making him into his own unique character.The main idea that was discussed in this novel was androgyny. Androgyny is the possession of both male and female characteristics. At the time this novel was written, men were supposed to act like men and women were supposed to act like women. A metro-sexual would not have been accepted in this society. Szerb writes about women who behave more manly than the male characters and men who display extremely feminine characteristics. Mihaly admits that he loved his childhood friend Tomas. The way he describes this makes him sound extremely homosexual which would definitely not have been accepted. Antal Szerb decides to discuss this taboo idea in his novel despite the rejection of society that he undoubtedly had to expect. Any author who writes a novel that does this deserves to have his novel read."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"\\"The Traveler\\" written by Antal Szerb is an outstanding book that captures the reader's attention from the beginning all the way to the end of the story. The main character of the story is Mihaly, a very depressive man that is captivated in his own childhood memories. The story begins with Mihaly's honeymoon, where he finds himself reviving once again his past at his old friend's house. As a result, Mihaly begins a journey trying to find some answers to his inner problems and questions. \\"The Traveler\\" addresses the themes of Androgyny, where the sexes are blurred. In the story, both Mihaly and Tamas showed their feminine side. In the other hand, Eva (Tamas' sister) seems to be strong and less sensitive as she is supposed to be for being a female. Mihaly likes to be dominated by Eva; he loves to play the victim. There is another major theme that the story presents: Death Eroticism. Mihaly and Tamas would play games with Eva, where they pretended she killed them. Both characters made various attempts to commit suicide; Tamas succeeded killing himself the second time. On his journey, Mihaly, planned his death, but he did not succeed. This novel was really interesting, and is worth reading. The book caught my attention from the very beginning.

Mihaly becomes obsessed with every detail of his childhood and decides to abandon his wife in search for answers to the mysteries of his youth. Mihaly's journey to self-discovery keeps the novel very interesting and its English translation allows us to capture every detail of the voyage."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"First published in Hungarian in 1937, The Traveler by Antal Szerb is one of the most jolting and astonishing books written in the twentieth century or perhaps ever. This blackly comic masterpiece revolves around the life of the main character Mihaly. This man experiences a life transformation, revival, self discovery, and a realization of who he really is.After destroying his honeymoon in Venice, Szerb's Mihaly goes on a strange journey through Italy and at every turn collides with embodied memories of an intense and peculiar adolescence. This leads him through a kind of twilight zone of personal knowledge. If this sounds pretentious, it isn't, for the tone is sardonic and quizzical. The narration by turns is puzzled and puzzling, na?ve and knowing, weary and compulsive, and finally tragic and hilarious. Many major themes in the book mirror taboo and norms that signify deviance. They jump the walls of our basic society. Issues of androgyny, death eroticism, femme fatal, and incest circle the relationships in the novel. It is the sort of book that once read you will want everyone else you know to read for themselves and marvel at what a singular literary imagination, working at the height of its skills can do."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Beautifully composed and poetically styled, Mr. Hargitai's translation of Antal Szerb's masterpiece is definitely a must-read. Hargitai reveals all the dark and confusing secrets that the novel and his author had. The main character journeys all over Italy to find his true self only to encounter obstacles that prevent him from reaching the happiness he once had. After reading the whole novel the discovery of Tamas and Eva being the same person, the whole mystery is exposed and the reader is able to understand the novel's androgyny theme. Throughout his travels, Mihaly has been in many flings with women, which tends to make this book a romance novel. He tries to find his true self; he uses these romances and signs of lust with these women as a way to express himself as a man. I recommend this to those who love romance novels."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The traveler is a journey into the soul by a man in a mid-life crisis. In this journey the very foundations of his personality come to a test. The passionate Mihaly is in a quest for answers he hopes will give a meaning to his life. This journey might be described also a s a rite of passage or a search for philosophical meaning to life. In a very interesting way the author Antal Szerb brings out a story of search for the self and the soul. Within this story the Character of Mihaly is accompanied by other vivid characters with their own worlds and their own form of search for the self. Some of the most colorful characters include a Jewish boy obsessed with the Catholic Church to the point of converting to Catholicism and becoming a priest. Tamas and Eva Ulpius are two characters that seem to be living a Greek drama in the story. Their story revolves around the world of theater and other people get pulled around them but they never really mix. The story unravels as all of the friends Tamas, Eva, Janos, Mihaly, and Ervin all develop their destiny in converging and diverging ways throughout Europe. Some of the themes exposed in this book include androgyny, homosexuality, and death eroticism. These themes were really revolutionary ideas in the time that they were written. The blending of the sexes in a character as delicate and fragile as Mihaly and a strong woman such as Eva were very controversial things to write at the time. Mihaly's childhood and past needs to be confronted for him to be able to find a meaning in life. The reader is exposed to a Mihaly in a dreamlike state where he has been all his life to his present thirty something years. This journey into seemingly nothing is really Mihaly trying to break the ties that are keeping him from the world of adulthood and self sufficiency. This book is able to lift you from a dimension in a time and space and place you in another with a very unique story and fine prose. The reader is attracted to a journey into the self as the main character is, and probably most people will find a connection to the life of Mihaly."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler written by Antal Szerb is a book about a man's journey to self discovery.

He could have had the ideal life with a nice wife and financial stability but instead he chose to leave it all to find his true self. After losing his best friend he was never able to fully move on without having the feeling of nostalgia take over him. Mihaly and Tamas shared a close bond and Mihaly tried on numerous accounts to replace the relationship he had with Tamas but it wasn't long before he would get bored and would look for someone else to complete that part of him.Antal Szerb's novel is extraordinary in the topics he covers throughout the novel. The Traveler blurs the roles of men and women, depicting a male with extremely feminine like qualities. Mihaly was the emotional, more passive character, while his wife Erzsi displayed dominance and aggressiveness, which are customarily characteristics of a male. Death eroticism is clearly a main theme in the novel in that most of the characters have a wild obsession with death. I found the novel very interesting in the way everything was connected. Everything in Mihaly's path towards his self brought him closer to finding what he wanted. Every person he encountered led him closer on his path and every obstacle that occurred was a part of it as well."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler, written by Antal Szerb, is a fantastic novel. The hero of this novel, Mihaly, and his wife Erzy are on their honeymoon in Venice. At some point during their honeymoon they become separated. This is ironic because they are both happy about that separation. Both of them run parallel lives through Europe and never met each other. Erzy gets involved with men that treat her really bad while Mihaly confronts existence and death during his travel and adventures. During the whole novel Mihaly is trying to find himself and overcome his obsession of disappearing from life following the steps of his beloved friend Tamas, who committed suicide, and Eva. He meets several people while he was traveling and some of them were friends of his in the past. He will not be ready to return to his home until he truly finds himself.

But hey, that's what one looks for when reading foreign novels, right? The characters were anything but usual, and the story's events were unpredictable. Mihaly, the protagonist, can't seem to figure out what he wants in life. He's just one of the characters that the reader can relate to in how he is on this road to realizing who he is, who he wants to be. At the same time, Mihaly has such an unorthodox way of thinking, that it keeps the reader on their toes as to what he's going to do next-whether it be commit suicide or escape his honeymoon to find a child-hood friend. The biggest theme of the novel seems to be self discovery, which is a theme that everyone can relate to. When reading the book, it's important to remember that it has been translated from Hungarian. Interestingly enough, the English-readers have had a different take on the characters than that of the Hungarian-readers. Overall I would suggest for others to read the novel, not only for the enjoyment of it, but to also expand their knowledge of other cultures."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler, written by Antal Szerb and translated by Peter Hargitai, illustrates the protagonist Mihaly as he is on his honeymoon with his wife Erzsi visiting Italy, a city that he has been dying to see. However, as the story progresses we can see the journey of their honeymoon turn into a frantic quest in which Mihaly searches for his young childhood friend Eva, after hearing that Tamas, Eva's brother and Mihaly's close friend, committed suicide. In a sense, The Traveler is a psychic journey through oneself in which the adolescent becomes an adult. In the novel we see Mihaly the adolescent, as he has no trouble retelling his childhood tales to his new wife Erzsi, including the fact that they used to play together by acting plays, in which Eva was the punisher and Tamas and Mihaly were the victims. The adolescent that we see is more evident by his apparent infatuation with Eva and her \\"smile\\" upon inflicting punishment, which according to Mihaly, is similar to the way Erzsi smilesThe journey begins when Erzsi and Mihaly were on a train ride toward Rome, when Mihaly suddenly got off at the Terontola station to grab a cup of coffee and then not knowingly boarded the wrong train, which headed toward Perugia. Instead of panicking and worrying for Erzsi, he surprisingly continues on, exploring the city of Perugia. He wanders so much that he ends up suffering from a severe case of fatigue and has to be hospitalized. Mihaly spends an extended period of time at the hospital while he recuperates, and Ellesley, a doctor at the hospital who speaks English and was attracted to Mihaly's case, tends to him. After Mihaly recovers, Ellesley sends him to the city of Gubbio to see a priest, a place were Ellesley had an encounter with a hallucinating woman. Little did he know, but the priest he was going to see was Ervin himself, locally known as Pater Severinus. Seeking spiritual guidance, Mihaly pleas with Ervin to tell him what he should do and Ervin tells him to just head toward Rome. Following instructions, Mihaly heads toward Rome not knowing what was waiting for him.Once in Rome, a series of events unfold around Mihaly, the most critical ones being filing for divorce due to a lack of money and more importantly, he caught a glimpse of Eva. Upon seeing her, Mihaly delays his return home because now he knew why he had to go to Rome; however, his happiness is short lived because Eva sent a letter to Mihaly indicating to not come looking for her. Unable to comprehend why Eva would not want to see him, Mihaly's happiness hits rock bottom. During this time, Erzsi visits Mihay and tells him what has conspired and they say their goodbyes, because they both know that their relationship is over. Furthermore, Mihaly receives a letter from his family back in Budapest, urging him to return home. Then, in a sudden turn of events, Eva appears at Mihaly's doorstep and explains to him what has transpired with Tamas and where she is going from here. Upon hearing this, Mihaly ask one favor of her: to be at his side when he commits suicide. Eva promises and they agree to meet again a couple of days later. During the last remaining hours leading to the event, Mihaly's plan is halted by the baptism of Vannina's cousin (which he has forgotten) and has no choice but to attend, stopping his suicide attempt. The following day, after awakening from yesterday's festivities, he eventually winds up in his hotel room, where his father greets him. Mihaly is surprised to see his father, as it is unusual for him to leave the family business. Mihaly's father pleas with his son to head back home, and eventually Mihaly accepts and they are on their way home.Toward the end of the novel, we see Mihaly the adolescent become an adult. During the visit of his father, Mihaly stated that \\"everything else seemed so insignificant, Eva and his death-wish, even Italy\\" (The Traveler, 231). Furthermore, Erzsi wrote a letter to Mihaly stating that \\"I am no longer coming for you and that you must live, that the death of Tamas had to do with himself and that we have to find our own deaths\\" (234). And finally, the last lines of the novel say that \\"he must stay alive...live like a rat among the ruins...and while one lives, it is always possible for something to happen\\" (234).

This same journey is also taken by his wife, Erzsi, who discovers that her place is not as Mihaly's wife. Mihaly attempts with all his might to evade the natural process of growing into an adult. He marries Erzsi only because it is expected of him. When he leaves her during their honeymoon both go in seemingly opposite ways, only to be searching for the same thing: their purpose and meaning in life.The only people that have ever given Mihaly tolerance and a sense of belonging are his childhood friends, Tamas and Eva, since they are also androgynous. Therefore, he feels the need to remain in that era of his life forever. As the reader is informed of the games played at the Ulpius house, it is clear that in Mihaly's world the typical male and female roles are blurred and, at times, exchanged. \\"Eva enjoyed being the woman who cheats on men, betrays men, and eventually murders men; Tamas and I loved being cheated on, loved being bertrayed, loved being murdered, or at least greatly humiliated.\\" (Szerb 31) He emphasizes the erotic quality of his desire to be a victim. \\"I loved being the victim. I would think about it from morning on, and spend the entire day waiting, yes...\\"Mihaly is presented as a heterosexual man who is afraid of facing his homosexual tendencies. He makes the reader confused in order to portray his own uncertainty about life, death and his role in life. Mihaly reacts to Tamas' suicide with a certain jealousy, wishing he could have taken his place. Mihaly saw death as an erotic end to the suffering and hardship that life entailed for him. It is understandable that death seemed appealing to a man who is not sure of his identity and simply wishes he could assimilate to society.Both Mihaly and Erzsi visit the past in their journey. Mihaly finds Eva, while Erzsi has dinner with her ex-husband, Zoltan. After evoking these earlier times, they are able to realize that they no longer have the same desires. Mihaly no longer desires to fall victim to the erotic call of his death wish. He is interrupted by a baptism, a rebirth that allows him to be free. Eva, on the other hand, realizes she does not want to live the life of a student. Essentially, they have both returned to where they begun but are now armed with a newfound knowledge of who they are. Overall, the book was inspiring, as it conveyed humanity's fundamental need to be accepted and to find a reason and purpose to live"},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler is a classic novel written by Antal Szerb and translated to English by Mr. Peter Hargitai. This a classic novel from the 20th Century published in 1937. To get a better idea, of the novel's ideas, we have to understand that the novel was written in times of the Great Depression, times of many suicides, when life was almost nothing o just nothing. The novel begins when Mihaly, the main character, is in his honeymoon talking to his wife, Erzsi, about his past, his childhood. What I find very interesting from this book, is that life was nothing. Mihaly believed death as being erotic. Mihaly and his friend Tamas always liked to be the victim. They wanted to be killed every moment of their lives. Tamas and Mihaly tried to suicide themselves with no fear at all. I enjoyed the book. I liked it because I could understand some personalities from that time. The book reflects some personalities from those times. And it kept my attention because I was interested in learning more from the main character, Mihaly, which has a very unique personality. I have read similar books from the same times, and I have found out that life was nothing. This is a classic piece from Hungarian Literature. I recommend this novel to anyone who wants to know about what kind of ideas the people had in those times, the thirties in 20th Century."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler which tells a story about an obsession of death is written by Antal Szerb but translated by Hungarian writer Peter Hargitai. The book begins in the romantic city of Venice, Italy. He was on his honeymoon with his new wife Erzsi. The honeymoon ended up becoming a disaster. It first began when Mih&aacute;ly wondered off to the other side of the city on the Fundamenta Nuova, which he could see the island of cemeteries and ended up in the dark alleys (Szerb 5). Erzsi became worried and fatigue but finally Mih&aacute;ly came back. Yet, he still found some way to be alone. Mih&aacute;ly was a heavy drinker. He continuously drinks sweet wine, such as Samosian and Mavrodaphne. Italian wine was too bitter for him which is a symbol that he has not become a man yet. While dining in Ravenna at a piazza the couple was interrupted by his old friend J&aacute;nos Szepetneki. They began to have a small altercation, which is when Erzsi became curious what it was about. Mih&aacute;ly began by telling her his life story that he has never shared with anyone before. At a very young age Mih&aacute;ly was plagued by terrible depression. He met his best friend Tamas were they had similar interest. While playing their childhood games they both like to be the victim. \\"I became rather good at taking poison or boiling in oil\\" (Szerb 27). Mih&aacute;ly always found death as being erotic. Being the victim like in the movies was already directing his fantasies (Szerb 28). Towards the end of the book he leaves his childhood fantasies and death behind after the rebirth of his godson. I would recommend this book to anyone who love being on edge and like books of self-discovery."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler by Antal Szerb is a unique novel, shadowed by an unraveling spiritual journey that draws the reader into the past with distinct and idiosyncratic characters that convey a sense of reality through their fantasy. The language used in The Traveler has a somewhat monotonous harmony within the words, and this tone is a compliment to the inner mood of the main character, Mihaly. Part I of the book drags quite a bit, perhaps because of the overuse of direct conversation between characters whose personalities are still unknown to the audience. Despite the drama of the unfolding events, this reader was confused by some of Mihaly's erratic actions, but one may conclude by the end of the book that misunderstanding is entirely the point of this character. The interlude between past and present is a creative and smooth transition into the childhood of Mihaly, with Tamas and Eva, who are brother and sister with a co-dependently disturbed sense of reality. Together, the three outsiders form a bond that only arises from unfathomable love, understanding and acceptance. Some people when they are children play hospital or school and they grow up to be doctors and teachers. Tamas as a teenager played his death game with Eva and Mihaly and never has to grow up. Perhaps already so disillusioned by life at such a tumultuous age, the siblings misdirect their desire to be comforted into an erotic, seductive demise, free from the torture of living. All feel a sense of alienation, both from their families and from the outside social world. When the three spirits come together, the theatrical game created from this longing ironically becomes something worth living for.Each character in the novel seems to have one strong trait that identifies them. Mihaly is by no stretch of the imagination a macho or abrasive masculine ideal, and maybe his submissive and effeminate traits lead him to idealize Tamas is such an adoring, obsessive manner. The love for Eva, the mystery, which grows out of Tamas's absence, seems more like another desperate attempt at conformity, which always seems like a goal out of reach. The secondary characters may even represent the aspects of Mihaly that he is unable to get in touch with. Erzsi's love and hope, the doctor's patient compassion, Janos's deceitful intervention, Ervin's passion and devotion, and even Zoltan's contrived kindness all balance together help Mihaly find his way. It is his instinct for noncompliance and a deep interest in antiquity, paired with a strong sense of wanderlust that makes this story captivating and thought-provoking. Mihaly has impressions that are often in disparity with the reality of the world, as if his mind was wired differently than most human experiences. He is tortured by a shadowed bottomless abyss that some may define as social anxiety, which closes the throat, shudders through every nerve, and makes death feel as close as a prayer. His great escape from his surrender to a conventional and compromising life can be seen as a triumph over normality and feigned attempts at a life that would please his family and traditional society. It is not until his solo journey across foreign lands that he is truly able to look inward and discover himself among the ancient cities and progressive travelers that teach him as much about himself as they do about the pleasures of life. The narrative is the cascading tale of growing into maturing, of love, nonconformity and surrender to truth. It is told with passion, honesty and celebration, giving the reader a sense of hope for progress within the human condition. At the end, when Mihaly must decide if he will succumb to the seduction of death, it is the very essence of life itself: a baptism and a feast that keeps him from the sweet surrender of suicide. The story is endearingly cyclical, each character from the beginning makes an appearance and an impression later, and as with any newfound enlightenment, the only remaining journey is the path home."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler depicts the journey of the story's protagonist, Mih&aacute;ly, towards a personal discovery: his self. The story begins in Venice, where Mih&aacute;ly and his new wife, Erzsi, are on their honeymoon. As Mih&aacute;ly begins to open up to Erzsi, he tells her of his childhood; something he wishes that he could go back to. As Mih&aacute;ly's memory becomes deeper and more profound, as it already was, he starts to enlighten Erzsi and fantasize about his childhood friends: Tam&aacute;s, Ev&aacute;, Ervin, and J&aacute;nos. Tam&aacute;s and Ev&aacute; Ulpius are the only two people that Mih&aacute;ly had ever cared for. Although he was not in love with Ev&aacute;, he holds a deep respect for her. But, he insists, that if he was in love either of them, it was Tam&aacute;s. \\"If you must insist I loved anyone, then it would have to Tam&aacute;s. Tam&aacute;s was my ideal.\\" (Szerb, 31) The Ulpius house, where the brother and sister grew up, was a house in which there were no rules or boundaries. The free way of living liberated each and every one of the friends that stayed after school, and sometimes during school, to play there. Most of the time they would act out scenes of a play, where Ev&aacute; played a woman deceiver, and Mih&aacute;ly and Tam&aacute;s would be the victims of some sort. \\"Ev&aacute; loved being the woman who cheats on men, betrays men, and eventually murders men; Tam&aacute;s and I loved being cheated on, loved being betrayed, loved being murdered, or at least greatly humiliated...\\" (Szerb, 31) Although the Ulpius house's regulations went against his own family's morals and upbringings, Mih&aacute;ly feels complete dedication to the siblings, almost as if he is obsessed with them. As Mih&aacute;ly concludes his story to Erzsi, he tells of Tam&aacute;s' suicide, Ev&aacute;'s disappearance, and Ervin's conversion in religions.As the novel proceeds, Mih&aacute;ly leaves Erzsi, and wanders through Europe searching for answers; for meaning in life; for Ev&aacute;. The only thing that ever made sense in Mih&aacute;ly's life were Tam&aacute;s and Ev&aacute;, and since Tam&aacute;s is dead, he feels the need to find Ev&aacute;. For what purpose, he hasn't figured out yet. Eventually, Mih&aacute;ly ends up in Perugia, where he meets a young, American art major, Millicent. Because he has spent all of his honeymoon money, he is forced to borrow money from Millicent, who is very wealthy. While he is contemplating on taking the money from the girl, which is not a proper thing to do, he really starts to think of his actions. \\"Let's be honest about it: wasn't he regressing back to the ethics of the Ulpius house?\\" (Szerb, 105) Mih&aacute;ly can only relate rash, unsuitable, and erroneous actions back to the Ulpius house, where he learned to free his mind and do what he wants.Erzsi, on the other hand, stays in Paris with a friend because she is so baffled as to why Mih&aacute;ly left her on their honeymoon. Although she finds Mih&aacute;ly later in the novel, and should be quite angry with him, she refuses to let him hurt her again. She also promises to him that she never wants to see him hurt. Erzsi, though she thought she had found her true happiness with Mih&aacute;ly, is also on a path towards self discovery and finding what she wants in the world. This is how Mih&aacute;ly and Erzsi are running on parallel tracks through the entire novel. Mih&aacute;ly is going forward trying to find Ev&aacute;, but ironically, answers to his past while Erzsi is moving backward; starting over again with her ex-husband Zolt&aacute;n. But both, no matter which direction they are heading, are leaning towards the unearthing of who they are inside.Erzsi realizes that she is not a part of Mih&aacute;ly's life in the way that she wants to be. When she becomes acquainted with J&aacute;nos Szepetneki in Paris, she still longs for Mih&aacute;ly and acceptance in to his life. \\"Erzsi allowed herself to languish in Szepetneki's desire, feeling that though this desire, through its awakening, she would truly become Mih&aacute;ly's woman and enter the magic circle, the old Ulpius-circle, Mih&aacute;ly's one and only reality.\\" (Szerb, 151) This is correct, the Ulpius house had become Mih&aacute;ly's only truth; the only real thing in this world for him to keep faith in.Before Mih&aacute;ly ends up in Rome, where is sent to on account of Ervin's insight, he meets Dr. Ellesley. Dr. Ellesley, immediately upon encountering Mih&aacute;ly is able to diagnose him. Dr. Ellesley asks Mih&aacute;ly if he has lost someone close to him, in which Mih&aacute;ly says yes. Mih&aacute;ly even admits to wanting to go back to the only era that ever made sense to him. \\"I'm suffering from acute nostalgia. I want to be young again. Do you have any medicine for that?\\" (Szerb, 112) Although Mih&aacute;ly seems like a confusing and complex man, it is easy to understand why his heart aches.Once Mih&aacute;ly sees Ev&aacute; in Rome, he vows to become part of the working class just to be in the same city as her, in hopes that he will run in to her again. Finally, they are brought together by J&aacute;nos, who told Ev&aacute; of Mih&aacute;ly's location. When Ev&aacute; tells Mih&aacute;ly that she will be moving to India, Mih&aacute;ly finally wants to go through with his own suicide, just like Tam&aacute;s had done. When certain unplanned events arise, Mih&aacute;ly is unable to go through with his premeditated death. Ev&aacute; leaves the country and Mih&aacute;ly's father comes to Rome and brings Mih&aacute;ly back to Budapest. Eventually, when Mih&aacute;ly realizes that he must stay alive because he is weak and has surrendered, he comprehends the idea of death and that at some time, he doesn't know when, but it will find him, not the other way around."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"\\"The Traveler\\" by Antal Szerb is a book relating the difficult life of Mihaly, the journey he goes through being a teenager dealing with suicidal thoughts, alcohol consumption, and even drug consumption.

So in the middle of his honeymoon in Italy he starts the search of all the questions he had left unanswered leaving her newly wife alone, and also not knowing that this search will put him in danger and just in the door of death.

Being trapped inside a bubble filled with confusion, Mihaly usually blurs reality and is transported to a world where his memories haunt him, and he is taken through a psychic journey, in which at the end of the ride, he discovers that he became an adult, and the ideas that always dug under his mind where left behind.Although the novel has many points for conversation, the idea of androgyny stands out the most. Mihaly is obsessed with his best friend from adolescence Tamas, and his sister Eva. When together, the plays that they would act on would depict Tamas as the sensitive character, while Eva was the character that would inflict pain and torture to the play.\\"IF you must insist I loved anyone, then it would have to be Tamas. Tamas was my ideal. Eva, more of a bonus, an erotic tool in the game...\\" (Szerb 31) With such passion, Mihaly confessed that the Ulpius' where somehow everything to him during his teenage years.Through the following lines, one could tell that Mihaly was always the person that blurred himself in the plays that both Tamas and Eva took part in. Mihaly's obsession with death was the downfall to his maturity in life. While speaking to Erzsi, his now wife at their honeymoon, he let her in on the little secret that was very important to him because the secret that he confessed, explained his obsession with death.\\" And I should tell you, although it's difficult to talk about it, even after all this wine-- but I think my wife ought to know: I loved being the victim...\\" (Szerb 30) His point in life was to have a heroic death as the deaths that were portrayed in the plays that the Ulpius and him acted when young. The thought of Tamas killing himself, haunted Mihaly, and wanting to follow the steps of his idol, Mihaly wanted to die as he frequently would in his childhood plays: by being the victim.I definitely recommend this book to anyone, because it helps clarify many of the confusions that one may go through in life. Letting go or our demons is the only way to move forward, and this initiative is exemplified in this book."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"I'm sure that when the book was written it was very shocking. But now days people are use to almost anything, it was not a page turner. Personally I don't recomend the book, but I understand that some people might be interested in reading it.

Soon he finds Eva and when he hears of how his best friend Tamas had killed himself, he desires to do the same as well. He plans to meet Eva the next day but due to certain circumstances he cannot make it. He realizes that he should not kill himself and goes back home.

It is insightful of the questions and identities each person searches for."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"Antal Szerb's novel follows the journey taken by Mihaly in his quest to find his true inner self. He is stuck in his past childhood. The protagonist, Mihaly, attempts with all his might to elude the natural process of maturing into an adult. Although he marries Erzsi, it is only because that is what is expected of him. During their honeymoon, both characters go in seemingly opposite directions, yet, end up searching for the same thing: their meaning and purpose in life. There is an array of various themes within the story; the main ones being the theme of androgyny, homosexuality, and the eroticism of death.The Traveler is the story of Mihaly's obsession with death. His journey to find himself commences in Italy while he is on his honeymoon with his new wife, Erzsi. Mihaly tells his new wife about his past. During his childhood, he had two friends that became somewhat of an obsession, Tamas and Eva, were brother and sister who had an odd relationship toward each other. Tamas and Mihaly would play games where they both were victims and Eva was the torturer. After Tamas commits suicide, Mihaly feels trapped in childhood.The theme of androgyny is key in this story. Mihaly is portrayed as a heterosexual man who is afraid of facing his homosexual tendencies. Tamas and Eva were the only people that ever gave Mihaly a sense of belonging since they, like Mihaly, were androgynous. Mihaly and Tamas are sensitive, gentle, and emotional characters who like to play victims' roles during their childhood games. At the same time, Eva is presented as a strong, practical, manipulative character, who during the same games handled the cruel roles of invaders and torturers. Because of this, Mihaly feels the need to remain in that period of his life. It is evident by the games played at the Ulpius house, that in Mihaly's world the typical male and female roles are blurred and perhaps even exchanged. \\"Eva enjoyed being the woman who cheats on men, betrays men, and eventually murders men; Tamas and I loved being cheated on, loved being betrayed, loved being murdered, or at least greatly humiliated.\\" (Szerb 26) He also emphasizes the erotic quality of his desire to be a victim. \\"I loved being the victim. I would think about it from morning on, and spend the entire day waiting, yes...\\" (Szerb 27)Mihaly reacts to Tamas' suicide with a certain jealousy, wishing he could have taken his place. He saw death as an erotic end to the suffering and hardship that life entailed for him. After Tamas' death, Mihaly's obsession intensifies but towards the end of the novel it subsides after the birth of his godson. In the end, both Mihaly and Erzsi find their true selves."},{"Title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler, written by Antal Szerb and translated by Peter Hargitai, is about a man called Mihaly that is obsessed with death.

I can honestly say Mih&aacute;ly, the book's protagonist, is one of the most unique characters I have ever read of. He is very introverted in every way and his philosophical and analytical style make for a great read. His words are always deep, never short of calculated, much like the story he is drawn into. The story is a series of unique coincidences that seem to follow him around in Italy. But don't let this book be dismissed for some silly soap opera with an \\"upside-down\\" ending. This book is genius. It fuses the past with the present, and the two share equal importance in the development of this story. As the future progresses, the past is made clearer. Similarly, some parts of the novel cannot progress until the past is shown in a different light.Mih&aacute;ly really is a Traveler. His strange obsessions and experiences drive him close to madness at some parts, but at the same time, he isn't too far off from any of us, forming a close relationship between reader and story-teller. I felt for this character, and in time, he became a part of me inside. That is what a great book should do for a reader.

Mihaly, the groom, finds himself on a journey to find himself not only in the past, but who he has become without realization. The book focuses mainly on his travels, and not much on his wife which is eventually separated from Mihaly in more ways than one.

They seem very distant from each other and they even seem a little like strangers. Suddenly, everything begins to change when Mihaly mistakenly gets on the wrong train.

Eliot's poetic masterpiece. However, I found the book no different in the end than most coverage of \\"Four Quartets\\", and did not give me any additional insight on the work.Booty's work is relatively short, more essay than book. It is divided into four sections, each on one of the Quartets. He goes through each portion of the poem summarizing it, and I find that too often he attempts to explain to the reader something he already understands. The book's real failing is that while Booty intended to over a truly religious reading of the poem. his analysis does not differ much from secular criticism of the poem.One of the few redeeming qualities of Booty's work is that it does attempt to place \\"Four Quartets\\" in the context of Anglican poetry in general, and quotations from John Donne and Henry Vaughan among others shows how Eliot's work compares. Still, I don't think that is enough. I would not recommend MEDITATING ON FOUR QUARTETS, though I would recommend \\"Four Quartets\\", and a very attentive reading of it, over nearly any other work of literature. Stick to the original poem and perhaps some more substantial critical works."},{"Title":"Meditating on Four Quartets","review":"Good for those who want to understand the Four Quartets for personal, spiritual use. Even better for those want a scholarly handling that does not violate Eliot's premise that poetry should be experienced rather than forced into false patterns!Booty does not attempt to offer a \\"comprehensive analysis\\" of every minor detail, but aims at explaining the poems' themes and progression. Where appropriate, he uses biographical narrative or explains Eliot's literary sources.You need to keep an actual copy of Four Quartets alongside, and I recommend that you read Four Quartets all in one sitting a time or two before beginning Booty's book, so that you can follow the conversation.If you only read one book about Eliot's Four Quartets, this should be it."},{"Title":"Running For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I've always wanted to start a running program, but never really knew as to HOW.

This easy to use reference lists every person (including all those listed in Chronicles!) named in the Bible and gives a description of the character based on the Scriptures. All entries are cross-referenced to their location(s) in the verses.While nothing can replace the original Bible for discovering the men and women of God, this books pulls together all the information under each character into one crisp, flowing summary. There are over 40 major characters that receive extended articles from Abraham to the Woman at the Well. Under Paul's article, there are entries for specific events in his life, his missionary journeys, and the themes that run through his writings and teachings. Additional articles also give an overview of certain groups, such as the Judges, Kings, and Prophets.The only drawback to this book is the lack of a pronunciation guide (you'll have to look that up in the Bible Dictionary of the same series) but the meanings of names are given when known. This minor oversight is negligible for such a great reference work. Whenever I am studying the Bible or preparing a lesson, this book will always be in reach.This book is part of Zondervan's six-volume &quot;Understand the Bible&quot; Reference Series.

As a person who led the evacuation of Clark, Anderegg paints a picture of destruction that was mitigated by people who took care of others, the Ash Warriors. In addition to saving the lives of 250,000 Filipinos and 15,000 Americans, the Ash Warriors marshaled their courage and resources to help survivors cope with the devestation that the surprise eruption of Mount Pinatubo and subsequent natural disasters wreaked in their lives. This is the fitting tribute that honors these heroes, a must read for students of military history and geology."},{"Title":"The Ash Warriors","review":"This is a large-format, 145-page book by retired fighter pilot Colonel Dick Anderegg for the Pacific Air Forces office of history describing the final days of Clark Air Base. Col. Anderegg was the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing vice commander when the disaster occurred and remained at Clark until the end.The base was established in 1903 as Fort Stotsenberg. One may recall that, acceding to the wish of the Philippine Senate (but likely not the wish of most of the Philippine people), the US would have given up this huge base in any event. But, as it happened, Clark AB was effectively destroyed in 1991 by eruptions of a volcano, Mt. Pinatubo.Consider the problem facing Col. Anderegg and the other Air Force people at Clark: the sudden requirement for a safe and orderly evacuation and permanent shutdown of this huge base during the eruptions of a nearby volcano amidst the floods, typhoons and earthquakes that struck the area in June and July 1991.The \\"ash warriors\\", the mission-essential Air Force people who stayed there until the end, did a terrific job. With grace and dignity these airmen lowered the flag and left Clark Air Base for the last time on November 26, 1991.The Ash Warriors is a fascinating account of those dangerous final days and how these airmen earned the respect of all Americans as they responded to the crisis of their lives."},{"Title":"Internet Performance Survival Guide: QoS Strategies for Multiservice Networks","review":"This book is destined to be a classic. It has a very detailed treatment on how IP protocols perform and how IP networks and hosts interact.

It addresses all of the issues surrounding this difficult subject (void of vendor marketing!) Great for anyone just beginning to address this subject. Very good reference work with execellent pointers for further reading,(Books as well as RFC's and RFC drafts). Wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Internet Performance Survival Guide: QoS Strategies for Multiservice Networks","review":"This book explains in clear, unambiguous terms the meaning of quality of service and how to develop an infrastructure that will provide this elusive characteristic. More importantly, it provides a vendor-independent view of network performance and capacity management.I particularly liked how the author distinguished between quality of service (QoS) and classes of service - these are important distinctions that will influence how you develop strategies for achieving either or both.The heart of this book is the section titled Performance Toolkit. The clear explanations of all of the &quot;moving parts&quot; at the physical and protocol layers are the best I have ever read. These were augmented by illustrations that effectively conveyed conplex information and interrelationships without confusing the reader. Most of the illustrations have two basic elements: a physical or logical network diagram on top, with timing or interaction information below. This, in my opinion, is one of the key strengths of the book because I was able to immediately understand what the author was trying to convey.In addition to a structured approach to QoS the book is also sprinkled with interesting information that is set in text boxes. Examples are web links to additional information, interesting discussions that support the main text (I loved the discussion on the &quot;Speed of Light Problem&quot;), and anecdotal information that liven up the book.After reading this book I felt I had not only a firm grasp on what it takes to achieve QoS, but that I also understood with a great deal of clarity how networks work at the physical and protocol layers. This alone speaks highly of the book because I have more than 12 years of network experience.Regardless of whether you are working towards or are certified in a particular vendor technology (i.e., MCSE, CCIE, etc.), this book will expand your knowledge of networking in general and QoS in particular.If you are a network architect this book with provide you with a strong foundation upon which you can build a solid QoS strategy. It also gives a sound approach to performance and capacity management, which would be nicely augmented by either (or both) of the following books: Capacity Planning for Web Performance, and Scaling for E-Business, both by Daniel A. Menasce and Virgilio A. F. Almeida."},{"Title":"Internet Performance Survival Guide: QoS Strategies for Multiservice Networks","review":"I thought that Geoff Huston's book was excellent.

Five leading experts talking about some of the most profound subjects available(consciousness, evolution, the Brain...). It takes quite a lot of background to understand everything that is being said. The fact that these are just transcriptions of interviews and a discussion doesn't make it easier: compared to a normal &quot;book&quot;, the ideas presented are not as structured and there's no room for background information to introduce readers in complex matters like Witgensteins philosophy or &quot;orthogenesis&quot; and &quot;epistothisandthat&quot;. If Descartes, Newton, Heisenberg, Galileo, Montaigne, Darwin, Dirac, Kant, Turing, Aristoteles or Maxwell are completely unknown to you, this is not YOUR kind of book. :-)In 1991, I saw parts of the original television series. A few years later I read the Dutch printed version for the first time at the age of 20. Now (1999) I've read it again, and there are still quite a few passages where I'm totally lost in space &lt;G&gt;. Now I don't have a degree in philosophy or physics, but still I have a healthy interest in these issues. Not enough to constantly keep in touch with 5 leading experts discussing without holding back..What is nice about this book, is that you can &quot;grow with it&quot;. In around 2005, I'll read it for the 3th time and no doubt I'll conquer some more dark areas.The &quot;interview&quot; approach also gives quite a good impression of the personalities of these five extraordinary men. Sacks is still like a little child that has preserved his ability to wonder about all and everything. You just CAN'T bore this guy because he always finds an interesting approach! Gould is my absolute favourite. Because his ideas appeal to me, and because he is so totally &quot;no-nonsense&quot;. Sheldrake is the rebellion with his heart in the right place. Dyson is the quiet one with the hidden powers. Dennett is so self-confident that it looks almost as if he can force reality to comply to his theories instead of the other way round. Toulmin is a bit too literate for my taste: he always gave me the feeling that I was a few steps behind. Not good for the ego &lt;G&gt;All in all I would say that the book lacks structure because of the interview approach, but there are still more than enough interesting bits of original ideas and insight to make it worthwile.Jo Helsen Antwerp, Belgium"},{"Title":"A Glorious Accident: Understanding Our Place in the Cosmic Puzzle","review":"One of the most interesting shows ever aired on public television (WNET, New York) was Wim Kayzer's interviews with six leading intellectuals who represented both the mainstream academic (Stephen J. Gould, Freeman Dyson and Stephen Toulmin) and more or less, as it were, \\"eccentric\\" outside the box groudbreaking intellectuals (Oliver Sacks and Rupert Sheldrake). Kayzer interviews each of them (and philospher Daniel Dennett) individually and then has the entire group sit in a kind of round-table seminar that he moderates and lets the ideas fly.In mho it is unconscionable that there has never been a DVD release of this unique and amazing historical experiment in intellectual dialogue. And while Kayzer's book pretty much reproduces the dialogues, seeing is believing."},{"Title":"A Glorious Accident: Understanding Our Place in the Cosmic Puzzle","review":"Wim Kayzer interviewed six great thinkers: the psychiatrist andneurologist Oliver Sacks, the philosopher Daniel C. Dennett, thepaleontologist and evolutionary theorist Stephen Jay Gould, thephysicist Freeman Dyson, the biochemist Rupert Sheldrake, and thehistorian and philosopher of science Stephen Toumlin. Then all of themparticipated in a round table to discuss the deep and'unanswerable&quot; questions mainly related to our consciousness. Thecontent of this book was originally broadcast as a televisionseries.In general one expects to get more systematic informationfrom a book on science or philosophy of science than from a televisionprogram on the same topic, but naturally we cannot have thisexpectation for a book produced from a television program. Further,when an interview or round-table program is put into printed lines,the discursiveness of spoken words comes to the surface, and theprogram is apt to lose some of exciting flavors present inbroadcasting. This book is not an exception of this phenomenon, andthus is good only for casual enjoyment but not good for obtainingsubstantial knowledge. Reading carefully, nevertheless, one can findsome brilliant words of the great minds here and there."},{"Title":"A Glorious Accident: Understanding Our Place in the Cosmic Puzzle","review":"The title of this book comes from (who else?) Stephen J Gould. This is what a scientific discussion could be and should be. In short, six famous thinkers were asked to participate in first an individual interview and then a round table discussion with the other five. The subject was life in all its mundane and complex makeup with a special emphasis on consciousness, computers, free will and the future. Almost a \\"What does it mean to be human?\\"Each contributed something special - Oliver Sacks was almost infectious, a child masquerading as a grownup. From his case studies of neurological quirks he has dericed a thery of consciousness and being. Daniel Dennett, the \\"materialist\\" of the group, sees the body (and brain) as a complex machine (my personal view) and ventures that since our mind derives from a purely materialistic basis (the atoms in our brains) computers will one day acquire consciousness in complexity. Gould was his usual biting, sarcastic, iconoclastic self - as sure of his own opinions as we was disdainful of others (loved the crack at Dawkins). He represents that almost perfect blend of working scientists, philosopher with the common man touch. Freeman Dyson, the cosmos futurists reminded one of the 19th century with his serious, old-fashioned manner. Rupert Sheldrake tried his best to insert some New Age wisdom and for the most part, failed. His ideas were original but stillborn. Stephen Toulmin plays the part of the man who gets the last word, the scientific historian who finds errors from the early days of philosophy. He is simultaneously authoritative and, in a way, the undeclared leader of the group.My only criticism was the redundancy of the questions. These six men had wide-ranging backgrounds and ideas so why ask them the same questions? The panel discussion was the very model of civility, intellectual give and take and yet another glimpse into the working of the mind even as they discussed who it did just that!

I saw it air on PBS, which stimulated me to get the book.

It's large and friendly, unlike Emacs, and you have to dedicate a lot of time to learning this lovable, beastly editor. (Emacs is not so much a text editor as an IDE + calendar + interface to Unix tools rolled into one).Learning Emacs to its very core is a good education for any programmer... I can't imagine a benefit to any non-programmer (or non-technical person) in this day and age (Emacs dates back to the 1970's, technology-wise). Its extensibility is indeed legendary, but RMAIL is simply not as good as a dozen other mail clients; Gnus cannot compare to Netscape's news reader or rtin; w3 is not as good as Lynx for plain-text Web surfing; buffers are nice but I find 'screen' to be a better tool, and 'vi' faster for just plain text editing.The advantage is Emacs can do all of these together, with major and minor modes providing the hooks (pun intended) to integrate the work. Emacs is a jack of all trades and master of... a few, at least.All that said, I found the lack of regular expression search/replace examples mystifying, no discussion at all of registers or the mark ring, and after reading the *whole thing* I still wanted more. Maybe more major modes for the next edition? :-)"},{"Title":"Learning Gnu Emacs","review":"LEARNING GNU EMACS is an introduction to the most powerful text editor ever made, a fully-programmable environment that through contributions from thousands has become something of an operating system in itself. This third edition covers all the new enhancements made in version 21.3.The book begins with an introduction to Emacs as it : a text editor. It gives basic commands for moving around, describes the look of the user interface, teaches how to search and replace, and how to make simple (and not-so-simple) macros. But Emacs isn't just a simple text editor, it also has extensions to do everything from drawing simple pictures to managing your schedule. In the next portion the book describes among other things Dired, the Emacs file manager, the calendar and diary functions, and how to execute commands from within Emacs.Since Emacs functions as an integrated-development environment for many programming languages, a fairly large portion of the book focus on how Emacs can help the software developer. Concerning markup languages, this new edition covers the excellent nxml mode for XML documents, and in terms of computer languages it describes modes for C, C++, Java, Perl, SQL, and Lisp. Unfortunately, the Python mode is not discussed. An entire chapter is devoted to Emacs' interface to version control systems like CVS.The book doesn't aim itself at only a beginner's market. It teaches one already proficient in editing to customize Emacs. At the simplest, this means tinkering with one's \\"~/.emacs\\" file, but it also includes using the power of Lisp to change all aspects of Emacs.This book could only be perfect if it were twice as large as it is now, since Emacs has so much in it. I think it a pity that the book doesn't cover Gnus, a mail and news reader that takes advantage of Emacs' scriptable nature to offer immense configurability and power. In fact, it doesn't cover the popular Mew mail reader or Emacs' limited built-in mail reader at all. Also, the bit on search and replace doesn't give any small intro to regular expressions.Emacs is not for everyone, and even with a fine book like this some people are not going to like it. But if you are comfortable doing basic editing with Emacs, and want to maximize your efficiency, then LEARNING GNU EMACS can help."},{"Title":"Learning Gnu Emacs","review":"I have been a vi user for a long time (6 years) and never thought I needed an alternative. This book has shown me the wonderful world of Emacs and its many modes. For very fast editing of text files and search/replace operations, vi is still the best. But for anything else, Emacs is a real time saver. I work a lot with the Fortran and LaTeX modes (with the AUCTeX package) and they both have saved me countless keystrokes, particularly with LaTeX. I find it convenient to keep this book nearby for reference as Emacs' has far too many commands to keep in one's head. It is *certainly* a very good introductory and reference book to Emacs. I will not write Lisp code in my life and the information given here is sufficient for me. Another user has mentioned that rtin and Lynx are better, but most often, you have install another dozen packages before you can use them (atleast if you *don't* use a Linux machine). Gnus works well enough for my occasional newsreading. I highly recommend this book for the 95% that are not too interested in heavy customization or esoteric uses. I most certainly will buy an extra copy to keep as a reference."},{"Title":"Learning Gnu Emacs","review":"I found this book to be not that good. It is a bit long winded, I had a hard time using the index to find things that I was looking for. It helped me get a bit more expertise but didn't help me get to a very good level of expertise. I rarely use this book now, I would recommend looking else where for a better book to both learn and use as a reference. Wrong first buy or only buy."},{"Title":"Learning Gnu Emacs","review":"Most of the Unix/Linux senior level Wizzards that I know use Emacs and swear by it. There are others (vi users especially) who swear at it, but that's another story. Emacs is a huge package and is growing bigger. Although you can consider it a text editor, it's a big, massive package that does a lot more than just edit text.At the start of the book the authors comment \\"Many people think that Emacs is an extremely difficult editor to learn. We don't see why.\\" I think the WHY is that most people start with a simpler more fundamental text editor like vi. Then when they think of moving to Emacs their fingers have to un-learn the vi commands to replace them with the Emacs commands. The authors say they don't recommend the vi emulation mode built into Emacs, but fingers sometimes take a long time to un-learn.If you've just decided to move to Linux, you might want to start with Emacs and never go the vi route. There is no question that Emacs has more power. Comparing to the Microsoft world, I think of vi like NotePad, while Emacs is like Word.There's an interesting table near the front of the book that asks you what you want to do with Emacs. If you want to write HTML, read Preface and Chapters 1-3 & 8. Then after you are getting some work out of the package, you can go to other chapters as you need them - Chapter 12, for instance to use Emacs to compare files.About half the book is on 'simple' text editing, where their 'simple' maybe isn't as 'simple' as the rest of us consider 'simple.' I do a lot of SQL, Chapter 9 talks about the editing support for SQL, and for other programming environments like Perl, Lisp, JDEE, etc.This book is from O'Reilly. O'Reilly does professional quality books for professional programmers. If it's time to learn Emacs, you can't do better than this."},{"Title":"Learning Gnu Emacs","review":"If a person is thinking of learning &lt;a href=\\"http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html\\">GNU Emacs&lt;/a>, or if they have been using it and are looking to sharpen their skills and broaden their Emacs savvy, it is a fairly safe assumption that the individual is motivated. This person probably knows their way around a command prompt, and it is likely that they are aware that Lisp is more than just a speech impediment. This person needs a book that offers expert advice without wasting time or insulting the intellect of the reader. &lt;em>Learning GNU Emacs, 3rd Edition&lt;/em> is that book.As a programmer, when firing up a monolithic word processor or graphical IDE to edit a simple script or properties file, one cannot help but wonder if these tools aren't overkill much of the time. For a growing number of users, the answer is yes. The tried-and-true text editor is enjoying a renaissance of sorts. One of the most extensible and customizable applications in the text editing category is the venerable GNU Emacs.The tutorials and documentation for Emacs are abundant, but they often prove time-consuming and ineffective for actually &lt;em>learning&lt;/em> Emacs. This book is a refreshing break from the documentation many have come to expect. Imagine you had a consortium of leading experts on Emacs at your disposal to teach you how to use it in a conversational, consultative style. That is what has been bundled into this latest edition of the book.The extensibility of Emacs has been both a key strength and a criticism of the application. Its user and developer community have created all sorts of additional capabilities for Emacs, ranging from the impressive to the absurd. The authors have done well to judiciously select what to cover in this edition. For example, while Emacs does have the capability to function as an email client, other applications have long superceded its ability. The authors have chosen not to cover this topic, and instead devote the available space to learning Emacs' core functionality - powerful, efficient text editing. Other peripheral areas of Emacs have been left for the user to research after gaining their solid foundation on Emacs as editor and work environment, such as compatibility modes for programming languages other than Java and Perl.This edition of the book uses the space gained by the removal of esoteric topics to flesh out areas of more common interest. Integration with the major version control systems has been expanded to include Subversion alongside of the age-old standards CVS, RCS, and SCCS. Coverage of support for Java and Perl has also improved, as well as sections for editing HTML and XML. Users wanting to tap into the power of Lisp programming for Emacs should find the coverage satisfying as well.Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of this book is the chapter devoted to the use of Emacs on different platforms. Unix, Windows and Mac OS X users receive equal acknowledgement. The precautions and insights regarding Emacs nuances when used on particular platforms can reduce users' frustration when getting started with Emacs.Even current Emacs users can benefit from this work. The mnemonic devices and conventions used in the book allow users to commit useful keyboard commands to memory. The memorization is further solidified by the exercises sprinkled appropriately through each chapter. Readers do not go for very many pages before it is time to be at the keyboard again, harnessing the power of muscle memory to reinforce the material presented."},{"Title":"Learning Gnu Emacs","review":"The title &quot;learning GNU Emacs is deceiving&quot;. It is an introduction to Emacs.If you plan to use Emacs for software development, it is definitively not sufficient.Moreover, while introducing a feature, the author think useful to write a full paragraph to explain you why you need it (for instance, why you need the command UNDO).The positive point is that the features discussed are explained step by step so that you are sure that if you read the whole section you will understand and be able to reproduce.Finally &quot;GNU Emacs Manual&quot; by R Stallman is the reference an Emacs user will need."},{"Title":"Learning Gnu Emacs","review":"The first part of the book is a gentle introduction to basic editing with Emacs, then proceeds on to useful intermediate topics such as dired, shell buffers, etc. The later chapters give the nitty-gritty on advanced topics such as elisp programming. The book has the virtue of retaining usefulness to the user as the user gains experience with Emacs.The book has been updated to reflect current programming topics: for instance, the section on editing Lex and LaTeX has been dropped and a section on XML has been added.in re Emacs:- Emacs has a devoted (even fanatic) user base. The reasons for that are worthy of your consideration.- The Emacs editor is very good. The keyboard functions are well thought out. The mouse is not needed, which makes it easy and fast to use for the touch-typist (though you can use the mouse if you want in the GUI versions of Emacs). Emacs' programmability makes it possible to emulate other editors, such as vi, in Emacs.- Emacs runs on most systems. Learn one editor, run it anywhere.- Ironically Emacs, although having a reputation for being hard to learn, has an excellent on-line help system. (The help pages are also available on the web at http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/#Manuals .)- Technically speaking, Emacs is not so much an editor as an operating environment into which an editor has been built. Versitile applications can be built inside the Emacs environment which can interact with telnet, ftp, email, web browsing, etc. These applications can be ported to any architecture that supports Emacs. Emacs is much more than \\"just an editor\\".- For programmers who are also Emacs users, Emacs Lisp (elisp) will become the most practical language in their toolkit. Automating day-to-day, keystroke-to-keystroke functionalities will save programmers from the tedium of their jobs. Emacs is tops for automating such tasks, and is my own principle reason for using it.- Here are two well written opinions on Emacs, each discussing the pluses and minuses:Eric Raymond's book \\"The Art of Unix Programming\\" has discussions of Emacs scattered throughout.Peter M. Bagnall has a very interesting critique of Emacs athttp://www.surfaceeffect.com/essays/emacs.html , where he contrasts the usefulness of its design with its reputation for being hard to learn.- Emacs is free - you only need to apply yourself to access an enormous amount of programming capability and editing power.- Richard Stallman's strongly expressed opinions about ... everything. I don't go along with him on many things, but I am grateful to him for Emacs."},{"Title":"Learning Gnu Emacs","review":"An excellent book, very thorough with clear examples and explanations.

It has a short biography of the most important jazz bass players, with some short transcriptions of their style.It has also some interesting arcticles on technique, exercices, theory and bass playing in general. The CD is well done, it has some examples and some songs.I don't think this book will teach anyone to play bass and I don't think that's the book's intention anyway, but it will broaden your horizons.

As such, it's more of a disconnected set of essays than a narrative; the discussion of significant bass players is somewhat spotty, and doesn't go into great detail on their music and style in the way that (for example&quot; Todd Coolman's &quot;The Bass Tradition&quot; does. But it's still both entertaining and educational. The chapters, being mostly self-contained, can be read at random as the reader's interest dictates.The first section of the book is primarily short snapshots of significant bassists, each being composed of a short biography accompanied by brief musical examples. The latter section- almost an appendix- consists of longer examples of styles and techniques. It's not really a method book, but it does offer some insight into styles and harmonic and rhythmic concepts for the beginning or intermediate jazz bassists. The accompanying CD helps illustrate the musical examples for those whose reading and playing technique are at a more basic stage.All in all, a very entertaining and useful book for jazz bassists of all abilities, and an excellent choice for bedside reading."},{"Title":"The Jazz Bass Book - Technique and Tradition Book/CD (Softcover) (Bass Player Musician's Library)","review":"I'll chime in with the previous review.

I discovered the comic book over 10 years ago and have been following it or one of its cousin books ever since. In that time, I've also managed to compile a sizeable back-issue collection, meaning I have most of the X-Men comics from 1975 and on.That leaves me with huge expectations for every X-Men issue, TV series, movie, and novel that comes out. Needless to say, I've been disappointed by many of them. Sometimes, my only wish is that a new X-Men related product merely be decent, if not great.Siege, the first part of the Mutant Empire trilogy by Christopher Golden, meets and exceeds every single one of my expectations.One thing I love about this series, and about each individual novel in it, is the pacing. With about 350 pages per novel, Golden has a great deal of room to work with, and he puts that to great use. He maintains suspense by actually having two simultaneous plots (although one is clearly a relative subplot).The larger issue is that Magneto has taken control of the Sentinels (mutant-killing robots), and has declared himself ruler of New York City. One half of the X-Men deals with that, and the other half goes into space to rescue Corsair, Cyclops' father. I'll be honest - the latter plot is doomed to be filler from the start, and it doesn't occupy my interest much.But beyond the plot pacing, the characterization is almost dead-on. The X-Men are just how I remember them from the comic books - complete with accurate dialogue, realistic character interaction, and even some personality development. It's a testament to Golden's skills that he continues to flesh out characters with over 20 (and in some cases, 30) years of history. Each of the characters has a particular worldview, and Golden not only gives each one fair representation, but he also gives the reader a deeper understanding of how each character ticks.However, I do find that some parts of the novel degenerate into comfortable, &quot;easy&quot; writing. One of my complaints is Golden's description of both Deathbird and Henry Peter Gyrich (the two main villains in the novel) as &quot;evil and insane.&quot; Ho-hum. Although he slips in a bit of irony by having Deathbird's obvious paranoia and insanity justified, he paints Gyrich as so thorough a bigot that he borders on contradicting established comic history (but then, that's a fanboy gripe).I like it that Magneto, soon to be the principle villain of the story, receives very little attention and development in the first novel. His basic motivations and plans are spelled out at the very beginning, and then Golden proceeds to develop the character slowly as the novel proceeds. It's a great way to build suspense toward the inevitable takeover of New York.In short, Siege is one of the best pieces of X-Men literature I have read, including the comic books. Christopher Golden has an excellent handle on the basics of fine writing, as well as the complex histories of his particular characters, and proceeds to combine them into an engaging and enjoyable tale. This novel stands alone for new readers, or even for people who don't want to buy the whole series (but be warned, the cliffhanger will make you want to read the other two books). And it will please all but the pickiest of longtime X-Men fans. Go for it."},{"Title":"X-Men Mutant Empire","review":"This is a REALLY good book! The Marvel novels were on a little roll here, and this one keeps the ball rollin'! Mr. Golden has really done fine work (again). He seems like one of the few writers who wrote these books to truly \\"get\\" the characters they are writing about...go figure. Just about every character gets some backstory, to help you truly understand them, and they each have distinct characteristics that set them apart from each other (save for a few of the Acolytes, but oh well). Great job, and I look forward to the rest of the trilogy..."},{"Title":"X-Men Mutant Empire","review":"Christopher Golden has written a book that does justice to the X-Men comic book series created by Stan Lee.

Philosophies on how humans and \\"mutants\\" should co-exist together. The first philosophy coming from a mutant called Magneto. He believes that mutants are the next line in human evolution and should reign supreme over the \\"normal\\" humans; he leads a mutant regime of followers called the \\"Acolytes\\". But Charles Xavier, leader of the X-Men, believes that with mutual understanding, mutants and humans can learn to exist together in peace. The book includes many conflicts and surprises, including the giant robots known as sentinels and the alien \\"Starjammers\\".Comic book fans who have followed the series since its beginnings will not be disappointed, and those just starting will be simply addicted.

Though the idea was interesting for a fanfic, it has several flaws, most of them on a major scale. The most obvious difficulty in accepting this as a serious work of the X-Men is the time frame. The story is obviously supposed to take place between X-Men #25 and Uncanny X-Men #304. The time frame is established by the leaving of Colossus and the fact that Wolverine has not been &quot;dismembered&quot; by Magneto as of yet. This is impossible, since the events of those issues had very little time lapse between them. Yet Golden's story supposedly takes at least three days of time between the two issues. Further, Golden writes the novels in 1996, a full two years after these issues have taken place and several other developments have occurred in the lives of the major players in the series.Also, he fails to account for the absence of two of the major X-groups, Excalibur and X-Force, througout the novels. Further, he fails to account for the absence of the Avengers, Fantastic Four and Spider-Man, all who have strong ties to Manhattan, the scene for the majority of the story. Personally, I think the story was poorly conceived, though the idea had merit.Another issue I have with the novels is characterization - Golden not only has written out Psylocke and Jubilee without explanation, he has also changed much of the idea behind the characterization developed by Marvel for the characters he does include. While remaining true to Cain Marko and Charles Xavier (to an extent), he completely ignores the characterizations developed for Storm, Jean, Rogue, Iceman, Archangel and several of the other characters that he treats dismissively.While most of the reviewers for this series have said they were thoroughly pleased with it, I was immensely disappointed. Though fanfic can ignore continuity, the author generally makes a introductory courtesy note of the omission to the readers. This prevents disappointment with the story on a whole.If you are looking for a good X-Men fanfic, there are several available on websites free of charge that are neither so long, nor so tedious as this. I am of the opinion that Mr. Golden needs to re-evaluate his next attempt to characterize the X-Men. And if Marvel is responsible for the editing on this series, they need to hire someone who can read for the *numerous* errors included in the manuscript."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Every woman should read this book and then it will help them understand how their partner think and why they act the way they act sometimes. Every newlywed couple should have to read each of the books before they get married."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I Didn't realize how ignorant we women can be. There is so so much male bashing that there is never any room to look at the women and possibly say, &#34;hey!? What's up with you?&#34; Neither sex is perfect but for sure we women are some seriously complicated beings and God didn't make any mistakes but in our complexity we have sorely misunderstood our men...In their simplicity we have somehow lost them and this book can help us get a better insight on how and why it happen and where to pick up the pieces. Read it and for goodness sake don't Interrogate your man about why he didn't just tell you the stuff in this book!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Great book and very helpful to get inside the mind of a man - who knew?? I asked my now husband about the accuracy of the book and he said it was right on. They have a For Men Only and describes a woman's perspective. Definitely some things are hard to read, but it's honest and from a wide variety of men. Yes, it's written from a Christian point of view, but the words are still true about the inner life of a man. LOVE this book - I reread it often!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book has some really good insights into the way men think and operate. I am getting married soon, and this book has already enhanced our communication and helped us understand why we do what we do. Great book!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"After reading the companion book, &#34;For Men Only,&#34; I read this book, and found it was good for helping women understand men. At least, as a man, it portrays us and how we think, pretty well. I bought several to give to my daughter and other friends."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I was horrified to read the 1-2 star reviews, I had to stop reading. To me if you love your husband, your going to make things better for him, it's not all about you. If you can understand what he is thinking, will help you make it easier for him unless you don't care about him.I started crying when I read this book! I love my husband so much. I can't believe what he goes thought in a day. I have told him how proud of him but it was awhile back but need to do it more often. I never knew what he needed from me. I cleaned, cooked, took care for the kids let him relax at home. Thank god I have tried to make it easier for him but you know how stressful it gets after years of kids, school and everything else I was exhausted, had gluten problems my whole body was so screwed up, mentally and physically too. This book is also good for raising good strong sons. I know my husband is doing his best to make are life better, so in return I'm going to do my best to make his life better. Thank you for this book! I wish men would just tell us what's going on with them it would be so much easier on everyone.I talked to my husband about this book and asked him why haven't told me any of these things and this is what he said, I didn't know how to say it. I think woman get really confused with the dating and the players etc... out there, that we become confused with what a man really wants from his wife."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book had many valid points, and seems to be on target in a lot of areas. The author does not take the route that says we need to make specific changes. No two marriages are exactly the same, so blanket advice is often not valid. Her approach is to simply inform, and allow you to take the next step(s)."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I read this in under 2 hours; most all of this info can be found in other marriage 'self-help' books. Not necessary."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Tons of statistics, lots of polls taken. Very informative.But I would caution the author when writing \\"grounded in biblical hope\\" to MAKE sure you have the book FIRMLY grounded in the Bible. I searched and searched for some mention of what GOD thinks about all of this. Man can think all they want. And to a certain extent, all these polls and what men think, are so helpful to us women. BUT be very careful when you say you are grounded in the Bible, and then not really mention it!I really found a lot of interesting. What we as women really miss out on, is well it is their problem if they can't keep them eyes to themselves and not think things they shouldn't. We, as women of God, should help by being modest. 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 - \\"Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.\\"Most of the things Shaunti mentions you will want to smack your head and say, duh I should have thought of that! If you are trying to be a daughter of God, and have a better relationship with your other half, then this book will certainly help. However, grab your Bible and do some research too. I also recommmend John Piper's This Momentary Marriage. BEST book ever!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This was a good book - I wish I'd read it 20 years ago. It really helped me to understand what is important to my husband which is totally different from what is important to me.Thanks for a great book on the subject."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book was a great price with descent shipping charges. The book is very good so far, I'm really enjoying reading it."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book promotes damaging stereo-types and is insulting to both women and men. Though it makes some valid points that apply for some people, it lacks scientific research, other than surveys the author conducted (many of which seem to have involved her close friends) and forces Christian philosophy upon its readers. I have no problem with someone writing a religious, opinion-based relationship book. However, it should be marketed as such."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Dont' get me wrong, there is a LOT of good information in this book. However, I noticed that Shaunti Feldhahn seems to actually condone some of the actions/shortcomings of the men in her studies, which to me did not seem like the biblical view at all. For example: She quotes a man as saying \\"....it's like she doesn't respect me enough to believe that I can figure it out if I put my mind to it, even if it takes me a while.\\" Does this sound a little like PRIDE to anyone but me? Is pride not a sin? She talks a lot about a man needing to be/feel \\"in control\\". What does God say about who's in control? She says men can't help but have sexual thoughts about an attractive female business colleague. Is Lust not a sin? Yet the author doesn't even touch on this. I just couldn't get past the way the author glanced over the fact that things such as pride and lust are sinful, and need to be dealt with by the man. I found myself resenting (not good, I know!) the fact that she seemed to tell us women to just accept the tired old \\"boys will be boys\\" thing, without the man taking on any responsibility for his behavior/actions. In the area of biblical roles of husband and wife (man as the provider, spiritual leader, etc. and the woman as the helper), I found the book severely lacking. In fact, I would say that this book leans more in favor of \\"the world\\", catering more to feelings and helping the man feel \\"in control\\", than to helping our men lead more Godly lives. I would have preferred a more biblical view, but appreciate what I did learn."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I am almost done reading this book and, although 90% of the people here talks about it being useful for marriages, I would say that it is a good read for single women too. It does provide insights and make it easier to understand why guys react in some unpredictable ways to some innocent joke, or why some innocent comment seems to \\"push away\\" a guy we are interested in talking to.A very devout person might think it is not useful in the single stage just because it does address issues on the emotional needs of men in relation with sex. I thought that as an umarried person I would not need to know much about that aspect, but I did find insights that made me understand a little bit some of the reactions from a person with whom I broke off with from a stable relationship some time ago.The book also gave me insights about how to talk to guys in general, I'm a little bit shy, and if I take the initiative to talk, at least I would want to say something smart, not something that make me look aggressive to his eyes. It does help to know what things not to say.In summary, I think this is useful for many people, not only for married women, so I would recommend you to read it."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK ON RELATIONSHIPS I HAVE EVER READ. Most hard-core Christians probably wouldn't consider me a Christian because I receive the Bible in its allegorical and metaphysical meaning and not the literal sense (although some is literal)... so I wanted to touch base on that aspect of it for those that are turned off by \\"Christian books\\". This book does have slight Christian undertones to it but it's not disturbing from the point of the book. I have read a T-O-N of books on relationships and this (along with For Men Only) is truly THE BEST set of books on relationships that I have ever read. While this book wouldn't have prevented my divorce, it would definitely have saved a ton of painful events leading up to it. And I do believe, whole-heartedly, that this book has (and will continue to) save many many marriages. I will require any future suitor to read For Men Only before getting serious. I have purchased \\"For Young Women Only\\" and \\"For Young Men Only\\" to read and determine if it's something suitable for my daughter, nieces & nephews. I believe in this book so much that I decided to purchase each book (men & women's version) for every female friend I have (and her significant other) and for all three of my brothers. That was quite an expensive investment in their future's, but I believe in these books that much. While in the process of ordering 11 copies of both books, I came across \\"For Couples Only\\" and saved myself a LOT of $$$$$!! \\"For Couples Only\\" is a boxed set of \\"For Women Only\\" and \\"For Men Only\\" and (according to reviews) a discussion guide. At this time it costs close to $2 more than ONE of the single books. Go here:For Couples Only: Eyeopening Insights about How the Opposite Sex Thinks-- and trust me ladies, when you read \\"For Women Only\\" you are going to want to sneak a look at the one written for men! I purchased them both, I read them both. I am a woman. My personal recommendation? Stick to your own book and work on it. Give your man time to process his. Don't try to talk to him about it. Just observe any changes he makes through time. If you read his book, you will probably regret it (I did). Here's to saving marriages and relationships *cheers* After reading the adult books, consider these books for the teens in your life:For Young Women Only: What You Need to Know About How Guys Think,For Young Men Only: A Guy's Guide to the Alien Gender"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I bought this book based on the high reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. After six mostly wonderful years of marriage and two children, we both felt something was lacking in our marriage. For me, I could see where an important gap was - I just didn't understand why some things irritated my husband or why he got so depressed over (what I thought were) small things.By the time I finished the first chapter, I already could see there was a lot I didn't know. As I read through the book, I periodically asked my husband, \\"this is what my book is talking about, do you really feel this way?\\" His response was always a \\"well, yeah,\\" accompanied with a duh!-didn't-you-know-that-already look. This is what I was missing!I now make time for the small things that I know make my husband feel more appreciated (as simple as changing the way I ask him a question, so as not to sound accusatory when I'm really just curious). It's only been a couple of weeks since I've been applying this in my marriage, but it is really helping us to feel closer, more affectionate with each other, and most important, loved and supported in the way we need.Keep in mind this book is truly \\"for women only\\" - it doesn't address what your husband/partner needs to know about women or how he should treat you. There's a separate book for that which I don't know if it's as good or not. This one I will be recommending to every married woman I know, including my mother!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I highly recommend this book to married women everywhere. Although not every man feels the same way about the different issues discussed in this book, I think it will give women great insight into how differently men think and why they do the things they do. It may also help us to be better wives. After reading this book, my attitude toward my husband has changed for the better and I see him as my partner who has needs, however different they may be from mine. My one recommendation for women reading this book -- read it prayerfully."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It gave fantastic info about what men truly feel and want, by surveying 400 men of all ages. It's a small book and very quick read; great if you have trouble finishing longer books. It helped me understand the fragile nature of men a bit more and made me realize my husband & I were each loving the other the way we needed not necessarily the way our partner needed. It also revealed what things are important to men, especially what we do or don't do to show them we really love them. Must read for all woman."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"My husband and I read this together and it was so great for bringing up things that we could talk through about our differences. We had some great talks. Definitly worth buying. And you should read it together."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I read this book for the first time in late 2005 and have reread it a few times since then because I love reading it so much! I am pretty shocked that a few people on here didn't like the book, I can't imagine anyone reading this book and not falling in love with it.The books is based upon surveys, research and statistics - ones that my boyfriend said were \\"dead on\\" on how men really tick inside. I enjoy this book because it shows you how to be a better wife or girlfriend and reveals what guys really need from us in a relationship (and I'm not just talking about sex) that they may not always have the courage to just come out and talk to us about. The book has a Christian outlook on the topics, which I definitely enjoyed being a Christian myself. The book is pretty short and sweet too, you can finish it in a couple days and get PLENTY of information you will always use out of the 192 pages.I recommend this book for Christian women who want to learn more about the inner minds of the men we love in our lives, and the ways they want you to show them you love them."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"A wonderfully insightful book if you are open to learn. I read it and learned a lot and then recommended it to my future daughter in law. She enjoyed it also.

So negative! And a lots of areas (when she talks about mens visual \\"Rolodex\\") are not true for a lots of men up there."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"There was a lot of good advice in this book, but I didn't like how the author seemed to shift almost all of the responsibility for the success of the marriage over to the woman. Woman today are extremely overburdened and this is regardless of whether they are career women or housekeepers. I know, I've been both. We bear almost all the burden of raising and disciplining our children. Are expected to have the house clean at all times. Have dinner hot on the table. Compliment our husbands to the point he thinks he's Jesus Christ himself. Bite our tongue when he's about to make a bad decision even though we and our children will be forced to live with the consequences. Look just gorgeous at all times. Be a lioness in bed although were physically, mentally, and emotionally drained. When were in Wal-mart to swallow all our insecurities and say, \\"Hey honey! Look at that hot babe!\\". Well, let the ladies start lining up for their daily dose of prozac. If the author is really serious about her advice being taken she needs to write a companion book called \\"For Men Only-What you need to know about the secret lives of women\\", so he knows his part. Most men DO NOT know how to love their wives AT ALL! That's why the vast majority of divorces are initiated by women. I'm tired of being considered a man's appendage. I give this book 2 stars."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I hastily ordered this book, then quickly canceled my order as I realized what it contained. Without reading the piece in its entirety, I can honestly say I am so disgusted it makes me nauseous. What kind of woman do you think it would help to tell her all about (supposedly) EVERY man's \\"dirty secrets\\" of the mind? And on top of that, it leaves you feeling despair because instead of recognizing that every man and woman will encounter temptation over one thing or another in their lifetime, and their responsibility as a Christian is to obey the LORD and flee, the author paints it like they just can't help succumbing to their biological urges because they're just \\"wired\\" that way. Well, GOD didn't wire them that way, the fall introduced sin and marred the perfect design that HE originally intended. Which explains where we are today. Through CHRIST, this can be overcome and I expect any decent man who calls himself a Christian to make an effort to FLEE temptation, not excuse it.Furthermore, the most disturbing point is probably the notion (conveyed by the author) that women have this huge ability or responsibility for men's happiness, self-esteem and ego. It is up to US, ladies, to be perfect and pleasing so that our men will not feel insecure or be tempted. HELLO?? It is downright DANGEROUS to suggest that a human being is responsible for another human being's self-worth. This is codependency 101 and is fodder for seriously destructive relationships. It is borderline idolatry. We are to find our security, all that we are, in CHRIST, our rock, and only then can we find health and strength to love others as we ought and fulfill our roles as husband and wife in Christian marriage. Not by attempting to be perfect on our own to win another person's love."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"To begin with, I was blown away by this book. What an impact such a small volume has made in my relationship with my dear fiance' as well as with my brothers and father. So, why is this book so good? Firstly, it is written with the idea of informing about the way men think. How many of us are totally confused about men? Yeah, most of us. And men don't talk a lot about their \\"feelings\\" so it is very difficult to get an honest answer. This book is an absolute blessing in that measure. It shows why men have trouble being romantic, why they need women's respect so much and (possibly the most revolutionary chapter) why they want SO MUCH sex.I will not explain, b/c the book does that, but I will say that once I read the book my eyes were completely opened to why my fiance' reacts the way he does to my actions. And I began changing my actions and... well I will just say that although Caleb and I have always had an incredible relationship, this just made things even more beautiful.To the reviewer who complained that the book made wives too subservient I would answer, firstly, read her book \\"For Men Only\\". Both books are interested in teaching wives and husbands to better serve eachother. Secondly, women are not at all put down in this book. Rather wives are shown to be the one factor in their husbands' lives that really makes the crucial difference between men feeling like a success or a failure. This book really is empowering to women because it is basically like, \\"You can make the crucial difference... Oh yeah, here's how.\\"While some points in this book may not be accurate for all men (I am blessed with a man who is the \\"King of Romance\\" as my mom says, and who will always talk about his feelings) it really has something for every relationship. If you are working to cultivate a blessed, beautiful marriage, you will find this book to be of great value."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I first heard about this book during a radio broadcast by James Dobson. The interview between Dobson and the Feldhahns was actually to promote their newest release....For Men Only. A few key insights, such as women needing constant reminders of their husband's love, really hit it right on. I then checked out For Women only from the library, interested in seeing if they were equally insightful on the inner lives of men.I was reading For Women Only one evening while my husband was watching sports, and during a break in programming I asked him one of the questions in the book about what a man desires more: love or respect. I told him I was just curious if the book was accurate. He answered the question exactly how the highest percentage of men had in the book, and then became very intrigued himself about what I was reading. Consequently, my husband--who HATES to read--has been reading For Men Only (in his spare time, every now and then). Ladies, don't underestimate what you will be starting by purchasing this book........I have learned very much about my husband through this book, the biggest thing being that he needs my respect. I am a better wife to him after reading it, knowing how to lift him up and love him in the ways that he was wired by God. The book does generalize, and every man is different, but there is a lot of subtance in it and even taking away one truth is well worth the read."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I wish I read this book 50 years ago. I am now a widow of one year and wish for good marriages for my daughters, friends and relative. I've given away many of these books to bless relatives and friends with understanding of their spouses. This book is an eye opener."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I had purchased Shaunti's book, \\"For Men Only: What you need to know about the inner lives of women\\". It was very, very eye-opening and it changed my perspective forever.Her book on women was so good that I decided (out of morbid curiosity) to see what this same author had to say - to women - about men. I ordered the unabridged, audio book.I felt overwhelming compelled to leave a review for any wives, girlfriends, and mothers who may stumble upon this review... This is my official feedback:I would gladly - and without conditions - give my left eye (and maybe my left hand) in exchange for having women in my life who read / listen to what she has to say and believe it and run with it. Shaunti nails us. I was practically sobbing listening to it. My greatest fear is that women / wives will hear this and not take it seriously. Shaunti understands the keys to every man's heart. Just like her book on women, this is an amazing book."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this may encourage women to be less assertive of their needs and more understanding when their husbands are doing things the don't understand/agree with.This book did help me understand my man but he's still accountable for his actions.He read the counterpart for men and has adapted his behaviors as well. If you have the sort of relationship where you can work together it can't hurt for both to become more understanding!This book has religious undertones but it's tolerable."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I have not read the book. The mother of one of my students delivered this book to my wife with a strong reccomendation. We agreed to discuss the contents of the book in an honest manner after she had finished reading it. It took us three days in several hour blocks to just scratch the surface of the issues raised by this book. In my wife's words...\\"I had no idea...\\". Frankly, neither did I...For a man, the topics were hauntingly accurate and, in some cases, difficult to discuss because you have to truly reveal your innermost fears and desires. Allowing yourself to become this vulnerable is not a familiar process for most men. And most women will likely feel some discomfort with much of what they hear if the man is being truly honest with his feelings. Will it solve all you marital problems? No. But it is a good starting point for anyone who is on the journey to truly understand their partner. This book made many issues crystal clear for both of us."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Although I have been married for 28 years, and my husband is far more communicative, and open about his inner thoughts than most men, there were still many helpful nuances in this book that deepened my understanding. And when I think back to my twenties, I realize how clueless I was at that stage in life!! I have bought many copies of this book to give to family and friends, and I think every young woman, and young man would be greatly helped by reading this book. I'm hoping to soon be able to read \\"For Men Only\\", so that we can all have the opportunity to see the other side of the picture--the balanced viewpoint will complete the possibility for greater understanding.One of the things I appreciated most about this book is the focused, narrow point of view, avoiding repeating good information already reported in other sources. I believe Shaunti did a great job in revealing a few, otherwise unexplored, crucial areas that are surprising either in their totality or their intensity, to women in general. Bravo, Shaunti! Keep it up! I see many marriages deepening in fulfillment!! Thank you."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I know what you're thinking: \\"for women only\\". I saw this book on my just-engaged sister's bookshelve and my curiousity got the best of me. As i read, i was surprised by Shaunti's accuracy. After reading even more, i felt....violated! Feldhahn has invaded the mind of man, penning our very way of being into one book. What a crime. Even more surprising, this book helped me! A man! As people, just because we are a certain way, doesn't mean we completely understand why we are a certain way. Feldhahn has managed to put into words what most men cannot - why we are the way we are.This is a highly recommended read for any woman that wants to better understand her spouse so that she can better fulfill his needs. Also recommended for the man who is tired of not having an answer to \\"why are you so *insert degrading word here*\\" questions. Men are so very different than women, but God has built both man and woman to compliment eachother's needs. We have a totally different way of thinking. Completely opposing mindsets! \\"Understanding\\" how a man thinks is just as impossible as a man understanding how a woman thinks. With this book though, you can at least know what a man thinks. Buy this book now! the tools for a stronger more healthy relationship are included free of charge! what a great deal.Also check out Feldhahn's upcoming book \\"For Men Only\\" (released april 3rd, 2006). If it's anywhere near this caliber, it should be a great read for both sexes."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"My soon-to-be-husband and I try to live as closely to His will and word as we can, but even so, disagreements had been tearing us apart recently. Even as we approach the doorstep of marriage, we'd begun to have doubts because of the frequent misunderstandings. He heard a radio spot on a Christian station talking about the book and, in a desperate attempt to mend our relationship, he mentioned it to me. I was just as frustrated as he was, so I bought it the next day.I read the whole book in about 3 hours. It was an easy read and, for someone so anxious to make things better, I couldn't put it down. He was at work when I read it in its entirity, but last night was eye-opening and awe-inspiring.Ladies, I highly recommend making a list of questions to ask your significant other/husband while reading. So many things occurred to me, even things like, \\"Do you really see it this way?\\" or, \\"Is this really how you feel when I say/do ____?\\" We assume that men are all simpletons, and they play the role rather convincingly sometimes, but this book gives great insight. Because of simple changes in wording, I was able to understand quite a few things about him that I thought I knew (but didn't get) before. The conversation we had based on the questions I wrote ironed out SO many things that had been plaguing us for several MONTHS; we haven't been this happy since the few spark-filled days after we first met.Finally, I must add something I found very helpful from this book. For longer than I've known my husband-to-be, I've struggled with depression. He's often encouraged me (in a concerned way, not a degrading one) to do things like lose weight or be active or have a more active social/spiritual life. I took these things to be insults, which only deepened my hole of worthlessness and low self-esteem. When we talked about the sections of the book that cover things like why they look at other women and what it means for those of us they come home to, or what our physical appearance means to them, or how the EFFORT of taking care of ourselves is more important that the result of those efforts, it made a lot of things \\"click\\" for me. The only thing (in my head) stronger than the depression is my love for him. If he tells me I can do something, it doesn't matter what the depression tells me. I'm not condoning things like losing weight because a guy tells you to, but seeing things from their point of view, not to mention having them confirm what you read in this book, makes a lot of things much clearer.This book has helped both of us in so many ways. He breathes a little easier knowing that I try and succeed in understanding him better. Because of that understanding, it's easier for me to relate to him and for us to get through things as a couple; we've reclaimed our relationship from communication difficulties and depression. Last but not least, having a better idea of how he sees the world (and ME) has helped me to see myself in a different, more positive light.Read this book! It will definitely change your relationship and the way you see him."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Great book - I'm just getting started in my marriage and a friend gave me this book to read...and now I'm going to be doing the same for my friends because these issues are ones we need to talk to the men in our lives about, or at least know so we can better UNDERSTAND them! :) Straight forward and to the point...also great stories and statistical evidence."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Shaunti's book is a well researched and much needed piece of work. As a man, I felt vindicated that I wasn't the only one feeling that way. As a husband, it helped my wife and I better relate to one another. Shaunti is a gifted writer and her own personal examples of her own marriage add much needed realism. I advise any couple or single adult read this book. It will be well worth the time."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"My husband and I read this book in addition to the For Men Only Book with our Bible Study Class at church. It helped start a lot of important conversations. This book helps you get things out into the open that you don't realize were hiding. This book in no way suggests that you ignore problems, it just gives you a better platform to discuss the problems. For example, if you go to the doctor and before the doctor even examines you he starts to \\"address your problem\\" and prescribe you medicine, you wouldn't be open to anything he had to say. On the other hand, if you took that doctor's advice, then you'd walk around thinking something was wrong with you when you may be perfectly normal! This book helps you to examine your man so you guys can have more productive conversations.In the class, the men identified with pretty much everything that she described. A lot of them admitted that they would be scared to bring those topics up on their own. There were couples who had been married for 20+ years getting revelations from the book(s). Men were getting in touch with their feelings because they never knew how to verbalize what they felt. It was pretty fun. I'm a newlywed (almost 2 years) and I feel like I'm ahead of the curve!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"The book was just as instructional and informative to my husband as much as it was to me.

Our church gave out about 5000 free copies of this book to the women and I read my wife's copy. Now I am buying this for other couples and getting the companion book for men. This book has provided conversation starting points for my wife and me. It is incredible for her to see the responses to certain questions about love, support, insecurity and sex that are so central to a healthy marriage. This is sort of no-holds-barred brass tacks issues for a marriage. A true look inside a man's heart and mind for the woman who loves him and wants to love him better."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"A \\"Must Read\\" for not only every woman, but for men as well. Short, easy to read, and to the point. Research based findings give it more credibility - these \\"absolute truths\\" about men are delivered poignantly and with grace. Hard to believe that a psychologist and married Christian man could be surprisingly halted in the midst of a read to acknowledge, \\"Shaunti Feldhahn has really got it right!\\" Designed not only for Christians but for secular non-believers as well. This book is a more woman friendly read than Dr. Laura Schlessinger's, The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands. I look forward to her sequel, For Men Only, projected release April, 2006.

This lady did a lot of research before writing the book and it is well worth the read."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"You've given me renewed hope. Thanks to you, I've decided not to give up on American women just yet. Maybe there are 1 or 2 out there somewhere who've decided to build men up, rather than tear us down. By showing women what we really need, your book is a huge step in the right direction.I especially loved your chapter \\"Sex Changes Everything.\\" Your careful insights were as good as, or better than, anything I've seen anywhere else. I've heard rumors that in previous generations, women were taught that they should always say yes to their husbands. (Does anyone know if this is true or not?) If true, then the modern standard of doing it only when the wife is in the mood represents the most radical (and unacknowledged) break with tradition imaginable. (Note: I'm certainly not saying that force is ever OK. Obviously, women always have the right to say no.)Lest this seem a burdensome suggestion, I read somewhere of a mother telling her \\"modern\\" daughter, \\"But it takes so little time, and it makes him SO happy!\\" Besides, as John Gray points out, \\"always say yes\\" doesn't mean \\"always.\\" If it would create actual lasting resentment for you to say yes, then say something else affirming (to overcome the rejection he will feel) like, \\"No, but let's set the alarm so we can have a quickie in the morning instead.\\"For so many of us men, sex is love. Besides, sex is a process, as the book points out, starting with romance and ending in the greatest intimacy, becoming \\"one flesh.\\" Do you women feel loved and appreciated during this process? You should, if it's done right. Sex is sacred, and it has a way of creating love and so many other good things. For most of us men, sex is rarely just physical. We may be attracted at first for purely hormonal reasons, but our hearts invariably get just as involved as our pelvises. It's the same in reverse for you. At first, you may seek love. But soon, you're desperate for our touch.Besides, none of the book's suggestions should be much of a burden. Instead, love is one of life's greatest privileges. If I find one of the chapters in For Men Only difficult to practice, all I have to do is to ask God to fill me with His love, to change me so that I will want to love her in the way she needs. All it takes is willingness and prayer, for since God is love, He will always say yes to this kind of prayer.My all-time favorite book, written in 1870, is calledThe Christian's Secret of a Happy Life. She talks about a romantic love that is so awesome as to make today's love seem comparatively tame: \\"Love gives all, and must have all in return. The wishes of one become binding obligations to the other, and the deepest desire of each heart is that it may know every secret wish or longing of the other, in order that it may fly on the wings of the wind to gratify it. . . . Ah, dear soul, if you have ever known this, even for a few hours . . . .\\"May we find such wondrous love today. Thanks, Shaunti, for helping love to flower in all of our hearts."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"ladies why do i have to think like a man? written by NFL player exwife. shanae n rhonda give us a story,they relate to what woman face daily.they are told atrong womans who share there past"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I bought these for me and the hubby...almost everything she talks about we either already do or have already been told.

After reading it myself first, I increasingly felt very hesitant to give it to my wife. Why? Although the book certainly raises important issues that are a great conversational starting point, I can't help but feel that Feldhahn's book is saturated with a particular kind of \\"submissive wife\\" ideology common in various evangelical Protestant circles. One of Feldhahn's driving theses is that men are wired a certain way, so the key to a successful marriage is for women to discover the intricacies of that wiring and then adapt themselves accordingly (Feldhahn tells her women readers that these \\"fascinating new secrets\\" about men are \\"supposed to change and improve us [women]\\" [p.19-20]). Although that might be in fact what men want, I'm unconvinced that is always what we or our marriages need. Following the suggestions in this book might make a happier husband but a more unfulfilled, subservient wife.That's not to say I can't relate to much of what she describes. Her analysis of the inner wiring of men is interesting and accurate for the most part (although certainly some aspects are probably overstated), but it's her prescriptive \\"solutions\\" that seem misguided. In my experience, a marriage works best when good communication leads to mutual compromises. To have wives coddle their husbands might produce the desired results in the short term, but I think it is worth thinking about the reciprocal nature of a good marriage for long-term success. Is it too much to ask that husbands should work just as hard to figure out the needs and desires of their wives and adapt themselves as well? I hope not. Unless this is a two-side process, the long term benefits are questionable at best.But again, she does manage to capture many of the core struggles of the average man. No one man (hopefully) embodies all the fears, anxieties, and problems she describes, but it would be a rare man that could identify with none of them. I still plan on giving the book to my wife (with a host of qualifications) because it does in some ways describe my own inner fears, desires, and struggles, but my hesitancy to do so still remains simply because of the implicit message to women."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I am a bookstore junkie, big time, and one of my absolute favorite bookstores is LifeWay. While I was browsing one day about a month ago, I came across this book in the new release section. Having already read a fiction book by Shaunti Feldhahn, I picked up this non-fiction book even though I thought the cover was rather lame (also, Beth Moore's favorable quote on the cover got my attention). I started reading and by the time I had scanned (in depth) the first 3 chapters, I knew I was on to something important. My wife is not as \\"into\\" these types of books as I am, so I chose to run it by her first. I waited a couple of days until the moment seemed right to bring up the topic, and asked her if she wouldn't mind if I gave her the book (I explained it briefly) - she said she wouldn't mind at all. So I bought it the next day and gave it to her that night. My wife is a processor, luckily for me, and she is reading a chapter every few days and then letting that one soak in. If you should choose to read this book, I would urge you to take your time reading it. Each chapter goes into depth in a particular area concerning men, but does so in a way that is not bogged down in psych tech-speak. At a point about 4 chapters in, she asked me to read the book and decide which chapters fit me more than others - she wanted me to, in essence, rank the chapters. She had a tough time wording how she was feeling as she read more and more of the book, but what I gather is that she is genuinely taken aback by what the author has found out about men, and possibly even having a little trouble processing all the information, some of which, no doubt, is new to her, or if not new, I dare say she had no idea as to the depth.After reading the book myself, this is what I want to say to you, the wives. There is no chapter in this book that doesn't hit home and thus felicitously apply to what I believe would be a normal man, and by normal, I mean most of us. Much of what is contained in this book is of a deeply personal nature - stuff that some of us men would feel (to varying degrees) uncomfortable talking about with our wives. Just let me try to say what most if not all of husbands would say to their wives if asked by their wives about the content of this book.* \\"Yes, the contents of the book are true, even though it may be alarming (maybe even shocking) to you.\\"* \\"It's possible that some chapters may apply more than others, but trust me, the entirety of this book is dead on target, with all chapters applying to the makeup of who I am.\\"* \\"Sometimes I wish God had not \`hard-wired' me to be like this, but I know with total certainty that I am created in the image of God - I am created exactly the way God intended, thus, in retrospect, 100% of the time, after consideration, I am very glad God created me like this.\\"* \\"Likewise, though you are indeed so often a puzzle to me, I am equally glad God created you to be mysterious to me, because it's more often a wonderful mystery than a frustrating mystery.\\"* \\"Please be cautious how you talk to me about this book. Remember, much of the content is of a delicate nature, if it wasn't, I would have already talked to you about the subject matter of each chapter.\\"* \\"If you ever find a book that is similar to this one, but written for men, please buy it for me and give it to me right away. I am always looking for ways to be a better husband to you.\\"I truly feel that the author has written this book in a way to be as far from preachy as I can imagine. I suspect that you will feel her surprise with her as she was gathering the survey and interview results and other enlightening material for this book. Here is a woman who loves her husband deeply, but married life is, of course, not without frustration. Perhaps, she was mystified by her husband one too many times, and, putting on her investigative hat, decided to go to a fount of results - the opinions of about four hundred men. She got answers, and those answers just may increase your understanding of men and strengthen your marriage to a level you thought not possible. Highly recommended to any wife who loves her husband."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I thought I was happily married, I mean, come on I love my husband, and he loves me. I'm a Flight Attendant and successful author, what is there left to learn about men, that I don't know. Then I saw an interview with Shaunti on TV and I was stunned. The book sounded facinating. She interviewed 1,000 guys and tallied up the results. I got the book - read it in one setting and then quizzed my husband. \\"Honey, you don't think this...do you?\\" He did. My eyes were opened. And I saw my husband as \\"so different\\" from me, someone who responds to different things, will respond differently than me. You need to get this book. I have told everyone I know, men and woman, this book will change your marriage."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This was an excellent book. Before giving my own personal review of it though I'd like to answer a few of the critics of the book (as in the critics in the Amazon reviews below)--------------------------------------------------As per M. Duffy comments under \\"So What?\\" M. declares that \\"She's not changing for any man.\\" This sounds like the comments of someone who expects that any man who's with her should change everything about himself to suit her. The fact is that relationships are a TWO-WAY street: this book is meant to be one-half of the overall issue (the author is very clear about this). The book in no way says that \\"men should do whatever they want and women should only do what the man wants them to do.\\" If that's how M. Duffy read the book, she's sadly mistaken. If she knows that the book isn't saying the above but she's pretending that's what it's saying, then she's simply being intellectually dishonest, making her review irrelevant.As per I. Bodden's comments: Her review is just drooling with disdain for anyone who doesn't have as high and mighty of views as she does. Perhaps it's time to open her eyes to the fact that not everyone has the \\"knowledge\\" that she does, and perhaps a lot of these \\"obvious\\" things are not so obvious. Her cheap shots at 'religious' people also reveals either that 1. she's simply had bad experience with 'religious' people (which is unfortunate, but you cannot judge any philosophy/religion by its illogical outworkings) or 2. her own mind is too tiny to comprehend the idea of the supernatural (I find that most people only accuse other people of having 'closed minds' when that particular person disagrees with the one who's making the accusation) or 3. (and most likely) she is too afraid to think that there may just be a higher power.---------------------------------------------------On with the actual review of this book! (I should note that I'm not a woman... a close female friend of mine lent this book to my wife who read it and then wanted my opinion, which is why I read it.)This book is not meant to be an exhaustive study - the book itself (not including excerpts from other readings at the end) is only 188 pages...obviously this won't cover every last thing. In other words, I can understand Emily E. Spinozzi's comments in her review, but this book is not meant to cover as in depth as she was hoping. The book serves as an excellent INTRODUCTION to issues surrounding what many (not all) men want.Nowhere in the book does Feldhahn claim that ALL MEN feel/want the things that are in this book. That is to say that throughout the book, Feldhahn talks about how MOST men want/feel such and such. You may read this book and your husband/boyfriend/etc may disagree with the entire book. That's not the point. The point is that MANY men feel/want the things in this book, so it's worth considering the things in this book.Some of the topics/thoughts covered in this book are:- \\"a man's need to have his judgment respected\\"- \\"don't tell him how\\"- \\"the most fragile thing on the planet\\"- \\"I have no earthy idea how to do this\\"- \\"the imposter at work\\"- \\"affirmation is everything\\"- \\"create a safety zone\\"- \\"haunted by romantic failures\\"- \\"it's difficult to change gears\\"- \\"playing together is very romantic\\"- \\"when you take care of yourself, I feel loved\\"Since my wife and I both read the book it was funny to compare how according to the book I was sometimes more of a 'woman' and she was more of a 'man.' Again, this book does not claim to be an exhaustive apologetic on how EVERY MAN feels. This book is a simple, very quick read (I read it in about 3 quick sittings) - if you're looking for a complex, very in depth look at male/female relationships, look elsewhere.I believe this book achieves every aspect of its authorial intent: a tool to help open the eyes of women as to just what their man might be feeling/thinking. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"My husband and I were high school sweethearts and have been married forty years. I thought I understood my husband's every thought. However, Shaunti's book bought many things to my attention which I had ignored. She stressed the importance of saying positive things about your husband in front of friends instead of negative comments. This hit home with me. I started listening to my comments about my husband when we were with friends and realized that many of my comments were put downs. Although my comments were made in jest and not sincere, I begin to see what they were doing to him. My husband is a wonderful Christian husband, a great father and grandfather. I assumed that he knew this; but after reading the book, I realized that I did not always tell him so. Thank you Shaunti for opening my eyes. A happy marriage requires daily commitment from both partners and open communication. This book provides much insight for wives to better understand the inner life of their husbands. The book is excellent for couples of all ages."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"After reading this book, I was stunned to find out how little I really knew about the man I'd married. He confirmed that *everything* in it was true. I would recommend this to absolutely any woman - regardless of how long she's been married or whether she's ever been married at all. This will become a well-worn book, and I intend to use it as a wedding present in the future."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"When my best friend told me about Shaunti Feldhahn's bookFor Women Only: What You Need to Know About the Inner Lives of Men, I didn't quite believe it could top my absolute favorite book on relating to men: Dr. Laura Schlessinger's Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands. But after searching every book store in town to find For Women Only, I came home and read it in one sitting. For Women Only needs a better cover, but that's my only complaint.Inside the striped cover of For Women Only, I found a concise, encouraging message that motivated me to apply what I discovered in its pages. More succinct and less blunt, with scriptural principles instead of crass terms, For Women Only now tops Proper Care and Feeding on my list.For Women Only is a must-read for every woman who has (or hopes to have) a man in her life. It is a book I will go back to time and again (along with the articles in this February's issue of Focus on the Family Magazine), for reminders on the best way to love, respect, and support my man. But I would still recommend Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands for additional guidance--you can't beat Dr. Laura's signature down-to-earth practicality.Shaunti's book had two chapters that Dr. Laura's didn't. From Shaunti I learned about a man's visual Rolodex that he battles every day (which relates to what she and Dr. Laura both have to say about how important it is that we look good for our man). And her research revealed that men really do like romance, their definition of it just varies from ours sometimes.For Women Only is written based on results from a survey Shaunti conducted of hundreds of men. The revelations of the survey astounded her, especially when she found out that they were the very things her husband had always wished she had known about him. After you read For Women Only, you will be thankful that Shaunti felt compelled to share her findings with the rest of us. The seven truths she shares will have a dramatic effect on your relationship with your man. The seven principles will guide you as you seek to better support, respect, and understand the men in your life.For Women Only combines the wisdom of Dr. Emerson Eggerichs' book Love and Respect, with the sometimes startling truths of Stephen Arterbur's Every Man's Battle, and the wisdom of Dr. Laura's Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands, for a wife's complete guidebook to loving and understanding her man.It's For Women Only...and only every woman should read it."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Of course, I always knew: Men are different.

This book enabled me to see that when I feel I want something from a man, I may actually be communicating the opposite.I dislike books that separate men from women or that favor one sex over the other. This book doesn't do that. Instead it delivers information about how men and women communicate. The reader then learns the awareness of the different ways of communicating without making anyone of either sex wrong for how they are being.Another book that is a special gift is called Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment. The writers Ariel and Shya Kane present a way of living and communicating that opens people's eyes to things they might not have even thought was possible like having a fun, easy and spectacular life..Both these books offer refreshing ways of viewing & experiencing what is happening around you: this thing we call Life."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book is a quick and helpful read, because it's written in light, easy prose and it addresses issues all married folks should, but probably don't, discuss. (My only beef was with the layout that repeats part of the text in big, bulleted blocks.) I am a married man, and I found that, as with all generalizations, some apply to me and others do not. Felham acknowledges this. The ones that do apply will be very helpful to my wife. The ones that don't, we can discuss. The insights are very appropriate for all married people, because they will open the discussion, and they do so in very clever and insighful ways. I recommend it despite some complaints in reviews that it \\"takes us back in time\\". There are good and bad with past, as with present, marriage practices, and to suggest otherwise shows a lack of objectivity. This book will help marriages to become more like they should be: honest and open discussions between two people who have become one, but often don't feel like it. Its foundation of traditional, Biblical marriage is the best there is when understood. Feldham helps us get closer to that goal."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"As a single woman until the age of 50, I thought I knew men based on the myriad of males who had crossed my path over the years.

I learned new things and got validation on issues that I had been struggling with. I have bought several books and sent them to women who are marrying or who are having issues in their marriages.

Read this if you want your life to be better with any male in your life."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I highly recommend this book. But women, don't just read it yourself. Carve out some time in your busy schedule to read it together with your boyfriend/husband. As you read, ask him... is this true? Talk about his answers openly and honestly. Apply your discussion to your relationship. This has really helped our marriage and I'm sure it will help yours also. Also read the book \\"For Men Only\\" and do the same thing.WARNING: Be sure to allow enough time for a full discussion!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Finally, a book about man that's not just what some woman thinks! The idea that this woman got a professional surveyer to come in and survey men, in addition to her one-on-one interviews to try and understand them is amazing. Extremely well-written, dealing with some rather difficult issues for us women to face at times, but great insight into how the male mind works."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"There's a lot of good information in this book, and it does describe much of what goes on in the minds of men, however, as any study will show its own results, it cannot apply to all men from all backgrounds and dispositions. Naturally men want to be catered to, however there must also be a balance for women as well. I think the author did a good job in describing how many men think, and I digress that what women think is equally important. This is an interesting read and I do recommend it for some insight. I also suggest the book \\"Stop Being the String Along\\" by Barbara Rose for relationship answers taking all sides and equal balance within the relationship into account."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I am a 33-year-old single man, never married. I read this book in 3 days. This book is a must-read for both men and women, Christian or not. It will help men put into words about what they already know about themselves but were unable to formulate. It will help women understand all the men in their lives better, including their spouses or boyfriends, sons, brothers and friends. I found that 75-80% of what is written in this book is true of me. Of course, I'm not married yet, so not all of it was true, but you can't expect that generalizations can be true of EVERY man. However, a great majority of it was true about me, so I would highly recommend that you read this book.I would suggest that if women read this book, they discuss what they're reading with their boyfriends or spouses, and see how they can implement these ideas into their relationship with their man. Men should read this book and give it to their spouses or girlfriends so that their women will understand their men better."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book is life changing if you read it with an open mind and take it to heart. By understanding how men (mainly your husband) think, you realize how your words and actions affect him. Men are different from women and they hear the things we say differently than we may mean them, creating misunderstanding. If you take this knowledge and put it to use, you will positively affect your relationship with all the men in your life. It helps with sons, too.Terie Blankenbaker"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Shanti Feldhahn gives practical advice to women who are or hope to be in a marital relationship with men.

By following the advice in this book, a husband may become more loving because he feels he is being respected for what he provides.By understanding a man's basic needs a woman may be able to encourage a taming of the dragons and a more peaceful existence. It really comes down to keeping a man happy so you can be happy.Does a man want respect more than sex?Do men enjoy romance as much as women?What is the key to a man's emotions?Shaunti Feldhahn brings out good points about anger being a clue to when women have stepped over the disrespect boundary. At times she makes men seem very volatile and at other times shows they have an incredible amount of patience and endurance.This book does not address a woman's need for romance or how men can get the response from women that they desire, it mainly focuses on what a woman needs to know. After the initial reactions (an increase in arguments if you discuss the two books) subside, you may find you are experiencing moreromance than before.While reading, it can be a little frustrating to only be viewing the issue from one side, but there is a second book: For Men Only. My husband read the second book and actually came looking for this one.If you are a feminine energy woman married to a masculine energy man, this book will explain a lot and may encourage the reading of additional selections.If you are single, you might enjoy: Men are Like Fish by Steve NakamotoIf you want your husband to take the lead: Gentlemen Start Her EngineAn author who understands the Female Heart and has a deep knowledge of masculine/feminine polarity: Dear Lover by David DeidaSecrets: The Secrets of Happily Married Men by Scott HaltzmanMood Enhancement for women who want a response or want to bemore responsive:Culinary Seduction: The Seduction CookbookMassage: Kama Sutra Massage Therapy Kit - artfully blended for an enticing fragrance and uniquely powerful effect on mind, body and spirit.Tazo Passion Tea - an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.

Aside from a few innacuracies I found it to imformative. They are compact books concisely informative.

Us guys also want to be found endearing for our inner qualities appreciating you as a whole person. You aren't a \\"Lower life form\\" as stated in For Men Only. When men and women treat each other as equals their differences complimentary to each other there's closeness and pure love. In today's society shared-power is tricky business but it works for many and the efforts are well worth it. We're here to learn, love and be loved.

Every woman should read it regularly.,"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Shaunti Feldhahn's For Women Only, will astonish and amaze many women. Feeling as though I know my husband pretty well, I was surprised to read some facts about the male persona that I was not truly aware of. Though I thought I knew how he was wired, there proved to be many traits or struggles specific to men that I didn't quite have a grasp of. I can't remember how many times I would come to Dave after finishing a chapter and ask, is this true? I was amazed at some of the things I read and how little I really understood the core of my husband's heart.Over the course of nine chapters Feldhahn covers issues such as respect, performance, sex, romance, appearance, and so much more. She takes you deep inside a man's heart. Nowhere in this book will you find a rant against men and how they need to be better for us women. The book is strictly a magnifying glass into how men are wired and how we, as women, can be better for them. Each chapter uncovers a different secret about the man in our lives and ends with how women should respond to this character trait.One of the best things about this book is its credibility. This is not merely a collection of opinions that Feldhahn gathered from the closest men in her life. She did an extensive survey of four hundred anonymous men across the country, ranging in age from twenty-one to seventy-five, during which they answered two dozen questions about their lives and about how they think, what they feel, and what they need. She was determined to paint an unbiased, accurate portrayal of who a man really is.The point most stressed throughout this book is the response to give glory to God for His creation. Yes, men were created quite differently from women, but it is those specific things about a man that make him unique (and sometimes hard for women to understand). God designed man with a great purpose and a great calling, and as the women in their lives we need to push them to be the best version of themselves and the most accurate image of Christ they can be.Feldhahn ends her book with this charge: \\"Let us accept this call to maturity and receive this invitation for our generation to become the strong, gentle, godly women our men need. If we are willing to be molded by His hands, the Lord will shower us, our men, and our relationships with abundance. That is the way He works. He made us for each other. He is the Author of love.\\" (Feldhahn, p 178)Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review. I have not received any compensation for writing this post."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I truly felt the need to read this book. After years of abusive and failed relationships I slowly became somewhat of a \\"man hater\\". I've never been able to figure any man out, and have always questioned their making.Shaunti Feldhahn does a fantastic job in this book. There was obviously a lot of thought and a lot of long hours studying, researching, and interviewing many, many men that went into this book. She lays it all out there, the truth, be it something you want to hear or not.Why did I need to read this? Because at some point I have to realize that not ALL men are bad and I needed to understand them more to lessen my insecurities about them, and my \\"stereotyping\\" if you will of men in general. By understanding the inner thoughts and workings of a man, maybe I could gain a little more understanding about how relationships work as well.Here is a glimpse at some of the topics this book covers:Why Sex Unlocks a Man's Emotions....His Visual Rolodex: Why it's so hard for him not to look, and so hard to forget what he's seen...The Truth About the Way You Look: Why the way you look on the outside, affects him on the inside...I felt that the author has written this book in a way to be as far from \\"preachy\\" as I can imagine. You no doubt will feel her surprise with her as she was researching and interviewing men for the survey results and other enlightening material for this book. Here is a woman who loves her husband deeply, but married life is, of course, not without hardships, misunderstanding, and frustration. She most likely became stumped by her husband one too many times and made the decision to get the \\"down low\\" of the opposite sex by interviewing hundreds of men. She got answers, and those answers just may increase your understanding of men and strengthen your marriage to a level you thought not possible.I highly recommend this book to any woman searching for a husband, or who loves her husband, and wants to KEEP A HAPPY HUSBAND. I have 3 sons, and I find this to be appropriate in knowing how to guide them in their raising as well. This book is a must read for any women that know or are related to any men!!! I can't believe how much of a difference this book can make in any male, female relationship!!! I really feel that all women should read this, for their brothers, fathers, spouses, significant others, and male friends sake!I enjoyed this book, gave it a 5 star rating, and am no looking forward to getting my hands on the opposite version.....For Men Only...I'm curious to see how on spot that one is.I received this book from free from Waterbrook Publishing for review purposes.

I read it with great interest and learned many things that I can take with me into my daily life and dealings with men. I realize how I'd been hurtful and disrepectful to them in the past, but that's all changed now that I've read this eye opening book.

She lays it out honestly as well but never in a harsh tone. She wants to help women do better and it was all inspired by writing a male character in one of her Christian novels. I was blown away by a lot of what I read. I knew some of it but not quite to the depth shown in the book. It has changed how I want to be not just around my husband as well as other men in how I react, dress, and my appearance. Dress just has to do with my clothes.I am so glad I picked up this book. I made sure to give it lots of time to take in what was presented in the book. It definitely is one I highly recommend to all women to read whether you are single, dating, engaged, married or even divorced. We are around men all the time and this will help us better to honor those men in our lives. I am definitely wanting to read her other works and may even pick up her fiction books.

Mrs. Feldhahn states that ALL men want a skinny girl and that any who tell their wives otherwise are liars. I am sorry, but I resent being called a liar! This woman should be punished for writing this book; the Multnomah Book Company should be punished for allowing this book to be published. I will NEVER support this company again and I urge you to do the same. Buy this book if you would like a fight in your relationship! Otherwise, trust your significant other, not some trumped up expert.

I wish I could get my money and time back. This is a book for Christian relationships and nowhere does it say that on the cover or the synopsis. The book is filled with references to Jesus, God and everyone the author surveyed was from a religious community. I actually listened to the entire audio book out of sheer curiosity about how dumb this author. My fiance and I had a nice laugh about how ridiculous this book is. The book focuses on having women constantly adjust themselves to meet men's needs. The book is written from the point of view of a world in which women do not work and are generally self-involved and out of touch with their partner's needs. Do not waste your money on this absurdity."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"eazy read, profound knowledge gained, food for thought! pass it on, be a part of the peace process.

Are there really people around who still believe this kind of stuff? How can this book NOT be insulting to women AND men? Good communication is the key to successful relationships, NOT some made up rules on how to behave in certain situations. This book is full of generalizations and stereotypes that should have gone out of fashion at the same time as beehive hairdos.Example one (from page 10): The author writes: \\"Have you ever been perplexed by your husband's defensiveness when you ask him to stop working so much?\\"The author says that you'll learn the answer to this in her book. What she should tell you is to TALK to your husband and be on the same page as he is. If my husband is working \\"too much\\", I already know the reason for it. I know what's going on in his life because we COMMUNICATE.This example was just on page 10, I could go on and on here, but won't.This book is ridiculous and insults my & my husband's intelligence."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"You don't really need to buy this book.

It was given to me at my wedding shower by a person who probably should have known better (my own sister!). This book is just an extremely dumbed-down version of His Needs, Her Needs by Willard F. Harley. Having read that book, reading For Women Only was a waste of thirty minutes. Feldhahn's book is somewhat helped by a collection of survey results, which tell us exactly the same things that Harley's book does. Feldhahn's advice, however, is not very helpful (\\"Pray\\"). Her writing style is simultaneously annoying & boring. It's a little strange that Dr. Harley, a marriage counselor, is a better writer than Ms. Feldhahn. But then it should be obvious that a marriage counselor would write a better book on relationships than the author of The Veritas Conflict (which is apparently about the evils of humanism and a college education). One great(!) thing about this book is that it doesn't deny human nature. Christian wives are famous for expecting impossible things from their husbands. This book reminds them that, no matter what their husbands believe in, they still have the sex drive of a Neanderthal. Feldhahn does, however, like to blame that sex drive on the evils of American society, which is somewhat counterproductive considering that humans create society, not the other way around. Still, this book is a step in the right direction. (But if you're thinking about reading this, please read His Needs, Her Needs instead.)"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I learned so much from this book.

FIND THINGS U MIGHT THINK YOU KNOW AND IF YOU DONT DO A LOT OF RESEARCH ON RELATIONSHIPS THIS IS SOMETHING YOU PROBABLY WOULD NEVER NO OR UNDERSTAND IF YOU DONT READ THE BOOK"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Until I read other reviews here, I thought I was alone if feeling worse about myself and my marriage after reading this book. The common stereotype is that women are fragile and hurt by the least little word, but the author's finding seem to suggest the opposite: women can break a man (and even his career) with one comment. Given studies that say that women speak about 4x as much as men, that means policing a lot of what I say. The book for men gave simple, easy to understand instructions of what to say and do and different situations. This book gives vague ideas that I cannot build on - such as the scene from the movie \\"The Natural\\" where the woman simply stands up in the bleachers to support her man. Men apparently love this - they love that she didn't talk to him, coddle him, try to kiss it better, she simply stood up and that said how much faith she had in him. The book says women need to do this daily for their man to make him feel valued, but I have not figured out how to implement it. She gives a plethora of negatives examples, so I know never to say offhandedly that my husband has never played golf, might not be suited to race car driving, and I would prefer him not to sky dive. All these statements seem to say to a man he's a failure and his wife does not repect him (which men apparently equate to love.) The title of the second chapter is \\"You love will never be enough for him.\\" Did I NEED to know this? It's about how no matter how much I love him, his job will define him. His late hours (which I despise) should be lauded, and saying \\"I wish you were home more, I miss you\\" is the equivalent of screaming \\"You are a horrible provider, nothing you do will be good enough for me.\\" She tells me he hears \\"you're a failure\\" in every comment I say from \\"did you bring the mail?\\" to \\"did you pick up milk on the way home?\\". Which is why *I* get blasted -- apparently deservedly -- when he did not do those things. I THINK I am asking a simple question, but what I'm doing is telling him I don't have faith in him, and if he did indeed forget, then I have basically painted failure across his forehead. But if he says, \\"Did you pick up the dry cleaning?\\" - it's a question - though maybe he is secretly saying he thinks I'm a failure. I sure feel like one after reading the book. I was hoping for encouragement, concrete ideas on how to make him feel more loved and valued, and instead I walked away feeling like every action and word from me is an attack. The book uses terms like \\"attack\\" and \\"feels like my skin is being flayed off.\\" Wow. Images that make me feel like an abuser. Other women obviously love this book, but I for one cry myself to sleep for failing my husband so badly for 22 years."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"First, let me say that I have been married, and happily so, for over 21 years. I heard about this book, and set out to find it. After I read it in one sitting (I could not put it down), I, as a male, was blown away. This was a mirror on my own emotional and mental makeup. I saw myself in page after page. Some of the chapters were more relevant than others, but they ALL had helpful insights into my own beliefs/thoughts/actions. I have thought some of the EXACT words she has written about in her book.I knew that Ms. Feldhahn had written a companion book called \\"For Men Only\\". It delves into the inner thought-life of women. I bought it also and read it from cover to cover. It explained a lot about the actions of my wife over the years in certain situations. I felt like I needed to focus on her first, so I implemented some of the suggestions from the book, and my I saw an immediate change in her. She asked about my change, and I saw it as a way to start a conversation about \\"For Women Only\\". She has started reading it, and has found it a real \\"eye opener\\". I can only speak for myself, but I cannot state strongly enough that this book verbalizes what I could not find the words to say myself.Keep in mind that these books are written from a Biblical perspective, so don't be offended if it seems old fashioned. I also noticed that 14 out of 16 people that gave it only 1 star were women. Sorry, but women cannot say whether or not the feelings Ms. Feldhahn writes about are true. All you can do is ask your male significant other whether HE sees himself in it or not. She NEVER says that it is only a one-way street,or that women should be doormats. Just read her book written FOR men to understand what I mean.Whether or not it will help your relationship, I cannot say. However, I can say that it has helped mine. I just wish I had them 20 years ago."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Ladies, please read this book. Let me repeat that - PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!!! If you want to understand us, there is no better way to do it than to read this book. Shaunti hits the bullseye over and over. To those women who think that this book merely excuses mens' faults and shortcomings : you couldn't be more wrong. This book EXPLAINS us guys - it DOES NOT excuse our failings. If you don't believe that, you have a number of options: 1) become a lesbian, 2) try to find a guy who is an 'exception to the rule' (i.e. a needle in a haystack), in which case you'll probably find a 'girly-man', 3) pretend that we are not like this and have a less-than-you-could-have relationship. Lastly, such women shouldn't feel left out now that Shaunti and her husband have written a book 'excusing' the shortcomings and failings of the fairer sex (For Men Only).One last note : I would strongly suggest that guys listen to this one BEFORE listening to the companion book (For Men Only). It is enlightening to 'listen in' to women talking about us men - it enables you to see yourself through their eyes. I did this and it was really helpful when listening to For Men Only."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I wish I had read this book at the beginning of my marriage, now 22 years later I am still doing the same thing I did when I first got married with no good results.Now, I have started changing my remarks in public about my husband that I did not realize were detrimental to how he feels about himself. There are lots of things I never truly realized about men. We are so totally different. I complained about him working long hours and that is one way he is saying he loves me and the kids by providing for us. To me that is a sacrifice to the family, and yet to him it is the man's job.Just little things like that to help me see things in a different perspective."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I don't know what caught my eye about this book but I picked it up, got a mocha and sat down at the book store and read it from cover to cover. I have been divorced for 21 years, am not a christian and am a feminist; and I really wish I would have had this book 35 years ago. It's insight and revelations into men's thoughts and fears have honestly astonished me. Who would have thought that men would have such fears and hopes regarding a loving and balanced relationship? If what I've read in this book and the resulting comments written about this book are the way a majority of men feel, maybe I have some serious rethinking to do.As I read it, all I could think of was, \\"Ah, I get it now!\\" While there are some things I don't necessary agree with, it's a book I couldn't put down. As to the person who wrote that she was disappointed that it is not a more biblical book; if it had more more biblical I would put it down after only a couple of pages. I also disagree with the person who wrote that non-christians wouldn't be interested in it, ah - wrong again. I think any book that can challenge the mind to rethink long held and possibly not accurate opinions is a book worth reading.The book was written to give married and, I feel, single women an insight into the world of men, what could be better? No, this book isn't the end all and be all book of relationship solutions, but it's certainly a great start on understanding the way men feel and think. I am buying the book for my daughter and daughter-in-law. I haven't read \\"For Men Only\\" but you can bet I will and my boys will get that book."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book has forever changed the way I will view my relationship with any man in my life. The most valuable reviews written here are the ones I've seen written by men - so go read those! This book is insightful, surprising, thought-provoking, and should be required reading for EVERY woman, straight or gay, attached or not. It's an invaluable resource for women involved in intimate relationships with men, but also will give you new perspectives on any man in your life - friends, husbands, fathers, brothers. I've read it at least 5 times and I'll keep reading it every so often, just to remind myself. By one for yourself and one for every woman in your life. Not only will they love you and thank you....but so will the men in their lives!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I would highly recommend this for both men and women to read, and especially for men and women who are involved in a serious relationship. The author does an excellent job of exploring issues that are very important to most men (Yes, I am a man :-)) and that I think most women don't truly understand. This book provides a way for women to get insight into how men work, and can provide a opportunity for men to talk about issues they may not know how to bring up for discussion.I understand she is working on a book called For Men Only, which I am looking forward to reading and I sure will be done with the same honesty and integrity that she put into this book.Enjoy, it is a great book,Martin"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"For Women OnlyBy Shaunti FeldhahnReviewed by Ed VasicekSo what is a (somewhat normal) man doing reading a book titled, \\"For Women Only\\"?As a pastor, I do plenty of marriage counseling and plenty of teaching about marriage and family. I am always on the lookout for useful material, and, when someone loaned me this book, I found it to be a practical resource. It limits itself to helping women understand their husbands. It does not focus on the nature of women (see \\"For Men Only\\"). Although \\"For Women Only\\" does not address EVERY issue of marriage, it is faithful to its subtitle, \\"what you need to know about the inner lives of men.\\" As Beth Moore summarizes, \\"What an important book!\\"Women are often incredulous about how men are. Some wives go to the grave, living in denial when it comes to the male nature. Or they think they married defective husbands when their husbands are quite normal. They believe the way other men present themselves in public is the way they are at home. Funny, ain't it? Or, worse yet, they think that their husband isn't like other men -- or they try to redefine their man as they want him to be. But, unless he is really out of the mainstream, he is very likely much like the guys in this book (okay, we vary to some degree). As a man, I am saying this book is right on. So believe this book, even if it seems counter-intuitive.What is particularly good about this book is that it is concise (189 small-sized pages with filler graphics and quotations-the equivalent of less than 100 pages), easy to understand, and addresses the basics of the male mentality. Although an easy read, it hits the mark. As a man and an experienced people-helper, I endorse this book as true to reality.The first chapter is particularly noteworthy: \\"Lightbulb On! How I Woke Up to What I Didn't Know About Men.\\" In my experience, most women have a confidence that they understand their husbands, but they really do not (and vice versa). It is one thing to be aware that one does not know; it is worse to think you know when you do not. The author addresses male perspectives about job performance, family, respect, sex, and his innermost struggles. Ladies, you may not see it their way, but this is the way they see it.A group of married ladies could easily do a study using this material (a guide is available), and I would suggest it as a great gift for married daughters and friends. A simple book like this, if noted and remembered, could improve many marriages."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I did not think that this book added a great deal of real information that wasn't just common sense. Also, parts of it reminded me of a religious sermon. This seemed to be out of place and totally unexpected. The book was not what I expected. This book is great for the religious right, not the general public."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I was unaware of how religious this book was going to be when I bought it. Nothing in the description mentioned it. Sure, the author writes Christian novels but I figured a mention or two would be ok. There is a mention of God or a psalm in every chapter. It even asks you to prey at one point.Content wise, it had great information and helped me with my relationship (and gender studies class). I would have preferred less religious content though."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

If you are open to challenging your contemporary thoughts on what men should think in a politically correct sense, and want to improve how you relate to the man in your life, this book may be for you.

I learned a lot of new information, some of it is crazy to think men actually think like that!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Our daughter brought this book to my attention, and I cannot say enough good things about it! Shaunti has done her research well. She has obtained honest responses and feedback from men, and she explains the male mindset in language a woman can understand. It amazed me to hear so many things that men assume we women know that most of us *don't*! I was clueless, even after 34 years of a good marriage.Testing out Shaunti's findings, I found them to be true for my husband, as well. And, trusting that what was true of \\"For Women Only\\" would hold true for \\"For Men Only,\\" I asked my husband if he would be willing to read it. Since he was, we ordered it, and he found it to be helpful, also. Through reading these books, our understanding of one another has improved, and so has our relationship!Finally, we decided to pass on the blessing, and we purchased copies for our son and his fiance and for the couples in our church.My only regret concerning this book is that I was not able to read it 37 years ago!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I would love to give this book to every woman that I know - in fact, I've already given away my copy to a friend and need to get another! What makes this book special is that I felt such honour was communicated towards and about men. Honour is sometimes considered an outdated concept and the word is never used in the book, but the author maps out the concept in modern-day language with a female-friendly perspective.R-E-S-P-E-C-T is something that all men want! It isn't MAN-ipulation to recognise that the world will be a better place if women (who honestly have a monopoly on communicating without words) look to bring the best out of their partners, boyfriends, brothers and friends. This book is an amazing tool in the hands of all women learning how to place value on the men in their life!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"THIS REVIEW PERTAINS TO THE 2-VOLUME SET!I like this set so much I am buying a copy for each of my brothers, so they can (hopefully) skip some of the mistakes I made in my first marriage. The best gift I can give each family member is a happy primary relationship, and I think this is the best means by which I can give it to them.For either gender, this set seems to be the closest thing imaginable to an \\"owner's manual\\" to the opposite gender. I wish I'd had this available years ago, to avoid some of those situations when walking on eggshells seemed inevitable. I've always believed in respecting the differences between people, but it's exponentially easier when you know precisely what the differences are!Without trivializing any one trait, this married couple co-authors a simply & factually written guide to understanding the psyche of your significant other. I can't imagine how much good they have done for couples who read these volumes. I bet most readers get only a few pages in before exclaiming \\"WOW,\\" because it's rare that the other gender will open up so completely and so fearlessly to give us a clear glimpse inside their psychological map. After I received my copy, I read both volumes, discussed them with my boyfriend, then lent them to his daughter. I hope to share this treasure with many more people!The volume about men began accidentally, when the author discovered (while researching a novel) that her understanding of the male psyche was much less deep than she thought, and began to see her research as more applicable to a self-help book than a fictional story. Promising anonymity encouraged several male acquaintances to level with her, and she discovered a new understanding of \\"normal\\" for a man's inner world. Surmising that very few of us women would attempt such research, and that very few men would be willing to lay themselves bare to a loved one, she collected hundreds of answers about the issues that are core to the male psyche. Then she started to give out this info in her couples' workshops, and got even more insight. Then her husband went with her to several such workshops to gather intel, and wrote the companion volume for men, to explain the things that confounded men about their female significant others. Both books are strong enough to stand on their own, but are more useful to established couples in tandem, so each person can explain or answer questions about their own gender, then ask some questions of their partner, all based on the insights presented here.The volume \\"For Men Only\\" gives a pretty accurate description of typical womens' wiring, touching on the subjects of differing sex drives, our perceived obsession with beauty, the ability to mentally multi-task (and inability to stop multi-tasking) emotional \\"flashbacks\\" to episodes/memories that were seemingly resolved, and a few other female idiosyncrasies. Although I consider myself an atypical woman in many ways (and others have strongly agreed with this assessment), much of this information is still true, to a degree. There's even a short, one-page \\"abstract\\" of the topics, for men who only have 5 minutes to peek inside the book before deciding whether to continue.I found the \\"For Women Only\\" insights to be quite useful too, and discerning about how to explain a man's mental terrain so that a woman can best comprehend it. Although none of the topics were surprising, I was startled by the superficiality of my previous understanding. This volume covers mens' drive to perceive themselves as providers, the centrality of the sex drive, the need for respect (especially in public) from near & dear (particularly spouses), and ability to compartmentalize mental issues/topics, and a few other male idiosyncrasies.For all of us in a committed, healthy, heterosexual relationship, who would like to avoid stepping on an emotional landmine, this is worth the price and the time it'll take you to read it the first time. I bet my next paycheck that you will then decide it's worth reading at least one more time, and lending out to someone else who wants to have a healthier relationship with their significant other. Just remember that individuals will vary within the range of \\"generally true information\\" presented herein."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"You can get this excellent information from other sources, but you have to read a lot of books. In this book you get it all in one."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book caught my attention because it lists facts based on men who were interviewed and surveyed, not someone's opinion. As I began reading some of these facts, they helped me to communicate with all men better, not just my husband. Furthermore, with a better understanding and insight on how men process our words and actions is also a road map on how to raise boys. I am purchasing this book for all of my girlfriends and sisters."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"It is important to remember that this book is to be read with the expectation that the man in the woman's life is to read For Men Only. It is a two-sided, win/win relationship where both spouses feel that their needs are met."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"In this day and age, where so many people think that just because men and women have equal value, they think they communicate the same and have the same needs..... This book helps you see the God given (and blessed!) differences, how to acknowledge and honor those differences and why.This book - though written in a very conversational, casual style, is based on MANY large surveys conducted by the author through professional third party survey companies.... so it's not just hearsay, not just the author's observation and opinion. It covers many of the things you should know about how (and why) men respond to women the way they do. It even covers why they're frustrated why we don't understand - again - we're equally valued but different. I highly recommend this book - it's has even more to it than the Mars/Venus, Waffle/Spaghetti books."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book is to the point.

I was a little skeptical but considering my husband and I had been fighting a lot recently I decided it was worth a shot.This is probably the best money I have spent on a book in a while.I read this sitting on a plane - and was totally engulfed. I finished it within a few hours. I was totally amazed by the differences in logic and perception. What a difference this made! After I made it home I implemented some of the suggestions - and I must say it worked IMMEDIATELY. I wish I had read this book sooner! Thank you so much to the author!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Words cannot describe the wealth of information found in this book. I have shared it with all of my friends and my Pastor and his wife in hopes that they use it and the companion book, For Men Only with the couples ministry at our church. It is insightful as well as thought provoking. And it is right on the money with the survey results! It has strengthened my relationship with my significant other, and some of our friends as well. Kudos to Shaunti and Jeff for a job well done!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This is a must read for EVERY woman married or single who desires to have a better relationship with the men in their lives. We all have men in our lives husband, father, brother, son, friend or coworker with whom the relationship is worth improving.Keep in mind this is neither a marriage book nor a psychology book. It is a book about men written for the women who truly care about them and the relationships they have with men. There is a companion book written about women for men appropriately titled, \\"For Men Only.\\" Perhaps those who were offended by this book should give that one a try.I found this book to be both touching and challenging. Very Good book!!!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I read this book in like, 5 hours. Reads like a compilation of Cosmo articles. I really thought the insights into the male mind and emotional patterns would be more in depth. But it's all based on her surveys, which were a little bit elementary in my opinion. But the content is valuable.Pros about this book would be the tone that she writes in. It's all very positive, very Stand By Your Man, support him , understand him. He needs respect, He needs to be the provider, He needs sex and he needs you to stay in shape and look good for him.Better than the latest, greatest manuals on \\"how to catch a man.\\" For two reasons, one, is that spirituality is an important third party in relationships, which she points to often. And, that the book is geared towards married women and women in relationships and upholds men as partners, full of tenderness and feeling, as opposed to gamers or predators."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I had heard that this book was an amazing read, so when I was offered it to review I jumped right on it. It was a really thought provoking book but a hard read. Usually it takes me no more than a week to read a book and sometimes even a day but this one took months and honestly, I still have not finished it and just don't care to do so. I just couldn't get into the book no matter how long I read it. I don't know if it's how it was written or just that I got tired of reading the same thing over and over. This book has a lot of good views from men about how women should be more compassionate to them and help us to understand them more. But on the other hand it constantly refers to a mental \\"Rolodex\\" that all men have where they are constantly thinking about some one other than their spouse and that just doesn't sit right with me. Maybe that's why I quit reading it. I may try and reread it at a later point in life when I don't have so much going on and I may be able to learn from it then but for the time being, it's sitting on my shelf somewhere with the page marked where I ended it."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"On my second or third read, this book, \\"For Women Only\\" by Shaunti Feldhahn is still probably one of my favorites. Why? Well because this book is not only an easy read, it's humorous, informative and based on research rather than just someone's opinion. This book is one that really does help you to get into your guy's mind because it's based on survey results from men.Here's a look a some of the titles:Chapter 2--Your Love is NOT Enough: Why Your Respect Means More to Him than Even Your AffectionChapter 3: The Performance of a Lifetime: Why Your Mr. Smooth Looks So Impressive but Feels Like an ImposterChapter 4: The Loneliest Burden: How His Need to Provide Weights Your Man Down, and Why He Likes It That WayChapter 5: Sex Changes Everything: Why Sex Unlocks a Man's EmotionsAnd that's not even the half of it. Shaunti has several more chapters just as intriguing. And, if you like it, you may even want to read and share with your husband the alternative book,For Men Only: A Straightforward Guide to the Inner Lives of Womenwhich is also based on research with surveys taken of women. Who knows...when reading that book you may learn something about yourself too."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend & subsequently purchased it to keep as a reference/reminder for myself. I have recommended it to numerous friends & will continue to do so. This is a fantastic book, answering all the questions I had about men, more importantly the man in my life.

It taught me a lot about myself that I was totally blind to. I cried through this book and felt so guilty that I wanted to do much more for my husband than for myself. I guess that he didn't have to tell me anything after I finished this book because I started to see him in a different point of view.

The book does not call women to be \\"June Cleaver.\\" It changes the negative connotation of the word \\"submission\\" and presents a healthy perspective of what it really means. Both my husband and I have divorced parents. I was a single parent before we married. All if the women in my life had \\"advice\\" and so did the guys... but this book was not like what they said. My husband read it also. He is one of those men of few words and this book really closed our communication gaps.

To hear that other men have made this same comment or at least have thought it has helped me to see certain things from my husband's perspective -- like a light bulb came on! I can now understand why he says and does certain things and it actually makes sense. I now appreciate my husband for who he is, while forgiving him for his mistakes and weaknesses.Instead of being a roadblock in the way of his attempts to be a better man and husband like I unknowingly have been, I can be an encouragement, as I what I can to be a better wife. I now understand what areas I do need to work on and how to deal with the areas that are not within my control or ability to change.A few of the marital topics included in this book are:Respect vs. Affection - Which is more important to him?Your Hubby's Confidence - What's it really look like underneath?Sex - Some insight I didn't have beforeThe Other Woman - Porn and even the woman walking within hubby's viewYour Appearance - and what it means to your hubbyDisclosure: I did not receive any compensation for this review.

God bless!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I can say without hesitation that this book was one of the main ingredients to salvaging my marriage. We were both good people who loved each other and our kids we just got so of course on how and where to focus our efforts. This book is logical, practical and directly influential in changing attitudes. My hubby and I kept pointing to sections of the book and saying \\" is ths how it really is for you?\\". I learned a lot about myself as well. A whole new light has been shone on my husband, and my negative views of men were pushed aside so I could focus on him. Every couple should read and retread these books. Many pearls await."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Though I have been married more than half my life and am now a widow. A friend recommended this book since I am in a new season in my life. I figured what can it hurt, I have over 20years of life experience sure I'll read it. WOW - I must confess after all my \\"experience\\" I feel like I am in first grade learning my new vocab words. I already knew the alphabet but had no idea that so many different words could be created! This book is foundational in relationship building and understanding. I am recommending it to every woman I know Married, Single, Dating, Engaged, Widowed - whatever status! I thank God for people with the knowledge and the insight to dig deeper with research and I believe the leading of the Holy Spirit so that we can have healthier and more productive relationships! Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I was ready to be raptured by this book because it came highly recommended by a close friend. I had just finished reading \\"The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands\\", so I was on a roll. Unfortunately, reading them back-to-back was a mistake. The contrast was too great between men needing our support to go into the world and slay the dragons, and men being fragile and almost victims, who need very careful attention. Much of the text was similar, even some poignant points were in both books, however, the style in which they were presented communicated two very different perspectives on men. Both books serve a fine purpose. Nonetheless, I think men would prefer to be presented as the strong male in \\"The Proper Care...\\""},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"While I agree with much of what the author writes in this book, I felt she beat a dead horse in getting her point across. I think she could have said half as much with greater impact. I felt somewhat nagged at, especially since the video tapes nearly duplicated what was said in the chapters.I also think this book should only be done when husbands are doing the \\"For Men Only\\" companion book. I found myself increasingly frustrated with my husband, not due to anything he was doing, but because he wasn't reciprocating. It seemed that it was all up to me to make adjustments. Women in our group at church expressed a sense of failure and discouragement as we progressed through the chapters, and as leader, I felt the need to bolster them up and remind them how much God loves them and will help them to love their husbands. I do not think this was the writer's intent. I don't think she gave enough support and instruction to women with special circumstances (anything like this was only very briefly addressed). The fact is, very few people have the idyllic lives that make this book helpful as it is written. For instance, women in our group were dealing with husbands who had largely abandoned their role of leading their families spiritually. Other women were dealing with physical issues that made the chapter on sex particularly difficult to process.My biggest criticism of this book is that it is a self-help book that depends on the reader to make changes. In my Christian walk, changes have come by means of my leaning in on God, allowing the transformation to come as a result of His Word and His Spirit doing a \\"spiritual surgery\\" in me. I have never had success in changing myself through a \\"how to\\" book of instruction, but only by my whole dependence on the One who made me. This book was about what to do, rather than on the Who who was doing it. I consider this misguided focus. Too bad."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I'm a woman. I read \\"For Women Only\\" very carefully several times. It takes things we've all heard before (like men need respect, sex, etc.) and really gets at the heart of what that means...more so than any other book I've read on the subject so far. I was a bit surprised by some of the things I read, but I carefully started applying what I learned in my relationship with my boyfriend. \\"For Men Only\\" had just come out, so I asked him if he'd like to read it after telling him about \\"For Women Only.\\" He was more than happy to do so.I read \\"For Men Only\\" and marked how I would have answered the survey questions and underlined a few remarks that were especially true for me. I was constantly thinking, \\"You mean, men don't know that!?!\\" I think I now understand men even better after having read this second book because reading both books really brings out the differences between men and women. I gave the marked book to my boyfriend and left it up to him about whether or not to read it or discuss it. He told me he has now read this book several times, and I've certainly noticed that he has started to apply it!He says he loves how I treat him (using information from \\"For Women Only\\") and I'm in bliss right now from his efforts to apply what he learned in \\"For Men Only.\\" I've read other books on similar subjects, but none really get to the heart of the issues like these two little books."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I did not like this book at all. I kept it for about 3 years and was re-reading it time-to-time, thinking that it will grow on me. Still do not like it. I feel like I belong to a very disadvantaged gender as a woman every time I read this book. Maybe the author knows men but she definitely does not know women. Apparently, only men are sexual creatures... I did not know I am so boring... Men, regarding to the author, are wired to get excited by looking at beautiful women and women should only pray (because they simply do not notice a ripped handsome man-NEVER). The author does not portray men very nicely and delivers THE WORST in men to women in this book. It is almost like the most of the men are sex addicts and weaklings (yack). Even my BF got angry when I show him some parts of this book. This book does not show men as great, honorable, responsible, dominant and does not inspire (me)to treat My Man as my master and my lord (not Lord as God). Depressing writing. Our local priest did better sermon on this topic."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"You think you know the man in your life. Then a book like this comes out, based on the input of \\"our\\" men, and wow, you see things from a whole new angle. This book is a quick read, but very enlightening. I can grasp now why my husband does certain things and how I can show him, in his language, that I appreciate him totally for the wonderful man he is! Well worth it!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Although this book had a few (very few) valuable insights about men, the constant references to God, Christianity, \\"Churchgoers\\" and SIN was very off-putting to me. The cover does not indicate that it is a Christian book. Also, she seems anxious to return to the 1950's ideal wife who stays home, vaccuums in heels and acts dumb to make her man feel good. No, thank you."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be a precise and academic breakdown of male psychology.. well it wasn't. I suppose I should have researched the background of the author before purchasing the book, but considering the topic I assumed it would be a logical breakdown of male perception and how it is shaped in society. I was wrong. There are many helpful hints and useful stories which guide the reader through a better understanding of the men around them, however there is a real problem with the prescriptive advice she gives to female readers. The author continuously suggests that women today trample the male ego and so we are to blame for their wandering eye and trouser snake. Although I can see where a domineering woman would be a detriment to a happy relationship, the implication that we should inflate a man's ego by playing dumb is ludicrous. I am accepting of the differences she puts forth between men and women, however I wish she would have elaborated on more scientific findings of thought processes and not on the religious and antiquated notion that we have to take a back seat to the male ego. Do not buy this book, it is highly repetitive and dripping with christian bias."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book is dangerous for your marriage. It will cause women to be suspicious of their husbands based on some of the inof in the book, that is not true of all and maybe not even most men. Whiel men are visual, they cannot at will or images from the past nor do they appear involuntarily as the author claims. These statements will lead women to think their husbands are perverted and not thinking about them. DO NOT RECOMMEND."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I bought this book along with the 'For Men Only' companion. I read the 'Men' volume, and passed the 'Women' book to my wife. I found some good to excellent points in the 'Men' book, but was slightly off-put by the religious references. My wife finished the 'Women' book and gave it back. I asked her a little about it and I was slightly surprised that she was very lukewarm about it.So, I broke all the rules and read a book this is 'For Women Only'. And ... I disliked it very much.I will say right here - I am not religious. And neither is my wife. Above, I complained that there was too much religion in the 'Men' volume. Be warned if you do not want to read a deeply religious book! If there are three pages in a row in the 'Women' volume that do not hammer you with christianity, I do not know where they are.I read some of the other reviews here before I wrote, and some of them are very long and involved and the rating generally follow my own. If you have the mind that is susceptible to the attraction of religion, and you want to learn how to be the perfect wife from the 1930's, you just might like this book. There is very little here to interest anyone else."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I've had guy friends all my life, but somehow most of Shaunti's subjects never came up. Her book was so enlightening, and my girlfriend gave it to me just at the right time - when I was exploring the differences between masculine and feminine energy. I like my feminine side, I want to dwell there, and Shaunti wrote to me that this is not only OK, but something that should be. Plus the book includes some pointers to try out when dealing with both my men friends and boyfriends. And they work!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I first read this book in March of 2010, and even commented in agreement on another person's mostly unfavorable review. Well, the second time through it was different and my views have almost completely changed. There is absolutely nothing wrong with finding out what makes your man feel happy/strong/confident etc and meeting those needs. That's exactly what I would want my future husband to do for me, to not see my needs (ie-romance, affection, conversation and consideration) as weaknesses, but as needs. And it would bless me so much if he made it his business to meet them. So I can imagine how the same thing would make him feel.There's no shame in meeting needs or fulfilling wants. And I think that's what held me back before: shame. I felt that if I let myself go and stopped protecting myself and \\"gave in\\" to what a man wanted, that would make me weak. And now I believe the opposite to be true; it makes me stronger to have a happy, healthy husband who I put first.One major shift in my thinking is knowing most men truly do have good intentions towards their wives. They want to make her happy. They want to satisfy her. Don't think I felt that way before, hence the \\"watch your back/look out for yourself or you'll get taken advantage of\\" mentality. And it's been refreshing to exchange that for freedom and a basic good opinion of men. If I make his needs the priority not only will he feel happy and respected and loved, but he'll pour that same love back my way. We're safe when we give, not unsafe. We fortify the bond, I believe. So, no shame in learning his \\"language\\", how he interprets what I say, and giving him what he needs/wants. And there's no danger of being stepped on or taken advantage of because when you \\"own\\" the giving, when you choose to give honor as a gift. The worst that could happen is he rejects it, which isn't your loss. It was for them in the first place.All that being said, I look forward to actually living this out in a marriage one day:) But regardless of that, it's still very freeing knowing that men's hearts are usually in the right place, and that what I once perceived as weaknesses in men are actually needs which are just as important as my own. It's nice knowing that I CAN trust the other gender and that they are normal! (Just being honest:) OK, this was a lot longer than I planned. Hope it helps someone."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"At its heart, this book is warmed-over Mars and Venus (which is true of most examples of relationships advice, as I learned in my own rigorous, three-year analysis of the self-help movement and the \\"dating industry\\"). But there is a deeper problem here. Think about the logic that underlies this sort of methodology. If you send out questionnaires to 1000 people you know, you will probably get responses from people who think pretty much like you do. So there's a circular aspect to the whole thing. But even that's not the real problem. Send out questionnaires to 1000 people going to college, and you'll get responses from college people; they are not valid for people as a whole, and you might get entirely different responses from 1000 high-school dropouts. So Feldhahn's sample may be flawed. But even that's not the real, root problem with gender-typing efforts like Gray's and Feldhahn's, which is this: The fact that people \\"are\\" a certain way doesn't mean that they *have* to be that way, or that whatever way they are is (necessarily) biologically programmed. For example, if you had asked women prior to the 1960s about the most important things in life, you would've gotten such responses as \\"family,\\" \\"children,\\" \\"keeping a proper house,\\" etc. Today you might get entirely different responses. Is it because the genetic makeup of women has change? No. It is because the socialization of women has changed. Clearly, then, the way women once felt about family and personal priorities was not as much a part of women's genetic makeup as we thought. Similarly, the way men converse among each other, and relate to women, may not be indicative of anything genetic about men, but rather testifies to the gender-typing manner in which men are raised, and learn to relate to each other and women. Indeed, I know many men who--deep inside themselves--are nothing like the types of men Feldhahn sketches in her book, and really don't want women to relate to them in stereotypical fashion. If the men in Feldhahn's sample all \\"feel a certain way\\" about something, it may simply mean that they've been taught to feel that way, and that they've reinforced each other's feelings over time.My most serious complaint about all such books, however, is that they reinforce this notion of an irresolvable gulf that forever separates men and women, utterly confounding even our most earnest attempts to communicate with one another. Maybe, instead of doing that, we should all work at evolving toward a common ground, and a set of shared thoughts and values; I'm sure they're there, albeit too often buried beneath layers of surface characteristics--and misunderstandings like those perpetuated by Feldhahn."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"If you think you have men all figured out, think again. Regardless of what I presumed to know about my husband, this book brought to light the almost universal traits in men that women today so often consider insignificant, wrong, or just plain stupid. Shaunti Feldhahn does a fantastic job of reminding women that the way men think happens to be the way 51% of the population thinks, and perhaps that is worth respecting.Our society has done a great job of trying to feminize men instead of taking a good look at how men are designed to be, respecting that, and learning how to best help our men be the best men they can be.Before assuming that your husband falls into every majority category in the book, I recommend asking your husband the questions she asks in the study - I was surprised to find that often, my husband did not fit with the majority but understood why many men answer the way they did. The book is especially helpful as a jumping off point for discussion with your husband about the way he interprets your actions and words."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"As as woman, I can tell you that this book is a bunch of garbage. If you want to learn how to subject to your husband, and be an obedient wife, and do everything to please your husband, and spend your whole life adjusting yourself and your needs, and your personality and your heart, and dreams to HIM, then follow Feldhahn's suggestions. On the other hand, please get \\"The Second Sex\\"by Simone de Beauvoir, which I haven't read yet, by I know what it's about.Men have \\"created\\" an image of women and what women should be like. It's all'biology' according to Feldhahn. She believes that one way to keep a man happy is to give him lots of sex? She talks nothing about men respecting a woman for her mind, and not just 'sex' and 'appreciation'.If all men are like Feldhahn presents them, then we can conclude that men are idiotic, proud, spoiled, childish, selfish, egoistical, self-centered, animal-like beings and women should walk on egg-shells around them, and treat them like they're the center of the world.If this is true, then I would rather live on island by myself ...."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"The title sounds good. Who could not want to understand their spouse and how they think? However, there are more than just a few problems with this book. First of all, if the author was just presenting the facts from her survey--that would be one thing, but she decides that she needs to tell every woman what they need to do. Hey, one-size-fits-all counseling advice by a completely unqualified person. She writes christian fiction for heaven's sake! What makes her qualified to tell anyone what they need to do? I've been married a lot longer than she has--I'm sure I could write a better advice book than this.What is even worse, is that much of her advice could be very destructive for some women in bad relationships. She assumes women are going to be able to discern that for themselves. Well, it isn't that simple. In addition to that, she plugs her fiction book in nearly every chapter of this amateur advice guide.Christians tend to be more trusting of everyone who sets themselves up in a position of authority. BEWARE. Lots of these books seem like they are written just for the money. I don't say that that is the purpose of these books-BUT if you are thinking about reading this book, I would only recommend it if you and your husband already have a good relationship and you just want to do minor improvements. Some of the insights could be helpful, but some of the advice here is way off base and tends to treat women and men as a stereotypes."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I was extremely disappointed and caught very off guard by this book. I completed this book with a women's group and couldn't believe the point of view. I felt like the book expected and told women that they should be \\"June Cleaver\\". Very disappointed in the message that women should have no say so in anything and just fall to the feet of their man. Also, I did not understand how this book's message was in any way the message given in the bible as to what a wife should strive to be."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"First off, this book was given to me as a gift. I wish now that I had never cracked the cover. I do have to admit that some of the book is helpful...the part about how your guy wants to be respected and how he needs words of affirmation often...yep, that was helpful, but unless you just really really want to know the things that men think I would not read this book. If you are in a happy relationship and you know without a shadow of a doubt in your heart that your guy loves you, then I see no reason for you to read this book. When I read the chapter about how guys picture most attractive women naked and undresses them with their eyes I thought I would just die. When I asked my guy about it and he assured me that yes, this is in fact what men do, I tormented myself for a good week disgusted that my guy is doing stuff like that. Before I go on let me say that I am in my 20's and I am a size 2....so it's not like I am overweight and don't take care of myself (I'm at the gym every night). Before I learned about this disturbing behavior I felt confident with myself, I completely trusted the behavior of my guy, and I felt like I was the \\"one and only\\" in my guys eyes. To know that he is undressing girls in his head has really cut my confidence by about 50%. So girls....unless you just really want to dig in deep and learn about what your guy really thinks, I would just stick to the idea that \\"ignorance is bliss\\" and don't read this book.

I thought that if I could better understand my husband, that I could make a few changes of my own in order to fix the marriage.I have to admit that there were several items in the book that I didn't know about men in general. We all know the saying that men are visual - but this book explains what that means in easy to understand terms.Not only does the book delve deep into the male psyche, it also gives you understandable ideas to nurture the man in your life by treating him like a man needs to be treated.After reading the book, I feel that I have a better understanding of the men in my life (husband, brothers, father, etc.) By applying some of the ideas and making my own changes (note - not changing my husband) I feel that my marriage is stronger than ever.While this book comes from a Christian perspective, it isn't so saturated with it that it offends non-Christians.

I've read a couple of the other books in Feldhahn's series (For Parents Only, For Young Men Only), and even though I knew how good they were, I have to say I was shocked at how amazing this book was. Feldhahn did several surveys to get men to talk about what really matters to them and what their deepest feelings are about sex and what they want out of marriage. Respect is apparently number one, more than love, in what men require from their wives. Reading through what hurts men's feelings and how women can sabotage their self-esteem made me slouch down in my chair a bit as I realized that I have been guilty of many bad behaviors. Feldhahn treats men with deep respect, never playing to the stereotypes of sports-obsessed or couch potato, and she encourages women to respect their husbands more by understanding what makes them tick. I have to admit there were a few times that my jaw dropped (ahem, chapter six), and I'm working on making some things better (chapter eight). Feldhahn offers real advice that you can follow and writes in a chatty, easy-going manner.

I can think of a few women who'd benefit from it (church ladies?), but most of the things on this book are common sense to a well educated wordly woman. I also found Shaunti Feldhahn's way of writing very anoying...at the beggining of the book, it feels like she goes on and on about respect forever. I get it, respect the man, there's no need to say it 30 times with different words.It was definitly a waste of money."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Every evangelical Christian book I've read about relationships/men and women keeps harping on the same oldsterotypes.The sterotypes are as follows:men want respect,women want lovemen are visual,women are emotionalmen hide their feelings,women express every feelingmen care about the appearance of their spouse,women care aboutbeing provided forI don't know what kind of men she interviewed but she must haveinterviewed men too dense to realize they were acting outsocial constraits believing they are \\"hardwired\\".What bothersme the most is the chapter where she says men can't help looking at a pretty body.Hello!! Women look at men's bodies too!I don't believe these right winged fools will ever write adecent book about relationships,since they want to keep peoplein endless circles of status quo thinking to suit their ownpurposes.I'm glad I'm a different relgion now.Too many Christians are caught up in sterotypical thinking and it hurtsrelationships."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This was an eye opening book and a must read for all woman!The one glaring thing I got from this book, is that respect is key!

A person needs to read both For Men Only and For Women only to understand the truthful nature of the content. As a man reading this book, I could relate to each survey and fit myself into at least one of the categories discussed. This is very revealing of the inner thoughts of men, and accurate.Early in my marriage, a chasm occurred between my wife and I when I brought home problems from the office and discussed them with her, looking for her counsel. I would ultimately get mad at her and not the problem because of the way she looked at the problem. I ultimately stopped discussing these problems with her since I wasn't finding the answers I needed. This book explains to me what went wrong in that conversation in which I came away mad. I wish I had the book then so that I could understand how she was looking at the problem.This is a great read regardless of how long you have been married."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"first, allow me to qualify myself: im a guy. now, before you put me on \\"the list\\", i was interested in reading both of her books, just to improve my ability to relate should i ever find that \\"perfect girl\\". ok... enough with the mushyness.i partly wanted to read this for the above reason, but also to see if the author knew what she was talking about, and also to learn about myself (perhaps being better able to put words to how i feel).im only on page 32, but she is so right on for everything!!! i was almost laughing because it was like i was hearing someone describe how i like to drive somewhere without necessarily knowing how to get there. i call it \\"feeling it out\\"! other people might calling it driving in circles until you happen to stumble on the right road that will take you where you are going.the thing that struck me... is that while girls/women might really learn this so they can better relate to their guy, i have a hard time believing she is going to be able to know these things the way a guy \\"knows\\" them. it is like having my instincts described back to me, but will an \\"outsider\\" (a woman) be able to learn these things beyond merely etching facts onto her mind? i appreciate that she is willing to try for the sake of the relationship, and would definitely commend the effort, but just take into consideration the fact that while you (a woman), may be able to learn these things about a man... it's quite another thing to be able to empathize and/or IDENTIFY with these things. do you know what i mean? like a blind person trying to listen to someone tell them what it is like to be able to see, or for a deaf person trying to read what it is like to be able hear. I would highly applaud the author for \\"writing\\" such an accurate and true description, but for all the \\"deaf\\" women out there... just keep reading and keep trying to understand! (if you understand my analogy).but keep trying! the more you even try, the more we (guys) will appreciate it.(i guess this warning of sorts to keep in mind goes for guys in trying to understand women. haven't checked out the other book yet, but i imagine the author would be just as good conveying to us what they are like!)[EDIT] One thing i wish the author would attempt to convey beyond the fact that our \\"feeling\\" competent is important to us... the enormous importance it has for us. just how important is it that i feel competent/adequate, etc? HIGHLY. INTENSELY. CHIEFLY. get the picture?! maybe if a woman understands HOW important it is to us, perhaps they will be better able to support him and allow him the opportunity to rise to the occasion, even allowing the risk of failure. i guess we as men need to know that sometimes we will need to set that need aside in order to allow place for another priority... whatever it is we stand to lose by conceding that we don't know how to do it, and get the help we need so that that particular problem can be resolved... whatever it is.[EDIT 2] I'm now on p. 72... and all i can say is that this woman KNOWS WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT!!!![EDIT 3] I have since finished it... and all i can say is: if you want to know what men think and feel, this is the book. It also feels good to know I'm normal! Additionally it was nice (for lack of a better word) hearing my thoughts and feelings put into words, when i might not be able to articulate them to myself, whether internally or to someone else, let alone to a girl.

If you can act to these pointers, your relationship will be in much better shapes!200 pages of small book will enlight your sense of understanding about men, i belive that at least you will learn about 50% of what you don't know, and you can act better should you know about it.If you are a woman, GET THIS BOOK, and you will higly rewarded, regardless of your status (married, single, divorced!) this book will be of great impartance to your next or current relationship."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Even after 35 years of message, I don't think I could say that I understand my husband...until now.

I wanted a guide to not only better understand the amazing person I am with, but more importantly to get some guidance on how to deal with man vs. woman issues, which this book does not offer for non-Christains.

Shaunti Feldham even refers to Emerson Eggerichs by name and uses words directly from his book and his website. Why write a book and have half of your book have quotes from another author's book? Shaunti Feldham said that she did a lot of research and surveys, however most of the book seems to be other authors ideas, articles, and quotes."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"The main reason why I read this book was to see what conclusions it had and whether i'd get anything out of it. Frankly, I didn't. What annoyed me the most, was the way the data was represented. The research was frankly pretty bad. I know she's not a psychologist, relationship therapist, etc but come on! What made me laugh was when she said that at one section she surveyed 10 MEN! Seriously? Also, I couldn't help but think that the data was heavily manipulated and very biased. There wasn't even a lot of cross - referencing to substantiate her claims.The chapter on romance made actually made my blood boil when talking about sex and romance. One man supposedly said that romance should always lead to sex, and it's only because of social and moral restraints that it doesn't happpen. Wait a minute! Do you mean consensual sex or rape? That just infuriated me.Surprisingly, I did kind of get the chapter on looks. However, what I did find surprising was the amount of men who admit to full - on fantasising about another whoman. Sorry, I just don't get it.Throughout the whole book, what really annoyed me was the chapters constanly barraged women about what to do and what not to do, then at the end of the chapter, saying things like \\"we don't want to put more pressure on women\\" (I don't think the quote's exactly right, sorry). Mind you, this was AFTER they constantly barraged women with constant criticism about everything women are doing wrong to their husbands. And, referring to another review, I agree that the \\"groundbreaking research\\" comment on the back of the book was a serious overstatement."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men by Shaunti Feldhahn: This book gives many honest answers from different men in various surveys asking about respect, romance, sex, career and many other various topics. Although the author includes many surveys that show what men want, it doesn't go in detail on the age group, cultural backgrounds or religious backgrounds of these men. To say that most men think a certain way based on a general survey was not very persuasive to me. Even though the topics of the books were very interesting, each chapter was very short and the author failed to go deeper in depth into things that I wanted to learn more. Overall, I didn't find this book enjoyable. I didn't learn anything new about men that I don't already know. However, it served as a reminder of things that I should be aware more on a daily basis."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I highly recommend that all women, married or not, read chapter 2, \\"Your Love is Not Enough, Why Your Respect Means More to Him Than Even Your Affection\\" I now give these books as wedding presents."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know About the Inner Lives of Men, by Shaunti Feldhahn, is a must read for any wife, wife-to-be, girlfriend, or girlfriend-to-be. Basically, every female should read this book.Why, you ask? Well, let me back up, and tell you of when I first read this book, and why I jumped at the chance to review it.My first reading of this book was several years ago, when it was first published. My mother had lent me her copy. With, at the time, 9 years of marriage and 3 children under by belt, along with a college degree in social studies and a minor in sociology, I thought I had a basic understanding of my husband. After reading this book I realized calling it \\"basic\\" was an understatement. I had barely scratched the surface to my man.After reading it I gained a whole new perspective, and appreciation for who my husband is, as a man. I was also charged with useful information in helping us raise our two sons. The conversations Hubby and I had, thanks to this book, also opened his eyes to how women think.From the beginning of the book Feldhahn outlines the origination of this book, the surveys (professional and informal) completed to compile the data used for this book, and informs the reader that this book is not about male bashing. The information given in this book is based on evidence, compiled through two professional surveys, where 400 anonymous men, for each survey, were asked 2 dozen questions. A more informal survey, of another 400 men, was conducted, between the 2 formal surveys. All that to say, yes this book does know what it is talking about. And, Feldhahn delivers the information on a personal level, as if you were talking to a girlfriend.Since this book was first published in 2004 it has grown into the 'Only' Series. This includes, For Men Only, For Young Women Only, For Young Men Only, For Parent's Only (BTW, my next read). Discussion guides, Bible studies, a website and message boards have also joined this growing series. Now, I haven't read any of the other books; however, if its predecessor is any indication, they are all worth a read by those who fall into the book's respective categories.Interested, but not fully committed yet to read this book, then click over to Multnomah's website, where you can download, for free, the first chapter of this book. I would guarantee that after reading the first chapter you will be drawn in, and want to read the rest.***In compliance with Federal Trade Commission regulations: WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group gave me a free copy of For Women Only for this review."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Ever wanted to know your husband more?To understand where he's coming from?Then I believe this book might be for YOU!This book gives insight to women. An insight woman don't naturally have.As I read the book, I shared what I was learning with my husband. His reactions ranged from \\"I don't think I have that issue\\" to \\"You didn't know that?\\"It provided a foundation of understanding for temptations my husband faces,and feelings he doesn't know how to share. It is a generalization, of course, but what a great tool to open communication and find out where your husband is in these areas.I learned so much more about my husband by reading the book and talking with him about it. However, I wish more scripture would have been used.I defiantly would give a thumbs up for a great tool!This book was provided by Waterbrook Multnomah Puplishing.

Whether dating, engaged, or married, it will open your eyes to the reasons of why men do some things that they do. I would have to say that you must read this book with an open and loving heart, not to find something to start an argument with him on.

It was a fairly short book. I recently read Love & Respect by Dr. Emerson Eggerichs, and the two books share the same topic - Respecting our husbands.I really recommend this book for women before they are married. I think so many marriages are struggling because we women fail to respect our husbands and they fail to show their love. In Ephesians we are commanded to have love and respect in our marriage.Although I find it hard to say the words \\"I respect you\\" to my husband, I try to find ways to show it.

I found myself having quite a few \\"DUH!\\" moments. My husband and I have a very good relationship, but like anyone else, there are always things that can be improved. This book helped to remind me that I need to think about how my husband is going to react to a statement vs. my opinion of it. I catch myself doing some of the no-no's, but quickly turn it around and make something positive out of it or simply apologize. I would recommend this book, even if you think you have the BEST relationship!I got this book for free as part of a book review program, check it out!

This is a fascinating book, one that helped me to better understand the male species. It's not terribly long, less than 200 pages, and is very readable. Shaunti Feldhahn's writing style is informal and engaging. And her subject matter is indeed important. Men and women are very different. That seems obvious, but I didn't realize how very different we are until I was married. We think on entirely different levels. A word or action can be interpreted very differently by one gender than it was intended.Used in conjunction with books like Love and Respect by Emerson Eggerichs, this book really helps to explain why men think the way they do - and how we as women should respond. Their behavior and actions may often seem a mystery to us - until we look into their inner lives and see why they do what they do.I can't wait to read the companion volume to this, For Men Only. :)Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the Multnomah Press book review bloggers program.

I will be getting the version for men to read."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I loved this book!

I realize I wasn't really supposed to read this one but after reading the Men Only version and thinking how great it was I couldn't help but wonder how good the Women Only book was. Guys, all I can say is if you want help and to be more understood by your wife I highly recommend you purchase this book for your wife and For Men Only for yourself. They are both so accurate and insightful that I only wish I had read them sooner. The authors truly did their homework and really do a great job in laying out examples in daily life how the situations are bad at times and how they can be made better. They are both quick reads, quick enough that I read them both in one afternoon so it's not going to take a long time to do it. If you prefer, soak in a chapter or two at a time and discuss them with your spouse if you want and even then you could do it in a week. These books are truly every bit as good as the reviewers here on Amazon said, I'm glad I went ahead and got them. Ladies, all I can say is the author got it right with this one so if you want to better understand your husband this is a great starting point. All couples could benefit from these books regardless of whether you're just starting out or have been married for years, ironically, those of us married for more than a few years are the most surprised we didn't know this stuff yet or have figured it out. This was truly an eye opening experience and I know it can help any couple looking to better their relationship."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This is not a book about someone's opinions and personal observations about the opposite sex, though she does use her own experiences to illustrate points. Her insights are based on legitimate survey techniques, and through percentages, gives you an idea of what MOST men think, feel and need. And how they perceive love and acceptance from their woman. This book came about as a consequence of research for writing a fictional story, and what a learning experience it was! This book and her other book written for men to learn about women is life-changing, and will make you understand, finally, why men act the way they do, and put to rest some anxiety that comes from lack of that understanding. A must-have!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I was introduced to this book at a Weekend to Remember conference. It sounded very interesting so I figured that I would purchase this one for me and the For Men Only book for my husband. I'm still in the process of reading it but I have to say that from what I read already, I am starting to see how the things that I say can be misinterpreted by my husband. So this book has caused me to really think about what I say and how I react to that communication between my husband and myself can be better. I would recommend this book to every couple that really wants to make their communication better and in the end connect more as a couple and have the type of marriage that God intended us to achieve."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I loved this book It has great insight into men and was very helpful in the beginning of my marriage!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Every year my husband and I attend a marriage conference from Family Life to help us to focus on any new issues that have arisen in the last year that we need to tend to away from distractions. As an avid reader, I am extremely guilty of breaking the bank at the resource center each year. Three years ago, my HUSBAND was the one who snagged this book and it's partner \\"For Men Only. I was truly shocked that he had chosen some books (first time ever I think). That spurred me on to read it as soon as the conference was over.Needless to say, I had heard many of the subjects on a surface level in the conferences, and in many other books I have read over time, however this book digs so much deeper. I couldn't put this book down, but when the kids went to bed, would review certain areas that I just couldn't believe with my husband. What an eye-opener! I don't think it matters if you are a Christian or not, but I think that this book will definitely give you a better understanding of your husband or fiance.I bought the cd version as well, so I could listen to it at work. The guys in my group laughed the first time I put 5 copies on my desk. So many co-workers have borrowed them and passed on the word (we're talking 30-40 women, and that's not counting the women who just bought the book because they couldn't get it away from another co-worker). The guys didn't laugh when the cd's hardly ever came back for more than a few hours. Women are desperate to understand their loved one and you don't find this information in the media. I didn't always agree with her suggestions, as they do not fit into our family life all of the time, but t's an insightful study.Good luck and I hope it helps you to understand your husband or fiance better. My husband and I are pretty open and communicate well...most of the time. This just opened up our communication even more so. :D"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I really appreciate that this book is not a woman or a man's perceived differences between the sexes.

It is insightful and will help you get a glimpse into your man and how he processes the things you say and do."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"In her book \\"for women only\\" Shaunti Feldhahn does an excellent job of waking women up to what they don't know about men. Moreover, she presents the information so that all women can feel like the lightbulb just went on overhead. I've read a number of books on improving your relationship with your husband, but this is the first book that spells it out in practical terms that you can easily understand and apply.I particularlly liked her chapter on respect. It was helpful to realize that for your husband to feel respected it isn't always about showing respect, sometimes we need to remember to not show disrespect.Shaunti Feldhahn begins each chapter by detailing her findings via the surveys that she created. Then she explains what those finding mean using stories from the interviews she conducted. Finally she spells out what it means in practical terms for our relationships with the men in our lives.I highly recommend reading this book. I guarantee you wont be disappointed. The last chapter in particular will touch your heart. Also, if you would like to discuss my review please visit my blog http://oncesoldtales.blogspot.com/"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I wish someone had given me this book to read several years ago. This book really cuts through the fat... I have gotten a deeper understanding of men from this book and so have developed a new perspective on how to love and respect my husband... and all of the men in my life (brother, father, etc...). I've given this book as a gift to my married and single girlfriends!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"One book of three books I wish my own wife would read and listen to the advice of For Women Only, Dr Laura's Proper Care And Feeding, and Paul & Sandy Coughlin's Married But Not Engaged"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I think this book should be a reading requirement before marriage. It helped me understand SO many things. I think it can make any wife a better wife, and any marriage better. Please read!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"It was very inlighting. Shaunti doesn't beat around the bush in her writting.She''s done her homeworok and gives you straight facts."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"In regard to all of the so-called \\"hard wiring\\" of selfish impulses that Shaunti tries to pass of as unavoidable, I would like to refer to them as conditioned behaviors. Despite the inherent \\"datedness\\" of Beauvoir's work (come on, it was published in 1949!), there could be an interesting dialogue about how women choose to resign themselves to passive roles and capitulation between the two books. If you want to find a reason to play into all of the broad societal expectations about your personal appearance, your sexual boundaries, and general steps to becoming a Stepford wife, then this is your book!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"We are reading this book and it's companion for men in a church small group. I have also read Dr. Laura's book which I think it so much better. This book really on scratches the surface and my husband is reading it too and keeps saying she misses a lot of key points in some of her chapters. The one thing that bothers me about ALL books like this is they fail to address some pretty important issues that can affect part of marriage, albeit temporarily most of the time. For instance, being pregnant. The sex chapter talks about how your husband wants you to want him, ok, I get that and 90% of the time I can do that, but when you are pregnant there are so many other issues involved and I think there needs to be more attention paid to that. I think husbands need to be much more understanding and realize that her lack of desire has absolutely nothing to do with you, she still loves you and actually still wants to have sex, but feeling sick and self concious just take over and you just have to deal with it. It just seems like these books go into great detail about what the man needs physically and how a woman holds all the power, but they fail to address issues that affect couples all the time, issues that can impact sex and other parts of marriage for more than just a short while. Otherwise husbands end up hurt or belittled when in reality their wife wants nothing more than to WANT to want sex, but her body is just going through some tough things and she needs a little time."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"My husband and I got a good laugh out of this. So, it helped my marriage in that way. To read why it's such an awful book, give the other one star reviews a read. I wish I had before I bought it."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"\\"For Women Only\\" is intended for (Christian) women who are interested in gaining a better understanding of men so that they can better appreciate and support their husband in the way that he needs. Feldhahn offers seven \\"revelations\\": things men wish women knew but don't know how to explain. She came upon these revelations through surveying hundreds of men from many walks of life.The first chapter lists six ground rules for reading the book: it contains no male bashing, it deals only with how women relate to men (\\"For Men Only\\" deals with how men relate to women), there are exceptions to every rule and no man is expected to fit perfectly into any category, the book addresses what a normal man is--not what he \\"should\\" be, some of the information in the book might be distressing to your current views of how men think, and this book is supposed to change and improve women--not men. Judging from many of the negative reviews on this site, many people seem to skim over or forget these rules.Feldhahn's seven revelations are: men crave respect and love, men are in constant competition with themselves and the world and are often worried they don't measure up, men are burdened by their need to provide but also like to be depended upon because providing is a way to show love, sex fulfills an emotional need for men, men notice beautiful women, men want romance but they define it differently than women, and men want their wives to care about their appearance.The book is a very easy and quick read, but it is repetitive and slim. It contains a few too many Christian references for my taste. There is a discussion guide available for purchase, and a website for further information (I haven't looked at either). The practical advice is weak, but that's ok because the revelations inspired me to create my own solutions.I read \\"For Women Only\\" in an evening and then had about an hours' discussion with my husband. It was enlightening and enjoyable for us both, but it is not something that I would take too seriously and not something I would give as a gift."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This is a great book. I bought it for my wife after reading the companion, \\"For Men Only\\". Both are great, common-sense books that include simple steps for understanding and improving your relationship with your spouse or significant other."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I think this book is a must-read by any Christian married woman. It really makes you think about your man and how he thinks. I was surprised at some of the negative reviews of this book, but I will warn you that you will probably be convicted when reading this book. It has really changed the way I view some of my husbands actions and how I communicate with him. In just a few days, I'm seeing a change (a good change) in our marriage, especially with communication. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I read this book as a man because I heard so much about it and was interested in giving it to my daughter who is getting married in June. I thought it might be helpful at the very beginning of their life together to know what her man would most likely never tell her. However, I wanted to read it first because of some of the reviews that seemed to be negative. I must say, it was most affirming to realize that other men responded in the manner I would have to the survey. I had a friend of mine look it over as well and he felt the same way. I don't think this in anyway harkens back to the 50's at all. In fact, no one in the 50's would have ever discussed this kind of thing and men and women in the 50's don't have near the negative influences upon their lives as they do now. To say that, in my opinion, is a negative reaction to the truth they don't want to admit. Fact...men are different than women...period. And when women realize this and quit trying to understand us men as women and attempt to relate to us in a manner that will be productive the more powerful and positive their marriages will be. In fact, the conclusions Shaunti comes to are quite biblical. Read Ephesians 5:22 and following. Women are to give their husbands unconditional respect just as they expect to receive unconditional love from their husbands. But in our generation, even Christian women have been duped into believing the feminist dogma. I wholeheartedly recommend that this book be read by every Christian woman with an open and honest heart and mind. It will make all the difference in the world for their marriages."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I found this book to be wonderfully educational and helpful to my understanding of my husband. Sexual unknowns about men used to frighten me; now I have a deeper knowledge about what makes them tick. It is helpful in knowing how to love the man in your life. I am giving these books as gifts to friends this holiday season!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book is very easy to read - I read this entire book on a 3 hour flight. The information and quotes are broken out into the top ten things that many men wish they could say to women, but either don't dare or don't know how. It inspired some \\"aha!\\" explanations about why the men in my life behave the way they do. I quickly recommended it to my women friends and relatives.Keep in mind that this book is the result of a survey and not an absolute on male behavior. As with any survey or statistic, avoid assuming that \\"majority\\" means \\"everyone\\".Also, I wouldn't recommend this book if you are struggling with past hurts or abuse. Because if you are hurting from abusive relationships, some of the content may trigger your hurt and anger, not answer the \\"why\\" for unhealthy behaviors. If you are trying to understand how to have healthier relationships with men, you may benefit better from one of the \\"Boundries\\" books by Dr. Henry Cloud.However, if you are looking for something easy to read with a little more information on the men you love, you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I found this book because I wanted to understand my boyfriend better due to my lack of relationship experience. We've been together about 2 years and he's very open with me about many things. I wasn't surprised about a number of things in the book because my boyfriend talked to me about them. The other topics covered in the book, like how men see romance and sex where a real eye opener. I would recommend this book to any of my girl-friends. I feel that it's changed my relationship for the better.Thank you Shaunti Feldhahn and the countless people who assisted you in putting this book together."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Both books were interesting. But scanning the reviews for both books today was more illuminating.\\"For Men Only\\" - helping men figure out their fairer partner - has garnered about 90 comments so far. The few negative reviews were from two apparently unhappily-married guys, and a woman suggesting if you didn't already know what women wanted you were clueless. The rest, often by women (my best guess here, given the pronouns and screen names used by reviewers), offered glowing commentary of how important it is to understand and meet a woman's needs. Ah, the importance of patience, kindness, listening. My favorites were the ones in all capitals and exclamation points. Yes, yes, YES, YES!!!Now scan the \\"For Women Only\\" comments - all 212 of them to date. So far there are 29 negative reviews (including 16 \\"1 star\\" votes) about a book on how ladies can better love their men. There were a few unhappy guys, some complaining the book wasn't \\"biblical\\" enough, but the bulk are from ladies insulted (!) by the idea of compromising their feminine selves for some man.The ladies offered such loving things as:\\"Unfortunately, this book is only going to help you if you're a fat nagging religious close minded wife who's let herself go.\\"\\"The entire book was about stroking a man's ego at the expense of anything the woman may want.\\"\\"This book is full of generalizations and stereotypes that should have gone out of fashion at the same time as beehive hairdos.\\"\\"If you want to find a reason to play into all of the broad societal expectations about your personal appearance, your sexual boundaries, and general steps to becoming a Stepford wife, then this is your book!\\"Or my favorite: \\"There is an underlying \\"good\\" here that is twisted in a package that will be ultimately damaging to our children and to ourselves. Yes, we must be careful of our spouse's emotional, physical, sexual, and relational needs. But we must do this out of love and respect that is guided by a sense of mutuality in the marriage relationship, not by catering to an unhealthy sense of self-worth that is so pervasive in the responses of Feldhahn's participants. Feldhahn has taken these unhealthy responses and twisted them into normal \\"healthy\\" responses that women must then take care of through their behavior and appearance. We should not buy into this myth. Rather, we should take seriously the feelings of low self-esteem, poor attachment, and an un-Biblical view of the role of women in a marriage relationship that were demonstrated by the participant's responses and work to improve the messages we are sending the men in our society.\\"Obviously a graduate of Women's Studies at Wellesley College.Now, don't get me wrong. The large majority of both men and women who read these two books found them helpful in understanding the opposite sex a little better. Most couples also found them to be good conversation-starters, important for any relationship. Having scanned both I also thought there was plenty of useful info in each.It's hard, though, to miss all of the gracious thoughts liberally applied to \\"his book about her,\\" compared to what seems like a sort of begrudging admission in the other that, well, men like being loved too, as long as it meets faminine approval.Speaking of usefulness, perhaps the person these books helped the most was a former boyfriend of a Ms. Rhonda Pyle of Corpus, TX:\\"My boyfriend gave me this book in hopes that I would read it and think that what it was saying was insightful and profound. He thought it could help make me into the woman he wanted me to be. I just want to say to the women that are considering buying this book: I broke up with my boyfriend of two years - who I was going to marry - shortly after he gave me this unhelpful, uninspired piece of material. I was glad though; it revealed to me the kind of man he was. I don't think this helped me understand men more; it just made excuses for them. I remember thinking how often it excused men's insecurities and how women should just be OK with this obvious fault. I'm a Christian woman, but I don't believe that women have to be pushovers for men in order to be a righteous woman in their marriages...\\"Wherever you are, bro, count your blessings. Thanks to this little book you dodged a bullet.Perhaps Ms. Rhonda's unwittingly found the most important reason to buy Shaunti's stuff: Give a copy to your (prospective) mate and see what happens. If it gets devoured and put into action, you're a lucky guy/gal. If it remains un-opened on the nightstand or ends up in the garbage disposal, perhaps you should reconsider your options..."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I really looked forward to reading this book, but was very disappointed. First of all, it really irked me that the assumption was made that Christian men make great husbands. In my 45 years of life experience, that has not been the case. I am not a feminist, but a traditional stay at home wife. I have found Christian men to often be hard task masters in marriage.Anyway, each chapter of the book is devoted to a particular fact(?) about men. If you can stand it, here they are:1. Men need our respect-I agree with this except for the fact that the author says that respect and love are the same thing and should be given unconditionally. I completely disagree. Respect IS given just by virtue of marriage or parenthood, but must be maintained. If my husband is chronically unemployed, going out drinking and driving drunk, etc. he will lose his family's respect. Wanted to be respected in our eyes is what keeps him on the right track.2. Men act confident, but deep down they are scared and unsure and afraid of being found out. Our job? Affirm them and give them a safe haven to go to at home. Good advice, but no one can be affirmed all the time. Men will have to accept constructive criticism at times or know that they did something wrong. They are not children.3. Men want to be the providers for the family and worry about not being able to pull this off. I agree, but I know lots of men who are very content to send their wives off to work so that they can afford to buy lots of expensive things. I also know men who are lazy and unmotivated and are happy to have their wives be the bread winner so they don't have to worry about it.4. Sex. Men want lots of sex. Again, I agree, but the men in the book were almost whining over it. Part of maturing as a man is maturing in your sex life too. The kids come along and are demanding (babies up all night, sick kids up all night--ring a bell?) There is sickness and/or death in the family, etc. etc. Men say they can have sex easily without love and enjoy it, but yet the book says that sex is how the men feel love. Yikes! Which is it? Married couples should have a sex, but a woman should never have sex when she doesn't want to. The example in the book? You just got back from the funeral of a loved one and your husband wants to have sex. You don't, but do it anyway. Again, yikes!5. The old \\"men are visual\\" excuse for oogling women. Men are socialized from a young age to look at women and picture them naked or having sex with them. I agree, but there is a such thing as self control. I know the surveys were supposedly scientific, but I doubt that sexual images just pop into the normal man's mind (even from back in his teens!), so he just can't help it. There is only one thing to do. Look away and look away quickly. Keep your mind busy. Men think about sex all day every day. Not true. I think that is demeaning to men.6. Your partner really does want romance. He doesn't do it because he feels insecure that you'll criticize him for doing it wrong. Oh brother. He also equates sex with romance. If he does plan a romantic evening for you, it had better end in sex or it was a waste of time. Half of the men want there wives to \\"play\\" with them--hiking, golfing etc. Duh, some women aren't into that and most men know that before they get married.7. My personal favorite. Your husband wants you to look good. This I can see. No man wants to come home every day to find his wife unshowered and wearing baggy sweats. Wear some decent clothes and put on some make up. Good advice. We like our men to be well groomed also. The problem? These shallow men also want to see their wives dieting and exercising because, if she doesn't, it is a bad reflection on how she feels about THEM. (Narcissism?!!) The author's husband was upset that his wife ate a chocolate donut for breakfast each day because he wanted her to be thin. (and by the way, she wasn't obese either) It was said that men are competitive and want to have the hottest wife to show off. I think that is true, but at some point, ya just have to grow up.I wanted to learn something from this book and all I came away from it thinking was how these men sounded like shallow, mama's boys. I know my husband is not perfect (and neither am I), but he seems so much more open to looking within himself and trying to be a better person instead of saying to me \\"This is how I am, I'm not changing, just pamper me and worship me.\\" He may not be a fundamentalist Christian, but he is worlds ahead of the guys surveyed. For THAT, I greatly admire and respect him."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This has been a very interesting read. I purchased it because I just started dating again after 27 years of marriage and the death of my hubby. I have 3 boys and lots of men in my life and never knew some of the things I learned here! I suggest this for all women."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I am a man and just finished reading this book which I found lying around the house somewhere. I was very skeptical and interested to see if a woman could actually portray a man's inner workings accuratly. To my suprise she hit the nail right on the head! I even learned a thing or too about myself, mainly just the reasons of why some of the things women did irritated the living daylights out of me!! That being said I started reading some of the reviews on amazon and found most were positive and helpful. However when I started to read the negative one-star, two-star, or even the negative comments in 3 to 5 star reviews, I noticed a major simmularity. Here it is...the negative comments were people ranting on about the shortcommings of men or women in general. They became upset by what they read because what they were reading was true! They were dissapointed to find out how men really thought or acted (or what hurts him inside etc.) Look for yourself or take my word on these reviews, I literally laughed out loud at some of the things I was reading. Whatever your personal feelings about the way men actually are:DON'T TAKE IT OUT ON THE BOOK!!If you want to write a negative review, write it on the content of what is being said if you believe it to be false or untrue. Almost all of the negative reviews testify to the fact that what is said in this book is actually very accurate and true. Women who wrote these awful reviews even asked their husbands or men in their lives and got confirmation on the validity of things that were said in this book. To put it bluntly I am honestly shocked at the stupidity of people in these reviews. IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH DON'T READ THIS BOOK. On a more positve note, if you want to find out the truth about men read this book. Use the information any way you want, they are just facts and great suggestions, and if you use these suggestions you will find that men will think you are one of the coolest women on earth and they will truly believe you understand and get them. Again a book review is not for your personal problems...most people just want to find out about the book. This info is what every girl tells me she wants, if you want it, read it."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This is supposed to be a Christian book but it's applicable to men in general and not just Christian men. I, as a traditional Muslim woman, found this surprisingly insightful in terms of explaining specific Islamic commandments directed at husbands/wives. The author unwittingly explained the logic behind the Islamic stance on marital relations and the standard for public conduct.Th book covers 7 facts about men, which are outlined in the sample and thus my sharing them here, does not qualify as a spoiler review. The author goes into detail about WHY that particular fact is part of male wiring and how profoundly it affects a man.1. Men need respect and appreciation. This perfectly explains Prophet Muhammad's saying that women would make a majority in hell because they are unappreciative towards their husbands.2. Men seem to be in control but they doubt themselves and need our support. This an extension of point # 13. Men feel the need to provide and this makes them tick. This explains why the Qur'an unconditionally places the burden of \\"providing\\" upon the husband, no matter what the wife's financial standing.4. Intimacy is crucial for a man. Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) told women to make this their top priority, come what may.5. Men can't control themselves and they simply have to look at women (and later fantasize). This explains why the Qur'an commands men to lower their gaze and women to cover themselves in loose fitting clothes.6. Men want romance but they need appreciation. An extension of point #17. Married women must make an effort to stay thin and look presentable. Prophet Muhammad told women to dress up for their husbands and even told traveling husbands to give advance notice to wives, lest they turn up at home and see them in a shabby state. The Prophet also stressed on eating less and staying fit.Amazing!!!PS: I downloaded the audiobook and found the narrator's voice a tad irritating at times when it got too soothing."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I was afraid to buy this book because I wasn't sure if I wanted to really know what men thought. I bought this book for the visual chapter. A year ago I went through a divorce. It ultimately ended because I was cheated on. My husband blind sided me because, despite our problems, I trusted him to the fullest. He convinced me he wasn't like other guys who looked at other women. I never caught him looking and he never said anything sexual about the opposite sex. This may sound totally stupid, but I never thought he had sexual thoughts about other women. So you can imagine my shock when I found out he cheated on me and a few other surprises that I thought were out of his character. Now I am happily in another relationship, but my boyfriend is more open about the opposite sex. He's not disrespectful, but I'm not used to it. I have to learn to emotionally deal with this \\"new knowledge\\" that men do look at women from scratch. I find myself feeling anxieties when a beautiful woman is in his line of vision. I feel totally inferior. So I bought this book for help. It was hard to read, but a huuuuuge eye opener. If I knew then what I know now, I may not be divorced today - honestly. I bought the book for the visual chapter, but as I was reading it, I realized everything I did wrong in my previous marriage. I didn't show respect, affirmation, and sex was minimal. No wonder. But, I am with a super person now and I can use this new knowledge and become a better person and girlfriend. I am not religious and I still found this book extremely helpful. Some of the lesser reviews on here said that this book was common sense. I thought it might be too, but each chapter had so much detail that I learned a ton from it. I will be giving it to my daughter when she's of age."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"My marriage was falling apart, I left my husband and came back home to Louisiana to be closer to my family. My husband followed and began getting counseling at a local Pentecostal church. His life began to show significant change...I new he was no doing it alone, but that God had taken out his heart of stone and replaced it with a heart of flesh! I had always heard of such stories of how God transformed people and made them new, but never really thought that my husband would ever be one! He was prideful, boasting always, arrogant, rude and constantly on the edge of exploding. I was on pens and needles around him. I knew I had to save my children from a life of chaos and confusion. I have always been very close to Jesus. I guess I just couldn't see him as the great miracle worker in my own life, only in others around me. He is truly the master crafts man. Worthy of all Praise and honor! God saved my Marriage. We are now both in counseling together and we couldn't be happier. I have found that I was to blame for a number of problems in my marriage as well. God has began to open my eyes to many different areas he wants to change within me. My husband and I communicate now and always put God first in our lives no matter what! Without God in the equation...all is lost. Back to the book: I received it during one of our counseling meeting. It has been a real eye opener for me. So many things that I thought where not really important(to me), ARE IMPROTANT TO HIM(my husband). If it is important to him...it should be important to me as well. I would recommend this book to women everywhere, in all walks of life. Young and single, married and happy, married and miserable...take this book and read it.

My husband could NOT believe that I was finding this information to be new or informative because it seems like common sense to him, but I felt the same way about \\"For Men Only.\\" This will now be my standard wedding gift for newly married couples. Everyone should read this before they get married and probably daily after they get married. It explains WHY men do the things they do, what they are thinking, their motivation, etc. and it is BANG ON! It really helped our marriage.

For decades it has been virutally impossible to find relationship literature that truly equipped women to be stronger wives. This book accomplishes that. The vast majority of relationship-oriented self-help books seemed to share the goal of molding men into women as a prerequisite for experiencing a successful marriage. This approach sold a lot of books, primarily to women, but didn't work so well for marriages overall.In For Women Only, author Shaunti Feldhahn shares the truth about how most men process their world. I can verify this personally and by confirmation of my male clients who aggressively bought this book for their wives when it was released, understanding that the author had articulated precisely what they hoped their wife would know, but didn't quite grasp how to deliver the information to her.What a perfect solution!A woman completes the research and then writes a book for women to help them understand and consequently respond in wiser, more thoughtful ways to their husbands (and sons).I also recommend the companion book,For Men Only: A Straightforward Guide to the Inner Lives of WomenandLove & Respect: The Love She Most Desires; The Respect He Desperately NeedsIf you want to maximize the potential of your marriage, these three books are a must!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I got this book a year ago to better understand and encourage my husband. We have always had a very loving and close relationship. Some of the points were obvious (ie. not teasing, showing respect etc)and some were newer to me, and quite helpful (ie. the pressure to provide). I believe the writer did generalize quite a bit and needed to elaborate on the variety of differences found in men. One difficulty I had with the book was on the emphasis on a man's need to feel trusted being discussed in the same book as his 'hard wired' drive to perv at other women. Now I'm not too sure how many women would walk away from a book like this feeling like they really trust their husbands. Clearly men are complex and deserve respect in their marriages but it is a very big ask to expect women to trust them when they now know their better half is trying his very hardest to pay them attention in the presence of other women. Pretty much most of what was presented in this book I already do but it really helped over the last year to evaluate where I draw my self esteem from. I now no longer really need to take on board my husbands compliments because they mean very little to me now that I know he's thinking exactly the same things about other women. Instead I look to God for feeling good about myself, focus on my hobbies and friendships and exercise for me. Meanwhile, I show him the respect etc the book talked about (which he is really appreciating). In this sense I have found the book helpful.My concern with this book is not that the information is correct or incorrect it is that I'm not sure how much of a role a husband or a wife should play in meeting all these 'needs' of their partner. Some of the things mentioned (like appearance) are wants / preferences and not needs. Husbands and wives should not feel pressured by books to work overtime at trying to meet certain preferences. My husband and I believe that we are there to support one another but we are not what determine the other person's worth and are certainly not expected to meet each others every want. I agree with some of the other comments - the Bible is a great place to learn how to better love your husband or wife, not a pile of advice set forth from a survey on what men or women WANT. I mean, I want a ferrari but it's not my husbands responsibility to get me one is it?"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book is a must read for every woman-especially for married women out there that are wanting to be better wife. Shaunti touches sensitive topics with grace and love. I have learned new things about my husband, and as I follow suggestions from this book, my husband notices a difference."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I highly recommend this book. I have read it several times and it provides great information about men that I never knew. If you apply this knowledge, it could make your marriage the best it's ever been."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book is a must read for any women that know or are related to any men!!! I can't believe how much of a difference this book can make in any male, female relationship!!! I really feel that all women should read this, for their brothers, fathers, spouses, significant others, and male friends sake!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Okay. I've already read the Mars & Venus Books and other books that are supposed to give women insight into men. I also have a husband who has been more frankly honest with me about men's struggles then most men are. But this book still opened my eyes in ways that are just oh-so-special. But I want to warn you... don't read this book unless you truly love your husband and want to be the wife that he needs.See... this isn't a \\"how to get what you want\\" book, or even a \\"this is what you're doing wrong\\" book. Instead, it is a \\"your husband DOES love you, he is simply different from you\\" book! It's not full of to-do's but rather full of explanations... it explains WHY some of the things we say make our husbands smile and grin like they've been given the world, and WHY other things result in an angry back rapidly moving away.This book goes over the familiar territory of explaining how men need respect... but it goes one step farther and showed me why my husband thinks I don't respect him... something that's confused me for years!It talks about what we all know about how men usually want more sex, but it goes so much farther and shows why in a way that touches your heart and makes you feel so loved and special.It shows how men really ARE romantics... and if you don't think so, I dare you to read the chapter and not change your mind! Their romance is just different then ours, that's all! And when your eyes are opened to how often your husband wants to do romantic (to him) things with you, you'll be so touched... and grieved at how often you've unknowingly shoved him away at those times. But you'll also begin to see what you can do to encourage him to work on the romance that YOU like!And this is just the tip of the iceberg.Keep in mind that this book is not a guide-book... it is an EXPLANATION book. It doesn't really get too much into right and wrong behaviors or what is sin and what isn't, etc... most of us already know that, and don't need to be told again. What it DOES do is explain where men are coming from. For example... we know and they know that lust is a sin... but fighting it as a man is COMPLETELY different then fighting it as a woman! When you undersand how it is for a man, you understand how even his desire to fight it shows strong character AND love for you!One reviewer said that the author was excusing pride, and things like that. But that's now how I saw this book. Okay women... we know that to be like Jesus is to be a servant... but does that mean that it doesn't hurt when we feel like we're nothing more than everyone's slave around the house? Of course it doesn't! We are still \\"wired\\" in such a way that it is easy for us to feel this way. This book explains these sorts of things about men... how THEY are \\"wired\\". And once you understand this and begin to recognize these explanations in your own husband, then you can help and support him sooooo much better! Because then you see how little innocent comments hurt him... comments that are so easily refrained from, or re-worded. You see how little things you did when you were dating (and have since forgotten about) meant so much to him. You'll learn how to get that \\"you make me feel like a million bucks\\" grin on his face!READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"In any relationship, we have the ability to communicate rather than assume what the other is thinking. But that requires listening to the other person from their point of view. In the past I placed my views and opinions on others and thought that was the truth. This book provided me with another possibility. I enjoyed this work because it took a look at how men and women communicate and express themselves. The author's helped me to see other options. I can now support my partner and allow him to express himself freely. I no longer need to agree or disagree. I can just listen.There is another book that further enlightened me on the power of listening and how it supports relationships. It's called \\"How to Create a Magical Relationship\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane. I suggest reading these books, giving yourself new possibilities for a brilliant relationship."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"As a counselor none of the categories that Shaunti uses surprised me but she did put different words to it that were helpful. As men we do have significantly different struggles than women and she points that out well. I felt honored in this book as a man who is viewed as having a good heart and who seeks to love his wife. I think this view (which has an intentional focus and not a covering the whole spectrum focus) can lead some to feel that she isn't standing for what a woman desires in a relationship. I think she'll get to that in future books. With regards to some of the negative reviews I believe they miss out. Communication only goes so far unless one understands or is curious about some basic differences in the genders. Even with understanding it can be difficult to share accurately what truly lies at the depths of our hearts.I recommend this book to men and women and look forward to Shaunti's book on For men only about women."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"My husband and I bought the \\"For Couples Only\\" set of \\"For Women Only\\" and \\"For Men Only\\", and I wish we'd saved the money. I can't speak for his book, but mine was a total waste. Every point made in the book made me think either one of two things: 1) REALLY?! She didn't know that?! Who doesn't know that?!; or 2) I must be the worst wife ever.On point 2), it made me feel like everything I say could potentially damage my poor hubby's fragile ego. To listen to Feldhahn talk, everything I say is something that I don't realize he takes as an insult or something I think is encouraging but he takes as being patronizing. So what, am I just not supposed to talk? (Rolls eyes)My husband and I actually have a great relationship, but this book (which we bought to strengthen it) just made me feel insecure. If you still think you MUST read this book, do yourself a favor and check it out from the library."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. I thought it contained a lot of useful information, a lot of which I had never thought about before. I feel like it really did give me a peek into the lives of men that I did not have access to previously.This book is written from a Christian perspective, so you should be aware of that if you are not a Christian. However, the information is valuable, and you can easily read around those parts if they do not mesh with your beliefs.I also liked this book because it was short and to the point (you can read it in 1 1/2-2 hours) and also classy. No gross language or vulgar descriptions here.If you are interested in working on yourself to improve your marriage, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"My husband and I both feel we have an awesome marriage, and understand each other very well BUT this book was VERY eye opening for me.

This explains and uncovers a lot of that, and it has helped me even with my relationships with guy friends and family members. A lot of times, a man you're in a relationship will want you to understand him but won't even think to tell you how his brain works or doesn't even know that you don't get it! This is so helpful. So, please, if you know ANY men at all, read this book. In other words, every woman should ready this book!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Worth the read.

I got it even though it's more geared to married couples. It opened my eyes to different issues in a man's life and how I can be supportive and understanding. I liked that it incorporates God and the Bible and how we as women should respond to different issues. Great read!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I tweeted so many quotes from this book because I had to share the knowledge. I thought I knew a lot about men, but this book proved that I didn't.

Very good book!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Loved this book, and it's companion, For Men Only.

It's a book that every woman should read."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This was an excellent book. Every woman should read it, especially those about to be married. 5 stars are not enough. This book deserves at least 10."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I picked up this book thinking it would help me better understand how to relate to my husband. I did indeed gain some insights into how guys think--that's essentially what this book is--putting the data from a survey into words. But I also thought that this would come from a Christian perspective--and that was really missing in the book. What we see here is how guys think--not what God thinks about what guys should think. For example, on page 168:\\"Several men told me something like this: 'I want to be proud of my wife. Every man has this innate competition with other men, and our wives are a part of that. Every man wants other men to think that he did well.'\\"If indeed every man feels this way, then they need to look at the Bible and ask God to change their hearts--\\"Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.\\"I know I'm not being as articulate about this as I could, but the bottom line is that this is not a biblical book--and I'm frustrated that it's being presented as such."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This is not the book us women want to read, especially if you have any feminist tendencies. Even those of us that believe in a Biblical marriage may be disheartened by some of this. But you can't change biology. So read up and use to improve your marriage.Chapter 2 is very important, in fact you should read the book, Love & Respect, to understand more on this issue.Chapter 6 I wish every woman would read so some of them would start dressing modestly (this does not mean unattractively).Thanks, Shaunti, for writing it."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"If you're baffled by men then you've probably read many books on how to decode them, and you can add this one to your list to check out. Though it's more geared to married women. If you haven't already countless articles, or a few books then this information will be new to you, but if you're like me then you'll find some of the information familiar.I'm not sure if it was because I'm a Communication major, and we had to study the difference between men, and women, or it's these things aren't that difficult to figure out that made me know already what most the book was trying to tell me. I think most women know by now that men have feelings that aren't only about wanting the physical. It's just driven in a different way than women. Then again this book was released in 2004, so maybe it was new information around that time.If you are sensitive then some of this information will get to you. Even I'm still confused as to what to think on the chapter of how you should keep up your appearance for your husband. I think we should all strive to be our best, but what it should stem from is debatable. I also tried to remind myself this book isn't to tell husbands what to do for wives, because one day when I'm married I would love someone to tell my husband to keep himself visually appealing for me. I think what is even worse for women is that we don't have as much to look at as men since men care even less about their appearance most of the time. I'll have to get the book addressed to the men for women to see what they recommend for us.If you're not married you may have trouble relating a little, but the advice can be used for all. The surveys featured are well conducted, and even if you know all the information you might just find it to be a good reminder."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I received my order in the mail in a timely fashion, and once I began reading the book I was hooked. It's been so helpful for my relationship with my boyfriend to gain insight into the needs that he has and how I can be more sensitive to them. I also bought him \\"for men only\\" and he's reading and learning about women. Overall, the books have been so helpful for us. We want to get married and it's encouraging to see the two of us actively striving to be better for one another. Shaunti Feldhahn is a great author."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This was an awesome insightful book.

I feel when reaching a certain age you do know that sex is important for men not only for mental bonding and that respect is important for them too. I can't say it gave me a lot to read it. Maybe to be less critical as a partner is what I got from it."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"If only I could remember the information in this book all of the time! I would be kinder to my husband and not misunderstand him all of the time. I usually only read books about men written by men, but this was especially helpful to have been written from a woman's understanding and reaction to men. At the same time,the author has done her research well and asked all of the right questions. Read the introduction to this book and pay attention to how and why she decided to write this book.It has helped me a lot since you can only change yourself and your reactions to your husband, this will give you some ideas on how! Thanks for writing this book!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This is the best book I have ever read on understanding men. At times I wanted to throw it across the room, because I didn't like what it said, but I guess sometimes the truth hurts. It does have a very happy ending, though...and one that restored my faith in marriage and relationships between men and women.I especially appreciated that it includes data collected in a scientific, professional way and that it is based on information gleaned straight from the lips of men. Also, I found it valuable that the men interviewed were from all socio-economic, religious, cultural backgrounds and a variety of ages.A must read for every woman."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I love the fact that this book is supported with such timely and thorough research, not just opinions. But I also think the author is dead on with her observations as well. It's so important for men and women to understand each other's designs better so we can relate to each other. This book helped me understand my husband better, but it also helped me raise my son to adulthood. When he hit the teenager years, he suddenly craved \\"respect\\" from me. Thanks to For Women Only, I better understood this innate desire for respect and my obligation to give him a healthy dose of it."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I know there are a lot of books out there on men but Shaunti is the first person to actually get her data directly from men. I've learned more about men reading this book than any other, Christian or secular! Every woman in the world should read this book regardless of your faith. This is the best education on males you will every get but be prepared; some of it will be hard to hear. However if you really want to know the truth about men and how they think and approach relationships with women then you must read this truly insightful book! I think it can save a lot of relationships and marriages!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book is a must for any wife or future wife trying to understand how her husband thinks. It is in depth, explicit, and detailed information about what makes him \\"tick\\" will help you with the big and the little things. Just yesterday we were putting in flooring and I actually UNDERSTOOD why he really didn't want my help and needed to figure out how to do it himself! This book is a must! Shannon"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"My husband gave me this book when it was first released. He was so excited that someone, especially a woman, was saying these things. I was shocked at what I didn't know about him or men. There are difficult truths here but someone needs to say them. It was a great communication tool for him to discuss things he could never say himself. I found myself saying \\"Is that really true?\\" over and over and his response was always \\"You didn't know that?\\" Since then I have given several of them out to my friends. Their experience was the same.Read this book and discuss it with your husband. He will confirm that what Shaunti writes is accurate."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"GET THE STUDY GUIDE. I rate the book as a 4 but honestly the book can be really frustrating on its own and I would probably rate it even less but I loved the workbook so much I couldn't. I would recommend totally skipping the book and getting the workbook instead. It is a 5 star! It was life changing. I'm not sure if it was the workbook itself or if it was that I did it at the right time when my heart was ready to receive it but I thought it explained things much better than the book and made applying it much more practical. I actually did the study with 3 other women. You need friends you can be totally transparent with if you really want to grow. If you have that I HIGHLY recommend this to all women who want to better understand their man and grow in all the areas of their marriage."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I liked this book! Basically, it's a reminder of common sense relationship builders about how men are different than women (guys and gals are different? No! Really?). When I was a new bride my mom gave me some advice, some of it funny, about being a wife. At the time I thought oh that's all well and good, but mom was married in 1950 and I'm getting married in the '80's and men are SO different now. Well guess what? 20+ years later into my marriage and mom was right. Men and women are wired differently; this book reminds women of that.For some reason the difference in genders has become forgotten in our society, and I think a lot of relationship issues are the result. Men are men, no matter what generation this is. They want respect. Teasing and joking at their expense is deeply hurtful. The \\"Sorry honey, I have a headache\\" routine isn't just annoying to them, it hurts them emtotionally. In that respect the book is fairly basic, but I think this information - as basic as it is - is important information for women today. That said, the book does put quite a bit of responsibility on the wife. I think many wives will read this book and say \\"But I tried all that!\\" and feel like any failures in their marriage are their fault. Relationships are complex; this book is a start but doesn't answer every marriage issue, and I don't think that is the book's intent. It's a starting point.The funny thing is, the average girl in Jr. High can accurately describe what boys are like but somewhere along the line women seem to forget all that and honestly, grown men and Jr. High boys still have a lot in common. (Ha Ha). When my daughters are older I'll definitely give them a copy of this book, and of course maybe have them chat with my mom, too."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Being a man, I can tell you women out there that this book is 90% of what all men think and feel. It was amazing reading how accurate it is.Sure there are exceptions but this book focuses on the common ground and while it is not in depth, it will give you a look inside our hearts and say things that we are scared to death to say in front of you.I would recommend this book before ANY other book on men and relationships."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Realizing that there is always room for improvement, my wife and I have made it a practice over our almost 25 years of marriage to read marriage articles and books regularly.

We strongly recommend it to every married couple.

I read it with my husband and he could identify with about 90% of the material in the book. There was of course some things that weren't paticularly in line with who he is or how he works or thinks. But it's opened up a lot of dialogue. Several times I was blown away by what I read (e.g. how most men view intimacy, the male need to make provisions for his family, & how the way other women dress can affect him & in turn affect me). This book will make you more aware of what is going on with man in your life. There's lots of good tid-bits to chew on, think about, & hopefully give the man in your life a little more credit & not be so undesservedly hard on him in those areas that makes him uniquely male. Just like we would like our men to have an understanding of us, I hope we can wave the white flag & try to start down the road of understanding togehter. I recommend this book. Even if you only have 1 or 2 lightbulb moments, you'll come away better educated on that other wonderful gender God created."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book advocates women being the paragon of Christian virtue in public and quite the opposite in private to appease their husbands. It also says that men cannot help but desire a beautiful/scantily clad woman that comes into his field of vision. A woman or anyone should be able to be themselves in public and private. And men and women both who are in a committed relationship should never think of another person with lust if they are in love."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"A well-meaning friend sent this to me. Perhaps I'm a bad wife, but i couldn't help but wonder where the compromise came in.If you were to take this book as gospel, you'd have long bitten off your tongue to stop saying anything your husband could consider derrogatory or disrespectful, you'd be starving yourself (but cooking gourmet dinners for him) lest he think you weren't 'taking care of yourself', and faking orgasms every night because \\"men need sex; it's the physical equivalent of them talking to you\\".So if you want a marraige like that, I'd definitely say 'follow this book to the letter.' If you want your marriage to be all about him, then read this book and follow the directions. Or, better yet, if you want to feel guilty because despite your best efforts, you dare speak your mind and say no to sex every now and again because you're -- gasp! -- tired, or worse, BUSY!

If a man said this, I would be intrigued, because he knows what he is talking about because HE IS A MAN and he knows what's going on. Also, she's basing the whole book on survey results. She's coming to the conclusion that most men are like this or that because 70 percent of the men she polled said so. If you go on the website, you can see how the questions were answered. Honestly, I got more out of her survey results online than reading her book.

The surveys were so revealing. The men speak so honestly about their feelings. There is so much to learn, realize, reacknowledge.

My husband was practically in tears when he realized I really was interested in knowing him better. In fact, when I mentioned there was a companion \\"For men only\\" he told me to get it.

The book delved into the inner workings of their minds and showed how visual they really are and their thought process on many topics.

There is no particular reason to *also* try to work God into every other page and the word \\"Christian\\" into every third paragraph, or to turn this from a description of what *some* men *feel* into an discussion of the *moral* dimensions of *womanhood*. The argument and the data don't depend on this move toward morality or a list of dos and don'ts for women, and as a result of doing this, the book is practically useless.But the authors appear not to have been able to stop themselves, and as a result the book has a kind of split personality. It is trying to be about the real experiences that a variety of men have, and that in turn many women may or may not be interested in, and on that point it would be a potentially useful-for-some (if not entirely scientific) book. But this book is also trying to make a moral argument about what women *ought* to do, largely resting on a particular strain of Christianity, and the result is a book that necessarily excludes and/or alienates probably most that might otherwise be interested in or able to benefit from what it contains.There are people I would like to share the \\"men\\" side of this argument and discussion with, but framing the work in moral terms turns it from an interesting and potentially illuminating claim about some mens' experiences into an offensive set of prescriptions to women about how to love men the \\"right\\" way based on Christian principles.There is a big difference between saying \\"Hey women, did you know that a lot of men feel XYZ?\\" and saying \\"Hey women, since a lot of men feel XYZ, you are obligated under God's law to do ABC.\\" The first has the potential to be informative, matches the marketing for the book, and allows women to decide for themselves what to do with the data. The second is what's actually in the book, and the result is a book that is likely to be offensive to any non-evangelical-Christian-person that reads it, doubly so if it was received as a gift or suggested reading.It's another instance of Christianity having to bring religion and theology into a domain that ultimately has no *necessary* relationship to religion. If you're great at selling Tupperware, but you insist on only doing it through church to members of your congregation, you're missing a lot of sales that you could otherwise make.That's what's going on here. I'm an atheist and was turned off by much of the unnecessary religious rhetoric that obscures, rather than serves, the discussion being had here, and I'm unwilling to subject any people in my life that might have been able to benefit from some of the material contained here to the prescriptive moral discussion that takes place. I'm might be interested in saying to people, \\"Hey, some of these things do sound like things I've thought as a man. Did you know that...\\" But I absolutely unwilling, nor would I ever for a moment consider saying to them, \\"And here's what you ought to do about it. Let me quote the Bible...\\" Basically and sadly: offensive.And it's a shame. If it was a necessarily theological or moral discussion, fine. But for really mundane, earthly stuff that's primarily about description, do we really have to keep ordering people to do particular things based on scripture? Why is it that Christianity seems always to proceed invasively in that direction? Noticing and expressing can be an interesting and useful thing. It doesn't always have to be tied to \\"commandments.\\""},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I truly enjoyed this book - it gave me so much insight.

It helped to solidify some of the facts and experiences I have read in other books."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book gets right to the point and is on target. I read it prior to getting married and it not only helped me appreciate my husband's wants and needs, but told me point blank what I was doing that was hurtful to him. Ladies, our intentions are typically pure and our hearts are usually in the right place, but men and women communicate differently, and because of that we hurt each other without meaning to do so. The author does not say you should be subservient to your husband, but rather explains the way in which men perceive things so that we can be sensitive to their feelings (the same way we want them to be sensitive to ours). I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"The good first. There is a lot of good. I enjoyed and agree with every chapter except the chapter about men keeping a visual rolodex of sexual images for their perusal.My husband and I have a great marriage. He knows I have the utmost respect for him and he has great love for me. He is certainly not ever wanting more sex, just complaining about how he feel like a piece of meat sometimes. (In jest I'm sure.)I say that to show, that not coming from a prude, the author puts for the idea that men just lust and fantasize about women nonstop and it's normal. I am quite sure she used the word normal at least twice. It was dealt with like, it's a fact so get used to it. Your man might chase women around home depot to get a better look, or go out to dinner with you and remain preoccupied with the hostess all night. The men give accounts of this, like, oh well, doesn't mean I don't love my wife. In my opinion, just b/c they aren't willing to risk actually acting on those thoughts, doesn't mean it's ok.I found the book to be very very discouraging. That a bunch of married Christian men would unapologetically (key word here)see a woman in a fitted worksuit no less (we're not talking lingerie here) and think about what she's like in bed or what her nipples look like. There's no mention that maybe this is lust or committing adultery in your heart. Or maybe they should not do this. It really threw me for a loop! I guess I didn't realize just how insecure or sex crazed men are. Not that I think they don't want a lot of it. But I found it discouraging for Christian wives to think that their husbands can't go to work without picturing everyone naked. I found it disturbing that the book is purporting this is giving the idea to men a lisence to do this since it's \\"normal\\" and women just need to get used to the idea."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"We've all heard the saying, \\"The only stupid question is the one that's not asked.\\" That's why I often don't hesitate to ask my husband if he thinks he should consult a map for directions. Being task-oriented, I rarely think twice about asking if he needs help because there may be a faster way to get a job done. I've never been shy about asking if he has remembered something on our home \\"to do\\" list-and I've never considered that his sometimes less than cheery responses are because of me.Scores of books have been written to enhance relationships between men and women. We can count Chapman's love languages on one hand; Cloud and Townsend have shown us how to draw lines in the emotional sand-but for once comes a book that is solely for women, solely for the benefit of their men.Author and wife Shaunti Feldhahn was working on character development for her latest novel when she discovered something completely new to her-the secret inner lives of men. In fact, she was so fascinated by what she discovered that she hired a professional survey company to conduct studies across the U.S., confirming how most men think and why they think it.But husbands need not roll their eyes and women can roll their sleeves back down. This isn't a manual for manipulation or leverage-gaining techniques. In fact, it may be everything our husbands have been trying to tell us. Whether it's the quandary most men feel between the call to conquer and succeed and the nagging fear of failure or why love is not enough or what they really feel and think about sex, this book covers it-and after 15 years of marriage, there were quite a few surprises for me.I never considered that my husband thrived on the challenge of being able to find his way on his own. My questions about looking for a better way to do things were not meant to imply that he was incompetent. And I never really considered that his list of priorities is very different from mine-and that's actually a good thing. Sometimes the smartest questions are the ones we never ask."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I heard several men I know rave about this book. I read it and started making some changes in my relationship right away. The response was immediate and quite positive.

Every woman who wants to communicate effectively with her man should read this book."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"First of all, the picture of the book cover listed on this Amazon page does NOT do the book justice. It is an attractive little book, with bold stripes and a perfect pocketbook size. It is sold with a wrapper on it (like Madonna's book Sex) because of the sensitive nature of the contents. And since you can't judge a book by its cover, let's talk about contents. This book is obviously the result of some labor intensive research, into a subject that affects your marriage: sex. Unlike Madonna's trashy book, this one seeks to make things better between men and women. In doing so, it doesn't villify either gender or place blame. It helps illuminate why men think the way they do, and gives practical instruction on what steps to take to protect your marriage. You might also want to buy the author's novel \\"The Lights of Tenth Street\\" along with this one (you know, the free shipping thing) because they both are ultimately compelling and about the same general topic. This is a beautiful book. You probably can't tell, but it is blurbed by Beth Moore on the front cover. Anyway, buy this beautiful book."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This is a must read for any woman wanting to know what makes men the way they are.

The bottom line for me is, when you stand before the judgement seat of God, are you going to point your finger at the other person and blame him OR are you going to be able to honestly say I did what YOU called me to do..to respect my husband..and becuz of this book I now understand what respect looks like to a man!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book has answers to questions about men that we women never knew to ask.

You can't come away from reading this book without a new appreciation for how we, uniquely, are fearfully and wonderfully made by our Creator, and how men and women really are designed so differently, even in thought life and emotions.

In the section about the \\"mental rolodex\\" she suggests that all men notice attractive women. Even if they are happily married. Even if their wives are themselves very attractive. Sure, not news. Not really a big deal to me. It's not like women, myelf included, don't also notice attractive men but still feel satisfied with their current partners. The part where I got upset was when the author implored women to dress with modesty because men can't help but notice and \\"file you away\\" but \\"he doesn't want you there so stop!!\\" Really? This seems to contradict a later chapter that tells married women not to neglect their appearances because it reflects poorly on their husbands. So which is it? Yes, it's possible to dress sexy without looking trashy and maybe that's what she was saying. But I felt like her implicit message was that men are all so oversexed and out of control that women should completely conceal their feminine shapes or anything else that might remotely hint at the fact that you're an attractive woman lest any man look at you with lust in his eyes. This is getting a little to close to \\"slut-shaming\\" in my opinion which is the mindset that if a women is sexually assaulted she was asking for it by being \\"too\\" alluring and the perpetrator just couldn't help himself. It seems to hint at the old idea that women are all evil seductresses who tempt innocent and spineless men into committing sin. Does anyone really think life is that black-or-white? Does she think we're all reptiles without the capacity for reasoning and judgment? Is she implying that at our core we're inherently bad people and left to our own devices we would do nothing but destroy one another? Guess my view of humanity is a little more optimistic than that, especially knowing we are more than our urges. I've also noticed that \\"slut-shamers\\" seem to be so much more often women than men and I get so tired of hearing women tear each other down based on some twisted notion that it lifts the accuser up or the myth that there isn't enough \\"sexiness\\" to go around so you have to take it from someone else.Any reasonably attractive woman who takes pride in her appearance and likes to get dolled up every once in a while already knows that guys are going to check her out and even perhaps(gasp!) imagine what's going on under the clothes. Women want to look and feel sexy. I don't think there's anything shameful or sinful about that. No need to create unnecessary guilt about that. Among many other factors, I blame some practices of Christianity (I'll speak for the conservative Southern Baptist I grew up around) for the host of sexual problems women and couples face. I feel like young girls are told \\"good girls don't do that\\" until they grow up and get married and are suddenly expected to be sexually full-functioning adults but they really don't have a clue what they like or how to communicate with their partners about intimacy. It's very confusing and, I think, unhealthy and detrimental to men and women to present such a rigid view of a normal human practice.I guess in the grand scheme of the book, one statement shouldn't make or break it. But I don't like the reaction I had and felt it strongly enough to write a review so maybe there is something to that."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Great Book - it may not have all the answers, but it sure has a lot of them.

Drs. Les and Leslie Parrott, from Seattle Pacific University, hail this book as uncovering the secrets of the inner lives of men. \\"Shaunti Feldhahn has uncovered a mountain of meaningful information for any woman wanting to understand men at a profound level,\\" they said. According to Bob Reccord, president of the North American Mission Board, this book is even said to have the power to \\"revolutionize your marriage!\\" I happened to miss these quotes when I first read the book and, to be quite blunt, now that I have read this book I can honestly say it did have a profound impact on me - and my upchuck reflex. I shudder to think that this book is on the best-seller list and that hundreds of thousands of men and women are reading this propaganda. Not only are they reading it, they are believing it because she has the \\"scientific proof\\" to back it up! In as little space as I am given in this response, let us examine Feldhahn's take on sex and the male mind.Feldhahn believes that the lack of sex men are experiencing in their marriages is a \\"crisis.\\" A crisis. Along the lines of the September 11th terrorist attack? Or the tsunami that washed over Southeast Asia? Nope. We have the real crisis right here in America! Men aren't getting enough sex! It's a crisis, according to Feldhahn, because men who do not have sex with their wives as often as they need it are not able to develop a secure, emotionally intimate relationship with their significant other. Lack of sex breeds \\"secret feelings of inadequacy. Making love assures him that you find him desirable, salves a deep sense of loneliness, and gives him the strength and well-being necessary to face the world with confidence\\" (pp. 92-93). Feldhahn goes on to state, \\"Your lack of desire can send him into depression\\" (p. 101). Yep, that's right. Straight out of a night-time soap opera off the WB...oh, wait! Silly me! These are statements from a Christian woman who is trying to \\"help\\" husbands and wives develop deeper, more intimate relationships. What's wrong with these statements? Let's discuss them on a few levels.First, statements such as these are too reductionistic. A statement that assumes men are only able to emotionally connect with their spouse or significant other through sex reduces men to walking penises! Furthermore, it is quite insulting to the emotionally mature male who is able to connect with his wife with his mind and soul, not simply with his genitals. Second, these statements are a cruel manipulation of women. It shifts all responsibility for the development of emotionally mature relationships to women. The man is insecure. He apparently is not clever enough to get his needs met by any other means, so the woman has to offer her body as a way to begin the connection process. What a great lesson we are teaching our young women and girls. It used to be said that the best way to a man's heart was through his stomach. Not so today. The best way to a man's heart is through his penis. This is fodder for a dangerous fire. \\"If you have sex with me, I'll know that you really love me.\\" Now, the experts are telling us that our grandmothers were lying. A man really will connect with us emotionally if we sleep with him.Third, if these statements were true, if men were looking for a deep, emotional, lasting connection through sex, why are there so many single, sexually-experienced men? If a true emotional connection was found through sex, such that the deep feelings of inadequacy and loneliness were healed, why do men often find it necessary to have sex with multiple partners? If the need for a deep emotional connection was met through sex, why then the woman with whom he first had sex should be enough. To sleep with woman after woman would leave emotional scars that would only tear down the confidence and self-worth that he has built up through sex. It's a catch-22. Fourth, Feldhahn's conclusion that a woman's lack of desire can send her male partner into depression shows a clear disregard for ethical research. Other than her survey, there is no empirical causal support for her claim. This is simply one of many manipulative statements Feldhahn makes under the guise of \\"good research.\\"I am horribly disappointed that this message is being sent out into the world. There is an underlying \\"good\\" here that is twisted in a package that will be ultimately damaging to our children and to ourselves. Yes, we must be careful of our spouse's emotional, physical, sexual, and relational needs. But we must do this out of love and respect that is guided by a sense of mutuality in the marriage relationship, not by catering to an unhealthy sense of self-worth that is so pervasive in the responses of Feldhahn's participants. Feldhahn has taken these unhealthy responses and twisted them into normal \\"healthy\\" responses that women must then take care of through their behavior and appearance. We should not buy into this myth. Rather, we should take seriously the feelings of low self-esteem, poor attachment, and an un-Biblical view of the role of women in a marriage relationship that were demonstrated by the participant's responses and work to improve the messages we are sending the men in our society."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This is the best book of it's type that I've ever read.

Previously, I had no idea that the word respect was key in communicating love to them. When I used the word to tell my brother what I considered his greatest contribution to the family, he warmed up enormously, and he still initiates hugs weeks later. For my significant other, I grew longer hair, although it's more labor intensive, because I now realize that my appearance reflects on him among his male friends.

I have always been the kind of person that tries to prove statistics wrong, so as I read this book I was constantly thinking about just how accurate the statistics were.Each time I'd come across a new question, I'd turn to my husband and say \\"Hey honey, which answer would you pick?\\" And wouldn't you know, just about every time he would prove the statistic right. Ugh!Perhaps the thing that annoyed me most about this book is that the whole thing is based on the premise that there are certain things men just won't tell women. I found that when I asked the questions, he was totally willing to answer me openly and honestly. In fact, there was hardly ever a time that the question asked didn't spark lots of very interesting conversations. Things that had happened in our past, thoughts about our families growing up, things that had happened in the past week, and a few new revelations about how we interact with one another.It's laced with stereotypes and gender role expectations, and is not a book that I would recommend you reading in hopes of \\"getting all the answers\\" about the men in your life. However, I do think it can spark some interesting conversation between you and that super special guy - and it just might help you understand each other a little better."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"For Women Only, by Shaunti Feldhaun, was an interesting little book. I feel like most of the information in it was spot on, although my husband seems to think differently than the male \\"majority\\" that was poled. It helped me understand more of what he needs, how he thinks, how he perceives his role and mine. It also confirmed what my pre-marital counseling pastor mentioned 6 years ago to my fiancee (at the time) and I- the most important word for me in regards to my husband is respect. He not only needs my respect, but he deserves it. I love how the author poled and interviewed so many men. It helped me easily bring up subjects with my husband that would've been more difficult had I not been reading the book beside him! It also helped me ask him questions about himself that I never would have thought of- especially in the chapter on guys being \\"visual.\\" It gave me great insight into the mind of my husband, and I am so grateful for this well written book!I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this honest review."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"My spouse and I bought the box set with for women and men only. Together we read the books and spent a lot of time constantly conferring with one another about the truths held therein for one another. More often than not we found the details/facts from both books to be on the mark with regards to each spouse's frustrations, goals, hopes, feelings, and ideals. Both books are straightforward and not meant to return women to the 50's as some suggest. However, the for women only does offer advice that requires women to put their husbands first sometimes; this is fine. What happened to love being 50/50.. hate to say it but it's half on us girls! And, to be fair to Shaunti Feldhahn, the book for men only tells the guys in many ways to put us first...in many ways my husband didn't expect! Read them together as a couple. It's been a great journey for my spouse and I. Also, as some have pointed out, there are Christian references in the book, but even if you're not a Christian, the book is definitely a great resource. Very enlightening. What you chose to do with the information is up to you."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Often times during the day, when we are sitting watching TV or eating dinner I will look at my husband and say \\"What are you thinking?\\" Nine times out of 10 he will answer nothing. Yeah sure...I really wanted to know what he was thinking and why he wouldn't be open and honest with me. I am sure some of you have the same problem.As I was looking for a solution to my problem, I came across the book For Women Only: What You Need to Know About the Inner Lives of Men by Shaunti Feldhahn.This book was an eye-opener for me. When Bill says he isn't thinking about anything, he probably is not thinking about anything! (Completely different from when a woman says she isn't thinking about anything, because we usually are thinking about LOTS of things! LOL)For Women Only offers 7 revelations about men that we probably knew deep down, but we are not practicing. These include: Men need respect, men are insecure, men are providers, men want more sex, men are visual, men are unromantic clods, and that men care about appearance.' In all of these Feldhahn takes scientific research analysis and uncovers the most common insecurities in the average man. Most of these seem like common sense to me, however once I really read about how to build up my husband and accept these principles about him, I learned that many things that I had been doing may have actually been hurting my husband and that he just didn't know how to tell me.For some this book may seem preachy, and may seem like Feldhahn is saying that women needs to be subservient to their husbands. I don't feel that is the case at all. I feel she offers a comprehensive guide to what my husband is thinking. I plan on implementing some of her theories. Just the day after I read, I found myself more aware of what I was saying to my husband and HOW I was saying it to him. I am trying to be more positive and to reinforce how I feel that he is a great father, husband, and provider!The only drawback to the book was about the design. Feldhahn had ideas bulleted in the chapters that were exact copy and pastes of sentences that you had just read or were going to read. They were VERY distracting.The message of the book was AWESOME and empowering to me as a wife. One thing I am trying to do to live each day better is to be a better wife to my husband and I feel after reading this book and implementing the tactics that I FINALLY have the tools to do that!DISCLAIMER: I received a copy of this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.

In addition, parents, siblings, and everybody else treat males one way and females another (no matter how \\"equally\\" we try to treat people), so socialization plays a role in the male mind too.Women often wonder, \\"what was he thinking\\", or \\"is he thinking\\" or \\"with what head was he thinking\\" of men.The author actually conducted a survey of men to achieve her results that she showcases in this book.This book wasn't for me. I don't need a book to tell me about my man. I'd prefer to go to him and have him tell me! It's got to be a pretty sad state of communication in a relationship if a woman is going to a book for a generic answer about her man's behavior rather than talking to the man himself.I've been with my husband for 13 years now; 4 1/2 years of dating and 8 1/2 of marriage. We went through college, graduate school, newlywed and new parenthood days together so far. We've grown up together.

The revelation that \\"men will choose to be respected without being loved over being loved without being respected\\" is blighted by the false dichotomy, ludicrous and offensive to people everywhere.

I can agree that there are a lot of similarities between what she has concluded. Then again on other ideas I felt so far alienated from them that I couldn't understand where such a conclusion was drawn. To put it simple I think if you are looking for a little more information about your man, just ask him.

A Christian author should not be reviewing and adding mens oppinions who are not Christian and of the worlds mindset. They should write only from the Holy words perspective and what GOD's commands are, not what mans opinions are. It is just that... a few handful of mens opinions. Men are commanded to act a certain way. They are not to look at women with lust of the eyes and are not to try and get sympathy for it from women. Men/Husbands that struggle with this need prayer not encouragement to keep be more of this world. Women are to be of modest dress and focusing on their inward inner quiet self not on the outward dress as is also commanded by GOD. This book is going against what the author professes to believe in for one who claims she follows GOD. If you want to know what your husband wants, what GOD wants for your marriage, ask your husband and read the word and pray about it don't read this book!! It does not rightly divide the word of GOD.

I saw this book and actually laughed when I read the cover. Once I picked it up 2 mths ago I could not put it down. The author has great input on men and what drives and fuels their emotional, sexual and spiritual side. It's good to see a Christian book that tastefully touches such topics.

All I have to say is a quote of a passage 20min 30s into the audio book, which made me want to scream and throw my iPod out of the car window. It pertains to giving our man an \\"unconditional respect\\". It goes on to quote a biblical passage that tells the wife to respect her husband and the author says that we need to \\"respect his leadership\\", putting our needs above our own and that we do this \\"as a choice made out of our reverence of God\\". The Greek translation of the word \\"respect\\" supposedly means \\"to be in awe of, to revere\\". Please, give me a break, what kind of nonsense is this! I do not use swear words, but a lot of those came flooding to my mind listening to this nonsense. Respecting someone as an equal is one thing, but her version of respect is just abhorrently submissive. I have to give it to her, she interviewed 400 church-going guys and, as she mentioned, gave them a two dozen questions. To write an entire book based on this and make money off it, that really is an achievement. Sorry, I can't review anything past the first 22 minutes or so, it turns my stomach. I bought this book based on the first few great customer reviews, I guess most of the population out there is far more religious than I am.

It's a combination of mildly interesting, rather lackadaisical research and the same old advice that women's magazines have been recycling for decades.The basic gist of this book is that most women have NO IDEA what men really think. OK, fine. The problem is, even though she claims this is not an \\"advice\\" book, she goes on to tell women we should all rush right out and change our whole approach to our relationships. In Fehnmann's view it is the woman's job to do all the work in the relationship. To the old-fashioned chestnuts \\"treat him sweet, be a good cook and keep the house clean\\" are added \\"look great and be a tigress in bed - but only if he happens to like tigresses.\\" Oh, and also the rather obvious advice that men don't like to be put down by their wives/girlfriends in public, and therefore we must make a huge effort to always be supportive and never, ever question his judgment, because it's just too devastating for his ego. Finally, be sure to tell your husband/boyfriend how wonderful he is instead of always asking him to do things (?!?)What decade is this woman living in? OK, I'm all for being respectful, as long as it's mutual. I agree that I should probably thank my husband more for the help he gives me, and we already have a policy (notice the word WE) never to put each other down in public. Actually we try really hard not to put each other down anyway, because we love each other. However, this book really raised my hackles, because of all the pressure on women today to excel at work, at home and as a mother, and be thin, groomed and sexy like the women we see on tv. What we don't need is another book saying, \\"yes, you have to do all those things if you want to be a good wife and a good Christian, and by the way, here are a few more to add to your list.\\" We don't need another book that tells us that if our man has a midlife crisis, it's our fault for not being thin/beautiful/organized/supportive enough. And we definitely don't need a book that relieves men of all responsibility to help out at home, understand the pressure women are under, or comprehend what a difficult job raising children is, whether you work outside the home or not. This is not good advice. I'm a Christian, a stay-home mom, my husband has a good job and is very supportive, and I hated this book. For a woman who's struggling with financial difficulties, depression, medical issues or other family problems, it could well push her over the edge.I won't even get into the incredible naivete of the author in being surprised and shocked that men check out other women pretty much all the time, and that sex is important to them. Duh! The explanation for this is that \`they're hard-wired that way'.In fact, the gist of this book is that men are hard-wired, and that means women do all the changing to accommodate them. I think we've progressed a little beyond that. At least, some of us have.I'm truly surprised by all the positive reviews. In my view, you shouldn't read this book unless you want to be depressed and/or angry."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"My boyfriend gave me this book in hopes that I would read it and think that what it was saying was insightful and profound. He thought it could help make me into the woman he wanted me to be. I just want to say to the women that are considering buying this book: I broke up with my boyfriend of two years - who I was going to marry - shortly after he gave me this unhelpful, uninspired piece of material. I was glad though; it revealed to me the kind of man he was. I don't think this helped me understand men more; it just made excuses for them. I remember thinking how often it excused men's insecurities and how women should just be OK with this obvious fault.I'm a Christian woman, but I don't believe that women have to be pushovers for men in order to be a righteous woman in their marriages. I've seen my parents have a non-typical relationship in which both of them have jobs and both of them view the other as a complete equal. They've been married for 30 years and they're happier than most married couples I know. I agree with another reviewer - your key to a successful marriage is already written out in the scriptures. Go back to the basics before you even consider buying this book."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Most of the chapters in this book were okay, and maybe a little helpful. However, my problem is with the chapter called \\"Men's Visual Rolodex\\" which is basically about how all men notice attractive women, and struggle to keep from picturing them naked. I'm trying to figure out why Mrs. Feldhahn thought wives needed to know this information. It has in no way helped me, and has actually made my self-confidence plummet to unbelievable lows. Mrs. Feldhahn attempts to soften the blow by explaining that while your husband may find other women attractive, it has no effect on his love for you. She actually recommends that wives and husbands should notice attractive women together--make it a game--and that the husband should use this opportunity to reaffirm his wife as his choice. My solution? Tear out this chapter, before you read the book. If you do, you won't have to bother making anything into a game, and you can go on as before thinking your husband only has eyes for you. And if you decide, for whatever reason to read the chapter--do not under any circumstances read it with your husband or ask for his input. At least, then you can think to yourself \\"My husband isn't like those other men. He would never...\\" If you do as I say, you'll live happily ever after, with your confidence intact."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"You could call today's book review a twofor, since although both of these books could stand alone, when it comes to couples, they should be purchased, if not read, together. In fact, I'll go so far as to say that they should be pre-marriage requisite reading. These books may be considered Christian; however, there is information in these books that will help couples better understand one another no matter what religion they are, or even if they have no religion.First, For Women Only by Shaunti Feldhahn, is a book written, obviously for women, about the way men think. At first, I honestly thought it was just another book telling us how we should respect our mates whether we think they deserve it or not. Reading further, I realized it was so much more.This book goes beyond the respect lesson, though there is a heavy dose of it, to mens' emotional and physical needs - yes, sex, but more than sex. Not only does it explain these from a woman's perspective, but also delves into the man's perspective, because although the author of this book is female, she took the time to study hundreds of men from all walks of life.It was during this study and interview of hundreds of men from pastors to CEOs, tothe man seated beside her on an airplane, to the one behind the counter who served her favorite coffee, that Feldhahn noted a pattern of responses that is the basis of this book.The companion book I mentioned, For Men Only, written by Feldhahn and her husband Jeff, will have you nodding your head in agreement; at least if you are a woman reading the book. That is exactly why I recommend this book as a gift for the man in your life. Whether engaged, or married for fifty years, there is something in this book that will help spark a new understanding to men about what makes women tick. Or, more specifically, what makes you tick.The best part of these books, I found, was that they not only disclosed these inner thoughts and feelings, but they also dissected them and placed them under the microscope so that the reader would have a better understanding of what really is the deeper meaning of what might otherwise seem a surface feeling. In other words, they also provided the whys. If you are in a relationship you owe in to both yourself and your partner to read these books."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This is a \\"wow\\" book!

I also recommend the companion book, \\"For Men Only\\"."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"For Women Only is the result of a survey of 400 men across the country who responded to a questionaire about their relationships. This book points out seven areas in which women have a surface understanding of men's needs or desires and delves into each subject in a way that leaves the reader grasping what that statement really means.For example, the first point is that \\"men need respect\\". That seems obvious enough, but Feldhahn brings this into perspective with her survey result that 74% of the men would rather feel \\"alone & unloved\\" instead of \\"inadequate & disrespected\\", if they had to choose one of the two options. She then elaborates on this with several follow-up examples of ways women can either demonstrate respect or show a lack of respect. Some of which we don't usually connect with showing disrespect. On page 24, she quotes Dr. Emerson Eggerichs, \\"In a relationship conflict, crying is often a woman's response to feeling unloved, and anger is often a man's response to feeling disrespected.\\"I would highly recommend this book to any woman who is serious about wanting to improve her relationship with her husband. The author has a way of transforming something you think you know into something you can apply to your everyday life, which isn't always an easy task."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I never thought I'd be writing a review for Amazon...but this book has given me a whole new outlook. I'm trying to survive my husband's midlife crisis and have been on a rollercoaster of emotions (more downs that ups). Recently, I found an article describing midlife crisis and just what a man goes through and I finally felt I had a better grip on \\"where he is coming from\\". The same day, I picked up this book (in the stack next to my bed); read it cover to cover, and it has changed my heart. I hope and pray that we make it through this, but I feel that this book has helped me see his life struggle more clearly. More importantly, it has shown me how I need to react...with unconditional love and respect rather than posturing and bitterness."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I wish I'd had this book and had given my husband its companion, \\"For Men Only\\" when we were married. These two books speak to normal people looking for help in normal loving relationships within marriage. They are not preachy and they leave all the psychobabble out. There is no \\"whine\\" in these--just practical understanding of what the differenced are between men and women."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I have been married for 3 years, and I've began to notice me and my husband bickering more than usual. We weren't fighting, just not making each other as happy as we had been just a few years earlier. I really found that the information in this book helped me keep in perspective how different men and women really are and it helped me think about what I was saying or doing that could be taken the wrong way by my husband. I reccommend this book for any married woman that really wants to understand their husband the way God intended. I also think that it would be a great book for Pastors to use for Marriage Counselling; very easy to read and up to date. My husband also has the Male version of this book and he is finding it helpful but he did comment that he found the information a little repetitive. I only read parts of the book so I wouldn't know for sure. In any case I think this is a great book and it would do a woman great to read it and begin to appreciate her husband again."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Truly a great book. I shouldn't have read it, since I'm a guy, but I did to see if it was an accurate presentation my inner feelings. It was dead on the money! I then read the companion, \\"For Men Only\\" book, figuring if Shuanti had me figured out, she'd surely also have my wife figured out. I highly recommend this book. -Michael."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"After reading this book I have shared and bought it for my friends and married daughters. Believe me I have read many many very good marriage type books but this one is different in that it is loaded with surveys. The surveys are especially revealing of the universality of the way men think. It opened my eyes on many issues regarding my husbands behavior - how he is feeling inside and why he reacts as he does to my behavior. It's a fun, helpful, quick read:)"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I finished reading this book yesterday, and I am already enjoying what I learned from it. I have to admit that there was one point when I stopped and started arguing with the book, wondering, \\"Why does she make me feel like I gotta do all the work? Why should I worked so hard to think the way he does, what ab out me?\\" Then as I started reading again, the next paragraphs addressed that very question! :)I was so happy after just the second chapter that I want online and bought \\"For Men Only\\", and both discussion guides, then later bought For young women only and it's discussion book to give to my teenage sister.I would recommend this book to any woman, marital discord or not. It's so rewarding to love anyone to the utmost, especially the one from whom you want the same kind of love."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I learned more useful information about men from this book than almost any source in my life.

I would recomend this book to ready anywhere, laying by the pool or on the beach, in a book study with other women, or even on your own at home.

Shaunti Feldhahn cracks male myths and stereotypes wide open and reveals a wealth of knowledge about the inner worlds of men. Who knew? really! You would have thought someone would have come up with this stuff sooner. Leave to God to inspire someone to FINALLY write this stuff down and share it with the world! I really learned a lot about this book, namely, the IMPORTANCE OF RESPECT TO MEN! And also how they think about sex and stuff like that. I am going to read this book a few times and it will DEFINITELY come in handy to prepare me for marriage! Thanks Shaunti!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I recommend this book to any woman in a serious relationshiop or any woman just wanting to better understand the oppostite sex. GREAT book!!!!!"},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I cannot believe how many women are so offended by this book - even Christian women! There are very few books I've found that even attempt to piece together what makes a man tick. As I read this, I found myself in agreement with almost every point Feldhahn made.I can see how this book would be upsetting for some women, only because they probably haven't realized just how dramatically different men are. Men need sex. It's even more important psychologically than physically. Men need respect. Men, despite their best efforts, cannot help but notice other women (not stare, just notice). It IS important how you look to a man. That's just the way men are. I never chose to be that way; it's just the way I am. Even the most pious men I know fall into these categories. Deal with it, ladies! At least now you know! Most women would rather spend their time trying to change these things in her man than to learn how to deal with him better. That's like a man telling his wife to \\"be less sensitive\\" or \\"talk less about your feelings.\\" You can't change the way people are wired.The question for women, then, is what are you going to do about it? The women in these reviews who do nothing but complain about \\"catering to their husbands needs\\" reek of selfishness. Selfishness has no place in a healthy marriage. If one partner refuses to place the other's needs above their own, then marriage cannot be what it's supposed to be. Feldhahn's biggest mistake, I think, is opperating under the assumption that her reader's husbands nurture their wives and place them high above themselves in all things.It's my guess that the ladies here who are militantly against this book don't experience that kind of treatment from their husbands. Otherwise, they would desire nothing more than to know how to better return that kind of devotion to meet his needs as well.This book doesn't have all the answers, but it's a great start to understanding the inner lives of men. I would hope that the women who read it are in relationships where the man is treating them in a blessed way. If not, then please get out of that relationship! But if so, then don't go around complaining about a book that has the guts to challenge your own stubborn selfishness."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"This book confirmed many of the things I've heard from a number of my close male friends - things they're often hesitant to tell you. Even the greatest guys have trouble opening up and being honest with the women they're romantically involved with. One caveat - the book does go a little overboard in regard to focusing on his needs, rather than striking a balance between his and yours.NOTE: This reviewer is the author of \\"Never Be Late Again, 7 Cures for the Punctually Challenged.\\""},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Firstly, this book is extremely generalized and while it is well meant it was prepared and written poorly.The authoress is long winded and does not get to the point. Her language is unusual and out of touch, and somehow she found people to write the quotations she uses with these same words, \\"clod\\" and \\"cad\\" for example. I do not believe I have ever heard a normal man describe himself or another as either of those terms -- they simply are not part of modern vernacular.Her research was conducted in an unscientific method. Enough people were not interviewed for a scientific result, making this study and its results skewed. Good examples of literature that was researched scientifically: \\"The Seven Cries of Today's Teens: Hearing Their Hearts; Making the Connection\\" by Timothy Smith based off of research conducted by the Gallup Organization and The Values and Beliefs of the American Public, produced by Baylor University also based on research conducted by the Gallup Organization [...]Secondly, the emphasis put on sexual intercourse and physical intimacy over and over makes it sound like a duty to women rather than the result of a loving relationship. For example, please note she has a section entitled, \\"Supportive Sex\\" outlining how men \\"need\\" sex.There is one point where she states, \\"Your lack of desire can send him into depression\\". Depression, by the Webster Dictionary is defined as, \\"B (1): a state of feeling sad : dejection (2): a psychoneurotic or psychotic disorder marked especially by sadness, inactivity, difficulty in thinking and concentration, a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping, feelings of dejection and hopelessness, and sometimes suicidal tendencies\\".If she intends that it can make a man feel sad or dejected - that is highly possible.However, a woman's lack of sexual drive and expression, can hardly be the underlying cause of a \\"psychoneurotic or psychotic disorder\\". The verbiage she uses gave me the impression she meant the latter.Thirdly, she sprinkles in Bible verses and mentions prayer and God when it suits her while ignoring the scriptures when they do not support her cause. For example, she states, \\"Temptations are not sins. (The Bible states that 'Jesus was tempted in every way, and yet without sin'.) What we do with those temptations is the issue, and we'll get to that in a moment.\\"Please note that in Matthew 5:27-30 KJV, right after Jesus delivers the Beatitutdes, he states, \\"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. \\"Those are the very words of Jesus stating that the act of lustful observation is adultery of the heart; the authoress maintains that men are incapable of controlling lustful thoughts due to having a \\"mental Rolo-dex of sensual images\\".The Bible also charges women in 1 Timothy 2:9-10: \\"In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works\\".In 1 Peter 3:3-4, the Bible states clearly what wives should be like: \\"Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. \\"As a soloution for this \\"mental Rolo-dex of sensual images\\", the authoress suggests first prayer, checking one's own heart as a spouse, determining one's involvment level, becoming a support, and lastly -- the gravest of all -- that women \\"champion modesty in yourself and others\\".At first this may sound extremely reasonable -- how often it seems we are exposed to women as sex objects in the media!Let us not forget, however, that citing other women as a cause of sexual impropriety is something touted by another Faith of Abraham. This idea that men should not be responsible for their sexual urges and the inner workings of their minds is the basis of the hijab -- the Muslim practice of veiling women.This is also part of the ideology surrounding religiously extreme behavior denying the rights and self-expression of women: the practice of the Amish women to be \\"plain\\".Both practices have very little basis in the holy scriptures of their religions: the term hijab is only used for the actual wives of Muhammad in the Quran; the only Biblical basis for wearing a head covering concealing one's hair in the Bible is found in 1 Corinthians 11: But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.\\"This one passage has not inspired conviction for this to be considered a tenant of normal Christian behavior.The idea that woman are responsible for men's thought lives by the woman's dress is dangerous for women's civil rights: for an example of a society where women are blamed for a man's lack of restraint both mentally and in action, we need look no further than India [...]All human beings are responsible for their thoughts and their subsequent actions. Infidelity cannot be blamed on a woman's dress; what is provocative to one person may be disgusting to another.There is a line drawn in this book between unattractive people and attractive people. People come in all shapes and sizes, and subsequently ideas of beauty vary from person to person and ideas of modesty vary as well. What would be a stumbling block to one person, fails to excite another in the least.Some men have feet fetishes; must we all stop wearing sandals and getting pedicures so as to not bring those men to temptation?Perhaps the most intriguing lack of consideration is the way the striking social issues of women's inequality and sex trafficking have been ignored.In the US women make 76 cents to a man's dollar, and rape, sex trafficking, and discrimination are common problems, while many people deny these issues exist and claim an equality that we simply do not have.[...]This country is overwhelmingly Christian, as evidenced by the study conducted by Baylor University. The terms \\"faithful\\" (meaning not adulterous) and \\"churchgoers\\" are liberally sprinkled throughout the book as if a man not committing adultery and a man going to church immediately was a certificate of morality.The kind of thinking entertained by this book is reminiscent of an Oscar Wilde quote, \\"What a fuss people make about fidelity! Why, even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.\\"Despite being overwhelmingly Christian, we have a huge sex industry in this country that extends beyond the pornography of a man's youth (as if a faithful Christian man cannot look at images he should not), and falls into prostitution and sex trafficking itself. Nevada is not the only state with prostitution - it's just the only one where it's legalized and regulated. For an informative article, please read Enslaved in America: Sex Trafficking in the United States [...]In conclusion, this authoress meant well with this book, yet failed to miss the mark in execution.If you do not understand how other people think, then reading a book on psychology and personality may help you more.If you want to know what your husband personally thinks, then I suggest you ask him and listen."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"In For Women Only, Shaunti Feldhahn provides insight into the inner lives of men. Touching on subjects such as respect, sex, romance, and competition, the author explores the complex terrain beneath a man's confident exterior. It is a book written for women who want to support their husbands in becoming all that God intended them to be. The more we understand the men in our lives, the better we can support and love them in the way they need.I was very excited to see this book available for review - mainly because Shaunti Feldhahn is coming to speak at my church next month. I am so glad I requested it! This quick read is filled with so much valuable information. Even though I assumed I knew a thing or two about my husband, I really had no clue what was really going on inside of his head. After reading this book, I feel so much more confident in our relationship and the way that I relate to him. I was able to put some of the information into practice the very next day, and can I say - it truly made a difference. I feel so blessed that I learned this information early on in our marriage. I know it will make a big difference in the years to come.Disclaimer: I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group in exchange for my honest review."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"I just finished reading the book For Women Only. You may have seen that I read the book For Men Only not too long ago. They are pretty similar in writing style and setup. Also many of the topics were similar but told from different perspectives.In some ways, reading a book about how men think was boring because I am a man and I know how I think. However, it also made me think about how I think in some new ways and was in some ways affirming to know that men, not just I, think about certain things in the same ways.As they make clear in the book, while they make many blanket statements, they do not mean that the statements are true of all men. I found myself to be an exception to some of the statements. However, I could relate to the main ideas.For example, one of the topics addressed was that husbands like to see that their wives are making an effort to be healthy and to look good, even when just around their husbands.I agree that I like to see my wife making an effort to be healthy. Currently, she is trying to eat healthier and include more exercise in her lifestyle, which I think is great. However, I don't really care if she puts effort into how she looks around me most of the time. In fact, while the book said men prefer that their wives do things such as put makeup on even if just the husband is around, I prefer that my wife doesn't wear makeup. I think she looks better without makeup. I would prefer she never wear makeup. However, like I said, I can relate to the main point of that section.In conclusion, I think it is a valuable book and I would suggest it for women, and men if they want.However, if men read it, they should be careful not to feel entitled to special treatment. We can't expect our wives or significant others to completely understand and apply everything in the book. It would be good to balance it out with reading For Men Only.For the women who read it, there is a warning in the beginning that I think needs to be emphasized. The book could seem to oppress women or make them feel like they should be doing all the work in the relationship. Which is not true. The Bible says that women should submit to their husbands, but it is also clear that men should love their wives as Christ loves the church (which is a much bigger task). If both of those are happening together, it is a beautiful thing.So, while this book is one-sided, it needs to be understood that the relationship shouldn't be one-sided, and I don't believe that is what the book or the author is promoting.Checkout this book and/or order your own copy here [...]This book was provided free for review by Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing Group."},{"Title":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men","review":"Great book with some good insights.

Shaunti Feldhahn spent the time and effort needed to interview and survey over a thousand men, to get insight into their thought life. What she found was astounding. Only a woman could have written this book, as a lot of her research came back with men saying \\"but of course women know that!\\" To which of course she responded, \\"Well I didn't!\\"I would put this book in the MUST READ category.

However, I continued to read and really learned so much about how men think and how visual they really are and how much they really love their wives.It was written by Shaunti Feldhahn, after she interview many men over a lengthy period of time and I'm sure their answers will surprise you as much as they surprised me (unless you are male ~ then, you already know the answers).

I consider &quot;The Old Rose Informant&quot; to be the capstone of my nearly two decades of work on Old Roses, bringing the reader to a wonderful realm of roses and rose-lovers, a realm where no other book reaches. Presented here for the very first time, in English, are the complete basic works of the master rosarian Jean-Pierre Vibert, touching on the complete range of his era's roses, rose-culture, and rose concerns, including his fascinating observations, sage theories, and sharp controversies. Further chapters offer other lengthy excerpts from other noted rosarians of the old rose era on such topics as rose-shows, pruning, grafting, raising roses from seed, nomenclature, cross-breeding, and more. A major part of the book is comprised of the author's original and pioneering research on the origins and progress of many of the most important groups of old roses, such as the Damask Perpetuals, Chinas, Teas, Noisettes, Bourbons, Hybrid Perpetuals, Pernetianas, and others, covering new ground and rewriting our understanding of rose history and development. This is a book not only for the old rose specialist who wishes to gain deeper understanding of the old rose era, but also for the armchair gardener who will enjoy the literate prose, acuity, humanity, and wisdom of Vibert and his colleagues as they shape rosedom's budding progress!"},{"Title":"Sisters of the Sea: Anne Bonny & Mary Read, Pirates of the Caribbean","review":"As a child, I had always heard of pirates as savage, brutal, crude and cruel, especially the women pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read. Riley's story brings these two to life like I had never imagined. The book is filled with action and as well details character stories as well, to the point where I was gripped with sympathy for them both. Riley doesn't spare any of the gritty details of the sex or violence, instead she's written a realistic tale that seems both well researched and well crafted. Many points during the book I was overwhelmed with the intensity of the storytelling... the imagery lingers long after I finished."},{"Title":"Sisters of the Sea: Anne Bonny & Mary Read, Pirates of the Caribbean","review":"The saga of 18th-century pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read is worthy of a big-budget film boasting an A-list cast and top-of-the-line special effects. However, if Sandra Riley's novel were used as the basis of a screenplay, we'd be looking at a B-movie treatment for which the majority of the buzz would undoubtedly focus on which hopeful starlet would be baring all as Bonny.This is a pirate story, and thus above all else we have a right to expect plenty of cutlass-and-cannon action at sea. But Riley somehow managed to pen a tale in which most of the action passes by unnoticed. Instead, we get lots of stilted period speech and a great deal of grubby sex, including a voyeuristic peek at each girl's sexual awakening.Riley certainly does a lot of character development in the novel, and she created elaborate backstories for her main characters. That much is to her credit. However, it's a shame she sacrificed the meat of the story: the excitement of piracy itself. Riley doesn't seem sure if she wanted to craft a romance or a pirate adventure, something she probably should have sorted out before she completed the text.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(net) editor"},{"Title":"Sisters of the Sea: Anne Bonny & Mary Read, Pirates of the Caribbean","review":"This was my favorite fictionalized account of Anne Bonney and Mary Reade ever. The author manages to do Johnny-Depp-style pirate humor, while not ignoring the actual history or the gruesome realities of pirates at the time. There are graphic and brutal depictions of slavery, poignant descriptions of interracial love, and hilarious pirate anecdotes. I fell in love with her Anne Bonney. I wanted to be her Mary Reade. She does take one historical liberty, relocating the career of a notorious pirate captain by 10 years. However, I forgive her that for her inclusion of almost every bit of the Bonney/Read legend, right down to pleading their bellies for a stay of execution and the final bitter words of Bonney to Jack Rackham, after he left her and Read to defend the ship alone. (\\"If you had fought like a man, you would not now hang like a dog.\\" Brrr.) So, though I must add the obligatory caution about \\"historical fiction != history\\", the book really is rather good, and I will be chasing down some of Riley's other books."},{"Title":"Sisters of the Sea: Anne Bonny & Mary Read, Pirates of the Caribbean","review":"I dont know how much research the author did before writing this book, but even with the sparse facts that do exist, it would have been possible to write a book that is both an interesting read and factual in terms of what is known.Instead the author chose otherwise and I was highly dissapointed because of that. If your looking for a well done and factual novel based on the legend of Calico Jack, Anne Bonney and Mary Read, try James Nelson's \\"The Only Life That Mattered\\"."},{"Title":"Sisters of the Sea: Anne Bonny & Mary Read, Pirates of the Caribbean","review":"I think that Sandra Riley is an exceptional historical novelist. I've read quite a number of historical novels and am always evaluating them on the basis of their &#34;teaching&#34; me something, not just amusing me. This book is riveting, a page turner, colourful, interesting, enlightening and did I say I LIKE IT!! I am also stunned by the author's capturing words, experiences, insights and situations which only reinforce my belief in reincarnation!!! This would make a wonderful movie and it's hard to believe it hasn't been done, perhaps it is TIME."},{"Title":"Sisters of the Sea: Anne Bonny & Mary Read, Pirates of the Caribbean","review":"Note: Letter grades are given at the end of my review ranging from A (highest) to F (lowest).To be fair, I was warned by other critics that Sisters of the Sea (Sandra Riley, 385 pages) was more about relationships and the emotional toll of piracy than bang! bang! bang! cannon fire! sort of action. That seemed promising at the time. However, Sisters of the Sea is plagued by wooden period speech, thoughtless adultery and a lack of direction.For those of you unfamiliar with Anne Bonny and Mary Read, the female protagonists of the book, the first thing you should know is that they are actual historical figures and they were, in some respects, the first feminists of the world. The Anne and Mary we get in Sisters of the Sea, however, couldn't be depicted in a more sexist nature.Riley seemed to feel the need to add new characters to the lives of Anne and Mary, mostly to Anne's. Sadly, however, Anne's new companions are all a means for her to get some more of her favorite vice: sex. Yes, I know that a pirate's life was full of lust and adultery. But when that adultery gets in the way of things like, say, the plot, you know you have trouble on your hands.The true life story of these exceptional women are left smashed and empty in the corner, like a bottle of killdevil. Actual influential characters like James Bonny and Jack Rackham are pushed aside, left to subside on a few measly chapters at the end of the book, while Anne and Mary go off to have, yes, more sex.Sisters of the Sea presents an interesting question on what place adultery really has in a pirate novel. I think there is a place for it, it just can't be allowed to overshadow other elements of the pirate life.The Only Life That Mattered: The Short and Merry Lives of Anne Bonny, Mary Read, and Calico Jack Rackamby James L. Nelson proves that it's possible. Let's just hope other authors pick up his formula soon, because Riley's effort is as shallow as a Caribbean tide pool.

The author not only reconstructs the permanent veiling of Branwell's spirit by way of his sisters' fame, but through prose as mesmeric as that found in his previous works, it seems as though Martin personally knows his protagonist, Patrick \\"Branwell\\" Bronte, alighting the years between with dexterity unlike any other. Martin is a time traveler and his books well-oiled machines, facilitating insight, enlightening, and grooming audiences for what is yet to come. This novel continues to educate far beyond its first reading."},{"Title":"Branwell: A Novel of the Bronte Brother","review":"This isn't a straightforward biography of Branwell Bronte, it is much better than that.Douglas Martin is a poet and this book is a beautiful poetic dream, using the dark, damp, brooding atmosphere of the moors and parsonage to set the scene. Branwell's relationship with his sisters, his involvement with their writings, his drug and alcohol abuse and eventual downfall are all brilliantly portrayed.Douglas Martin has a deceptively simple style of writing, very easy to read. I don't know of any other author who can convey so much meaning and emotion in so few words. He never tries to give a complete picture, the narrative is fragmentary, and he doesn't draw conclusions. Subtly outlining such issues such as Branwell's sexuality and his sudden dismissal from his post as tutor at Thorp Green, he leaves it to the readers to decide for themselves what actually happened. His extensive knowledge of the Bronte family and their writings comes across clearly.It's tempting to read the book quickly, but don't do that - you will miss a lot of the subtleties in the text. The more you reread this book, the better it gets - brilliant!"},{"Title":"Branwell: A Novel of the Bronte Brother","review":"BRANWELL is an historical novel which tells the story of the Bronte family from the perspective of the black sheep brother, about whom most readers only know he was painted out of the family portrait. Like Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea (about the first Mrs. Rochester in Jane Eyre), Branwell enhances any reading of the sister's novels."},{"Title":"Branwell: A Novel of the Bronte Brother","review":"Consider three extraordinary girls and their brother who is only extraordinary because he breathed the same air and trod the same ground as his sisters, and is famous only by osmosis. Branwell Bronte was a failure, an excruciating failure, because he had the intellect but not the talent or the fiber to succeed as an artist or a writer. And he had to watch as his sisters spun their marvelous tales and became household names while he plunged deeper and deeper into a world of opium.And indeed, this superb novel is written as the stuff of dreams, of a delirium, of a misty world in which Branwell and Charlotte and Emily and Anne appear almost as wraiths, as ghosts on the moors, gone from this world in the blink of an eye. Nothing seems to be quite real, but this is Branwell's story, and poet Martin gives him understanding, substance and depth. Yet he is illusive, too, his red hair a badge of bravado but the rest of him fading away a bit more after each failure until he sunk into his death- bed, a hollow husk of the young man who had once shown such promise.\\"Branwell\\" is a lyrical book, written by the hand and heart of a poet. In a way, in this book, Branwell comes into his own because we can identify with him so well. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Branwell: A Novel of the Bronte Brother","review":"in a cauldron of literary brooding, sensuality, and suspense. Martin's performance is deliriously seductive."},{"Title":"Branwell: A Novel of the Bronte Brother","review":"I didn't find this book poetic, mood-evoking, or compelling at all. The writing is artsy-fartsy affectation. Not to mention shallow and trite.I've been reading books by and about the Brontes for most of my life. This includes literary criticism, biographies, and fictional novels based on their lives. With fiction a writer can speculate, take some liberties, expand on ideas concerning a famous literary genius' personality. That's to be expected and the result is often alluring. However, in this novel, there seems to be no setting of historical place. We have no idea if and when we are in the 18-teens, when Branwell was born, or the 1840's, when Branwell died. There is no background, no atmosphere, whether of the Yorkshire moors or England itself. Branwell Bronte's father and famous literary sisters are just names to be mentioned, shadowy puppets in the background, stick figures enacting the simplest reactions. There's no description - just a queasy glut of mood, if that's what it's to be called. The inferrence of Branwell's activities is the worst of all. The author coyly skirts around Branwell's \\"depravity\\", never settling in on naming it, only hinting at what might have occurred, and slithering the supposed events over with an oily, liquor-and-laudenaum-soaked fog of guessing.Reknown Bronte historian and researcher Juliet Barker has proven without doubt, in discovering transcribed eyewitness accounts of the time, that Branwell Bronte did indeed have a sexual affair with his employer, Lydia Robinson, which was the direct cause for his dismissal as the Robinson son's tutor. He also known to have impregnanted one, perhaps two young women in neighborhoods where he was elsewhere employed. Whether or not he was also engaged in clandestine homosexual activities is something which has not been sufficiently proven even though it's been popular to hint at it for the past three decades (Barker refutes it, as well as do other contemporary Bronte biographers), but this was Branwell's own personal business anyway. What he definitely was not was a pedophile preying upon the child of the family for whom he worked. Artistic license has gone too far and made a sympathetic if pitiful historical figure repugnant, and to not zero in on the reactions of the protagonists, the effects upon all concerned, however fictional this device, is a cop-out. Instead the smarmy curtain of \\"mood\\" remains.I think this book was a sorry failure at what it was attempting. Immediately upon finishing - for I forced myself to get through the entire thing - I tossed it into the giveaway pile - only because I can't bear to throw any book, no matter how bad, into the garbage can."},{"Title":"5-Minute Math Problem of the Day: 250 Fun, Multi-Step Problems That Sharpen Math Reasoning, Number Sense, and Computation Skills","review":"These are challenging and interesting math word problems, well laid out and organized.

(Almost all of the items catalogued are prints on paper, but three metal multiples are listed in an appendix.) There are small black-and-white images of all items in a catalogue, plus larger color images of select prints. Since all Serra's work on paper is in black, the color images might not seem so important, but they do give a nice sense of the subtle shades of the paper on which they're printed and a better idea of the texture of some of the more deeply-bitten etchings. There is an interesting introductory essay in English, French and German, that also includes images of Serra sculptures, drawings and prints. So a great guide to Serra prints.Except... there are a few omissions for the period covered (1972-1999); without trying very hard, I've noticed at least three prints that are not listed (one from the 1973 &quot;New York for Stockholm&quot; portfolio and two political fundraisers for Edward Kennedy from 1980 and 1996), and I suspect that there may be more missing. There is also an earlier multiple (the editioned lead roll from 1968) that could have been included with the three listed. A bit frustrating all of this. I know it's not easy to get something like this completely complete, but hopefully a future edition will include these omitted works, as well as cover Serra's more recent and very exciting prints of the 2000s. Still, well worth the price to the Serra fan."},{"Title":"Richard Serra: Prints: Catalogue Raisonne 1","review":"Beautiful book with a great essay about his work on paper, the prints are reproduced well on the pages and look great.

Not content with reading just another book about the general subject of marriage, and not really wanting to read another book about divorce, I was very pleased to be given this book on remarriage. After reading through it, I feel so much more confident now about my ability to enter a second marriage and not be trapped by fears and insecurities that resulted from my first. I feel much more able now to look objectively at the areas I still need to heal and grow in. Praise God for the careful work of Drs. Les and Leslie Parrott in addressing this seldom-addressed issue. I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who is divorced, even if they haven't yet addressed the possibility of remarriage in their life. [Edit on Jan 10, 2008, about six years after the original review!]: I have come to not necessarily agree with everything that the authors write in this book. But I did find it extremely helpful at the time I read it and wrote this review.]"},{"Title":"Saving Your Second Marriage Before It Starts","review":"As a pastor of over 25 years, I have used several books as part of a pre-marital counseling regiment. Drs. Les and Leslie Parrotts' books are the best, by far! Not only do the Man's and Woman's Workbooks (I suggest ordering them with the book) make premaritial counseling simpler, I have found that this book hits the nail on the head. Couples who went through the \\"Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts\\" material in preparation for marriage thanked me after they were married, and they shared how valuable this material was in the daily grind of life.This volume adds additioanl material to address the compexities of a Blended Family. Although blended family issues cannot be dealt with thoroughly, the Parrotts share the most important considerations (and offer other resource suggestions on page 186, footnote 6).I first heard the authors at a Moody Pastor's Conference in the late 1990's. It did not take me long to determine that I would check out their books. I have since concluded that Drs. Les and Leslie Parrott are exceptional in the realm of understanding human relationships.Althogh the book is written by a godly Christian couple, this is more of a relational book than a spiritual one, so I would not consider it a complete pre-marital regiment, but a good anchor book. Couples already married (even for years) will find this material valuable as well (and will kick themselves for not having read it earlier).Whether used in counseling or simply read by a couple in their own quest to prepare for marriage, this book is a gem. The Drs. Parrott seem to have a realistic (and well documented) grasp on the nature of marriage and the additional complexities of bringing children into a new blended family. This is practical, hands on material.The book is arranged around 9 questions: Are you ready to get married again? Have you faced the myths of marriage with honesty? Can you identify your love style? Have you developed the habit of happiness? Can you say what you mean and understand what you hear? Have you bridged the gender gap? Do you know how to fight a good fight? Do you know how to blend a family? and Are you and your partner soul mates? This is basically the 7 questions from \\"Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts\\" with two additional questions added to tackle a blended family, thus, \\"Saving Your SECOND Marriage...\\"Of course no couple entering marriage could honestly answer all those questions with a \\"yes.\\" But the book provides a good start and helps couples begin to face reality and potential areas of growth.If a couple follows the exercises by purchasing the workbooks, (like identifying some of your own personal \\"commandments\\"--rules you live by that you picked up who knows where and expect your spouse to know and agree with), it could preclude many potential tensions later.To those of you considering a second marriage, go through this book together, and cosider at least some of the exercises in the workbooks. To pastors and Christian counselors, I urge you to read this volume and consider using it!"},{"Title":"Saving Your Second Marriage Before It Starts","review":"My soon-to-be husband and I used this series as our premarital counselling guide and found it to be well-designed, practical (without being so full of pseudo-psychiatry that it felt fake.)

The workbooks that go with it are also wonderful.

I have been puzzled by all those programming related books these days: with all advacned word processing techniques, can they &quot;pretty-print&quot; example programs so that readers may get the idea very quickly ? Who has enough time to go through all those examples line by line ? First, this book goes beyond such pretty-printing. Important parts in the programs are well-marked, additional explanations are typed in small cases and pointing to the appropriate places using arrows, related parts are connected using lines and arrows. When you look at the examples in the book, I don't need to go through line by line. The concepts are immediately coming through my eyes to the brain, by looking at the example. Second, the example programs are as good as in many other authoritive books (like Perl5 Cookbook). And there are so many examples in the book. Finally, the structure of the book is one of the best. One minor problem would be there are as many typos as in Perl5 Cookbook. But unlike in Perl5 Cookbook, I can ignore such minor typos, since I already got the concepts of the example program by simply looking at it. In summary, if you need only one book for perl, this is one. Also, I would recommend this book to anyone who has been embarrassed by Perl. An extremely user-friendly book for anyone who has any programming experience (ie. this book does NOT teach the basics of programming)."},{"Title":"Perl 5 Complete","review":"After reading snippets of this book from time to time, and being frustrated and amazed at how many errors in how many code snippets could get through the editors, I finally turned to this website to see if others had observed the same problem.

Shame on you McGraw Hill for allowing this book to hit the shelves - you should do a mass recall - send in the front cover and get a corrected edition. It seems that the authors at times really know their stuff, and could teach a lot, but this is all foiled in error, after error, after error. I just got done reading a two page spread that had five code snippets - I believe three of these had serious printout errors. (I haven't confirmed this yet, but I'm getting tired of incorrect code.) Fire the editors, or whomever rushed this book to print, just to get shelf space - what a sad statement on American publishing - get that shelf space - I think that person should get out of publishing and go to work for Coca-Cola or Pepsi and let the book world alone. Terrible business practice. The other reviewers who give this a five star review are probably friends of the authors - sorry, guys, but this book with this edition should be trashed - it reminds me of the poor quality that TAB books used to put out - BTW, weren't they purchased by McGraw-Hill a number of years ago - could the same marketeers still be there - RECALL THIS BOOK MCGRAW HILL IF YOU HAVE ANY DECENCY - CONGRESS WOULD FORCE YOU TOO IF YOU WERE MANUFACTURING CARS!"},{"Title":"Perl 5 Complete","review":"I feel very strongly that the publishers of this book should provide an errata sheet as the sheer quantity of errors completely spoils an otherwise excellent book.

This book is riddled with errors. For instance, take a look at the function simple_recursion on page 151. This is an infinite loop! On page 216, the author talks about dereferencing complex data structures and describes (very poorly, I might add) - three rules, numbered 1,2 and 3. And then he refers to the nonexistent rules No.4 and No. 2b on page 218! These are just a couple of instances that I have mentioned here. Virtually every page has such errors that it really takes the joy out of learning new concepts. If you are new to perl, stay away from this book. Pick a copy of the Llama book, or better yet, buy the PERL CD bookshelf. Read the Llama book first, cover to cover. I am giving this two stars - because there is some good in it if you read it in conjunction with the Perl CD bookshelf. I really think that McGraw Hill should give the (corrected) second edition free to those who unwittingly bought a copy of the first edition."},{"Title":"Perl 5 Complete","review":"I am currently using &quot;Perl 5 Complete&quot; as a first exposure to Perl.

This book takes everything that has made the classics so good, and has gone one step higher. The writing style is outstanding, and it is very rare to find any technical book that works so well for handling the beginner-to-accomplished range of the readers.

Great book. Much better than any other book on Perl that I've seen. Very informative without being a dry textbook. Perfectly organized and contains a wealth of important material that is very difficult, if possible at all to find in any other Perl book I know. Very mature, &quot;thinking&quot; approach to Perl. I'm already recommending the book to my friends. IMHO, an ideal book for studing Perl."},{"Title":"Perl 5 Complete","review":"This is one of the most unorganized books I have ever read. I just started learning Perl, and I used this book because it was available in the library. I read up to chapter 10. One big problem with this book is that the Index is very short and the book is huge, so most of the time I cannot find a reference pointer to the subject I am interested. The index is basically useless. So I have wasted a lot of time trying to find information about a specific subject by browsing the book until I found a relevant heading. There seems to be tones of information in this book but, the organization is terrible; it is as if they had just dumped a lot of scattered information into one book, without beeing concerned about the logical flow. After chapter 10, the topics are very advanced, but they are not introduced properly. There is the assumption that you already know a lot of object oriented programming. I have given up on this book and threw it away. I never write book reviews but I felt compelled to do it today, because this book just got to my nerves by wasting so much of my time. I hope you don't waste your money on this book."},{"Title":"Perl 5 Complete","review":"This book has great examples and I liked the sequence it was written in, there are a few typos but nothing the reader can't figure out, also some of the code is not explained sufficiently, overall the best Perl book I've found.peter.rios@mciworld.com"},{"Title":"Perl 5 Complete","review":"There is a lot of good material in this book, but...First, the index is lousy, and I think calling it lousy is being overly kind. For example, &quot;.&quot; in the index references regular expressions but not as the string concatenation operator. Some keywords are not in the index (i.e., sub). Overall the book is twice as long as the Camel book (Programming Perl) but the index is shorter and double spaced, compared to the Camel book's single spaced index.The author has a tendency to use features before describing them, which can be confusing. He also often makes statements that require some back knowledge to understand.As others have noted there are lots of typos and just plain bugs. I find myself typing his code snippets into Perl and executing them to see whether they're correct. Perhaps this is a GOOD THING - putting me in the position of fact checker.On the plus side there is a lot of material here, especially about Perl 5 and Object Oriented stuff. The chapter on Regular Expressions has some great material.If you want to use the CD that comes with the book you must go to the errata site because it won't install properly without fixes you find there. You should probably go there anyway to mark up your copy with corrections.I'd give this book five stars for the breadth of material, but not being able to find things in the index makes the material less useful and costs a star in my rating. The fact that there are so many errors knocks another star off my rating.There is a pretty good book lurking inside of this book. Perhaps the second edition will be better. Maybe people should wait for that edition, but there is a lot of useful material here, that can be used now.

I've logged dozens in the first couple hundred pages...Here are couple of my favorites (note that the inablility to use HTML tags hampers the readablilty somewhat):&lt;Example 1&gt; page 89, which has no less than 3 typos:1) Figure 3.3 shows clearly that if@array = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'string1', 'string2');thenprint @array[2,3];prints the 3rd and fourth members of @array (ie: '34'), but the text directly below states that it will print out '23'.2) the block of code directly below reads:@array1 = ('This', 'is', 'an', 'array'); # four-element array@Numberarray = (1, 2, 3, 4 ,5); # array of numbers@EmptyArry = (); # empty array$Array2[0] = 'elem0'; # element 0 of array2 equald 'elem0'The typo is harmless here ('equald' in the the final comment), but I'd like to note that the variation in capitalization of variable names and the odd spacing in the comments (which I have faithfully reproduced) destroy some of the parallism of these examples.3) I reproduced all of the code above because the next line is another typo:print &quot;@array1\\\\n&quot;; # Example: printing out an array -- by default prints '1 2 3 4 5';This is bad, @array1 is defined above to be ('This', 'is', 'an', 'array') so this should print out 'This is an array'.What does 'by default' mean to a newbie? $&quot; is not mentioned, so this seems a lil' bit ambiguous... maybe it means if an array is undef?!? :P&lt;Example 2&gt; On page 119:It isn't bad enough that the book consistanly refers the the 'if...elsif...else' control structure as the 'if...else...elsif' control structure, the also have this whopper:&quot;Formally, the if then if...else..elsif. elseelse elsif syntax looks like Figure 4.4.&quot;(also at the top of page 143 the if..then contruct shows up again)Honestly, I can't really recomend this book."},{"Title":"Genesis-A Live Guide 1969-1975: Play Me My Song","review":"Taking inspiration from Louis Rey, Russell presents a detailed examination of Genesis live through the Peter Gabriel years. He reviews every tape in circulation, and even some that are not in circulation (where are those Lamb soundboards??) This book presents great summeries of each show that still exists along with some comments about the quality of the tape and relevant cuts.We even have an exclusive interview with Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford and Anthony Phillips where the author asks the exact detailed questions that are on every collector's mind (details about \\"The Light\\" for example).I only wish Russell would have given relevent boot citations for the tape he describes (like Rey does).

I was not disappointed because it was a good choice! Not only does the author give great descriptions of what he extrapolated from his bootleg recordings of early concerts, but he also went through the trouble of transcribing the little stories Peter Gabriel told while the rest of the band tuned their instruments. I am a big fan of early Genesis, (1970-1977) and this is a must have for those who are interested in that era."},{"Title":"Cry Republic","review":"This fine adventure story wraps up Kirk Mitchell's &quot;Procurator&quot; trilogy. The first book (&quot;Procurator&quot;) introduced Germanicus Agricola, military governor of Anatolia, serving in the name of a Roman Empire that never fell. In the next book, Germanicus travelled to the New World, to make war with the bellicose Aztec Empire, and their enigmatic Chinese allies. Throughout his career, however, Germanicus had only one goal: the dismantling of the Empire, and the ultimate restoration of the legendary Republic.Alas, the tradition-minded Empire has little room for idealists. Germanicus, his plot detected before it can reach fruition, is forced to flee East in fear for his life. Meanwhile, a cruel usurper seizes the Roman throne, determined to profit from the chaos. A bloodthirsty and paranoid tyrant, he ruthlessly goes about the task of eliminating his rivals. His main target, inevitably, is Germanicus...Germanicus himself makes his way to Anatolia, in the desperate hope of finding allies, or, more probably, a peaceful death. He finds more than he could have expected, however. For in the East, away from the pagan heartland of the Empire, monotheism has survived through the milennia. And now, both the Jews of Palestine and the Muslim-like Anatolians see something special in this _pasa_ from the West, something which may forever change the course of events, both temporal and spiritual.This book, like the previous ones, provides a satisfying mixture of alternate history and theological fantasy. The timeline is not particularly plausible (the Imperial structure has apparently survived almost completely unchanged for two thousand years), but the static and conservative empire, straining on the brink of a major technological revolution, makes a fascinating setting.An excellent concluding book."},{"Title":"Cry Republic","review":"'Cry Repbulic' concludes the trilogy started by 'Procurator,' in which ancient Rome never fell. Written by Kirk Mitchell, history as we know it was changed when Pontius Pilate spared Jesus Christ from the cross. Without its Martyr, Christianity never rose to take root in the Empire, eventually erroding its strength and causing its crumble.Germanicus Agricola began the series as a Procurator. Through a failed coup, most of the Imperial family was killed, and the title of Emporer fell to Germanicus. Over the course of adventures in the East and in the New World, Germanicus attempted to solidify his power....only so he could give it all away. His goal, from the beginning of his reign, has been to restore Rome to a Republic.However, the very individuals that seek to gain the most from this arrangement, the Senators, stand the most firmly in his way. They have grown use to living a privileged lifestyle; the rise of a Republic would make them have to work. They help plot Germanicus' overthrow with Nepos, a high ranking Emporer's aide. Nepos conspires with Claudia, the mother of Germanicus' adopted son, to assassinate Germanicus and assume 'the Purple'--the rank of Emporer.Germanicus manages to escape with the aide of his most loyal bodyguard, the German Rolf, and another advisor from the Far East, Tora.The most intriguing part of these novels is to watch the Rome that never fell attempt to weave modern technology into the Empire. For the most part, the Empire has been resistant. Electric power is in its infancy. Gunpowder and firearms are generations behind modern day warfare. The automobile is practically nonexistant. The first airplane of the series is seen in the last novel. The Romans may have been stubborn enough to conquer the known world, but that same stubborness appears to have prevented the world from evolving much.'Cry Republic,' like its predecessors, is steeped in theological mystery. The mystery of Christ, who appears to have moved onwards towards China after his pardon, is touched on throughout the series. The Jews still make their home in Isreal. Germanicus is somewhat torn between the Roman Gods of his homeland and the intriguing faith he discovers as he flees.My greatest complaint with this novel, and the series for that matter, is that it is often difficult to determine where things are happening. Mitchell uses a lot of latin names for locations that are not obvious, unless of course you have studied latin. The same problem holds true for some technological innovations. After enough reading, even the casual reader can figure out what is meant. However, this leads to frustration and often a plodding story line.That being said, this is still an excellent alternative history novel. It gets away from the Civil War and World War II, both favorites of most alternative history authors, and is compelling. I highly recommend this series to alternative history fans, Roman history buff, and those interested in theological fiction."},{"Title":"Cry Republic","review":"I would like to add my voice to all the others who have reviewed the \\"Procurator\\" trilogy, and given it a high rating.The books are a very satisfying read and despite the complaints of some about Mr. Mitchell's use of ancient names for locations and giving creative Latin names to some objects, I had no difficulty in following the plot. I would also like to say that his story telling skills are every bit as good as Harry Turtledove's and wish he would write in the alternative history genre more.Now that I've read the last book in the trilogy, \\"Cry Republic,\\" I'll miss Germanicus, Rolf, and Tora and wonder if they ever reunited and succeeded in establishing the republic. I hope some time in the future Mr. Mitchell will see fit to write another book and tie up all the loose ends he has left in his third book in this series."},{"Title":"Cry Republic","review":"This is the sequel to Procurator and New Barbarians, where Germanicus Julius Agricola eventually wound up becoming emperor in a Rome that never fell.

Now my husband (43), my son (12), and myself (37) are fighting over every book in the Squire's Tale series that we can get our hands on! We bought this book because we heard it was \\"good literature.\\" We had no idea HOW good until we read it. It is clever, witty, sarcastic, adventurous, and inspirational! My husband laughed so hard he cried! It is a very entertaining retelling of the King Arthur stories and Canterbury Tales, complete with knights, castles, princesses, magic, fairies, herbs with healing powers, and quests! The characters as sassy and full of spunk, and there is a new adventure around every corner. We recommended these books to our local library, some of the librarians read one of the books, and they ended up ordering a bunch of the books from The Squire's Tales series for the library. (This book is the seventh in the series but, personally, it's my favorite. My husband and son each have other favorites from this series, though, so you'll want to read them all.) It is easy to recommend such a charming and entertaining book!"},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"I am a King Arthur, And his knights of course, FREAK!! With this book I couldn't put it down! I really enjoy the twist that Gerald Morris put on Gawain. Terence and Eileen are the perfect couple and are both fun to read about. I didn't really like the way he portrayed Lancelot, but I really favor him, cause he is my favorite. Of coarse other charecters that he portrayed extremly well, ALMOST made up for it.Over all he did a great job with this tale that spins off A Squire's Tale.Can't wait to read the next book!"},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"You have to buy this book!It's absolutely FABULOUS!The story is the familiar one of sir Gawain and the green knight with a few unusal twists and turns.In this book sir Lancelot appears for the first time,but to the eyes of the reader he is not the great knight of the familiar Camelot tales,he is a self centered show knight who is intent on charming the ladies and making himself called the greatest knight of all England rather then helping Camelot.My favorite part in the book is at the very end when Gunivere puts him in his place.However Lancelot is not the only new character in this book,on their way to face the green knight terence and sir Gawain pick up a young girl named Eileen with no shortage of attitude.Terrence who is the main character learns alittle more about himself and his faery bloodand earns himself a title. I hope you enjoy this book because I certainly did."},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"I was searching the library selves one afternoon because I had nothing better to do. I was bored of reading the same magazines over and over and I longed for some adventure on the rainy days. I found this book on a shelf. I thought it looked boring and was about to put it back but something changed my mind. And boy was I wrong. Don't make my mistake, the old saying is true. DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER! (Did I make that clear enough?&quot; I was so impressed by this book, I couldn't put it down. So I snuck into the living room and read all night! This was a big mistake because I couldn't keep my eyes open in school. Before I read these I didn't really care for King Arthur. Now I want to read every book about him and his knights of the Round Table. The book deals with typical problems in life, and then there are the unbelievable parts in the book. It takes you on a roller coaster ride of events, from the challenge of the Green knight to the elfin villiage to the ghost of Sir Gawain's long dead sister, and the battle to get past the test of the sea and the test of the gate. Then this book also takes a serious turn and deals with problems we see today. For example Guenivere (Arthur's wife) messes around with Sir Lancelot and Gawain faces the shame of something, I won't give away. And he must forever were the green girdle to remind him of his mistake. All in all this book rocks!"},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"I read these books when I was in middle school and I absolutely loved them.

And this time Terence is the one winning the fair, and firey, maiden. A really nice book. And funny too."},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"Really, I would never have thought that a children's series would become some of my favorite books of all time. Yet, after my little sister convinced me to read the first book,The Squire's Tale (The Squire's Tales), my college-student self was fully won over by the lighthearted humor and expert storytelling Morris so deftly uses to bring boring Arthurian stories to life in ways that are more fun, more accessible, and as a result more instructive than the originals.If you've ever read the old classic \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\" in high school and were bored out of your mind, this is a retelling of that story that includes most of the major details while adding its own twists and making the whole experience five thousand times better. The fun comes from the side quests that Sir Gawain and Morris' own main character, Terence, encounter on their way to fulfilling the Green Knight's challenge. Not just a dumbed-down kids version of a classic, folks, this a whole new story that yet somehow keeps familiar elements! Along with the added dimension to the plot, Morris brings his characters to life fantastically. Lancelot is hilariously foppish and French, Gawain is genuine but sarcastic, Guinevere is silly and frivolous; new characters have a charm of their own, and all have a sort of simple depth that a child can understand and an adult can appreciate. Dialogue is always snappy and fun, humor is always in good taste, lessons are taught subtly. Really, I can't praise this literary work enough!I think what really makes this book (and the others in the series) so remarkable is the fact that anyone of any age and any literary experience can appreciate them. Children can enjoy themselves and understand what's going on, adults who don't normally like to read can laugh and enjoy the humor, and English nerds like myself can do all of the above while also appreciating the references the book makes to classical Arthurian works. Worth a buy for yourself, for a friend, for a child, for anyone!"},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"This is the second book in the wonderful Squire's Tales series.

I'll admit it! It's one of the best books I've ever read!Starting with a deadly challenge from an other-worldly knight, the book takes off on a series of cliff-hanging medieval adventures. In this book you'll enter a totally new world, brimming full of enchantments, magic, dimwits and more! The characters are interesting, witty and realistic. Although there's some romance in the end, this is a tale any one from 10-101 can read and enjoy. A sequel to The Squire's Tale, The Squire, His Knight and His Lady is a GREAT book to get lost in!"},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"I think this book is wonderful. I couldn't put it down. Gerald Morris' writing is amazing. He puts in a lot of humor and I really like that. I never laugh about funny stuff in books, but for this one I made an exception. I read both The Squire's Tale and The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady in two days, so it's a quick read but worth every minute of it."},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"This book is definatley worth while especially if you like a mixture of medival, fiction, adventure and mystery. Terence has been Gawain's squire for a few years now. There is a war with the Romans and Sir Lancelot makes his appearence. All the courtiers who once thought that Gawain was the Greatest Knight in England now worship Lancelot. The Queen and Lancelot have an obvious affair and Arthur is deeply hurt. A faery knight challenges the knights to a contest at a feast and Gawain takes the challenge. Terence and Gawain have to go on a quest and they encounter the Marquis of Alva, his niece who travelles with them Eileen, ghosts, Hag Annis, a knight with a boar head and many other knights, monsters and challenges. This is one of the best books ever!!!"},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"This is the tale of the humbling of Gawain, a legendary knight of the Round Table. It is told through the eyes of Gawain's squire, Terence. Gawain and Terence set out in search of the Green Knight. Along the way, they go on all sorts of adventures including a trip to the Otherworld. They rescue a pretty maiden named Eileen and fight evil boars! Gerald Morris is a superb writer making the book by turns funny and touching.

Then at dinner one night majestic knight shows up. He challenges one knight to take a swing at him with an ax then in a year the favor would be returned. They set out for the knight and many things come between them and their goal. Other characters in the story are King Arthur, Sir Lancelot, Eileen, and a little elf named Robin. Eileen is a woman they save and wishes to go with them on their adventures.The book was a great mix of knighthood and magic. If you are slightly interested in magic or knights you will love this book. It has great twists and turns throughout the book. The series flow together almost perfectly and things that seemed unimportant at one point turn out to be a main point later on. This book is a great book and I would definitely recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. This book is about the adventures of Sir Gawin. Some of the other characters are Sir Lancelot,a mega womanizer, who makes a move on the queen,and lady Eileen ,who really hates Terrance. But as usual they fall in love. But in all i found this book exciting expecially when all of the charecters go to visit the wizard. Over all i would recomend you read this book. And i give the book 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"I was looking in the library for a book and stumbled onto this one and it's sequals. I loved them all!

I wonder if he would want his own mother portrayed in such a manner? Since he is a baptist minister I can't believe he thought Our Lord would want us to picture His own mother,chosen by God above all others to hold within her womb His divine Son, as seductive. There is also a dialog between Sir Gwain and a priest where Sir Gwain is supposedly confessing his sins and the priest swears at him. A married woman also spent time with Sir Gwain in an invisible nightgown. I don't want my boys reading such material."},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady is the stunning sequel to A Squire's Tale that continues with Terence and Gawain's adventures. Gerald Morris doesn't fail to keep you laughing at the characters follys and feeling their confusion in parts of their quests. A story set in the midevel times with a new point of view on Sir Gawain's famous quests. In this book Gawain has to full-fill promise to a a green knight. That seemingly simple quest turns into a test of Sir Gawain and Terence's virtues and loyaltys."},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"I picked this up on my second pass through the library, because Arthurian legend is not really my niche. And boy am I glad I did!Shortly after the arrival of pretty-boy womanizer Lancelot, who immediately begins an affair with Queen Guinevere, an otherworldly knight called simply the &quot;Green Knight&quot; arrives to challenge one of Arthur's knights. Terence's master Gawain volunteers, and in a year must sacrifice his own life.Along the way to pay Gawain's debt, he and Terence meet up with a bizarre bunch of people, both of this world and the Otherworld. They also pick up a young woman named Eileen, independent and sharp-tonged, before arriving at the Green Knight's abode to be taught a lesson.Terence and Gawain are excellent characters, ironic and fresh and completely loyal to their king and country. King Arthur himself sheds the stuffiness of legend and resembles &quot;Star Trek&quot;'s Captain Kirk. Guinevere and Lancelot make you want to slap them, exactly as they're meant to. Eileen reminded me a great deal of Lloyd Alexander's Eilonwy, with her quick wit and mild disdain for any bumbling.Some references are made to the previous book, which makes it slightly more confusing (first time around I wondered, &quot;Who is Robin?&quot;) but not too much. With its mingled drama and comedy, this book is a treasure."},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"\\"The Squire, His Knight and His Lady\\" is a wonderful, enchanting book that I personally love. Mr. Morris' writing just brings every character to life, and makes you fall in love with them. Smart, sharp dialogue, great characters, well-written adventure/action scenes, romance and deceit, and even a few poignant moments are all combined into this book. Who could ask for more than that in a book?After a confrontation with the Green Knight, Gawain and Terence set out on an adventure that may resolve in Gawain's death. Along the way, they encounter an array of quirky characters, including the witty Lady Eileen. A wonderful, surprising ending leaves the reader in awe.ALL-AROUND EXCELLENT BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"What a delightful tale! The dialogue was great, the characters likeable, and the plot was excellent--an Arthurian story juiced up by Morris.Squire Terence is not happy with the changes that have come over Camelot. Silly and superficial Queen Guinevere is in the midst of an affair with equally silly and superficial Lancelot. Noble King Arthur is depressed and has no idea what to do about it. Court life is boring and the wild gossip is at a crescendo. When the Otherworldly Green Knight comes to court with the proposal for a \\"game\\", Gawain (Terence's knight) is the only knight brave enough to accept and save Arthur's life. In a year's time he will meet up with the Green Knight and inevitably meet his doom. So Terence and Gawain set out on the quest to find the strange knight and meet an assortment of quirky characters, including Lady Eileen, who ends up traveling with them on their quest. Terence and Eileen actually don't get along well at all. They have many adventures, but the year is ending soon and they have no idea where the Green Chapel, home of the Green Knight, is. They come to a castle, which they find out is not far from the Green Chapel at all. Here Gawain plays a game, and finds out the meaning of honor. When he finally meets the Green Knight once more, he learns the meaning of shame. And when he has to pass two unexpected tests, he learns his own worthiness.A wonderful read. I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you like drama, romance, or just a well-spun tale, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"The Squire, His Knight, & His Lady is a delightful book full of humor, action, and a little romance. The tale revolves around the knight Sir Gawain, King Arthur's nephew, and his squire Terance. Around Christmas time, Camelot's celebration was rudely interrupted by the Roman delegation. The ambassador's words and actions greatly angered King Arthur enough to declare war. The festivities were barely underway when there was a second interruption. This time it was the Green Knight from the Green Chapel. In the end, Sir Gawain takes Arthur's place in meeting the Green Knight's challenge. Little did he know that it would end up leading him into one of his greatest adventures, and a contest that can lead to his death.The adventures of Gawain and Terance were many and kept this book interesting. My favorite adventures happened along the way to the Green Chapel where Terance and Gwain met and assortment of characters. The most interesting to me was the \\"Dreaded Huntsman of Anglesey,\\" whose comic story gave new meaning to how rumors spread and is embellished. Eccentric Parsifal was another of my favorites because he showed great perseverance in wanting to be a knight. A delightful and strong woman was Lady Eileen, who Terance rescued from the villainous Marquis of Alva. Last, but not least, there was the unforgettable Sir Bercilak and his Lady wife, from whom Gawain learns a lesson in shame.The lessons of loyalty, strength, bravery, and compassion are seen in nearly all books of similar genre, but to learn the hardest lessons of life like shame, sacrifice, humbleness, and forgiveness makes this book stand out from the other books I've read. It was very difficult to find fault with this book and the valuable lessons it teaches us. However, in crucial places the descriptions were vague and ambiguous. I would have liked to understand more about the fairy people and their ways of life. Similarily I would have liked to have seen more of Morgan Le Fey in this book as she is a vital part of Camelot and the fairy kingdom."},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"This book is really funny. It only reminded me a little of Lloyd Alexander's Prydain Chronicles, though I have heard it called almost the same. The style of writing is extremely funny, and anyone looking for a similar style of writing should read P.C. Wrede's Enchanted Forest Chronicles and Sorcery & Cecelia.The characters were well done, and I found the attitude towards Guinevere, French Knights and Lancelot very funny. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"Gawain and Terence begin their journeys once again in this sequel to The Squire's Tale. In this book, Gawain is to meet his death by a way that you must read to find out. He has one year to live. During this year he must find the Green Knight. This story is not only on Gawain however. Terence finds out more about himself, his family, learns what it takes to be a knight, and even finds romance in this divine novel written by Gerald Morris. A suggestion that I may give you: If you liked this book I highly recommend the Savage Damsel and her dwarf."},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"I borrowed The Squire, His Knight and His Lady from my public library. This is a wonderful book! I like it very much because it is based off of Arthurian Legends, but goes into greater detail about each of the characters and their own challenges and personalities. I read this before I read The Squire's Tale, which is book one, because I was unaware that it was a series, but was satisfied enough to read it in backwards order. It would have been all the more exciting, however, to read it in the right order. I am still reading The Squire's Tale, have the next book waiting, and hope to find the next few books at my library as well. It might not be the most fast-paced book, but still I enjoyed it very much.The main character is Terence, who becomes squire to Sir Gawain, one of King Arthur's knights. It also involves several battles, and lovely Ladies. I really did like this book a lot."},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"A livly and involving adventure.

Fantasy lovers, don't pass this one up!I really like Terrance, in fact, I became attached to all the characters. I am hoping against hope for a trilogy. =)"},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"I really enjoyed this book, though not as much as &quot;A Squire's Tale&quot;. This book continues to follow the adventures of Sir Gawain, and his squire, Terrence, of who the story is based around. We also get some new faces, including Sir Lancelot, a mega womanizer, who makes a move on the queen, and Lady Eileen, who at first hates Terrence (and visa-versa), but then of course they fall madly in love. This book also features the Green Knight, sort of like a Darth Vader, but in green. He plays all sorts of mind games on Gawian, and kind of confuses the story a bit. But all in all, I found this book to be pretty good, especialy for the part when Gawain, Terrence and Eileen visit Terrence's father, the great wizard (sorry, fogot his name), and except for the part where Queen Guienevere turns all bitchy on the king, and falls for Lancelot, the supreme a-hole of the round table. But hey, just skip these parts-Nishana"},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"There are a ton of Arthurian retellings out there, many of which bother me. Either the language makes it almost unreadable, or it's so modernized it's no longer Arthur. Morris balances the two beautifully; the characters speak in understandable (and often hilarious) ways, but he doesn't sacrifice the heart of the story. The humor adds, rather than detracts, and the serious bits don't seem at all out of place.I was rather skeptical when told about this series. \\"O great, another Arthur retelling\\", but this book (and the others in the series I've read) really handles a great story in a great way. Not to be reading to much into it, but there's a bit of veiled symbolism in it too, if you look. Nothing heavy, just enough that you notice more the second time you read it.

And i give the book 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"&amp;#65279;The Squire, his Knight and his Lady, was a book based on several of the Arthurian legends involving Sir Gawain, told from the perspective of his squire, Terrence. Unfortunately this book was a sequel to another book, The Squire's Tale, which I had not yet read, so several parts of the plot were lost on me. But I enjoyed how true the story stayed to the original legends. This particular tale was about Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, but bespoke of several other adventures as well. It must have been a challenge for Morris to present his characters in a new way, since they are all so well known, but he met the challenge admirably and even threw some new light on the love affair between Launcelot and Guinevere. Throughout the book I continually received the impression that the author was attempting to imitate the style of previous Arthurian Chronicles. If this was the case, then I'm afraid Morris sadly failed in this area, not only was his story filled withconversations and events that seemed awkward and out of place, but his characters communicated using terminology more likely to be found in a modern conversation than in Medieval England. Despite all those minor annoyances I enjoyed reading this book and would certainly recommend it to readers who share a love for the Arthurian tales and legends."},{"Title":"The Squire, His Knight, and His Lady","review":"Sure, it's a good book but please, the whole plot is borrowed. The names, plot, personaliy, everything seems the same as Lloyd Alexander's books. I mean Taran and Terence, Eilonwy and Eileen. Eileen is sooooo much like Lloyd Alexander's Eilonwy. I love the parts at the castle with King Arther ect. but the rest of the story......Maybe I'm just being picky but I really think that if Gerald Morris can't come up with his own names then he shouldn't be writing.To anyone out there who likes Lloyd Alexander then don't read this book. It makes you feel cheated. If you haven't read his books then maybe you will like this book.

While the language can seem a bit dated at times, the meaning shines clearly through; clearly she has taken her own advice or writing truly and focusing on the things one cares about or is passionate about. To read it is almost to become hypnotized by her major themes: you are talented, you have a story or an observation to tell, you can write really well if you are true (not trying to be writerly), you need to enjoy the act of writing and be lazy about it, you need to relax and enjoy the beginnings in hazy territory. This is a good book to read to get you back into old habits, or to help writers re-assess their long-held and perhaps erroneous beliefs about what it actually takes to be a good writer. Ueland excerpts student writing to show examples, and the pieces she uses are very compelling, strong and true. I recommend this to writers and as gifts for writers. But I wouldn't suggest it for someone younger than 25.

Being a writer (Catholic Business Journal, blogs, and Amazon book reviews), an oil painter, and curious, I picked up a copy to see why all the fuss about a book that was originally published in 1938. I have since learned that none other than Carl Sandburg provided his endorsement to \\"The best book ever written about how to write.\\"Author Brenda Ueland was born in Minneapolis (my former home) in 1891, and lived on Lake Calhoun (the lake featured in the Mary Tyler Moore show's opening clip). She was knighted by the King of Norway and set an international swimming record (for over-80-year-olds). She died in 1985 at the age of 93.This book, according to many preceding me, has inspired thousands to find the creative genius buried deep within, and to express it without any regard to \\"criticism, self-doubt, duty, nervous fear, anxiety, about making a living, and fear of not excelling.\\" Ueland affirms that we are all filled with possibility, have a creative power which be kept alive in all of us for all of our lives. It is our Spirit and we keep it alive by using it.This book is a gem and is bound to inspire all to open up, explore their Spirit, and put it to good use. I would expand Sandburg's quote to - maybe the best book ever written on using our inner genius and creativity, whether it is writing, composing, or the visual arts.

This is the best book I've ever read on writing. Brenda Ueland claims there are two types of writing coaches: those who are critical, clenching types, and those who are angels, sent from beyond to encourage anyone--experienced or not--to put words down, without trying to be \\"literary\\" or too clever or cute, but simply tell a story with honesty and generosity towards the reader.

All I know is that no book has changed my life as dramatically as this one did when I was 13. I'm only slightly exaggerating when I say that this book has the power to cure minor mental disorders and to help you find direction in your life. Reading this book was like one long epiphany for me. It is an energizing read, written in simple, clear, vivacious prose by a woman without a shred of pomposity but with fierce, passionate beliefs about art and individualism, a la William Blake.Looking at this book from a more detached perspective, I think Ueland could justly be viewed as a proponent of American Romanticism, a scion of the nature-based (as opposed to nurture-based, or formal-education-based) philosophical tradition that gave us greats like Whitman and Thoreau.

So, I confess: I haven't read the whole work. I did read about 50 pages, then skimmed through the rest of it. The author means well, and apparently meets the needs of some readers, but I found it to be light and fluffy, with talk about divine ego and soul and so on. I thought it was poorly edited, but I could have overlooked that to a certain degree, if the book had more \\"meat\\" in it for me.I took it off my shelves and put it together with books I'm donating to the used-book sale of my local library. Skeptical of my view? Well, the Suggested Reading list (very spare and geared to positive thinking, not writing a book) had a couple of titles about thinking yourself rich and the laws of success. I think this gives a fair idea of the mindset of the author of this slight book. The one I have is a BN Publishing copy. I had no idea when the book was written or what qualifications, if any, the author had.

I felt that the book was more about developing self esteem and learning that you are good enough to write. If you already are confident that you can write, but simply haven't opened the doors to your creativity, you may want to search for other reading material."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"This book is based upon Brenda Ueland's experience teaching creative writing to adults and her success at freeing many of her students from inhibitions that prevented them from writing well. It is basically a \\"pep talk\\" for anyone who thinks they cannot write or have nothing important to say. And it has some interesting insights about the mysterious nature of inspiration and the role leisure plays in creativity. [\\"Leisure: The Basis of Culture,\\" by Josef Pieper, is a more advanced exploration of this theme.] However, the book is interlaced with so much dubious philosophy that I cannot recommend it.For example, on page 129, Brenda begins with this gem: \\"I have come to think that the only way to become a better writer is to become a better person.\\" However, she then ruins this thought by saying that by \\"better person\\" she does not mean a good person \\"for a great person often does things that so-called good people think very bad indeed.\\" She does not explain what she means by a great person. But it seems to mean someone who is an independent thinker; an astute observer who does not accept social conventions or values that cannot be affirmed through their own inner wisdom. Brenda does not consider the possibility that one's inner \\"truth\\" can be faulty.She relies upon quotations from the poet William Blake (one of her great people), entitling Chapter Five: \\"Sooner Strangle an Infant in its Cradle than Nurse Unacted Desires,\\" based upon one of his noble sentiments about deferred gratification. Blake saw visions and heard voices which he believed were Divine rather than demonic. Brenda also prefers this interpretation and thus agrees with Blake's conclusion that our inner voice which says \\"Thou shalt\\" is our true conscience, while the voice that counsels \\"Thou shalt not\\" is the product of learned behavior and should be rejected. (See page 13 and footnote on page 35.)Later, on page 174, the author reveals herself to be a ho-hum, garden-variety relativist. She writes, \\"If it is true to you, it is true. Another truth may take its place later. What is truly from me is true, whether anybody believes it or not. It is my truth.\\"The problem with all this philosophy is that the author tells the reader that they too must tend toward the amoral and asocial aspects of the psychopathic personality if they want to be an independent thinker and hence, a great writer. She teaches that the end justifies the means. Whatever gets the creative juices flowing is justified. And the stream of consciousness that gushes forth, whether polluted or pristine, is art. It is art because it is true to the inner self of the artist, who has learned to cast off all restraint, fear, and ambition. (I wonder what Brenda would think about the latest notions of modern psychology that radical independence is a less mature emotional state than cooperative inter-dependence?)Finally, the author presents her view as an either/or scenario. Either you adopt the reckless and rule-less approach to writing, or you're creativity will be stymied. She does not allow for the option that one can be creative and value-oriented at the same time. Potential readers of this work should be aware that behind the enthusiastic pep talk there lurks a relativistic philosophy which may not correspond with their personal beliefs."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"I ordered my book from lynn bookcase and got it just a few days later.Yes, I would order from them again.

It has RUINED the aesthetics and sheer presence in the hand of an incredible, inspiring book for the creative writer. DO NOT buy this version. It looks like a vanity press gone even more wrong. The pages have no gutters, there are typos, no bio on Ms. Ueland which is VITAL to understanding the philosophy of this book. The cover \\"art\\" cheapens the subject matter (\\"Once upon a time\\"???! WHAT!!?). Ms. Ueland would be appalled to see her work presented in such a cheap way. What a disgrace. The publisher should be ASHAMED.It doesn't even have the original pub date -- 1938 -- in the nearly non-existent front matter. It reads: \\"First Printing, 2010\\" !! What the....!!? Did you know Ms. Ueland was born in 1891 and lived to be nearly 100? That info is not included in this version (surprise, surprise), but look her up online, learn about this woman, and you'll find her writings even more amazing.I have purchased dozens of copies of this book for friends and family -- copies of the older Graywolf Press version which is lovely, classy. Matches the dignity of the writing.I purchased this copy for a gift, and when it arrived and I looked it over, it wasn't fit to give. I am sending it back and just now bought an older copy from a third-party vendor via Amazon.REAL publishers: here is your chance to pick up the rights to this book and do it justice!!Here is my ORIGINAL review from January 2008 based on the Graywolf Press printing and true CONTENT presented beautifully: \\"If you're a writer, you must add this book to your shelf of writing references and \\"books to inspire.\\" A true writer's book on writing.

This book is on that list.Brenda Ueland's message is simple - yet profoundly impactful. She explains that each of us, if we are willing to trust and listen to TRUE selves - not what others think or society thinks we can become great writers (or painters or musicians).She hates critics. She believes that we all have the capacity to create great writing.. if we'll believe in our selves."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"Wow. This book was one of the best gifts I've ever received. It is incredible. I understand those, looking for something technical, would find it 'boring'. I used to be a biochemist, then a lawyer. Now, I'm a singer and landscape designer. Suddenly, it's clear: I am 'in' the world, but I am not 'of' the world. Being 'in your head' is essential (mustn't skip that step, esp for we head cases). But, FINALLY, I have experienced that what comes from the HEART is what lives forever. When I sing, people don't remember whether I got the right notes at the right time .... rather, they remember that they were deeply touched. You can touch people too!

If you want a technical book about writing, this wont do it for you. But if you want to put yourself on paper for the world to share, this is it.

It's difficult to believe it was written in 1938, because it is as pertinent now as it ever was. Even Carl Sandburg called it &quot;The best book ever written about how to write.'Brenda Ueland says, '...we must...find our True Conscience...the very Center, for (there lie) all originality, talent, honor, truthfulness, and courage.'If you want to write, read If You Want to Write."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"This book is outstanding. It stands the test of time because what it talks about are basic and intrinsic truths about writing and creating. Rather than proscribe exercises to work-out your writing muscles or other superficial tricks, Ueland tells you the basics of the CREATIVE PROCESS, which holds true for any kind of art. While these things are fundamental, they are not common knowledge. Many thanks to her for pointing out the building blocks in such a supportive and encouraging (and comical) way. You will want to write volumes after having read this."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"I decided to read \\"If You Want to Write\\", since it was mentioned in Robert J. Ray's \\"The Weekend Novelist\\", which was immensely helpful to me in improving many areas of my writing. I had hit a bit of a stumbling block in my own writing, and, so I thought I'd see what a book of a different style had to offer. I'm glad to see that this book has gotten a new printing for 2007.I had gotten pretty good at all of the planning stages of writing; making character sketches, summaries of chapters/plot, and other related activities. But, as far as writing the actual text of the novel, I wasn't doing so well. I liked writing stories for fun, but I wasn't turning out anything publishable. When I looked over what I had written, I felt that it was lacking a certain quality, but I couldn't place what it was.The first aspect of this book that really struck me was its free-flowing, non-rigid structure. Many books that offer writing instruction are rather strict, telling the would-be author how to lay out their plot, how to write their opening scene. Not that this is always bad. 'The Weekend Novelist' has a very precise layout, of course allowing the writer creative liberties. Structure is good for keeping a person in-line and motivated about their novel, so they don't drift off to some other project. However, rigidity doesn't offer much inspiration for a beginning writer. This is where Ueland's little book comes in handy!\\"If You Want to Write\\" is peppered with valuable suggestions, coming from Ueland's own life-experience as a writer and her observations on the writing of others. Ueland's advice about writing for an audience in chapter 16 was quite useful to me: \\"...it helps often, to have an imaginary listener when you are writing, telling a story, so that you will be interesting and convincing throughout.\\" When I read this, I though, \\"Oh! This is what has been missing from my novel-writing all along.\\" You see, when I am writing my character sketches or plot summaries (or Amazon reviews!), my writing is better because I show them to people and I am KEEPING that fact in mind while writing them. When I am writing passages for my stories, I write differently. I am trying to hard to use clever words and I revise repeatedly with slight adjustments; I go into a panic, almost! The problem has been that I'm not keeping an audience in mind, since (when writing my stories) I'm not really writing to entertain an audience or for the purpose of sharing my ideas. There are numerous other helpful pieces of information scattered throughout, and the reader will probably find passages such as the above that shed light on what has been missing from their own writing.The last chapter summarizes the guidelines given in the book, which I'll abridge here: 1) \\"Know that you have talent, are original, and have something important to say.\\", 2) \\"Know that it is good to work. Work with love and think of liking it when you do it.\\", 3) \\"Write freely, recklessly in first drafts.\\", 4) \\"Tackle anything you want to-novels, plays, anything.\\", 5) \\"Don't be afraid of writing bad stories. To discover what is wrong with a story, write two new ones and then go back to it.\\", 6) \\"Don't be ashamed of what you've written in the past\\", 7) \\"Try to discover your true self.\\", 8) \\"Think of yourself as incandescent power.\\", 9) \\"If you are never satisfied with what you write, that is a good sign. It means your vision can see so far that it is hard to come up to it.\\", 10), Quote from Van Gogh: \\"If you hear a voice within you saying: You are no painter, then paint by all means lad, and that voice will be silenced, but only by working.\\", 11) \\"Don't be afraid of yourself when you write.\\", and 12) \\"Don't always be appraising yourself, wondering if you are better or worse than other writers.\\""},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"The more I read from Ueland, the more I became convinced that I had found a book that would be yellowed and dog-eared on my bedside table thirty years from now. Each observation that she makes feels so common-sensical, friendly and right at its core that it seems as though someone ought to have pointed it all out to you before. This is not the typical self-conscious guide to life or writing; it's a conversation and an excercise in encouragement."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"This book was brought to my attention by Felicia Day in her YouTube show, The Flog. I am a great admirer of Ms. Day as a major DIYer and creative force. She inspires me and makes me laugh whenever I watch one of her videos or her work in the last season of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-a-long Blog.\\" So when she mentioned this as her one of her Fave Fives a number of episodes ago, I decided to check it out.I originally got the audio version (abridged, ugh) from the library. It was not what I expected--it was much more. I have a number of writing books but none has downright inspired me to my core. Ms. Ueland teaches the belief that I teach in my memoir writing classes--everyone has a story to tell. Everyone is fascinating. But to this she adds that you need to be truthful and approach things with passion. I think this is the perfect book for the creative person (or frustrated person who doesn't think he or she is creative) who is blocked. And it isn't just for writers. It's for all artists and creative thinkers. One person on here said it should be titled \\"If You Want to Live,\\" and I completely agree.Perhaps not all people will appreciate this book. It's not an instruction manual, nor does it have exercises or assignments. It just speaks to your soul. And sometimes that's more important.I highly recommend it to anyone in need of being picked up and those who need a boost to the soul."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"I loved this book. Brenda stresses that writing is about telling the truth and the importance of imagination. The truth she speaks of is the writer's own truth. What is seen in the imagination. And not writing what is not seen. She judges writing based on whether she believes it and encourages writers not to add descriptions that they cannot see in their imagination. She believes imagination comes from God, though I don't consider this book religious. She abhors critics who judge but don't create. An enjoyable paradox since she critiques several pieces of writing, primarily for not being honest. She encourages free, messy, journal style writing in order find one's own voice. She addresses the concept of writer's block by saying that the creative process is slow, and encourages us to slow down, remove distractions, and listen patiently. I feel very inspired and capable to write after reading this book."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"Excellent book/in perfect condition!

Brenda Ueland proves that such thoughts just aren't true, that everyone has originality and talent. She also explains why 'constructive criticism' isn't really constructive at ALL.But this book isn't just a motivational tool - she also includes helpful suggestions for readers to actually get started on their writing.So if you want to write, but don't know how to get started, get this book - and go for it :)"},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"Brenda Ueland offers an on-going pep talk for the writer trying to find his/her place, trying to get started, or just reconsidering their craft.

One minute she's saying that you should never ever criticize someone's writing, next minute she's telling us which sample of writing is better than the other and which we should emulate. She actually says that her students' writing was better than someone who's already been published, which was alright at first but after about 10 different examples of her bashing the published writer, I found her to be quite pompous. All writing is subjective, and I don't see what gives her the right to tell us which writing is BETTER than another, based on HER point of view. I felt like I was being yanked around by a leash. She also says we should just sit around being lazy and idle, and that it's a good thing. I'm sorry, I just don't see it her way. It's like a recipe for disaster. Anyway, that's just my take on it.

Though she has gone on to her reward long ago she still speaks. She penned this book in 1938 and it still sells well. Carl Sandburg said it may have been the best book about writing he'd ever read. She doesn't deal with dry grammar and such, but deals with the human spirit and how to communicate with -- what she calls -- \\"microscopic truthfullness\\". My favorite quotes from this book, which I carry in my heart, are these: \\"Everyone is unique, talented, and has something important to say...\\" along with \\"Writing is talking on paper.\\" It is delightful to see Ms Ueland demonstrate what she teaches in her own writing and that of the humble students in her class whose writing samples she shares.

It turned out to be OK for me.My book was published by Bottom of the Hill Publishing and to me it is well done. I understand that people have their preferences on how things look, there is mention about chapter titles being on the left in one review. This copy looks fine to me. The footnotes are at the end of the chapters not in the text as in others. There are odd spellings and words but I believe that they are common the period which this book was written. All in all the book looks good, and the cover is what attracted me, someone mentioned the \\"once upon a time...\\", which I find quaint.As for the subject matter and its presentation, I found it interesting but not fantastic. It was written in the 1930's and at that time may have been cutting edge but I know of many blogs that inspired me much more and have more relevant information.

The tone and writing are still true to form, but it just somehow feels overlong after awhile.The overarching theme of unleashing your creative spirit does come around by the end even though it lacks the magic from the beginning. I recommended this reading for any artist who has ever doubted her own ability."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"In my world a book like this gets two strikes against it. It's non-fiction, and falls into the category of \\"self-help\\". This should immediately tell anyone how incredible it must be if I'm still giving it five stars. In 150 pages Brenda will convince you that exploring your own creativity will be the single greatest journey you can take, and show you exactly how to get started. Though it's focused on writing, this book is really about any art form. It is a how-to manual, for being a more creative person in every regard.I wish someone would've given this to me in high school. That time in my life when everything was about conforming, and acceptance. This book is encourages the exact opposite, and then makes you feel so comfortable about the break away. Every chapter has wisdom, not simply good information, but real wisdom like this:\\"I learned that inspirations does not come like a bolt, nor is it kinetic, energetic striving, but it comes into us slowly and quietly and all the time, though we must regularly and everyday give it a little chance to start flowing, prime it with a little solitude and idleness.\\"\\"That is why most people are so afraid of being alone. For after a few minutes of unpleasant mental vacancy, the creative thoughts begin to come. And these thoughts at first are bound to be depressing because the first thing they say is: what a senseless thing life is with nothing but talk, meals, reading, uninteresting work, and listening to the radio. But that is the beginning. It is just where your imagination is leading you to see how life can be better. But if you would only persist.\\""},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"This is far and away one of the best books I have ever read on writing, and I've read dozens. If you're hesitant to begin, if you're blocked, if you're a seasoned writer, you will benefit from Ueland's insight and encouragement. Her writing style is easy and engaging. Not only will I read this again, I'll read it again very soon."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"This book is as alive, vibrant and inspirational as when it was first written. It encourages, urges the reader to find and claim her/his own voice."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"I'm a writer and have read a lot of books about writing. This is one of my favorites. Contrary to what a few reviewers said, I do not think this book is only for beginning or immature writers. I've been writing for about 25 years and it spoke to me in a place where I needed it. I believe only something like two percent of writers actually earn even close to a living wage from writing, so there have got to be ton of slightly disheartened writers out there. This book will soothe exactly where it hurts and make you feel like writing even if you never sell one article or receive a contract for one book. If you're a writer wondering if it's all worth it, read this book."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"I came across this book when I was a senior in college, it is one of those books you will remember forever. The author understands how a writer feels inside, it is inspiring, and encouraging. Definitely something you want to pass on to your children and your children's children."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"This is an amazing book on writing. Unlike a lot of other books, this one will actually help you to get started writing. Go out and buy it right now if you want to Write!"},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"Originally written in 1937, this book is delightfully about how to write for pleasure, for the sheer joy of writing in your own voice, and for the enjoyment of telling a good story. Brenda does not believe in rules. \\"And now you will begin to work on your writing. Remember these things. Work with all your intelligence and love. Work freely and rollickingly as though they were talking to a friend who loves you. Mentally (at least three or four times a day) thumb your nose at all know-it-alls, jeerers, critics, doubters(p.9).\\" Brenda continues to encourage the expression of your true self through your writing on every page of her book. Her friend, the American poet Carl Sandburg, told her, \\"That is the best book ever written about how to write(p. xi).\\" She asks us to think about why we should all use our creative power and write or paint or play music, or whatever it tells us to do. \\"Because,\\" she answers, \\"there is nothing that makes people so generous, joyful, lively, bold and compassionate, so indifferent to fighting and the accumulation of objects and money. Because the best way to know the Truth or Beauty is to try to express it. And what is the purpose of existence Here or Yonder but to discover truth and beauty and express it, i.e., share it with others? (p.179). Brenda intersperses her writing philosophy throughout the book by giving examples and comparing the writing of ordinary people to the writing of famous people. In doing so, she brings out the loveliest parts and shows us how writing can be most beautiful when it is most simple."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"This book illustrates that the most difficult step in most things in life is the first. If you write, then you simply must just do that--write. You must do it every day. Ms. Euland teaches us that affirmation comes only from within, and that when we realize that, we care little about any artificial external affirmation anyway. She is a professor of the meaning and ascertainment of true quality.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"Inspired by a raving review by Guy Kawasaki in MacUser (April 1992), I decided to give it a try. Kawasaky reccomended it for anybody wanting to program computer software. He was RIGHT! As a musician, a composer, a teacher and a programmer I can't stop telling others how great this book is. YOU GOT TO READ IT! If you don't like I will buy it back from you. I have already given 10 copies away to my friends."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"I'd highly recommend this book to any people working in a creative field, particularly those who feel overwhelemed by the difference between the quality of work that they're producing and the quality of what the professionals do. Within the frame of the writing profession, the author talks about the need for passion, practice, and diligence to build competence and then expertise. She also covers how to have a good life along the way. While those coming to this book looking for Strunk & White, volume 2, will be disappointed, those looking for a quick boost of inspiration will be well served."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"This is my first exposure to this book so I'm left wondering if all the printings are the same. While the content is overall okay, the printing of this book is awful. The most terrible, and ironic, problem is there are typos everywhere including the back cover. Buy a different printing, maybe you'll have better luck. Sure wish I'd saved my return slip."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"There are many \\"how to write...\\" books on the market. Some help me with grammar, some help me with structure, but this little book has shown me how writing can become a means of growing mentally and spiritually as a writer--and thus improve one's writing. Ueland has great confidence in us as storytellers. We all do it, whether at the end of the day or in the laudrymat. She shows how to do it on paper and gives us confidence: \\"You will find you have something to say. And tomorrow there will be more [p42].\\""},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"The best book about writing that I've ever read. Brenda Ueland teaches you that all you need to write you already have, just get it down on paper and don't uselessly compare yourself to others. She believes everyone has the right to expression and you will too if you don't already. A great book for any creative artist."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"Yes! This is not about writing, it's about living. Really living to your potential, and in a way that brings happiness and fulfillment. This is a book for everyone, and one that can be read every few years for inspiration!"},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"Many of the author's references and examples are from her writing classes and her association with other writers, so I guess you can call it a writing book. But, its subtitle is more succint, \\"A Book about Art, Independence and Spirit.\\" The book answers the question \\"Why should we all use our creative power and write or paint or play music, or whatever it tells us to do?\\"She uses examples from Blake, Chekhov, Tolstoi, Sandburg and other creative writers, and sprinkles in Mozart, Van Gogh, Monet and God. We read much about imagination and creativity, and how our internal and external critics suppress us. She explores how to bring what is inside us all to the surface and to be thankful for it. If your are exploring your imagination and creativity, be it through writing, drawing, composing, acting, programming, entreprenuering or just living life, read this book, savor it and then read it again. You'll like it."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"I first read this book 2 years ago but consult it frequently. Brenda Ueland speaks the truth and helps all of us searchers to look within ourselves deeper and bring out our true selves. It is not just for writers but for anyone wishing to lead a more creative, energized, spontaneous, and fulfilling life."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"If You Want to Write is about the author's philosophy of writing in particular and life in general. This vague summary may make it sound difficult or boring, but in fact it is written in a friendly, energetic style. If you want to write--if you want to create, period--this book will be worth your time."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"I read this book on a whim and in it, I felt not only inspired by Brenda Ueland's writing, I can read and hear her echo in many of the writers who followed her.Its amazing to think, for example, that this book was written when my mother was 6 years old back in 1938. Makes me wonder what books are being written THIS YEAR that my six year old daughters daughter, at 41 will say, \\"Wow, this voice is from 1938? And she is so present to today!\\"As a writer and a teacher of writing myself, I have spoken words similar to these crafted by Ueland: \\"No writing is a waste of time-- no creative work where the feelings, the imagination, the intelligence must work. With every sentence you write, you have learned something. It has done you good. It has stretched your understanding.\\"While the book is written in a sometimes rambly form that makes my left brained side shout \\"What was the editor thinking when s/he organized this darn thing?!\\" at the same time I think this exact feature is one which teaches by example as well. Rambly, unorganized, out of order, pieces dropped and not necessarily re-picked up... its ok. Its life. Its ok. As I just quoted \\"It has stretched your understanding.\\"My copy is heavily underlined and dog eared... even though it is less than a year old I have gone back to favored sections repeatedly.Read this one and you will have a brand new \\" haven't we met somewhere before?\\" friend on your bookshelf to enjoy for a long, long time."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"I found this book by accident while browsing through a now-defunct Los Angeles bookstore/cafe. It was the luckiest accident of my life. At that point I had been a professional writer for more than twenty years, but I rarely enjoyed my work, and I felt all of it was disposable in one way or another. At first, reading &quot;If You Want to Write&quot; gave me an incredible, if unfamiliar, feeling of joy and self-confidence. Afterwards, I began to surprise the hell out of myself in terms of what I was able to accomplish. This simply written book states some of the most profound truths about life and creativity I have ever read. Whenever I get stuck on a project I go back and re-read it, and its warmth, generosity, and brilliance always inspire me to go on. It should almost be titled &quot;If You Want to Live&quot;, because far more than being a how-to book on writing, it makes an eloquent argument that we all can live creative lives as long as we're true to ourselves."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"I will admit from the start that this book is not for everyone. It won't appeal to all writers and artists. However, I believe the book was written for people who are looking for a way to lead an authentic life and to achieve authenticity in their art. As with Natalie Goldberg's WRITING DOWN THE BONES, this book feels as though it was written just for me, and that's the true beauty of IF YOU WANT TO WRITE. If the book speaks to you, as it did to me, you may find yourself having the first great epiphany of your artistic life. Her book sits in a prominent place in my home and in my heart. I have read it many times and underlined countless passages. As I struggled to finish my first book, I looked to Ueland for support and confidence. By far the two most memorable passages for me are the one in which she describes a time she was playing the piano and was told her playing wasn't \\"going anywhere.\\" She then discusses the relationship that MUST exist between the artist and the person experiencing the art. (Her philosophy is strongly influenced by the observations of Tolstoy.) She points out that this relationship is necessary in order for us to produce meaningful art. The second passage that is extremely meaningful to me is related to the first passage. She describes the time Vincent Van Gogh wrote a letter to his brother and drew a tender image of a streetlight that he was looking at outside his window. The drawing is beautiful because it came out of his intense love for his brother and his desire to share something beautiful with him, not from a desire for recognition or fame. This is what Ueland means by authenticity, which she, like Blake, connects to the divine source existing within each individual. This book changed forever the way I view the artistic expression."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"Brenda Ueland was one of my dearest friends. Her wisdom and gentle humor has sustained me through many years. If You Want to Write is an outstanding book on not only how to write but how to live fully -- with grace, joy, humor and compassion. It is &quot;first-rate,&quot; as Brenda would say. Once you have found this book, don't let it get away from you. Keep copies handy. One year, I gave copies of the book to my family and friends for Christmas. They all loved it. It soon became one of those books that everyone must read -- for reading this book seemed to make everyone a better person. How is that? Maybe one of the reasons is because it &quot;takes the pressure off&quot; to be a &quot;good writer&quot; or a &quot;good person.&quot; Just be who you are in an authentic and joyful way -- and you can't help but be &quot;good.&quot; Open the book to any page, and you will find her words funny, creative, loving and truthful --thumbing her nose at all the pessimists in the world.Brenda had a delightful sense of humor. She jokingly insisted on renaming me &quot;Countess Francesca&quot; because, &quot;Names are very important, and Deborah is just too stern and biblical.&quot; This was just her way with everyone -- funny, uplifting and endearing. And her book, If You Want to Write, will make you feel just as special, as if she is sitting right there with you, laughing with you and helping you every step of the way. Enjoy this women's words -- hold them in your heart. Brenda is a rare spirit. Avanti!"},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"Read this book. Read it all the way through. You might say to yourself &quot;this is juvenile. This is nave.&quot; But read it. Press on. Read it thoroughly. Set your mind on &quot;accept&quot; and let the book be right all the time.Then, read it again. Keep reading it when you are not writing. Randomly pick a page and start. Read it out of order. Perhaps you'll find the Blake, or the Van Gogh; one of her students, or one of her tirades against the niggardly busy-busy world. Read it while watching T.V.(but not while driving a car!)Soon, you just can't read it anymore. Because it's tedious? Because you've memorized it? Because its pages are stained with finger oil and falling apart?Because you will be too damn busy furiously writing. And rewriting, then writing again. You will fear--with a creaky feeling in your gut--that a short break may jettison the idea you're blessed with off into the unexpressed void, then banish the next one, and the next one, like a home-run slugger on a roll at batting practice, all which demand permanence--because they all got that something. And you don't dare stop typing (at 75 W.P.M, with pauses of concentrated, exacting thought between) because you must, you absolutely soulfully must, capture this thought perfectly, then quickly move on to the next antsy thought tapping its toe impatiently behind, before it gets insulted and walks out to planet nowhere in a huff.So read it. And I hope you read it so much that you just don't have the time to read it anymore, and it is gathering dust while your page is gathering words."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"A friend gave me this book for Christmas because he knew I liked to write and told me it was the best book for writing. I was skeptical, but started the book anyhow so I could at least tell him I looked at it. I found it immediately engaging and savored every page, limiting myself to a few pages a night so I wouldn't finish it quickly. The best part is that it is an &quot;idea&quot; writing book rather than an exercise book. There is no stopping to jot down notes or pages with writing exercises. Ueland gets into ideas and the psychology of why we do and don't write certain things. It got my brain churning, and I found myself become less inhibited with a project I was trying to get to the next level on. Excellent book for the experience writer who is feeling a need to break through to some fresh material. Ueland is amazingly insightful and even though it is written in 1938, it does not feel dated."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"I decided to read this book on the advice of another author, Harold Klemp. Well, I don't regret it! Being a French speaking reader, I usually take a long time to read an English book, but I took 4 days to go through this one! I used a yellow hightlighter pen, and when I finished it, it was mostly yellow! Indeed, the title of this book should really have been &quot;The Art of Living.&quot; Even if it was written before my time, I think Brenda Ueland speaks for today's aspiring writer, painter, artist within, or creative entrepreneur... Through numerous examples, and some excellent quotes from William Blake or Van Gogh, Ueland shows you how to believe in yourself, and how to &quot;live life fully!&quot; I am nos recommending that book to all my friends! But, please don't believe me... experience it by yourself!"},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"I first learned about IF YOU WANT TO WRITE from one of my college roommates. Several of the students in one of his theatre classes were reading the book and he suggested that I read it as well. As a struggling Artist myself, I eventually read the book and though I remember reading it, I didn't remember anything from the book. Having recently committed myself to discipline myself in my own writing, I decided to re-read the book. In re-reading it I now understand why I didn't remember much of what I had read the first time.IF YOU WANT TO WRITE is basically an extensive letter of encouragement to anyone who wants to do anything creative. The book does not offer any practical advice about how to find an agent, how to get published, etc. The book does not really offer any practical advice about writing either, e.g. writing prompts, ideas, etc. Instead the book does offer encouragement about being passionate about one does, remaining diligent in what one loves, and practicing one's craft (whatever that maybe).I can understand why so many people have gained encouragement from this book. For someone who is a beginning Artist (of any craft) who has become frustrated or for anyone who wants to create Art but is afraid to try because of being told by someone in the past that they weren't talented, the book could just be the boost that they need. Personally, however, I just didn't take much away from IF YOU WANT TO WRITE. I wasn't inspired in anyway and wasn't all that encouraged after having read it.I'd recommend this book for beginning Artists of any sort (whether they be writers, actors, musicians, etc.) or someone who is interested in creating Art but doesn't feel adequate about their talents."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"This book is just fantastic! I was looking for a book to give me inspiration on my writing and this is it! I wasn't so sure at first, I was afraid of yet another fusty, musty textbook-twin that would give helpful hints but bore me to tears. But from the first page I was hooked! &quot;...most people must break through a shell of timidity and strain.&quot; What encouragement! This book proved to me that there are other downtrodden creative people out there, people who have had &quot;contructive criticism&quot; shoved down their throats until it nearly killed them. Plus, the strain of being pressured to &quot;make a living&quot; from your writing. Instead, Brenda Ueland encourages in the most enlivening way to write because you love to! And in her mind this applies to anyone, this is not just a book about writing. It is inspiration for ANYONE who is afraid to follow their true creative spirit.She says that Van Gogh painted not because it was expected of him or because he wanted to make a profit from it, rather he painted the stars in the sky because he loved them and wanted to show other people how beautiful they are, he wanted them to be seen from his perspective so that others might share in his wonder! How can that fail to inspire all downtrodden sensitive creators?In this book, Ueland shows how to bypass all negative feedback from others, how to search inside ourselves to find our true motives for creating literature, artwork, whatever we love the most! She is able to bring out the unique creative nature in everyone (for if everyone is different, then everyone IS original!) and in the process make us happy with what we find inside."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"There aren't enough stars for this review. Ueland writes an amazing book on how to achieve our potential in anything that we do...and the things (such as trying to please other people) which prevent us from bringing forth the best from ourselves. Already I've found that I have better and brighter ideas when I write, and even when I do other things like play music.This book is one that is best read slowly...in short doses. I find that I can't read a page without having something to think about or reassess in my life and especially in my writing. I wholeheartedly recommend this book."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"Reading this book will lead you to different ways of thinking about your writing and your life. The heart behind the words shines through and you feel more like you're having a conversation with a trusted friend than reading a book. &quot;Art is infection,&quot; Brenda Ueland titles one chapter and this book is definately art by that definition. She infects you, across the boundry of time as only printed words can, with her enthusiasm for writing and her gusto for life. Throughout, she builds up your confidence and ignites your passion while also telling you that not everything she suggests may work for you. Try it, see if you like it, and if it doesn't help your writing, move on. There are no &quot;oughts,&quot; there is only your authentic voice.Also, she touches on the fact that she wrote this book about writing because that is her form of art. Everyone has the artistic spark within them and you can as easily show your particular passion through sewing, or house building or ditch digging as through writing. While a handbook for better writing this is also a guidebook for a happier life."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"This book is a treasure and a necessity for the creative person--or anyone who believes that the human spirit has no limits.The most valuable thing about this book is that Ueland is ENCOURAGING.

I began reading this book on the Summer Solstice of June 1987 (I scribbled the date inside the book cover)and have read it in bits and pieces ever since. No matter what page my gemini mind jumps to, a jewel jumps back at me. This morning it was:\\"I used to have to drive myself to work. You cannot imagine what an uncomfortable, effortful thing it was supposed to be, to be a writer... It was my class who showed me I was working in the wrong way... I learned from them that inspiration does not come like a bolt, nor is it energetic striving, but it comes to us slowly and quietly all the time, though we must regularly and every day give it a little chance to start flowing, prime it with a little solitude and idleness. I learned that you should feel when writing, not like Lord Byron on a mountain top, but like a child stringing beads in kindergarten,--happy, absorbed and quietly putting one bead on after another.\\"Go Look Inside This Book and see for yourself what it's all about.

Eye-opening and at times controversial, but always honest."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"First published in 1938, \\"If You Want to Write\\" presents the philosophy of writing (indeed, of all creativity) that Brenda Ueland taught for many years at the Minneapolis YWCA. The title of the first chapter presents her premise: \\"Everybody is talented, original, and has something important to say,\\" and subsequent chapters guide readers in how to tease out their own talent and originality so that it \\"infects\\" readers. Though her details do evoke the 1930s, her observations of human nature remain spot-on to 2008.Ueland's message is encouraging and inspirational and true. My quibbles concern aspects of the book's editing (non-editing?). First, the punctuation and formatting (extra and omitted commas; footnotes) interfered with my reading and I had to re-read numerous sentences to make sense of them. Second, Ueland tends to introduce a topic but then note that she'll deal with it later; I didn't keep track of what she was postponing, but did keep wondering whether she ever got back to all of it. Overall, the writing has a somewhat sloggy (first-draft) feel rather than that of a tightened manuscript.In the genre, I'd instead recommend: Anne Lamott's fabulous \\"Bird by Bird\\"; Dorothea Brande's \\"Becoming a Writer\\" (also pubbed in the 1930s); and John Gardner's \\"On Becoming a Novelist.\\""},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"I happened by this book while browsing a bookstore. I luckily bought it. I read it cover to cover the next day. I never read a book cover to cover. It was so applicable to my son and his mother and I. He is studying music. The book isn't just about writing, it's about art. It's about pursuing art for art's sake. It's about pursuing life for life's sake. It gives us permission to tell our son to concentrate on making music and that making money should not be the driving force behind it. I think an 18 year old needs to hear this, if he hasn't already figured it out. The author tells us we all know the way as children. Trash is inserted in our heads as we grow up and we then spend most of your lives trying to remove it. If you know an artist or someone that needs a lift, but this book for them.

She said she had two rules that she absolutely followed: To tell the truth, and not to do anything she didn't want to do.Euland's first chapter title states: \\"Everybody Is Talented, Original, and Has Something to Say\\". What a vote of confidence for the aspiring, timid writer. Every ensuing chapter contains fresh insights that will expand the mind, and stir the imagination.She writes of lofty things. Of poetry and sonnets. Of Shakespeare, Doystoyevsky, Chekhov, and the Third Dimension. Her observations of other writers works are captivating.When speaking of T.E Lawrence and his \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\\" she notes: \\"It is a work of genius, and the beauty of his writing has not been seen in English for a long time. I think it is because of the Third Dimension, the great personality of Lawrence behind it. Instead of him living a sedentary, literary life, polishing sentences, and cultivating a prose style, he lived a great life with supernatural standards for himself of courage, suffering, endurance, and honor. And so his book is better writing than a century of merely literary men.\\"Euland has a theory about him. \\"Lawrence seems to me like an Elizabethan Englishman, and his writing has the same quality. In Elizabeth's time, during the Renaissance, people felt that the \\"personality\\" was the important thing, not a man's ideas alone or his work.\\"She points out how that has changed. Today we might say \\"Do not pay attention to his \\"personality\\" it is his ideas that are the important thing\\".The author wears many hats throughout the book. She's not only a writing teacher, but a cheerleader, mentor, history teacher, and guide. She speaks of the need for great national literature, and that it is because of the critics, the doubters (in the outer world and within ourselves) that we have such hesitancy when we write.In the last chapter (p.160) Euland sums up her advice to the writer and artist:1). Know that it is good to work.2). Work with love and think of liking it when you do it.3). It is easy and interesting.4). It is a privilege.5). There is nothing hard about it, but your anxious vanity and fear offailure.6). Try to discover your true, honest, untheoretical self.Euland's book feels like a meditation and examination of the writing life. To me, it had a dreamy, calming quality, as if writing might be the most natural of all mankind's endeavours. Her book is a great gift for any writer or artistic person.It is one of those gems that can be re-read and referred back to for fresh insights and encouragement when the writer is feeling discouraged and bogged down.

It is so short, yet so painfully repetitive, filled with long excerpts taken from diaries and letters of few famous artists (mostly van Gogh, Blake and \\"Great Russians\\") and pupils from Ueland's writing class.While the author often mocks the great writers that she personally does not like (Steinbeck? Scott Fitzgerald, seriously?), her own style is desperately dull and non-inventive. Not to mention useless tirades full of Coelho'esque esoteric cliches and countless references to God and Christianity.What really irritated me was the contrast between her (self-proclaimed) modesty and frequent, mean attacks against everyone, who does not blindly flow with his or her emotions and contempt for everyone, who dares to think critically (her advice for a man that brought up his kids in rational atmosphere - \\"I think he might as well have taken them out in the backyard and killed them with an ax\\").All these tendencies culminate in the Chapter XVII, which basically encourages all people to become compulsive writers and just fill the world with nonsensical flood of words. In the last paragraphs Ueland expresses her conviction, that emotions (unlike arguments and facts) are always a great positive force. I simply can not agree with that - many mass murderers and tyrants considered themselves artists, without reason and moral introspection art can be a great destructive force, too!Ueland finishes with following words : \\"I believe this book will hasten the Millenium by two or three hundreds years\\". So much for her modesty, I guess."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"I purchased this for my daughter.

Instead of repeating those well-deserved praises, I'll comment on three powerful points that Brenda Ueland advances for developing writers.First, we are all capable of writing creatively. If we consciously experience the world we live in and the people we encounter, then we can write about them. Ueland offers many excellent cases in point to prove her argument.Second, you won't learn to write creatively from what you learned in school. In fact, school might beat the creativity out of you. Sir Ken Robinson ([...]) has a lot to say in support of this viewpoint. Therefore, you'll have to look for other sources of inspiration and methods of writing to get started.Third, those inspirations and methods are readily available to you. Ueland provides many throughout \\"If You Want to Write\\" as do numerous books by the likes of Ray Bradbury, Stephen King, Anne Lamott, William Zinsser, and many others who have borrowed liberally from her.So read her 1938 magnum opus not with a mindset to critique what might now seem quaint or trite or irrelevant for today's electronic writer. Rather, read it at face value, trying those long solitary walks and writing exercises she recommends. If you haven't tried them, you'll find them transformative."},{"Title":"If You Want to Write","review":"Reading this book is like having coffee with your most encouraging friend.

It's about being true to yourself and respecting your creative self. I've given copies away because I love it so much. The only thing I feel sad about with this edition is that there is no photograph of the writer. The older versions have her picture. She's amazing with wrinkles and wild hair and a beautiful smile.

It all comes together to create one of the most remembered US Open's in history."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I'm not a huge fan of this book. I made my way thought it, but it was a bit of a slog. The book is more about the behind the scenes aspects of the Open than the actual Open itself or the professional golfers plying their skills and the competition itself. As such, you'd really have to have an interest in the minutia of event planning to enjoy this read."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"The actual playing of golf tournament is secondary compared to getting the rights to host the Open, the long planning cycle and the behind-the-scenes action. That's ok with me, as play-by-play of golf action usually doesn't work well in print. In this case, the tournament did not have a lot of suspense or memorable golf moments, with Tiger largely in control.Thus, we learned about the massive effort to pull off a tournament, beyond what readers may have sensed had they volunteered at a regular PGA stop or even only attended one in person. Feinstein covers many inevitable turf wars and glitches and weather-induced problems against a firm deadline. You can't slip the schedule for the US Open. A core of talented and dedicated people succeeded in execution, which, although it must be quite difficult, is far from unique, as majors run each year and other sporting events of significance also manage to happen. It made me wonder what would happen if something really bad did occur (beyond weather and a parking mess) at a major. The author gives a lot of detail on the staff, with various amusing anecdotes or key background, but they blend together and ultimately are rather forgettable.The end result is an OK book, one unlikely to be read seven years after the fact (there's even been another Open back at Bethpage in 2009), other than as a snapshot in time and as a rather different look at golf."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Open is an exceptional book that takes the reader literally behind the ropes at Bethpage. Starting as a wild idea to host the Open on a public course, Feinstein is able to capture the years, months and days leading up to the 2002 Open. The book takes into account the extra security, parking, and such that comes with a major sporting event just months removed from 9/11. I enjoyed the in-depth profiles of the individuals responsible for putting on the show. The stores about close calls and how pairings are made. The book is definetly not your typical recount of a shot by shot golf tournament but rather a masterpiece for those of us that are as intrigued about how the USGA puts on championship versus who wins it. I recommend it to anyone who would is interested in the business side of sports especially golf."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Typical Feinstein (\\"A Season on the Brink\\" excepted). Quick, gossipy, superficial, fawning, etc., etc. This book is about the 2002 U.S. Open Golf Championship at the Bethpage Black Golf Course, a New York State Park course on Long Island. The subtitle, \\"Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black,\\" is used here as a figure of speech, meaning \\"behind the scenes.\\" (\\"Inside the ropes\\" is normally used in the context of a professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area itself -- spectators are separated from the golfers, caddies, officials, and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the spectators how close they can get to the action.) Feinstein's purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf tournament from its conception to its completion. We see U.S Golf Association (the organization that conducts the tournament) leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of putting on a golf tournament (e.g., 4,850 people willing to volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and U.S.G.A. can have a huge payday), about random qualifiers and random competitors, and about the resurrection of the Black golf course. Yet the book does not fulfill its promise. My guess is that Feinstein's indebted to too many golf people for both his past and anticipated future lifestyle to offer the kind of critical insights and analysis I had hoped for."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Being from Long Island, I understand the story behind the US Open. I was also able to go to the Open on the Saturday and get a feel for the event. As such I really appreciated this book because it is hard to build such an event in the public course like Bethpage. It is a testament to the USGA on how organized they are and all of the event preplanning they do. I thought it was a different and insightful look at the Open"},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Mr. Feinstein is a gifted writer and storyteller. This is the story of a golf course, the championship it hosted and the people that made it happen. Mr. Feinstein follows the story of the 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black Public Golf Course from idea to fruitition. He takes us behind the scenes and inside the ropes. It is a fascinating read."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Having read &quot;A Good Walk Spoiled&quot; and &quot;The Majors&quot; I surmised that John Feinstein had exhausted his insights on the subject of golf. However, &quot;The Open&quot; showed me that Feinstein can go low whenever he writes about golf. Somehow, he is able to provide information that make events come alive and keep the pages turning. Having been a caddy myself in High School, I enjoyed the inside the ropes details Feinstein provided. When it comes to writing about golf, Feinstein is the man! Good shot."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Feinstein has done a masterful job yet again. He captured everything about the planning and executing of the 2002 U.S. Open. If you're looking for a &quot;typical&quot; golf book summarizing the Open, you might be disappointed. While he does cover the week of golf, Feinstein devotes the majority of his book to how the USGA went about developing everything for last year's Open. It is as much a book on managing a golf championship as it is a book about the four rounds played Thursday through Sunday. Something a little different than what I expected, but thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I have to admit to not being the world's biggest golf fan but in the hands of an expert storyteller like Feinstein, the sport takes on a life of its own. Initial reviews highlighted the lengthy build-up/preparation for the tournament as a negative, but the scene setting really allows the reader to delve into the psyche (not only of the players, but of the Open itself). Do yourself a favor and buy this book."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"One of the more disappointing books by John Feinstein. He acts like the people putting on the 2002 U.S. Open were working on a cure for cancer. But seriously if the people described have all the abilities that Feinstein accredits them with, why aren't they doing something more meaningful than putting on a Golf Tournament. ALSO since I am a Huge Tiger Woods fan the usual Feinstein bashing of Tiger is not appreciated. One thing that surprised me is that NBC dictates pairings and starting times. If David Fay has all the integrity that Feinstein gives him credit for, he should not allow NBC to be so selective.Also, I remeber watching this event on the tube. And Feinstein does not capture the enthusiasm that New Yorkers displayed for Phil Mickelson. The Book does not mention that he was called \\"The Mick.\\"The only question was how low to rate this book. Though unscientific 3 stars \\"feels\\" right."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"First off, as has been written below, this is not a book that revolves around the golfers, as &quot;The Majors&quot; and &quot;Good Walk Spoiled&quot; did. It is an in-depth look at all the work and politics behind staging an Open championship (not &quot;tournament&quot;, as we are reminded seemingly countless times). The challenges run the gamut from the contract with the course, to television, to parking, to security. If these machinations do not interest you, don't bother.That being said, I enjoyed the book. As is the case with his books, he introduces seemingly countless players and provides short bios on each of them (much shorter than those in &quot;The Majors&quot;, thankfully). Good stuff, except a) there were so many people that it's simply hard to keep track of who they all are, particularly when they were last referenced 45 pages prior, and b) there really weren't any &quot;bad guys&quot; (although he didn't paint a rosy picture of Frank Hannigan). This isn't a surprise, given the fact that he was basically cozy with all of them and was their guest, but it did make for rather vanilla interaction. Surely over the course of years it took to stage this, there had to be some tension, instead they came off as one Giant Sized Cleaver Family.The golfing itself was given very short shrift, being mentioned almost in passing, which was fine with me.In short, if you are a fan of Feinstein's writing and can deal with the minutae, you will enjoy this."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. Having read most of Feinsteins other works. It was certainly not, &quot; Inside the Ropes&quot;, as the sub title implies.I was totally bored by the business end of the open. Aside from the introduction, the golfers don t enter the book for about three hundred pages.I found myself skimming to get to the good stuff, which took a long time to materialize."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"If someone told you that you could read a book about what it was like to escort the President of the United States through catering tunnels in hotels, would you want to read it? I wouldn't.Open is seriously flawed by providing me with much more information than I ever wanted to know about the USGA, biographies of its staff members, and little incidents of limited relevance to the 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black, the brilliantly rehabilitated course on Long Island. Two-thirds of this book could have been eliminated without taking away anything I wanted to learn about the staging of the Open.On the other hand, the book is detailed and will probably be very popular among those who know those who are described in the book or have played Bethpage Black. If you fall into either category, this is definitely a five-star book.Emblematic of the book's fundamental problem is that it fails to have a single illustration of an entire hole on the course. It would have been interesting to see what the hole layouts' and conditions were before and after the USGA paid for the fix-up.Of the many little anecdotes in the book, I liked the ones about the qualifying rounds the best. My interest is mostly in playing golf and developing great golf courses, and this book could have used more of a focus on both subjects.After you finish enjoying the book, I suggest that you visit Bethpage Black and take a look for yourself. If you don't mind getting up early in the morning, perhaps you can even play a round there.Despite not liking the book very much, I would like to compliment the USGA for its new focus on bringing the Open to courses where ordinary golfers with average incomes can pay. That's a fine contribution to the game and to us all."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Mostly rubbish - as a book and especially as a Feinstein book.John Feinstein broke new ground with &quot;A Season On The Brink&quot; and successfully used the same formula with &quot;The Majors&quot; and &quot;A Good Walk Spoiled&quot; (although the former was a better book).&quot;The Open&quot; is confirmation that Feinstein has completely adopted a paint-by-numbers approach. A typical paragraph/chapter follows:...John Doe was a skilled high school/college golfer, eventually lowering his handicap to 3. He thought about joining the minitours or becoming a club/range pro but was offered a job with &lt;insert corporation&gt; out of the blue. Through mutual contacts, he met &lt;insert USGA staffer&gt; and acted as a &lt;insert golf tournament job&gt; at a local qualifier. He eventually worked his way up the USGA ladder and is now responsible for &lt;insert title or duties&gt; at the US Open and other national USGA events...There are two big problems with this approach:1) Feinstein tries his hardest to portray each person as unique, but this Mad Libs style of writing gets repetitive when applied to dozens of individuals.2) It's a transparent attempt to humanize some of the stuffed shirts at the USGA. Unfortunately, some of them are beyond rehabilitation. Tom Meeks, in particular, comes off as even more arrogant and pigheaded (which is quite an accomplishment, in a way).I don't know if it's an East Coast/Long Island/political thing, but there are far too many groups who demand some form of tribute before they will cooperate. Feinstein attempts to portray the local governments, police, and transportation officials as helpful but watchful; instead, they come off looking like the tinhorns they are. The Masters, the Memorial, any number of tournaments are carried off year after year with similar crowds and logistical problems, but those events are not treated like a moon shot. Our own wonderful Department of Energy (of the people, by the people, for the people...or something) causes problems by refusing to allow vans transporting the players to the 10th tee to drive on their precious service road. In short, the tournament was carried off in spite of all the 'help' the USGA received, not because of it.I'm sure Feinstein stayed up late trying to think of a way to inject his buddies on tour, particularly Paul Goydos, into the storyline. As luck would have it, Goydos had the very first tee time of the Open, so we are treated to more incredibly boring coverage of this journeyman. This 'everyman' approach worked well in Feinstein's first golf book, but three volumes later it has been worn threadbare.As others have stated, if you're looking for coverage/insight into the top names in golf, read the newspaper or GolfWorld. If you are dying to find out how Suzy Smith sets up her armada of cash registers in the merchandise tent, pick up a copy of &quot;The Open.&quot;"},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"He writes with a lot of descriptive detail, to a fualt. Every person he mentions gets their biography put in. Way too much extra junk about people no one would ever here of. Chapters start out with the continuing story and quickly break down into the life story of some high ranking account for the PGA, and so on. Read only if you need to get some sleep."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I like Feinstein's work but this book is a bore. The first 100 pages are mini-biographies of USGA staff.

What I got, however, was every tiny, irrelevant detail about every person even remotely involved with the US Open. For example, do we really care that the superintendant's son played junior golf at... Or do we need 10-15 pages on the Shinnecock Indians and the 1995 US Open at Shinnecock? Or that the workers at Bethpage enjoyed eating sandwiches at BK Sweeney's??? Or that the guy who caddied for Tiger in his practice round was frome Ireland and his family, blah, blah, blah... Come on. It was just too much clutter and noise.This from an avid, single-digit handicapper, from Long Island, who played Bethpage Black and went to the Open on Friday in teh pouring rain!I had every reason to love this book, but instead threw it away. Save your money. I wish I had."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"John Feinstein may very well be the best golf writer around, but that doesn't mean that all of his books are instant classics like A Good Walk Spoiled. \\"Open\\" details the tournament at Bethpage in painstaking detail, from the history of the course, to the political machinations to get the tournament at the course, to the renovation of the course, to the volunteers, to the tournament itself. Although the devil is in the details, I would have appreciated more of the tournament and less of the development. Still a great read, but I wanted more golf and less golf course."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I highly recommend this book. It is a great, behind-the-scenes look at how much work and planning goes into each Open Championship. It's exceptionally well-written, and easy to understand and follow. And reading it on my Kindle made the experience that much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Feinstein takes a different tack in The Open versus his previous golf books, A Good Walk Spoiled and The Majors. Instead of stories about the players on the tour, this story focuses on the people behind the transformation of the worn-out municipal golf course Bethpage Black into the great course that hosted the 2002 U.S. Open championship. I found I couldn't stop reading, as Feinstein's prose is once again funny, heartwarming, and flowing. My only critique is that I wished for more detail on Rees Jones' changes to A.G. Tillinghast's design, with illustrations. For a book about the transformation of the golf course, there isn't enough about the physical changes that were done. The book does a great job portraying the enormity of the project that was undertaken, so the satisfaction that is felt with the success of the championship seems to be well deserved."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"If you are looking for a stroke by stroke description of the Open Championship, look elsewhere. As others have pointed out, this is a story about running an Open, not playing in an Open (perhaps the subtitle is a bit misleading).If you have any interest in the topic, it's a pretty good book. Feinstein's style is pleasant and interesting and he does a nice job describing the myriad of tasks and personnel required to set up an Open. This is not as good a book as The Majors, but I enjoyed it as much as A Good Walk."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I have to admit to not being the world's biggest golf fan but in the hands of an expert storyteller like Feinstein, the sport takes on a life of its own.

Do yourself a favor and buy this book."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"If you're looking for a fascinating book whose main purpose is not simply to provide a narration and analysis of the competition at Bethpage this book is for you. Mr. Feinstein describes the transformation of the Black course for the 2002 US Open Championship with the entusiasm of a devoted fan and the broad perspective and clarity of a truly talented golf writer and reporter. For those of us fortunate enough to participate directly at Bethpage as fans, volunteers or interested onlookers this book completes the first chapter on the use of a truly public (State owned) facility as a worthy venue for our national golf championship. Seldom, if ever, have we been allowed to glimpse the preparation for and staging of a major sporting event from start to finish. This work is as much about golf as golf is about life."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I loved &quot;A Good Walk Spoiled,&quot; Feinstein's previous book. If you haven't read that one, read it--it's fantastic. But this book was disappointing, mainly because Feinstein introduces too many characters involved with the US Open at Bethpage. And I don't mean the golfers--instead I mean the architects, administrators, maintenance people, producers, etc. Feinstein doesn't really focus on golfers very much in the book--probably the book's fatal flaw. What the PGA crew did at Bethpage was great but Feinstein tells us too much about them--after a while, I just started flipping past the pages and pages about their upbringing, their career paths, etc. I just didn't find them that interesting as people--although what they did to set-up Bethpage was interesting. But I kept on reading, thinking Feinstein's description of the actual US Open competition would be fascinating. But instead, it's truncated and not really fleshed out--not much of a payoff for reading the rest of the book. I guess &quot;A Good Walk Spoiled&quot; spoiled me for his second book."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Given that his most recent book &quot;The Punch&quot; was released recently, I figured Feinstein hastily put this book together to cash in the upsurge in interest in golf. I WAS WRONG and am happy to admit it.The author once again takes us on the &quot;inside&quot; and proffers the reader another dose of history, tradition, and day to day banter of those who help stage the world's greatest (and most democratic) championship. Feinstein grabs the reader with his poignant insights and an introduction to the jargon of those in the know (How many people will be correcting their foursomes on pin placements vs. hole locations?).The 2002 Open was truly a special and spectacular event held so close to New York during an historical time and truly an Open for the people. Feinstein does justice with this well written and easy to read tome. In fact I found myself wanting more.I noticed in the thank you portion at the end of the book that he thanks dozens of golfers, but did not mention the 2002 Champion, Tiger Woods. I really thought there might have been more on Tiger, but maybe John has been frozen out of the inner circle due to his book &quot;The First Coming: Tiger Woods: Master or Martyr&quot; Feinstein has alienated subjects in the past (right Bob Knight), but sometimes showcasing the &quot;inside&quot; leads to people reading unflattering things about themselves they wish to hide. It's the author who has to live with himself with those relationships; however once again I found myself enraptured in great sports book by Feinstein.Write on John!"},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"This is a facinating book.

Be advised that the book does not focus much on the action at the Open, only the last 75-100 pages deal with the actual championship, the rest involves the story behind bringing the championship to the club. The book is a good read and will be enjoyed by any golf fan, not the best Feinstein has ever written, but one of his best."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"John Feinstein's writting never sucks you in to leave you with the \\"I can't put it down\\" feeling. No, his books move slower and more methodically.But in the end his books, this title included, leave the reader with a satisfied feeling. A feeling that they have gotten an in depth look, with thorough reporting and a sometimes unique perspective, at a sports issue.The beauty of \\"Open\\" is that this event was widely reported on and covered by the media at the time of the U.S. Open. But the author's reporting starts us on this jpurney decades earlier and shows us many more reasons why this particular U.S. Open was an historic and dramatic event, aside from the obvious answers that are already known.He merges the players on the course with the players behind the scenes who made the event happen. He shows the history of the financing of the U.S. Open and how that has evolved. His wrttting is crisp and clear and he sets the scenes in the book nicely with important details about key figures that help the reader appreciate their role in the events even more.This book should appeal greatly to the golf fan and have a slightly broader appeal to those who enjoy good reporting from behind the scenes of major news events."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"What a book!!! Hard to believe you can break down one weekend and make it so fascinating! Made me want to go get a job at the USGA! What a great read, good flow, great humor but not over the top, good storyline, great characters...and it's all true!!!GREAT BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"The subtitle should be, &quot;Inside the Port-o-Johns at Bethpage Black,&quot; because Feinstein devotes many pages to the man who set up all those portable toilets that lined the golf course, every last one, even one that Tiger briefly did some business in! The guy who unloaded the Port-o-Johns off the truck is interesting for about a clause, but we get page after page of this guy. You'd think he was the Pope of Bethpage Black. If you want to know fascinating stuff like the PRECISE NUMBER of Port-O-Johns that actually lined the golf course, then attempt to burrow your way through Open. The playing of golf -- I'm talking about the first actual golf shot of the tournament -- doesn't make its first appearance until page 256. At that point, the book is more than two-thirds over!!!Feinstein phoned this one in. Did someone edit this? He should have called it, &quot;A Good Open Spoiled.&quot; Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Mostly rubbish - as a book and especially as a Feinstein book.John Feinstein broke new ground with &quot;A Season On The Brink&quot; and successfully used the same formula with &quot;The Majors&quot; and &quot;A Good Walk Spoiled&quot; (although the former was a better book).&quot;The Open&quot; is confirmation that Feinstein has completely adopted a paint-by-numbers approach. A typical paragraph/chapter follows:...John Doe was a skilled high school/college golfer, eventually lowering his handicap to 3. He thought about joining the minitours or becoming a club/range pro but was offered a job with &lt;insert corporation&gt; out of the blue. Through mutual contacts, he met &lt;insert USGA staffer&gt; and acted as a &lt;insert golf tournament job&gt; at a local qualifier. He eventually worked his way up the USGA ladder and is now responsible for &lt;insert title or duties&gt; at the US Open and other national USGA events...There are two big problems with this approach:1) Feinstein tries his hardest to portray each person as unique, but this Mad Libs style of writing gets repetitive when applied to dozens of individuals.2) It's a transparent attempt to humanize some of the stuffed shirts at the USGA. Unfortunately, some of them are beyond rehabilitation. Tom Meeks, in particular, comes off as even more arrogant and pigheaded (which is quite an accomplishment, in a way).I don't know if it's an East Coast/Long Island/political thing, but there are far too many groups who demand some form of tribute before they will cooperate. Feinstein attempts to portray the local governments, police, and transportation officials as helpful but watchful; instead, they come off looking like the tinhorns they are. The Masters, the Memorial, any number of tournaments are carried off year after year with similar crowds and logistical problems, but those events are not treated like a moon shot. Our own wonderful Department of Energy (of the people, by the people, for the people...or something) causes problems by refusing to allow vans transporting the players to the 10th tee to drive on their precious service road. In short, the tournament was carried off in spite of all the 'help' the USGA received, not because of it.I'm sure Feinstein stayed up late trying to think of a way to inject his buddies on tour, particularly Paul Goydos, into the storyline. As luck would have it, Goydos had the very first tee time of the Open, so we are treated to more incredibly boring coverage of this journeyman. This 'everyman' approach worked well in Feinstein's first golf book, but three volumes later it has been worn threadbare.As others have stated, if you're looking for coverage/insight into the top names in golf, read the newspaper or GolfWorld. If you are dying to find out how Suzy Smith sets up her armada of cash registers in the merchandise tent, pick up a copy of &quot;The Open.&quot;"},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"The idea had promise, but Feinstein couldn't identify and develop the more interesting aspects of what goes on behind the scenes to stage a US Open. He reveals that Bethpage Black was always a great course, without giving any supporting reasons why. He goes into minute detail of meaningless stuff like the family histories of junior USGA staffers, yet totally fails to address the efforts or process of renovating the condition of a run-down muni course to US Open standards. He teases us with one anecdote describing USGA exec David Fay's practice of putting together US Open pairings with humorous threesomes such as &quot;Jerk Groups&quot;, without naming who the &quot;jerks&quot; were.About the only interesting thing I can say about this book is that, with Feinstein's history of treating almost every single human being in every one of his books as a saint, it is truly an indictment when he portrays someone in a negative light. In the past it was Bobby Knight (A Season On The Brink), in this book it is Tiger Woods, who he refers to as &quot;soulless&quot;, callous, unforgiving, and like most of the other characters in this book, uninteresting."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I enjoyed the book, but it certainly occurred to me in the middle of reading it that a lot of people were going to be ticked off at how misleading the title is in relation to the actual direction of the book. As has been previously mentioned repeatedly, the book is more -- MUCH more -- about the behind-the-scenes personalities than the US Open golfers themselves. Feinstein's overall theme is that the US Open is more than a golf tournament, but it's a multi-year planning process with dozens and dozens of vital people playing important roles. The problem is that he spends a few hundred pages beating this idea over the head of the reader, while the reader wonders when the actual golf is going to start. You have to sift through a great deal of mini-bios -- and some not so \\"mini\\" -- on USGA and state characters before the Open tees off.I must say that one of the main reasons I enjoyed the book was because I live 20 minutes from Bethpage Black and drive past the \\"Bethpage: Home of the 2002 US Open\\" water tower every day on my way to work -- so the geographical and course info, and other relevant stuff, caught my interest. Obviously I realize that this same info is meaningless and annoying to people not from the area, something Feinstein should have realized, and if he did, he apparently didnt care.There certainly are a bunch of patches where the reader labors through incredibly unnecessary detail, but I thought most of it was made up for with SOME of the behind-the-scenes planning process, as well as the coverage of the Open Qualifiers. There is a lot of stuff here that is very interesting and entertaining, and you can learn a lot about what goes into putting on an Open. But if you simply want to read about the 2002 US Open's golf play and analysis, I wouldnt be surprised if you quit after 100-150 pages. The actual golf coverage takes up maybe the last 20% of the book, and its not all that fulfilling even when you reach it.Simply put, the book is way too bogged down in details that have no business being in print. Outside of the families of said USGA officials, state politicians, etc., I dont know who would be the least bit interested in much of what Feinstein wrote. However, if you can stomach the rough patches and the misleading title and marketing -- and if things like network TV negotiations, traffic/parking issues, merchandise tent issues, local vs. state politics, etc. can hold your attention and intrigue you in any way -- I think you'll enjoy it. And you'll probably add a star if you're from the NY Tri-State Area."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Feinstein's creation was aptly named... \\"Open\\". The national championship is open to all entrants, the public course that hosted it was open to all who wished to play it and the USGA finally agreed to open its closed doors and allow a great author to document what goes into running this major championship.Feinstein allows the reader to be a fly on the wall as David Fay (Executive Director of the USGA) formulates his dream of hosting the U.S. Open on a truly public facility and watches that dream become a stunning reality. Along the way he answers a number of questions that the avid and/or casual golf fan has probably wondered: How do they create the pairings? How do they choose the host course? What exactly does the USGA do and how do they interact with the PGA Tour?Feinstein also captures the pride and character of the New Yorkers who call the course home and couldn't wait to see how the best players in the world would fare on The Black. As one of those New Yorkers myself, I can truly say that Feinstein's narrative on this point is right on the money.The only criticism I have is around his chronology of the final round. He states that Tiger was on 13th hole when the weather delay hit, but Tiger had yet to tee of on 12 when they halted play. This becomes even more important when one considers the tee shot Tiger had to hit after a 45 minute delay on 12, the longest par 4 in U.S. Open history. As Roger Maltbie said on the NBC coverage - \\"I can't think of a another tee shot I would least like to hit than this one after a rain delay.\\" Tiger, of course, striped it 300 yds down the middle and made par on his way to the championship.I was fortunate enough to volunteer at last year's Open all four days and I look forward to doing it again in 2009 when it returns."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"In his book \\"Open...Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black\\" John Feinstein truly takes you inside the ropes at one of the most talked about golf championships in history. Beyond Golf, the 2002 US Open at Bethpage Black was unusual for so many reasons. From the inner workings at the USGA, The New York State Parks Department, NBC Sports, to the Long Island Railroad, you get a real sense this was more than a typical 72 holes of Golf. Be prepared to miss a few rounds as this is a difficult book to put down."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"John Feinstein finds a lot more interesting things about the preparations for the 2002 U.S. Open than I would. He writes about parking pressures and vendor pilfering the way Cornelius Ryan wrote about D-Day.Those expecting a play-by-play on the golf played during those four days in June, which saw Tiger Woods break away the first day and never look back, may be disappointed. Even when the book's narrative finally reaches the event itself, after some 260 pages, the focus remains on the behind-the-scenes organizers, the USGA, NBC, and state officials. It's a unique situation, Feinstein reminds us, to have used a municipal course to host the U.S. Open, but maybe it's not worth writing a book about.That said, Feinstein's book is an interesting read, especially for those who care about things like event management, sports broadcasting, or professional golf. As an author, Feinstein is much more engaged than he was when he wrote &quot;The Majors,&quot; his style coming up to that of his classic &quot;A Good Walk Spoiled.&quot;Some of his wit is back in evidence. When a volunteer realizes Tiger used the Porta-John he helped set up, he calls a friend to share the good news. &quot;Yes, Woods thrilled people in many different ways,&quot; Feinstein concludes.I also liked the fact he doesn't hold back with the players, something I noticed and minded with &quot;The Majors&quot; after his no-holds-barred approach in &quot;Good Walk Spoiled.&quot; Woods still won't shake a TV reporter's hand 18 months after that reporter said Woods was in a &quot;slump.&quot; Sergio Garcia has his star moments, while Jeff Maggert comes across as totally unpleasant. At least Feinstein whipping boy John Daly's on his best behavior this time around.The portraits of the organizers and staff that center this book are smoother, and maybe Feinstein finds more of interest about them than you will. It's an interesting tack to take, though, writing not about the game's stars but those who help to make such marquee events happen. Feinstein is in uncharted territory here, and maybe reclaiming some lost ground as golf's most original working writer.That said, &quot;The Open&quot; is still a bore in parts, and lacks a strategic or historical overview of what makes Bethpage's Black Course so special. What did course designer A.W. Tillinghast do with the track that was so unique, and how did it preserve that notoriety over the decades as an overused Long Island muni? There's a splendid tale about golf course architecture waiting to get out here that never quite does.All the same, &quot;The Open&quot; is good for what it is, an appreciation of a very underappreciated aspect of sport. Too bad it isn't a little more interesting, but for those who care (and there are many, given golf's popularity), it will probably be worth your while to check it out."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Those who buy this book thinking they are going to get the inside story of the US Open golf tournament held at Bethpage Black in 2002 are going to be disappointed. The tournament doesn't even start until page 262.What this book is about is how the United States Golf Association decided to bring it's prestigious Open Championship to a municipal golf course on Long Island, rather than the famed country clubs which have hosted this event since it's inception and what goes in to putting on such an event. The title says&quot; Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black.&quot; What you really get is inside the workings of the USGA, what goes on behind the scenes, how decisions are made (or not),how catastrophes were avoided (or not)and in the end you may have learned more about what was involved in bringing this tournament to this course than you really wanted to know.To those of us who follow golf closely and have attended a US Open, this is a very interesting read. Feinstein researches his subject exhastively and tells the story in an interesting manner, but at the end of the book I don't believe the reader has gotten a full measure of what has been promised. So, be aware of what the book is about and what it is not about, and if it is your cup of tea, read on."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"I am really ticked off and feel that somebody at Little, Brown publishing co. owes me $26. This is the worst book about golf I've ever read, and I've read a lot.Feinstein is generally a fantastic writer and in the past I've really enjoyed his stuff . . . so imagine how disappointing this was when I found out that it not only was NOT his usual great work . . . and that in reality, this one is really a 5-star stinker.Here's the problem: If you look at the book's dust cover, there is a guy teeing-off and gallery on both sides looking on. Look at the back of the jacket and there's Tiger and others. Read the title, &quot;Open -- Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black&quot;, and adding all that up you'd think that this would be a book about the open, inside stories about the golfers and personal looks at them and their lives and their games. You know, the kind of stuff that made Feinstein's other books so much fun to read.Inside the jacket the blurb talks about Tiger, Sergio, Nick, Phil, etc., so you figger you'll be reading about them. Uh-uh.Imagine, then, how the reader feels when this book slogs on and on about Barney McFeeley and Harry O'Howsmigolfin' and Freddie Fatsohuffinpuffin and whoever these old geezers at the USGA are . . . stories not about golf, but about executives and bureaucrats having to do work (! wow, imagine that!) to set up an open at Bethpage Black (and the reverence for this golf course really gets on one's nerves, I mean, come on already). Bo-ring, boring, boring! But I suppose this sold well on Long Island and in the New York area. . .I don't blame Feinstein, the author. He wrote a book about a boring topic and was probably misled by his publisher into thinking this would be a big hit. And his editor, well, what could he do with a can of crud like this. But Little, Brown, knowing they had a bomb on their hands, did the unethical thing, and that is to market this as something it's not.Little, Brown if you are out there, please email me. You owe me a refund."},{"Title":"Open: Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black","review":"Feinstein's books are always a good read and this one is no exception.

The 2002 open was unlike any other because it fell only 8 months after 9/11.\\"Imagine trying to put on an open only 8 months after 9/11. This is what happened to David Fay. David Fay is the main character in this book and he is the person in charge of all the opens. In this book OPEN By: John Feinstein it tells how David Fay's Dream came true. He's dream was to make Bethpage Black an open. This dream came to him in 1995 and in 2002 it came true, with the help of many others like Craig Currier (superintendent) Mary Lopuszynski (sales) and many other important characters. David Fay is about to figure out all these problems because there is nothing that will get in his way of making Bethpage an open. So don't you think he will follow through? Well find out.This book is non-fiction and reads very smooth. John Feinstein did a good job of using very specific details so pay close attention. This book does not only teach you about golf it teaches you good life lessons that are unforgettable. I think this book is best suited for sports readers who want a good book to read and they will not put it down. The good thing about this book is that it makes you pay attention the bad thing is that it jumps around a little bit. The life skills this book will teach you really helped my out look on life being under thirteen and this book really deserves a try.

Turner examines EVERY Beatles song, album by album, in a format that is also easy to use for reference.

It just explains the &quot;plotline&quot; or what the song is about, which obviously, can be discovered by simply listening to the song. There are many song entries that don't explain who or what inspired the Beatles to write the song, or why the song was so long, or why it was so short, or many other questions one might ask after hearing a Beatles song. Like on &quot;You're Going to Lose That Girl,&quot; he doesn't tell us if John Lennon wrote that song to be directed to a certain person, (if the &quot;you&quot; was really a real person), or if the &quot;you&quot; was supposed to represent himself, or anything like that. He simply says that it's a song warning another guy to stop flirting with the singer's girlfriend, basically. He doesn't explain the &quot;story behind the song,&quot; for many of them.

More than just an annotated scrapbook, it's his very effective method of offering readers an interesting, engaging series of illustrated stories of how each Beatle song came into being. While it covers only those songs written and recorded by the Beatles themselves and leaves out those by other writers covered by them, this is still a book that will be highly coveted by Beatles fans.Readers will enjoy reading these stories as much of the text is in the words of George, Paul, Ringo and John -- taken from interviews, articles and their families and colleagues. This is an important basis for the book as -- we all know -- many of their songs have a basis in the reality of the world and people around them. For example, as John said during one of the interviews, noting that some of his songs were written \\"after a period of intense personal therapy\\": \\"'My songs have always been personal...'Help!' was personal, 'You've Got to Hide Your Love Away' was personal. 'I'm a Loser' was personal. I've always been on that kick.\\"Open the book on any page and you'll find beautifully presented, engaging text.

Having read it, I am still glad to have it, but was disappointed in a few ways.The main thing I disliked was that the author refers frequently in the text to the fact that many of the songs were essentially written \\"in toto\\" by one Beatle or the other, yet in the \\"Facts\\" sidebar, he adheres to the record label credits. Thus \\"I Call Your Name\\" is credited to \\"Lennon/McCartney\\" (it was 100% John) and \\"Michelle is also credited to \\"Lennon/McCartney\\" (it was 100% Paul). The expansion of each sidebar to say, for example, \\"Credited: Lennon/McCartney. Written: McCartney, some input from Lennon\\" would have been a big improvement. My other gripes are minor, though. The author is much richer in background and information on the earlier songs (pre-Pepper, basically) than later ones, and any Beatles researcher could have done no better - early Beatles is simply easier to \\"sort out the facts\\" than the later material. Bottom line: A good book, which I'm glad I now own, but not a great book.Certainly better than \\"Shout!\\" the absolute WORST book on the Beatles ever written (it is rife with factual errors, folks). But lots of good and seldom (and never before) seen info in it."},{"Title":"A Hard Day's Write, Revised Edition: The Stories Behind Every Beatles' Song","review":"While this book is interesting in some of the fun facts regading each Beatle song every written, and the photos are fantastic, the author keeps letting us know that John was lazy and maladjusted, whie Paul, of course, was the golden boy. He also seems to tow the party line that lyrics do not have multiple meanings; that Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is only about one of Julian's drawings, Blue Jay way is only about Derek getting lost and being late, etc. Annoying and fun, worth having if you love them too."},{"Title":"A Hard Day's Write, Revised Edition: The Stories Behind Every Beatles' Song","review":"I'm not a Beatlemaniac or anything, but I own most of the Beatles' work and follow them quite a bit. Some other reviews commented on inaccuracies in this book and there are a few there. There are also a few songs where there's nothing really new revealed, or perhaps nothing really about the song at all but rather what is going on their lives when the song was written. Still, I actually found that enjoyable because the songs are all in chronological order (and not necessarily in order of release, especially when it comes to Let It Be and Abbey Road songs).The challenge with the book is that it feels written mostly second-hand. Direct access to the Beatles (or those living at the time of the writing of the book) would enhance it more, but that's not to say that this book is not thoroughly entertaining or without surprises. (Side note: as a fan of the band Genesis, their book, Genesis: Chapter and Verse, interviewed every single person who'd been in the band and that was a fantastic book.) There are insights into the writing style of them as a group as well as individuals, how their girlfriends and spouses influenced their work, and how their hectic lifestyle contributed to what they were writing about. What's helpful is that it's more than just what the songs are specifically about, but instead how each individual developed as an artist. Themes about Lennons' psyche are traced in songs throughout the book, rather than each song description being an encapsulated view.The photographs did seem less common than those I'd seen before, and references to the individuals or newspaper clippings that influenced the songs also were a boon. There's an introduction to each album that talks about what the Beatles were going through, how the album and singles did on the charts, and other additional information that compliments the book. There are multiple references to George Harrison's book \\"I, Me, Mine\\" as it was mined for information about George's songs. As George gets less \\"book time\\" than John or Paul, I've begun reading his book to get more direct information about him."},{"Title":"A Hard Day's Write, Revised Edition: The Stories Behind Every Beatles' Song","review":"There are many good photographs and tasty tidbits in this fascinating glance at the writing inspirations behind our favorite songs.

It's excellent, well written and illustrated and pure Beatles."},{"Title":"A Hard Day's Write, Revised Edition: The Stories Behind Every Beatles' Song","review":"This is a complete book of the Beatles work. If you have ever been interested in the meanings of the songs that the Beatles wrote, this book is a must-have."},{"Title":"A Hard Day's Write, Revised Edition: The Stories Behind Every Beatles' Song","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I couldn't even believe how biased towards Paul McCartney it was! On many of John Lennon's songs, there is either no more than a paragraph written about it, or it says how Paul was really the \\"innovator\\" but \\"John got the credit for the innovation\\". It was completely ridiculous. I agree with the reviewer who said this book was another attempt of Paul McCartney's to re-write Beatles history, what with the author trying to portray John as a lesser talent via snide little remarks scattered throughout the book.Even if this book was completely neutral, I would have disliked it, because it doesn't always cite the inspirations for the songs, or explain the influences for writing them. It mainly explains what the song is about, which is a waste considering all you would have to do is read the lyrics of the song.To fans who are interested in the real history of The Beatles' songs, hit the Internet. Of course a lot of the information is only speculation, but that's better than what you'll get from this book."},{"Title":"A Hard Day's Write, Revised Edition: The Stories Behind Every Beatles' Song","review":"In the music unit my Popular Culture class we look at the songs of the Beatles, specifically those collected on their \\"Beatles 1\\" album. Students write a paper looking at the stages of the group as defined by the songs on that album and sometimes they find things on the Internet that talk about how John Lennon and Paul McCartney (and George Harrison for \\"Something\\") came to write their songs. Unfortunately that has little to do with putting these songs into distinct chronological stages, but after reading \\"A Hard Day's Write\\" you can see where they would be fascinated by some of these stories and forget to just listen to the songs and decide for themselves what they are about and what makes them work.Steve Turner provides the stories behind every one of the Beatles songs, including \\"Free As a Bird\\" and all the songs from \\"Anthology\\" and \\"Live at the BBC\\" that would not be covered by the other albums. The book is divided into 14 chapters representing 17 albums (\\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\" are combined, as are the three \\"Anthology\\" albums). Turner is following the British albums and including those songs that ended up on the two \\"Masterworks\\" collections with the albums that were being recorded (e.g., \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"With the Beatles,\\" \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Strawberry Field Forever\\" with \\"Sgt. Pepper\\"). It does not include the songs by other writers that the Beatles covered during their early years.Turner makes the point that this is not a book that is attempting to explain what the Beatles \\"were really trying to say,\\" but tells us about the ideas and inspirations behind these songs, as well as dispelling some of the popular myths connected to some of these songs. You have probably heard about some of these, such as Peter Fonda telling John Lennon \\"I know what its like to be dead\\" leading to \\"She Said She Said,\\" the Victorian poster about \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" and Julian Lennon's drawing of his friend \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\\" But know you can also learn about the real location of not only \\"Penny Lane\\" but also \\"Blue Jay Way,\\" who was the real \\"Polythene Pam,\\" and what happened when the Beatles mentioned Denis O'Dell in \\"You Know My Name.\\"Nor does Turner present this book as the definitive one on the subject, since that cannot be written until everything the Beatles have to say about their songs is made public. However, he did track down and interview the real-life subjects of these songs as well as going through public records and newspaper archives, and speaking in depth to some of the people who were closest to the Beatles back in the sixties. Turner also provides a brief introduction to each album that talks about where the Beatles were in their careers at that point, such as how \\"Revolver\\" represented a significant development in the Beatles' sound since their music was now being created in the studio with no thought for how it could be played in concert (the album came out during their final tour but none of its 14 songs were ever played on stage by the band). So Turner does pay some attention to things other than the individual songs.The back of the book contains a chronology for the beats from the births of Ringo Starr and John Lennon in 1940 to Paul McCartney filing a suit against the Beatles and Co. to dissolve the partnership, a discography from 1962-1996, a bibliography, and index. There are also over 200 photographs, some in color, many of which are on point with regards to specific songs (e.g., you get to see the gravestone of Eleanor Rigby, the real Bungalow Bill, and the Apple Scruffs who came in through the bathroom window. No matter what level of fan you are of the Beatles you should find plenty of interest and stories you have never heard before. At the very least, you can learn something new about your favorite Beatles songs."},{"Title":"A Hard Day's Write, Revised Edition: The Stories Behind Every Beatles' Song","review":"Steve Turner gives the background story behind every Beatles song on all their officially released albums up to Abbey Road. Other books make the same claim, but this one's the best! To me, the most fascinating entries are about John's autobiographical songs, such as 'In My Life' and 'Strawberry Fields Forever.'The story behind 'A Day In the Life' is riveting and is partly based on a personal tragedy for Paul.Find out what John's inspiration was for 'Tomorrow Never Knows.' Does Dr. Robert really exist? 'She's Leaving Home' is based on a true story Paul had read about in a newspaper. Which was the first Beatles song not to be about love? Learn how much of an influence Dr. Timothy O'Leary was. Who's Ocean Child ('Julia')? Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is behind a few songs, but not always the way you might think! A song based on a conversation with Peter Fonda? You bet! What's the story of the sitar in 'Norwegian Wood,' and just who is the mysterious woman in whose bathtub John slept? I could go on and on!The text is very well researched, and includes quotes from people who were involved with the Beatles.The photos are excellent and add to the realness of the songs. See Eleanor Rigby's gravestone, Matt Busby (from 'Dig It')and the man who 'blew his mind out in a car.'AHDW is thorough, accurate and FUN to read. If I could, I'd give it 10 stars!"},{"Title":"A Hard Day's Write, Revised Edition: The Stories Behind Every Beatles' Song","review":"Beware, this is not a high-brow re-evaluation such as Revolution In The Head. Instead, Steve Turner has written an entertaining, humorous and well-informed lowdown on all self-penned Beatle songs. The narrative is of the sort you might find a kindly hippie-uncle giving his wet-behind-the-ears nephew when asked, &quot;so who were those Beatle guys?' We get to hear plenty from Paul who's clear memory of how and why the songs were written sometimes clashes with what John or George had to say. These two are sometimes quite dismissive about the songs whereas Paul seems far more even about it all.Light is thrown on the old chestnuts; Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields, Helter Skelter, Lucy etc. Charles Manson's ravings are included. Boy, he could see apocalypse on a blank page.The book mirrors the way the guys honed their songwriting skills and matured from the lightweight fun of the early songs into depth and genuine insight from Rubber Soul on.In conclusion, Mr Taylor has joined the pantheon of great Beatles chroniclers, Hunter Davies, Philip Norman and Ian MacDonald and produced an utterly glorious 'let me take you back...'"},{"Title":"A Hard Day's Write, Revised Edition: The Stories Behind Every Beatles' Song","review":"First of all, when I saw this book in the bookstore, I thought, &quot;Cool! A book all about how the songs were written!&quot; And, being a songwriter myself, I just knew I HAD to have it! I haven't even read the whole thing yet, and I already know it's the definitive book on the work of the Beatles' songs! Things in the book, like the people who inspired the songs, are cool to find out. It's great to know that ordinary people can inspire extraordinary vision! This is definately a fun book to read!

The subtitle says it much better: &quot;The stories behind every Beatles song.&quot; And never mind academic navel-gazing about the metaphors in &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; or nonsensical philosophizing about &quot;Revolution #9.&quot; Those of us whose hearts are in the firm grip of the Beatles' rich catalog owe a debt of gratitude to ace British music journalist Steve Turner for this book. Read it for fun and for some insight into the hard work the lads put into the creation of so many deceptively simple little ditties that have deservedly become classics. Enjoy the pictures, too. This book has a couple of hundred very good photos. Books about the Beatles number many hundreds. This one deserves a place near the top of the heap for the quality of the writing and the readable, accessible journalistic format. One quibble, and I'm surprised the editors didn't catch it: there's no alphabetical, page-numbered index of the songs, not in the Table of Contents, not in the Index, either. If you want to find the story behind a specific song such as &quot;In My Life,&quot; you have to know which album the song appeared on, and approximately which cut. But that's a minor detail-Beatles afficionados know the songs on every album."},{"Title":"A Hard Day's Write, Revised Edition: The Stories Behind Every Beatles' Song","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift three years ago and am still referring to it constantly. As a die-hard Beatles fan, I not only want to enjoy the music, but I also want to know why the songs were written - who, what, where was the inspiration? Real music fans know that lyrics are the key to an artist's soul. In this book you'll find out what really happens at the end of &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, who Doctor Robert really was, and where the term Helter Skelter came from. You won't be able to put this down!"},{"Title":"A Hard Day's Write, Revised Edition: The Stories Behind Every Beatles' Song","review":"John Lennon regarded IN MY LIFE as one of his most important songs. A long poem about the favourite spots of his childhood had gone in front of it. The lyrics remind to the amazing poem of THE OLD FAMILIAR FACES of Charles Lamb [1775-1834], which John possibly knew via the widespread anthology PALGRAVE's TREASURY. It starts: I have had playmates, I have had companions... \\" sounds rhythmically like \\"There are places I remember / though some have changed, some forever ...\\" Steve Turner examines really every Beatle song back to his roots of daily experiences: Who did not know yet, now will discover, that John Lennon has meant (writing about SEXY SADIE) the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He wanted to express with this lines his annoyance over the guru's claim to leadership. Hidden behind the lyrics of the song A DAY IN LIFE is a real road accident, where the enquiry finds the photo of the squashed coupe of the hautevole&eacute; belonging TARA BROWNE. SHE IS LEAVING HOME is based on a true story Paul had read in a newspaper. Who is that woman, who inspired John to the cynical lyrics of NORWEGIAN WOOD (and inspired the Sitar of George Harrison)? More than 200 photographies are shown: Eleanor Rigby's gravestone (that unmarried woman, only watching always other women get married) - the Victorian poster about \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" - Julian Lennon's drawing of his friend \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" - I'm sure, every Beatles-Fan will enjoy this book ..."},{"Title":"A Hard Day's Write, Revised Edition: The Stories Behind Every Beatles' Song","review":"This book is a classic to me.

Every Linux Programming book I have seen so far tries to give me the whole kitchen sink. They cover databases to scripting to GUI. Thats exactly not what I want. I tend not to look at the 24hrs book's as they usually don't cover enough ground. Not this one! Warren Gay has done a superb job of covering the essential programming steps required to do succesful GNU/Unix programming (I used Solaris not Linux). If you are already familier with the C language then this is the road map to doing it right, the unix way. Revision control, makefiles, debugging, forks, pipes and unix permissions to name a few of the subjects are covered in a clear and easly understood method. Granted there are other books that cover C more in depth, then again I already have them. Kudos to you Warren Gay, I can hardly wait for your next one."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Linux Programming in 24 Hours","review":"If you new to Linux, perhaps you need other books to check for small some details which are not mentioned by the author.

It tells the story of a family that moves from the central ozarks of Missouri to Northwestern Colorado in the 1920s. It is autobiographical in nature, but the author is a superb storyteller and the pictures he paints of life in and around Craig, Colorado during the Great Depression are poignant and vivid. (True for the telling of the trip from Missouri to Colorado, as well.) Anyone who is interested in Colorado history, life during the Great Depression, or simple human interest stories about real poepl in real life will enjoy this book. For those who are not related to the author, the brief sections about family geaneologies might be a little boring, but these are a small part of the book and do not detract from the overall book. If you are from Northwest Colorado, who knows? Your name might be in the book (or at least one of your ancestors).

The imagry of a young boy leaving his green Missouri home for the harshness of northwestern Colorado--a place where winter temperatures easily drop to forty or fifty below zero, then stay there--is beautiful and spell-binding, at times it brought tears to my eyes. But the glories of a mountain spring, summer and autumn show why anyone would want to live there. At the same time, the down-home humor often makes you laugh out loud. For instance--who ever heard of a winter so cold that &quot;one fellow spotted four jackrabbits pushing a coyote to get it started.&quot; Great humor. Mr. Miller is a writer in the mold of our great humorists and great folk writers. His depiction of seeing and using his first flush toilet is one of the funniest things I've ever read. Buy this book.

Robin Winks updated this in the 1960s by comparing the historian to a detective attempting to reconstruct what happened at a crime scene.Wounded Knee was the largest SWAT operation in US history and came at the end of the Vietnam Protest movements of the late 1960s and 70s. Dee Brown's book, BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE, was a best-seller and AIM was being criticized because it lacked any support on Indian reservations. Russell Means, for example, grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, and Dennis Banks was from Fargo-Moorehead. Carter Camp was from Oklahoma City and Leonard Peltier and the Bellecourts (Clyde and Vernon) were from the Twin Cities.All of those places were a long way from Wounded Knee, a trading post, church and housing area on the Pine Ridge Sioux Reservation in South Dakota. Rolland Dewing was close to all this from his academic post at Chadron State College in Nebraska.His research is the starting point for understanding the American Indian Movement and its occupation of Wounded Knee during 1973. Dewing was there and he got it right.Since then, Hollywood has gotten it increasingly wrong and that's why Dewing's book is so valuable. It is objective, a rare thing in Indian studies, and carefully researched."},{"Title":"sed & awk (2nd Edition)","review":"I grabbed this old edition from my co-worker and found it very well written.

It's a fairly quick read with more depth than \\"The Princess Test,\\" but not as much main character development as \\"Cinderellis and the Glass Hill.\\"Robin is considered an imbecile in his family because he likes to tell jokes instead of making up words (like his two elder brothers Nat and Matt) or create poems (like his father Jake). He wants to be accepted -- a common theme in these stories -- but his relatives won't.Robin stumbles upon Lark, the also-bird-named princess to the kingdom of Biddle. They hit it off because they treat each other as normal people. Unfortunately, Robin's a commoner, and the two are discouraged from meeting again, though we know they're destined to.Robin has more of a personality than some of the other princes-to-be of the other Gail Carson Levine stories, and it's interesting to glimpse into his struggle. He likes her, he's not sure she likes him, he gets discouraged, starts to have hope, etc.The subplots are not as enchanting as the other stories. King Humphrey has a speech impediment that causes him to harrumph every word. There is one scene where this is pretty funny because he's describing what he wants done while his scribe is attempting to translate it to English (Biddlish?). It's a bit much to read aloud, however.On the other hand, the quests Robin must fulfill are absurdly funny, and listening to him work out how to build a ship that works as well on land as it does the sea is amusing."},{"Title":"The Fairy's Return (Princess Tales)","review":"I got this book from the library and it is a wonderful book! It's really funny and kinda sweet! I love it.

I can't wait until I get ella enchanted. I think you will enjoy it. I liked that it was not too romantic and that it has so much things happening."},{"Title":"The Twins (Gemquest, Book 1) (Gemquest)","review":"Who is this child? And why does he need protection? What motives compel those seeking him out with such frenzied abandon? And what drives the woman trying to save him? Gary Wassner's story opens with the tension of a pivotal moment that fills the reader with concern, curiosity, and dread. As the chapters unfold, answers to questions get doled out masterfully, but they only lead to more involved questions that draw Wassner's audience further into his words. As the exciting introduction to the Gemquest Series, \\"The Twins\\" is an action thriller sure to interest fantasy and fiction readers alike.Wassner's story reveals the structure of a world in jeopardy. It is a world where nature and intelligent life are one and the same; where the ancient Lalas trees protect the good people of their planet through magic and the communicative power of their globe-stretching roots. It is a naturalist's utopia of harmonious existence filled with religious nuance. The trees select extraordinary humans called Chosen to be their life partners, and through that joining they are able to impart knowledge of the world and its elemental magic that could be known no other way. The Chosen are revered among the people, their power is well known, and their words are respected. They are teachers and healers that complete the union between nature and the creatures that live in nature's domain. But there is a stain on the portrait of this perfect world; a smudge that disrupts the harmony. Evil is present and it soils the canvas with its destructive influence.The Lalas trees are dying and even the Chosen are not completely sure why. With each death, the protective blanket of power the Lalas have over the planet diminishes and evil spreads like disease. Colton D'are Agenathea, the embodiment of evil, threatens the world with dissolution. With his amassed army of abhorrent creatures, he wields the powers of annihilation and ruin. His lust is not for world domination; it is for the obliteration of everything. Evil beyond reason, he is compelled only to destroy.\\"The Twins\\" are two boys who happen to be the heirs to the high throne of Gwendolen. The great books known as the Tomes of Caradon, have prophesied a role for the twins in this struggle between good and evil. They are the best chance the world has to resist the assault of Colton D'are Agenathea. Embraced by the magic of the remaining Lalas, the boys' destiny is central to this growing conflict. Allied with powerful friends, including a Chosen, it is they who must find the First Tree, and retrieve the Gem of Eternity if the world is to live on. Wassner weaves a story of the struggles that surround the twins into a novel of apocalyptic dimension.\\"The Twins\\" is a tale of hope in the midst of great adversity; of life in the face of imminent destruction. Wassner cleverly details a world filled with imaginative creatures, a naturalistic philosophy, and the ever presence of magic. His characters are unusual and interesting. As Wassner chronicles several of their separate struggles, individual adventures quickly turn pages into chapters and fast paced chapters into an action packed novel. Offering an ever-widening plot, \\"The Twins\\" is an epic tale with several intertwined sub stories.Wassner's writing is intelligent and crisp. His well stated phrasing leaves the reader feeling smarter for having read it. From concept to conclusion, the story is unusual and gripping. To this reviewer, there are two things that make a book an excellent read. One is when the story is compelling enough to keep the pages turning and the other is when the foundations of the tale inspire thought even after the cover is closed. Gary Wassner's \\"The Twins\\" is an excellent read by both measures."},{"Title":"The Twins (Gemquest, Book 1) (Gemquest)","review":"It's easy to dismiss a book, which is part of a trilogy, featuring elves, orcs, a dark lord and a quest, as simply another Tolkien clone.As a reader repulsed by Jordan and Goodkind, and a fan of the grittier, new wave of fantasy by the likes of Stover, Meiville and Bakker, why on earth did I read The Twins?Firstly, a publisher taking a gamble on a new author is rare enough in this over-flooded market place where there are rumoured to be more manuscripts seeking acceptance than actual readers within the market; let alone a publisher releasing the first three books of a series together by a new author! Have you ever heard of such a thing? Okay I can see the strategy there, shelf space and fanbase building, sure, but that is incredible belief from a publisher.Secondly, this guy can write and you only have to read his recent interview at WOTMANIA to see he is an articulate, talented and passionate author.So enough hype, is it any good?The first thing that struck me, is that you will love these characters. There is a depth to Wassner's characterization and some of his creations are brilliant. There is a magic to the world he creates and the author's love of nature and the harmony he must feel himself with our world, bleeds throughout.The idea of sentient trees and their connection with their humanoid 'chosen' is fascinating and compelling. The Twins is a page turner where you almost wish you weren't coming to the end, but you must continue regardless.This adventure truly is epic and whilst written with philosophical undertones, the exploration of evil is just as detailed and fascinating as the beauty of the Lalas.Light and shade give this work resonance and I applaud the publisher for having the vision to release three books and of course, the author for writing excellent, twenty-first century, epic fantasy."},{"Title":"The Twins (Gemquest, Book 1) (Gemquest)","review":"For those looking for a Tolkein clone, you'll not find that here. Wassner weaves a world and positions his characters like a master chess player. Each piece has its part to play in the greater game that is Gemquest. Sacrifices must be made and each move grips your heart and drives you to read onward. You end with a satisfaction, but wanting, no, needing to continue.It's rare when I read a book and need time before picking up the second in a series. In this case, the ramifications of the characters feel so real that I want to fully digest what I've read before plunging headlong into a second book. I have that book next to me. Waiting. I can already hear the characters' calling me back. I think I'll heed their call."},{"Title":"The Twins (Gemquest, Book 1) (Gemquest)","review":"This 1st offering from Gary Wassner shows great promise.He created a fairly unique and interesting world to set his story in. His magic and characters are interesting and provide ample room for a good tale to be told. There is some room for improvement and since this is an earlier work of his I have reason to suspect his latter books solve any problem. This work shows that Wassner is a writer to be reckoned with and I look forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Twins (Gemquest, Book 1) (Gemquest)","review":"One cannot read this first book in the GemQuest series without being reminded of Tolkien's immortal Lord of the Rings, but this epic fantasy quickly succeeds in taking on a vibrant life of its own. Wassner constructs this tale around a significant number of characters, but he describes each of them so intimately that you feel as if you know them (so there's no problem keeping them all straight). From the harrowing abode of the Dark Lord to the prosperous human city of Pardatha to the beautiful tree-top elfin city of Seramour, Wassner truly transports the reader to every location of his envisioned fantasy land.In this world of Wassner's creation, a great darkness is spreading over the landscape, an evil so dark and dangerous that even the Lalas, ancient and sentient trees that have served as the guardians of the land for eons, have begun to fade in power and to die. Colton dar Agonthea, the Dark Lord, has begun amassing an army of orcs, trolls, sorcerers, and even more frightening creatures, knowing that his time has come at last. Ancient prophecies of a terrific struggle between good and evil are now being realized, and Colton sets out with a grim determination to eliminate the only potential threat to his genocidal plans. Legend has foretold that a young prince would appear, a last true heir of the renowned and celebrated Gwendolyn family, and that he alone would possess the power to defeat the evil Coltan and thwart his bloodthirsty ambitions. Only the true heir can discern the location of the first Lalas and remove the Gem of Eternity which lies hidden somewhere in its massive trunk. That Gem alone holds the power to stop the encroaching darkness spreading over the land and thwart Coltan's evil plans for good.That royal child, whom only a handful of people even know about, has now appeared in the city of Pardatha. Knowing nothing of his heritage, the young man must be instructed in the use of his formidable powers - and so it is that Baladar, ruler of Pardatha, has summoned three accomplished young people to guide and teach him: Cairn of Thermaye, a brilliant scholar; Robyn dar Tamarand, an expert in magic and one of the Chosen (each Lalas tree chose one individual to intimately commune with); and Filaree par D' Avalain, a skilled female warrior. Each of them faces his/her own ordeals just trying to get to Pardatha, but their problems pale in comparison to the predicament Baladar finds himself in when the boy, the world's only true hope for the future, disappears. Colton, believing the boy dwells in Pardatha still, is determined to crush that city and find the enemy he seeks. This all culminates in an action-packed and extended siege outside the walls of Pardatha by Colton and his minions of evil.I can't say enough about the characterization skills that Wassner displays in his writing. He really brings each character vividly to life, which serves to establish a strong emotional bond between the reader and the story's noble heroes early on. And yet, despite feeling as if I knew these characters personally, Wassner managed to surprise me with a major revelation about one or two of them well into the journey. Wassner also excels in the art of creating worlds, and he makes great use of this skill by transporting the reader to a fantastical setting that manages to combine a sense of the familiar alongside the exotic. The mutual relationship between the denizens of this world and their natural environment is a crucial theme, and Wassner's writing intertwines the two almost effortlessly. And, if you're looking for excitement, there is plenty of that to be found throughout these pages, culminating in the siege and determined defense of Pardatha in the later chapters.This first novel in the GemQuest series definitely leaves you wanting more, and fortunately you don't have to undergo an agonizing wait for the next installment. In an unusual but welcome publishing move, the first three GemQuest novels were released at the same time, which means you can jump right into Book Two and continue the adventure as soon as you finish reading The Twins."},{"Title":"The Twins (Gemquest, Book 1) (Gemquest)","review":"Being somewhat new to the genre of \\"Epic Fantasy\\", I wasn't sure what to expect with The Twins. I got more than I bargained for in one of helluva roller coaster, and as there is soon to be 4 books in the series, it ain't over yet.I can't do justice to Wassner's story telling skills without divulging some plot details. Don't worry, no spoilers, yet. The World of The Twins is populated by humans, elves, dwarves, trolls, other magical creatures, and it's most beautiful facet, the sentient race of trees, known as the Lalas. Every Lala chooses a human partner, who, once chosen, is seen as a sacred representative of the Lalas, and treated like priestly nobility. The Lalas communicate with each other, and their chosen, through their network of interconnected roots, which cover the entire earth. They are literally a binding force, keeping the world and it's peoples at peace. All Lalas descend from \\"The First\\" Lala, an ancient and myth shrouded tree, who holds the sacred Gem of Eternity. When the Gem begins to fade, the trees begin to die, taking their chosen, and soon the rest of the world, with them. The child of the ancient prophecies must be found and trained to fulfill his destiny, the Gem of Eternity must be found, and the Dark Lord with a deep hatred of the Lalas in his heart must be stopped.Sound heavy? It is. Sound epic? It is. If you think you can read just the first book in the series and get everything out of it that's to be gotten, think again.As a fan of the \\"don't tell me, show me\\" style of writing, I appreciated the ways in which Wassner introduces us to his incredibly detailed world: through the eyes and experiences of his characters. Everyone is reshaped in some fashion by what happens to them. Nothing in this world happens in a vacuum, and everything happens for a reason. The Twins involves a kaleidescope of characters, all with fully developed personalities, backgrounds, and belief systems. From the mysterious boy Tomas, to the creepy and seductive Dark Lord Colton, everyone has a story to tell, and everyone must work together to ensure that their side wins the ultimate battle. As much as I want to say how cool the battle scenes are, and how suspenseful the chase scenes are (they are very cool, and quite suspensful), the action is merely the byproduct of what's going on in the plot.The book is beautifully written, there is enough detail that I felt I was getting to know everyone quite well, but not so much that I felt I was drowning in it. In an emotional, evocative manner, The Twins reminds me a little of The Neverending Story, although the plots are drastically different. That's my crazy brain for you!Wassner is a master of foreshadowing, while still keeping the reader guessing at every plot twist. He is a loving and passionate creator for this world, giving it strengths, passions, it's own mythology, and a dark side to balance it all out. Plot lines and character's lives intertwine in unexpected ways to show that everything is connected in one manner or another.The less than positive comments I have are personal pet peeves, and probably have nothing to do with the quality of the book. Someone who I thought was going to be a main character spends the entire book in a coma, so I didn't get to know him at all. I'm going to assume that Wassner has a good reason for this. At the end, I felt the chapters get a little short. Not that they weren't full of information, because they were, they just seemed cut up a little oddly, and made things a little choppy at times.Also on a personal note, I'm a bit of a tree hugger, so I just adored the sentient tree thing.Four and a half spaceships out of five.Reviewer: Andrea Johnson for Multiverse Reviews"},{"Title":"The Twins (Gemquest, Book 1) (Gemquest)","review":"WHILE READING THE NOVELS I WAS TOTALLY SWEPT UP IN THE VISUAL BEAUTY AND IMAGINATIVE STORY - IT HAD SUCH AN ORGANIC FLOW I READ ALL THREE BOOKS IN THE SERIES IN ONE MONTH...AND HAVE BEEN LEFT HUNGRY FOR THE FOURTH.I WAS IMPRESSED WITH GARY'S STYLE OF WRITING.

I know very little of the publisher, Windstorm Creative, the second publisher Mr. Wassner's Gemquest series has been with since the books have been in print. All that said, by book's end, Mr. Wassner had me hooked into his story and the world he created.While I enjoyed the book, it is not without its faults. Some occaisionally repeated words and phrases cropped up, and times, some passages in general were a overly wordy. The style is almost lyrical, and as I became more entrenched in the world Wassner created, things either became less wordy and evened out, or I simply became more acustomed to the style. The occasional wordiness is perhaps the only negative about the book, so I figured I'd get that out of the way first.The blurb/TV Guide version of the book is this: The Lalas, sentient trees who have acted as protectors to the land and the people, are dying. The dark wizard Colton wants to hasten the death of all the Lalas, which will further him towards his goal of disollution. In order to see his goal, Colton must kill the prophesized saviour, the heir the throne of Gwendolen to the kingdom which he destroys in the beginning of the novel. Baladar, the ruler of the city of Pardatha, calls a select group of people together to shephered and educate the young heir of Gwendolen towards his final conflict with Colton. While this is a familiar formula to most fantasy readers, its in what Wassner does with this theme, adding different flavors and his own voice that make the story work. I think writers, fantasy writers in particular, walk a pretty fine line between dumping too much information about the world they created and balancing that with providing a truly immersive reading experience. One good way Wassner showed his world was through the characters and their reactions and feelings about the world. By the end of _The Twins_ I felt I knew the world pretty well and could sympathise with the characters, but there were still more things I wanted to discover. The world of GemQuest is both familiar and fresh, that's why I like Epic Fantasy so much, I think. I enjoy some of the familiar trappings of the genre and style, but I also like seeing a new flavor thrown in, a new twist on things - something Gary has been able to do.Though the early parts were a bit slow, about halfway through, things really picked up for me and I became wrapped up in the plight of these people and fully immersed in the world. Wassner did some really interesting things in the book, some things I haven't come across in reading alot of the fantasy I've read. One of the greater strengths of the story is how Wassner managed to craft a story in the tradition of the genre, specifically the quest and struggle against Dark Lord, that both honors the tradition and forges something fresh and entertaining. I think he did a nice job with the characters and found it particularly interesting that by novel's end, one of the titular Twins, while on stage for many scenes, was still unconcious. Some characters come across more genuinely than others. The young Tomas is quite intriguing and I'm looking forward to being the fly on the wall when he meets his twin, Davmiran. While Baladar, the one who calls these people together, fits the Gandalf role in some respects, I like that he doesn't quite have all the answers. Baladar is trying to bring all these people together, but he certainly doesn't know everything and is playing within rules he doesn't completely know. I think Cairn, one of those called by Baladar, fits the Gandalf role in some respects, too, but I think he is much more than that, as well. I'm getting good sense of how important Tomas may be through Cairn's eyes. Thus far, Colton seems like the typical almost faceless, Dark Overlord, I'm hoping more is revealed about Colton in later volumes. Wassner conveyed a good sense of connectivity between the people and the trees and the importance of the trees to the land itself.Despite a bit of deus ex machina towards the ending of _The Twins_, the price the defenders of Pardatha was quite high. At one point, I was almost expecting Gary to somehow return the characters to the status quo, a lesser writer may have indulged in the happier ending. I think Gary took the proper fork in the road there, not that writers should indulge in shaking up the status quo just for hell of it. If it serves the story, then fine. Here it did.To sum it all up, while a bit flawed as most debut novels are, _GemQuest: The Twins_ was an enjoyable reading experience and I'm looking forward to reading more about these characters and the world they inhabit."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Ceramic Art","review":"This is an excellent reference book for someone learning to work with clay, or people who already are proficient.

It's a dated book (1972) but I didn't notice much change in newer volumes on ceramics. There are few color photos, but the skills and ideas taught are suficient in black and white photos.

I was surprised how I was moved by it, tho he is a generation before me. Some of the farming practices he describes (such as threshing from stacks) I only heard about, but others were not too different from when I was a boy in a different part of Iowa. Any one who grew up on a farm or has rural roots will be affected by this book, maybe not as powerfully as was I but it is a very pleasant book to read. The author's few poems (which were published in papers at times) are in the book, and they while not great poetry have a charm which surprises.

The stories include: Dogies, Dust, and the Drink; Hired Killers and Winter Underwear; The Great Elk Migration; The Hermit of Yampa Canyon, Riding with Butch Cassidy; Buzzards Don't Talk; The Wild Horse Man; Dirty Cattle Thieves; Tom Horn; Queen Ann Bassett, and more. Of special note is the epilogue: The Demise of the Two-Bar Rooster.

You can almost smell the campfire and the Arbuckles' Coffee brewing over it, right alongside the scent of horses, cattle, and sage. &quot;The Arbuckle Cafe: Classic Cowboy Stories&quot; creates its own setting and Val FitzPatrick's style is such that you almost hear the cowboys swapping the yarns around the fire. However, there's far more truth to the tales than the title suggests. Although FitzPatrick, a Colorado native born in 1886, missed trailing the big herds, he began cowboying at age 13 for the K Diamond Cattle Company. At age 14 he began working for the Two-Bar Cattle Company, which was &quot;the goal of nearly every young man in the area.&quot; Cowboying left its mark: FitzPatrick learned to appreciate a good tale and how to tell it."},{"Title":"The Arbuckle Cafe: Classic Cowboy Stories","review":"One of the best books ever.

This jewel of a book, by Val FitzPatrick, allows us to reflect upon just how rapidly we have become gored and dependant upon our stampeding, technology driven society. Mr.Fitzpatrick, who died in 1988 vividly recounts stories from his youth when none other than Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid slid their boots under his mother's kitchen table for a quick meal on their trip down the old outlaw trail. These stories, while regional in scope of subject, are a veritible history lesson of how rural life through out the west was in the days before, airplanes, cars, paved roads or even telephones. Told in a down to earth manner, neither glamorizing or romanticizing the &quot;good old days&quot; he vividly paints a picture showing the good and the bad, as well as the joy and hardships of those times of his early years.

But when the Civil War came, his beliefs, like Sam Houston's, bade him follow the Union, while his younger brother Dal chose the Confederacy. Now it's 1865 and he's on his way home, not sure if he'll be welcome but determined to at least assure himself that his kin came through alive. Passing through a dismal robbers' nest of a town in western Arkansas, he links up with a wounded Dal, who faces a lynching by some mustered-out Union soldiers eager to get hold of his horse and gear, and they journey on together. But before long they learn that a band of disaffected and unsurrendered Rebs led by Col. Henry T. Ashford (a man with whom Dal once rode) is working its way down through east Texas, stealing cattle, horses, and young women to sell into slavery in Mexico. Among the captives is Mac and Dal's little sister Gretchen, their brother Jesse (earmarked for labor in the mines), and Kate Carlisle, with whom Dal had something of an understanding before he left for the army. Fighting men are scarce in Texas, with so many young ones killed or wounded in the War and most of the survivors still on their way home. It's up to the two Travens, assisted by their ne'er-do-well uncle Happy Jack, to catch up with Ashford's band before he can get over the border or rendezvous with a ship that will take his prisoners to Mexico. Meanwhile, the courageous and resourceful Kate is doing her best to stall the advance or get herself some help in the form of a black-sheep uncle of her own, former ship's captain (and reputed pirate) Martin Connery, who now owns a prosperous ranch below Victoria and stands aloof from all human conflicts.This fast-moving tale follows the Travens and Kate as the renegades move steadily south, introducing the reader by the way to the terrain and history of a part of Texas that many may not have been aware of. Although I tend to question whether Southerners--no matter how degraded--would ever have gotten into the woman-stealing business, I enjoyed the book itself; L'Amour is a master of pace and his prose is highly readable and at times almost bardic. Oddly, given that the book came before the TV-movieThe Shadow Riders(which I also recommend), it's dedicated to the latter's cast and crew. This would be a good title with which to begin your acquaintance with one of the most successful and widest-read Western authors of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Shadow Riders","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book. As much as I like the movie I wish it had stuck a little closer to this version of the story."},{"Title":"Shadow Riders","review":"I read this book a long time before the movie with Sam Elliot was made, so I like the book better. But both the movie and the book are great. Most of the differences are in what happens while the men are searching for the kidnapped women. Probably you'll like one better than the other, but which one you like better will most likely depend on whether you like reading or watching tv better. In a nutshell, two brothers who served on opposite sides of the Civil War, return home to find that renegades have kidnapped their siblings and also a woman that one of the men planned to marry. This same group have stolen a lot of other people; planning to take them to Mexico to sell (the brothers don't know that at first) and the two brothers take off after them to bring them home."},{"Title":"Shadow Riders","review":"The aftermath of civil war are very hot.

On top of this, the recipes are wonderful, easy to prepare and different. The personal observations of the author add interest to the book. I recently had the pleasure of sailing with Captain Anne and the crew of the J.&E. Riggin and can attest to the fact that her cooking skills are outstanding. This book is well worth the money."},{"Title":"At Home, at Sea: Recipes from the Maine Windjammer","review":"This was a happy surprise in my Christmas stocking this year, after my mother ran into the author at Barnes and Noble. I'm so glad she snagged me a copy, since I'm not quite sure what I'd do without this cookbook in my home.This is one of those cookbooks that you don't know if you should put in your kitchen with the rest of the cookbooks, or out on the coffee table so that everybody can enjoy it. This book features wonderfully sophisticated home-cooking style recipes, breathtaking photos from the J&E; Riggin, the Maine Windjammer that's currently cared for by the author and her husband, and oodles of stories about the Windjammer, their voyages, their history, and the ideas behind these recipes. This cookbook has the feel of a family journal or photo album, which is really a great feeling that is lost with a lot of cookbooks. So often these days when you buy a cookbook, it feels like the recipes featured in it are made once or twice in a test kitchen before getting a rubber-stamped approval to be shown in their mass-produced cookbook. But you don't feel that with this book. You know that these recipes were made dozens, maybe hundreds of times to hundreds of hungry people before being collected and featured in a cookbook that feels like should be a personal family cookbook, not something you can just pick up at a bookstore. I love that feel.There are a ton of recipes in this book, not different versions of the same ol' meals that you can find in any cookbook. Unique recipes, ones that I've never seen on paper other than from my mother's handwritten recipe cards. Recipes like German Apple Pancakes, Roasted Mushrooms and Artichoke Sauce, Nectarine-Blueberry Bread, Ginger Shortbread, Black Bottom Banana Cream Pie, Pumpkin Cheesecake, Pork Pot Pie, Lemon Lobster with Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Wassail Bowl Punch... I could go on and on. Amazing. And this recipe book is a \\"from scratch\\" book, which I think is such a blessing, because there is nothing more frustrating than buying a cookbook with 100 different ways to prepare a can of \\"cream of chicken\\" soup and a can of refrigerator biscuits. This is a cookbook for cooks, and those of us who wish we were. We need more cookbooks out there like this.There is next to nothing wrong with this cookbook. The only observations I have made is that sometimes I need a little more description on the making of a recipe (for example, a notation the dough will be runny, lumpy, etc) as there have been a recipes that I made where the consistency or appearance wasn't quite what I expected. Also, it is obvious that some of these recipes were reduced from a recipe that made more servings for more people, so some of the seasonings and ingredients have to be tweaked for a more intimate setting. No big deal, just something to keep in mind.I love this cookbook. My favorite recipes thus far include the German Apple Pancakes, Pork Pot Pie, Rita's Double Toffee Delight, and the Wassail Punch. Even as we speak I have a batch of Double Toffee Delights filling my house with its delicious aroma. Every time I use this book, I remember Maine vacations, fine meals, happy memories... It's the best investment in a book I think anybody could make.This cookbook is a must-have for anybody. I can't say enough wonderful things about it."},{"Title":"At Home, at Sea: Recipes from the Maine Windjammer","review":"I was really glad to receive this cookbook as a gift as I have found it great fun to use. I think the layout of the cookbook was very well done as well as the color of the pages. . not something you see very often in a cookbook. The pictures are really beautiful and catch the feeling of the sea. I enjoy the margin notes in each section as well as, for example, in the Meat Section, Anne's description of the dinner menus she serves on board or under Yeast Breads her suggestions on proofing, flour vs water, etc. I found these very helpful. My one suggestion would be that if you weren't familiar with yeast breads, you wouldn't know how hot the \\"warm water\\" should be. Possibly if a temp. was added indicating that the \\"warm water\\" should be 105/110 it might be helpful. Also, after you make muffins some indication on whether they should be left in the pan or taken out. I loved the Blueberry Lemon Bread and so did some of my friends and especially Dana's Maple-Dill Dressing . .yum-o!

But, ever since I started using this cookbook, I have not only been preparing good wholesome dishes for my daughter and I, but have found myself trying new things. I am not known as the cook in my family, but having tried out a few recipes at family get-togethers, my family now wonders what I will be making next (and did she really make that?).I can follow a recipe as long as it is easy to make, and with this book it's not only easy, it's fun. I love reading the overall story of Anne, her husband Jon and children, Chloe and Ella. It adds a very personal touch to something that I used to think of as \\"a book of food to make\\".Not only are the recipes great, the photos in this book are so fantastic-giving you a real sense of being in Maine on a windjammer. It truly makes me want to go sailing again. I especially enjoyed the section called 'A Week at Sea'. How much better could life get-spending a whole week relaxing with the wind in your hair, taking part of hundred year old traditions, and eating some of the most delectable food you have ever tasted?! I don't think it can. Having sailed on the J&E; Riggin myself, I can say with absoluteness that the mouth-watering cuisine that folks can have onboard, they can also have at home with this book.Anyone that either buys a copy or receives one as a gift will from that point on consider this their favorite cookbook- I sure know I do!"},{"Title":"At Home, at Sea: Recipes from the Maine Windjammer","review":"Several years ago a friend and I sailed on the J & E Riggan, one of the Maine schooners, owned by Capts Anne Mahle and John Finger.

The novice gardener will find these descriptions extremely helpful. However, color pictures of the plants would be immensely helpful. The one thing I find annoying about this book is it defines the probability a plant may be eaten by deer as: Rarely, Seldom, Occasionally, Frequently or Absolutely NOT. I question the legitimacy of such detailed breakdowns, as deer are very similar to people regarding food. First, both people and deer have regional food preferences (e.g., Italian food verses Chinese). Deer in my neighborhood may love the same plant that deer in your neighborhood hate. Second, individual deer, like humans, have their own preferences. For example, I love garlic but my mother hates it. As such, it would be much more accurate and useful if the author categorized plants into one of three groups: Rarely, Occasionally and Frequently. This would also help eliminate discussions between confused gardeners and garden center staff trying to quantify the difference between rarely, seldom and, occasionally.This book is the perfect companion to Deer Proofing Your Yard &amp; Garden, by Rhonda Massingham Hart. The one area where Deer Proofing Your Yard &amp; Garden is weak, plant descriptions, is the area where Gardening in Deer Country excels."},{"Title":"GARDENING IN DEER COUNTRY (Gardening Guides Series)","review":"Gardening in Deer Country is a life savior.

Thank goodness for the book of the season."},{"Title":"GARDENING IN DEER COUNTRY (Gardening Guides Series)","review":"This is a very helpful book listing plants that deer prefer not to eat.

And while this is true, also keep in mind; \`All that is green is edible.' Well, at least to something out there.So when all of us urban gorillas, myself included, decide to forsake civilization in pursuit of the simple life, keep the former two adages in mind. Because to our four legged friends, all that is green is definitely edible to them. Fleeing the cities in throngs and invading the sub-urban country, we fail to keep in mind that we are the interlopers. Not the other way around. The animals definitely have the advantage.However, our station, and an ecologically balanced existence, is not without hope. By reading \\"Gardening in Deer Country\\", you can level the playing field. The author provides an in-depth, tongue in cheek survival guide. He outlines this unfamiliar environment, provides a thorough description of its inhabitants, together with their strengths and weaknesses, as well as a comprehensive guide to actually enjoy ourselves while sleeping with the enemy.Before you tell society to take its stiflingly crowded, single minded myopic existence and shove it, read this book. Follow it explicitly. Then go out and purchase as many bug zappers as possible and wait for the invasion."},{"Title":"SECRET LIFE OF SAEED. The pessoptimist","review":"Saeed, the narrator of the story, belongs to the large family of Pessoptimists. He can feel like a pessimist, or like an optimist, but can never tell the two apart. Saeed is an Arab. When Israel conquered part of Palestine, he did not flee but stayed behind to become an Israeli citizen. That did not help him much - Arab remains Arab.The book is a humorous allegory, wrapped around everyday Arab life, with a bitter nucleus of Israeli oppression. Like Voltaire?s Candide, Saeed believes that this is the best of all worlds. To him it seems quite natural that the occupying forces arrest people in the middle of the night for no reason, that they deport them, that they blow up houses, and that they devastate whole villages. After all, they won the war, and everything - and everybody - now belongs to them. There are those Arabs who want to retaliate immediately. But they are told that the tree is not loved for its flowers, but for its fruit. After all, it took them close to two hundred years to throw out the crusaders. Saeed is the simple soul who sees what goes on around him, but cannot understand why it is so. The bitterness comes with the explanation.Mr. Habiby wrote a devastating satire. His own life paralleled that of Saeed: he was an Arab in Israel, even a member of the Israeli parliament. He wrote this book almost 30 years ago. It is still valid."},{"Title":"SECRET LIFE OF SAEED. The pessoptimist","review":"Saeed the Pessoptimist now ranks in my pantheon of comic heroes up there with Swejk, Yossarian, Candide, Don Quixote and Joe from &quot;Milagro Beanfield War.&quot;This is a book to be read over and over again.For Americans like me persuaded to believe Israelis occupied an empty land (Palestine) after the horrors of WWII, Edward Said's works are helpful. For the feeling and experience of a Palestinian in Israel, however, Habibi gave us a distilled, comic masterpiece. &quot;The Pessoptimist&quot; is not just one more protest novel. Habibi ranks in the history of the comic novel for his amazing treatment of Time. Time itself -- history -- become original comic characters in this novel, their companions being Saeed's &quot;friends from outer space.&quot; The author said Swejk and Candide inspired him. &quot;Pessoptimist&quot; is picaresque but the chapters (events, whatever) are written in a style of wonderful, unique, surreal journalism that span many years rather than occurring within the context of a single journey. So, quite aside from Habibi's achievement in making Palestinians real (a neat trick at present and one that won't make your life any easier when you watch the news) I think his style adds something to the development of the comic novel. It opens new possibilities for treating time and history. So it is a real contribution to the understanding we gain from literature."},{"Title":"SECRET LIFE OF SAEED. The pessoptimist","review":"As its subtitle implies, \\"The Secret Life of Saeed\\" blends optimism and pessimism, tragedy and comedy, horror and farce, cynicism and gullibility. A Palestinian in occupied territory, Saeed has lived through both wars (1948 and 1967); although he is an informer on the payroll of the Israeli government, he's too stupid to be of any real threat to his own people, but he is equally unable to protect his own family. As Salma Khadra Jayyusi notes in the introduction, Saeed is caught between \\"the extreme poles of Zionist colonialism and Palestinian resistance.\\"Saeed is able to relate his tale only when he is rescued by an extraterrestrial being (perhaps the Reaper himself) who removes him physically from the absurdities in which he is trapped. In each part of the subsequent autobiographical account, he relates a different loss--of his first love, of his wife and son, of the daughter of his first love--each under different circumstances that are identical in their irrationality. A coward himself, comically useless to his superiors, he is surrounded by rebels. But, once freed from earthly shackles, he can unsparingly ridicule his oppressors, and his tale mocks both Arab oligarchies and Israeli officials.Habiby's novel owes much to Voltaire, as he makes clear in both the book's title and in a chapter called \\"The Amazing Similarity between Candide and Saeed.\\" When his extraterrestrial savior points out the resemblance, Saeed responds, \\"Don't blame me for that. Blame our way of life that hasn't changed since Voltaire's day,\\" and he draws parallels between Pangloss and Israeli dignitaries and between Candide's experiences and recent Palestinian history. The difference, of course, is that Candide always concluded that \\"All is well in the world,\\" while Saeed the pessoptimist is not so sure.Habiby's wit is most palatable when it is barbed, and his story is most powerful when it is tragic. The farce tends to silliness, however, occasionally threatening to undercut the satire. (To be frank, I have never been able to appreciate the slapstick follies in Voltaire's novel, either.) There's no doubt that much of the book's wit and wordplay is lost in the translation between languages and cultures; without the translators' pages of notes, I would have been lost. Nevertheless, the novel will surprise you with its most powerful scenes, especially when Saeed meets his battered namesake in prison and the ambiguous, tragic, climactic episode depicting the fate of his son and wife, an event that manages to be both melancholy and glorious. Such passages remind the reader that Saeed (as well as his fellow Palestinians) can hardly hope to be in control of the world in which he lives; although unchained, he remains \\"a prisoner unable to escape.\\""},{"Title":"SECRET LIFE OF SAEED. The pessoptimist","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It's not your run of the mill Palestinian literature - Emile Habiby is a very unique writer who is quirky & quick-witted. Anyone can enjoy this story - it has a universal human truth and is extremely touching. The character of Saeed is so different and out there, you can't help but have a soft spot for the poor guy. It is one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"SECRET LIFE OF SAEED. The pessoptimist","review":"Emile Habiby invented a new genre of Arab literature when he wrote this book. Instead of convincing the reader of Palestinian suffering through accusatory statements, shockingly violent imagery, or political rhetoric, he uses an unreliable idiot, who happens to be a Palestinian citizen of Israel, an informer, and a pretty pathetic character, to tell the story of Palestinian collective memory and current realities through satire, sarcasm, and seemingly stupid, yet really witty narration. This book is amazing!"},{"Title":"SECRET LIFE OF SAEED. The pessoptimist","review":"As much as I tried to get into the book, I felt like there was too much effort to talk about a whole lot of things in a short time. There were so many events that took place, and not enough time spent to explain clearly the situation, or give a better history to the dynamics of what was happening...I also felt that the translation could have taken a lot of what the real intent was. I was not able to live the story, and get involved to what was taking place..."},{"Title":"Recovering Rude","review":"Recovering Rude reads like a who-done-it with an inconclusive ending, but is, in fact, a political memoir of revolutionary struggles in India and the personal story of the author. The three main characters are Rude, whom we get to know through his diary, Allan, who also writes what appears to be a diary but is, in fact, commenting on the events described in the book and Nina, who is interesting in salvaging the diaries for posterity.The novel takes us from an upper middle-class neighborhood in Calcutta, where there are bloody clashes between well-to-do students and the police, through a fancy high-rise in Houston which reeks of sulphur all the way to the frozen streets of Montreal, where one lone exile is starving and cold. The language is often terse, sometimes humourous and occasionally tinged with the vocal overtones of Anglo Indians in Calcutta or street kids in the Deep South.It is a novel that engages our curiosity and makes us want to learn more, not only about what happened to Rude, but also about the revolutionary movement that shook Naxalbari in India in the late sixties. People to whom the term &quot;naxalites&quot; is familiar will also understand the subtext that permeates the novel. The general reader might miss some clues, but will in any case find it an intriguing novel which might whet his appetite for current events.Highly recommended for history buffs, persons interested in South Asia and the general reader who knows that Indian writers are some of the hottest writers around!"},{"Title":"Windows 2000 Systems Programming Black Book: The Only Reference Needed to Successfully Deploy Applications Within the Windows NT Operating System!","review":"In my humble opinion this book should have been classified as a more win32 api programming book. When I purchased it I was hoping to have a referenced comparison between systems programming in NT 4.00 and 2000. When I refer to Systems programming I refer to device driver, I/O control systems, File Systems, etc. A really big disapointment was the section on Security, Kerberos was only mentioned in the last section of the chapter.The order of topics seems strange, I guess I do not understand why ActiveX received a 100 pages in the second chapter while memory management received 20 in chapter 7."},{"Title":"Windows 2000 Systems Programming Black Book: The Only Reference Needed to Successfully Deploy Applications Within the Windows NT Operating System!","review":"This book is basically about the applications of ActiveX (mostly MFC, but ATL is also used in Chap. 10) to Windows systems programming in a somewhat narrow sense, excluding low-level issues such as drivers, and also (mostly) security. Much of it is also relevant to NT and Win9X.The examples are very well chosen, and if you study the code carefully you'll learn a lot, for there are many interesting details not discussed in the text. Have your on-line help at the ready -- and be prepared to do some sleuthing in atlsnap.h when you get to Chap. 10! Though the author cut his teeth on UNIX, he's also a Windows expert and handles the Windows API very adroitly, making the code a real pleasure to read. A few of the code examples don't quite work &quot;right out of the box&quot;, but it's easy to fix them. Besides, a few bumps in the road help keep me awake.The best chapters are the longest ones -- console apps, internet programming, shell programming and snap-ins (how many people know how to create a Windows shortcut programmatically?), and interprocess communications. There is also a long and useful review of ActiveX (I find some of ActiveX rather indigestible even the second or third time around).If you don't know ActiveX yet, you're not ready for this book. But Williams has written another book on ActiveX, which judging from this one should be excellent; or you can learn the subject from Grimes et al., &quot;Beginning ATL COM Programming&quot; as I did, or some other way.In sum, if you are already an advanced but nonexpert programmer this book will help you extend your knowledge further."},{"Title":"Windows 2000 Systems Programming Black Book: The Only Reference Needed to Successfully Deploy Applications Within the Windows NT Operating System!","review":"I'm only about half way through this book but it is really worth it. The material is really about Windows NT in general with a lot of Win2K-specific material but it isn't just about Win2K so if you are coming from Win98 or whatever that's OK.I liked the ActiveX part -- I finally &quot;get&quot; ActiveX. I've never read such a clear explanation of the WHY of ActiveX before.Because of the W2K stuff, some parts of it is stuff you probably won't use every day. I don't care about fibers or job control, but someone does I'm sure. Completion ports are obscure but I like them.The memory chapter talks alot about virtualalloc and how to make sparse arrays, read only pages and stuff. Haven't got to that yet. Haven't got to the security chapter either but it talks about PROGRAMMING security. Seems to me Kerberos is more of an admin problem -- programmers don't see the difference.The ATL stuff near the end looks good too. Now that I'm more interested in ActiveX, I want to try ATL.A big book but well worth the time."},{"Title":"Windows 2000 Systems Programming Black Book: The Only Reference Needed to Successfully Deploy Applications Within the Windows NT Operating System!","review":"I don't think categorizing as Win32 or System Programming is the book's fault.

I bought it with doubt for three reasons: (1) 1/3 bad review, although it is only one (2) many used copies to be sold (3) I saw it on sale in some real world book store.

Parrinder qualifies West African polytheism by noting the concept of a single principal deity. This spirit, however, is considered remote. This deity is not usually approached directly. Instead, prayers and offerings are directed to lesser though powerful spirits.The ghosts of ancestors whose names are remembered are also venerated. Gifts of food, and other signs of respect, honor the place the recently-deceased continue to hold in the family and society.The practices of fortunetellers and diviners are also discussed. The religious practices of various devotional centers, called houses of a god, feature the ritual death and rebirth of devotees. Throughout West Africa, spiritual vocation means becoming a new person. Scarification and learning a new language are often part of starting a new spiritual life.The concepts and practices considered by Parrinder offer fascinating insights into West African theology. A good companion work would be Parrinder's excellent West African Psychology. Dominique Zahan's The Religion, Spirituality and Thought of Traditional Africa is also an excellent study. The perspectives are different; for example, Zahan mainly considers ethnic groups in French-speaking Africa, whereas Parrinder concentrates on English-speaking areas of West Africa."},{"Title":"Verus Israel (Littman Library of Jewish Civilization)","review":"Verus Israel is, without a doubt, an important milestone in the history of studies in early Jewish-Christian relations. Its scholarship is strong, its intentions are noble, and its conclusions are logical. That said, however, it is important to remember that it a milestone, written some time ago. Milestones show us how far we have come, but once we have passed them we must realize that they were not the destination.Marcel Simon wrote Verus Israel some fifty years ago, in the shadow of the Holocaust. Despite the strange times in which he wrote, his work is fairly unbiased, but only in relation to other works of the period. Serious modern scholarship makes Verus Israel, in comparison, seem like something of a cultural relic which, in many ways, it is. Although a mere fifty years is brief when seen beside the nineteen centuries separating Simon from his period of interest, vast stores of data have since been found, and many basic assumptions in the field have changed.Verus Israel is a classic, and a worthwhile read if you're interested not just in the field of ancient Christian-Jewish relations, but also in the subject's history. Reading this book alone, however, could lead to a false impression of what scholars currently consider to be reliable. It will be best read with several modern works on the subject."},{"Title":"Baltimore Bride's Quilt Designs (Dover Pictorial Archives)","review":"This book is a great addition to the Baltimore Album style patterns you already have.

There are no instructions for the patterns...though any quilter with any experience could easily put the designs together. Also, the patterns are not to size, that is unless you prefere miniature quilts. All of the designs are sketched on a page, some have 2 to a page, and are all in black and white. There are no pictures of any of the completed designs. If you plan to use this book for quilting it would make for a complicated quilting motif.Here is what I will probably do with it:1. Make a copy of a design so that I can use colored pencils to help me visualize the pattern I want to make. (Keep the book clean!)2. Make an enlarged copy (or 2) to make freezer paper templates to use in the applique design.Someone only interested in the designs could also use them to make cards, embroidery, quilting motifs, and possibly decorate other artful crafts.Having said that, had I seen this book in the store I would most likely NOT have purchased it but since I have I will make the most out of it. This is definitely not for a beginner quilter who would need and appreciate directions and guidance on putting the designs together. However, I think that it will be a helpful aid in the future."},{"Title":"I Want My MP3!: How to Download, Rip, & Play Digital Music","review":"This book has everything that you would ever need to know to get started or take your MP3 skills to the next level.

As a Christian I truly believe that people in the Church need to understand the difference between religion and a true spiritual relationship with God. I think that overall modern Christians are too judgmental and that the evils of fundamentalism should be exposed. This book does that well, the author does a good job of making a link between judgmental thinking and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. However the book is not very well-written. The author repeats the same points over and over again, often obnoxiously beating a dead horse. The book is a little over 200 pages but could have easily been 100 pages. Also, the viewpoint of the author is very evangelical; this is obvious when he seems to suggest a very literal understanding of the Genesis and the Adam and Eve story. This isn't such a big deal but may irritate more liberal Christians who see that as more symbolic than literal. Overall I think that the author did a good job in explaining this most important issue, and I would recommend this book, but would probably recommend a few other books first that happen to be a little better written."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"we used it for small group and everyone complained that it was good bedtime reading material if you needed something to put you to sleep. we did not get a lot from it or find it overly insightful."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"This book should be studied in depth by all who are concerned about doing the right thing for the right reason.

It clearly helps understand what is/has happened in religion and how the institutional church has gone astray. I have come to expect his scripture filled writings to be thought provoking.

The antidote to judgementalism presented here is effective as the malady is well diagnosed. Man wants to be the judge of all things, himself, others, and God. In eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man came to mistake judgmentalism for righteousness and the rest is the visible history of the empire of churchism.

I always heard growing up that we should love and that God was love and all that, but that we should never sacrifice the truth with love.Boyd demonstrates with a convincing theological argument that love isn't the opposite of truth; that we should love abundantly and extravagantly all the time to all people. This is not easy believism. This is not liberal. Boyd points out that we can never be the people we're supposed to be until we have escaped the bonds of judgmentalism.I was like that once. I was bound and neutralized by my inability to love others. Oh, I thought I was being loving. I didn't understand that I was trying to do the work of the Holy Spirit in others lives, and I was terrible at it.In just over 200 pages, Boyd clears a lot of things up for us. He helps us to be freed from lies we believe about others and ourselves.

This book is written with an almost philosophical eloquence that brings to life the real meaning of the fall of man. There are a lot of negative reviews about this work but like someone already noted above, this sheds light on the very thing that Dr. Boyd discusses in this work. People are so fixated on \\"what should I do to get to heaven?\\" They become slaves to the rituals where they're taught to repeat over and over and you receive eternal life. We Christians have gotten this reputation to be close minded and obviously judgemental because we feel that we have the right to judge others according to OUR preceived ideology of good and evil but WE'RE also in the FALLEN state! Our moral compass is so diswayed because we are truly looking through the lens of sinners. We all need to show everyone around the love that Christ showed us on Calvary and stop this infighting. I HIGHLY reccomend this work."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"Having recently read this book, I came here to see, after the fact, what others had to say. I was surprised to find one commentor from Australia unreasonably denegrate the book and Boyd, and then state it was un-Scriptural (or un-Biblical). So much for common Biblical sense - not that I'm judging the person, or anything...Greg Boyd found his way into my realm of thinking with 'God of the Possible'. It was an astonishingly simple statement of the 'openness' position. While I did not agree with everything he stated there, his attitude was a welcome change in conservative evangelical theology.I have since read other of his works, but none have affected me the way this one (Repenting of Religion) has, striking on an area that I myself have been guilty of, recgnizing it as a widespread issue, especially in conservative evangelical circles, and moreso in the Fundamentalist camp.Thre are those who have recognized the failures in Christianity and are re-thinking. They dare to walk contrary to the well-established theologies and traditional-think. They look for a new approach, a different way. The Emergent movement is an example, and while I have serious differences of opinion, I understand their motivation, and pray that they will re-center and progress through this orientaion period to a useful move along God's path. The Church needs bold thinking to redirect it to the path Jesus intended when He set it up. Clearly it is failing on many fronts.Boyd addresses one of the glaring inconsistencies in the Church, turning people away by a self-righteous attitude of judgementalism. Imagine, the very God who loves us so much is misrepresented by His own Church, focusing on judgerment rather than love. Instead of welcoming all comers with open arms and a smile, encouraging them to consider the love God has for them in Jesus, they chase them off, hurting many so that they are turned off of Christianity. Dread stuff.We will answer to God Himself for this, and the leadership will stand at the head of the line to give account.God is love and intends for us to share in that, and to share that love with others, encouraging them to share in Gods love themselves.While some may gainsay this most appropriate work, I whole-heartedly support and recommend it, and pray that Boyd will persevere in addressing other relevant and pressing issues for today's Christian.The greatest ommandment, love the Lord your God.., and the second is just as important, love your neighbour: on these hang ALL the Law and the prophets.Thanks, Greg."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"This book urges us to get back to basics: to enjoy God's outrageous love and be a conduit of it. Also, we need to stop being critical and judgmental, and show a needy world what God's unconditional love is like. Instead of living by legalism, rules, and human effort, we need to rest in the acceptance and grace Christ offers us, then share this with others.For the most part that is an important message and one which all of us need to be reminded of. But perhaps because Boyd seems to think that we are all so far from where we should be in this regard, he tends to resort to unnecessary polarisation and overstatement. His message thus at times comes across as unbalanced and skewed. The fullness of the biblical data seems to be lost and the whole counsel of God seems not to be presented.Of course Boyd is a leading proponent of what is known as free-will theism, which claims, for example, that God is not really sovereign, he does not know the future, etc.Boyd's emphasis on the love of God is heavily influenced by this particular theology. For example, he seeks to make love the primary attribute of God. But it may be more in accord with the entire biblical revelation to acknowledge that all of the attributes of God are primary - that is, all are to be seen as operating together.To single out one attribute of God and effectively ignore or downplay the others would seem to present a truncated picture of God. Yes, God is love. But God is also holy. God is also just, and so one.Given Boyd's view on the love of God, it comes as no surprise that he has little to say about the wrath of God. He certainly does not see it as an attribute of God. Indeed, he argues that love and judgment cannot co-exist.But, is this really the case? I can think of at least three very important counter-examples here. God seems quite capable of loving and judging simultaneously. Parents are called to do the same. And Christians are enjoined in Scripture to do just that as well.Boyd seems to set up a false antithesis or artificial tension here. It is not a case of either/or, but both/and. He seems to engage in unnecessary polarisation where Scripture does not.He does allow that \\"in exceptional conditions\\" there will be a place for \\"confrontation and questioning\\". I am glad he does makes this concession. But how does this square with the New Testament evidence? There we find numerous examples of Paul and others challenging people, confronting people, even rebuking people. Numerous passages enjoin us to make righteous judgement, to warn and rebuke, to chastise and to admonish.But Boyd thinks this should be done sparingly at best. But Scripture seems to say it should be done when needed. It seems to be a part of the normal Christian life. Of course such discipline and admonition must be done in love, with humility, and with the recognition that we are all fallen. But it is a regular part of church life. Jesus himself insisted upon this, as in Matthew 18.And what about the Old Testament prophets? They made prophetic denunciations against foreign nations which featured the same themes and language as they used against Israel. Boyd does mention Ezekiel's call to be a watchman, but says it only applies to Israel. Yet Ezekiel 25-32 are oracles against foreign nations.On occasion he will modify his remarks, offer a brief corrective, or throw in a qualifying comment. And his closing chapters seek to look at these issues in a bit more detail. But these qualifications seem few and far between, and one suspects that Boyd makes them grudgingly.And then there is the problem that Boyd seems to do the very thing that he rails against throughout this book. On a number of occasions Boyd makes judgments about the rest of the Christian church.While such judgements might be true they are nonetheless just that: judgments, the very thing Boyd thinks we should not be making. Indeed, he accuses believers who are not following his scheme of things of \\"spiritual pathology\\" and \\"religious idolatry\\". It seems that even Boyd cannot make his case without resorting to judgment. And that makes my case, I would argue. One can seek to build up the body, to be loving, while at the same time making judgments and pointing out shortcomings.I found this book to be somewhat frustrating. Its message is important. Yet I can't help feeling that for all that he says, he leaves much unsaid, and the end result is a somewhat skewed message. He could perhaps have written this book in a different fashion and still made much of his case.I for one will try to apply some of the truths contained in the book to my life. I know I need to be a lot more loving and a lot less judgmental. But I have enough reservations to be hesitant about passing this on to others without at least some qualifying remarks."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"An extremely well-argued case for love and judgment being the two dichotomous trees in Eden.

Of course we were the good and everyone else was the evil. As a child I felt that something was off, and as an adult, loving people that are on the margins of society, and seeing first hand how much they distrust Christians- this book is a like fresh water. I wish every person on earth would read this book, and especially people who profess to believe in Jesus Christ. In my opinion the way some people talk, they believe more in the power of evil then they do the power of good that comes through Jesus Christ. I thank God for Gregory Boyd writing a book that clarifies that love triumphs over EVERYTHING, and God is love so it is easy to agree. This is one of the first times I have ever heard someone confront the church for it's lack of love that I have witnessed over and over and they back it up with scripture. He is right, the reason the church is not thriving is not because of the evil's of the world, it is because of the evil within the church, the judgment and evil within our very hearts.

God however is allowed and the ONLY one that can judge.If you wonder about the verse where Paul tells church people to \\"kick out\\" people from the church who still sin, Boyd clearly addresses this and doesn't discredit the scripture at all.The supreme commands for us humans are to Love God and love your neighbors (all humans). All else is subordinate to those, or rather reflections of those commands. Judging others fits no where in there.This is a great book, kind of repetitive, but that I guess is necessary to beat it in our heads to stop being religous, judgemental, legalistic, and wake up to the love, life and freedom that Christ death on the cross offers us.I would have liked to see a few more modern day examples to cooralate this teaching with how we handle life.

I have been involved in ministry my entire adult life, and consider myself to be a student of the Word. But this book turned my thinking upside down, in a good way. I have been judging people--by MY standards instead of God's. This book helps you take a long look at how your thinking can gradually change to the point that you convince yourself that you aren't \\"as bad\\" other people in \\"certain\\" categories-that your sin isn't as serious as theirs, which then allows you to elevate yourself above others. It is about the lies that we begin to believe that the Enemy quietly plants in our minds. If you are a person like me, trying to always \\"do the right thing\\", if you are black or white in your thinking, or if you have been a Christian for a number of years and just need to take a fresh look at the gospel, this book will rock you!

I've come to believe it's all myth, legend and wishful thinking. That said, I'm leaving a lot of my old reviews of Christian non-fiction up because they are often very instructional, in the case of this book, super insightful into why I believe that Jesus as god is a myth.This book points out the hypocrisy in much of modern Christianity, certainty in American churches this book hits the nail on the head, we pick and choose who is \\"out\\" and which sins to ignore.It wasn't long ago that I was excommunicated and banished from my long time church (the Anaheim Vineyard, mother church of a reasonably large denomination), of the people that showed the most hatred of me, the majority of them are extremely obese and yet my sins were so bad in comparison to theirs, I was not only banished, when I complained they had me arrested for annoyance. Not joking, two months in jail (I was never formally charged, I guess there is some common sense with the district attorney's office).My point about their obesity is this: Boyd makes the point that the bible clearly teaches that gluttony is a really bad sin, yet modern Christians like to banish and condemn people like me, homosexuals and others that they don't like (depends upon the denomination), while ignoring their own disregard of scripture and their own sins.My former friends over eat to the extent that if they simply ate what they needed and sent the money they would save from not over indulging in food, they'd probably save a dozen Ugandans a year. Maybe more.And of course, my pointing out their overweight problem is highly rude and offensive, but I'm making a point, they have no problem abusing others for their sins, no problem banishing me from church while saying \\"Jesus loves mercy\\" out of the other side of their mouths.So, Boyd's point in this book is that those pastors have no problem hating me, yet doing worse sins themselves, it's the old get the plank out of your own eye.So what does that have to do with becoming an atheist? For me it came down not being able to reconcile what I heard people say and teach and how they acted. Now this isn't new, but I also started reading:The God DelusionandLosing My Religionfor example and decided that the evidence is way to in favor of atheism, or at least a form of agnosticism.All that said, if you are a Christian, you'd be a better one if you read this book, convinced your church to read it and actually did what it said. Good luck.End Edit.I've been through this book three times now and I'll have to read it again I'm sure. It is difficult to give the whole work justice in a review because without explaining in depth what the author is trying to get across it is easy to be misleading in what is really being said in the book.I'd like to first state that Boyd has become my favorite Christian author, I think that he finds a way to take complicated theological problems and reduce them down into parts that are easier for the non-master's degree lay person to understand. That isn't to say his words are simple, but just understandable in complex subjects.This basic idea of this book is that judging others is a sin and not only that, it's the original sin; eating from the Tree of Knowledge. This sin is so profoundly evil because it feeds our pride by making ourselves better than others, as if we had the knowledge God does when He rightly judges (from His position of omnipotence). Since we don't have the knowledge necessary to really know someone, to really know where they've walked, what they've been through, we don't know how we'd have behaved had we'd been subjected to the same life circumstances. That being the case, it's the height of arrogance and pride to place ourselves in a position of judging and condemning anyone. And as we do it, we commit a sin that in fact makes us just as deficient in coming to the Father and just as in need of the cross.The idea of unrelenting love and tenderness, the kind of love that God has for us, being given to \\"those people\\" or \\"that type of sinner\\" is just too much for a good percentage of the modern Christian church to even pretend to strive for; we certainly don't have it in us without going to the source. This forgiving merciful love is hard to come by, Boyd points out that for acceptance and fellowship many people go to bars, not churches, and that is backwards.As companion reads, I'd suggest \\"What's so Amazing about Grace\\" and \\"The Ragamuffin Gospel\\" they are much different books, but the idea of what grace is can be helpful in understanding how and why we are called to \\"repent\\" of the sin of \\"religion\\" (judging others) and I think the latter book explains so well how much God loves us, we are called to do the same to a broken world.It is with great irony that the reason I read this book is because the lead pastor of my former church asked the entire staff to read it, a few years later I was banned from that church and many of my former friends, people who claimed once to love me, refuse to even speak to me. The experience has only highlighted the importance of books like this that explain the Gospel in clear basic layman's English because for some reason the words of Jesus about grace, love, acceptance, and such are so easily discarded by the modern church which conducts itself often enough like a business and not at all like a family (which it's seemingly called to do).I am grateful for Boyd's strength in stating things that aren't easy for any of us to hear, convicting messages because they carry not condemnation, but a call to be more than we are. I'm learning to be grateful for my excommunication because it's taught me so much what it's like to be an outsider, a reject. I reread this book in part, to be honest, to strengthen my belief that I'd been wronged (Boyd points out that the only group of people that Christ publically \\"outs\\" are the professional religious leaders) but in the end I really just came back to myself. I judge. I hate. I condemn. I see the speck in my brother's eye and ignore the log in my own eye.Jesus, Son of the Living God, have mercy on me, a sinner."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"It is evident how the Holy Spirit has revealed to Gregory Boyd the awesome Love He has for His people. The message brings us to humbling ourselves before the Lord, to love as God loves, and the reason why we are here on this earth. We are to be vessels filled with the love of God, and bring others to Christ through His Love.I find that Gregory Boyds message is the Truth and the Truth shall set us free. The Body of Christ in these last days has to be in unity, and how is that accomplished? By laying our lives down for others just as Christ did. And we only can do this, not in our works or our own way but by being one with the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit John 17:21, 23, 26. To understand this book it must be read not with your head but by the leading of the Holy Spirit. It has opened my eyes to Who God is and what my purpose on this earth is, to see through His eyes, to walk in the Spirit and fulfill the lust of my flesh and to Love my God and my neighbors as myself.

Satan told Eve she would be &#34;like God&#34; possessing the ability to know Good & Evil which was a lie. While partaking of the fruit launched mankind's judging and blaming (Eve blamed the serpent, Adam blamed Eve), neither Adam nor Eve (nor any of the rest of us) has the perfect knowledge that God possesses, so our judgments are always flawed. Judging others does make us feel better (more righteous), however it prevents us from loving others as Jesus did. The book also promotes a deeper understanding who we are as sons and daughters of God. It explains how the realization of the depth of God's love for us, frees us to follow in Jesus' steps and to love others and our selves as God does."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"It seems to me that Gregory Boyd would need to argue his case as if to convince the Apostle Paul of his thesis, or at least deal with 1 Corinthians 5 in detail, maybe even a whole chapter on just this chapter in the New Testament, before he could expect evangelicals to be convinced. In 1 Corinthians 5, Paul says things like, \\"Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this (the particular sexual sin), just as if I were present.\\" The action and attitude of Paul seems to contradict the approach Dr. Boyd is trying to communicate with sin and sinners in the church. He needs to spend time explaining and arguing in same way how Paul's approach fits in with his thesis. The Apostle also writes further, \\"What business is it of mine to judge (krinein)those outside the church? ARE YOU NOT TO JUDGE (KRINETE)THOSE INSIDE THE CHURCH?\\" While Dr. Boyd mentions this passage he doesn't deal with it in the way he needs to in order to demonstrate to everyone that what he is saying is truly compatible with what the Apostle Paul is saying, because what he is saying and what Paul is saying seem to contradict each other in many ways. For example, Dr. Boyd says that the only setting for any kind of correction would be perhaps in a small group where a relationship of trust has been built between the person correcting and the person in need of correction. But how does the Apostle Paul's correction in 1 Corinthians 5 come anywhere close to that? Paul is writing from outside the church, addressing a situation and speaking of a person to whom he doesn't know (as best we can tell). But if that is so, the Apostle is already violating a guideline Dr. Boyd sets down in his thesis. But the Apostle seems to be violating all kinds of the guidelines Dr. Boyd lays down in the book. Another example, Paul judges the man and doesn't seem to take into consideration the man's background, experiences, and reasons why he may be involved in such a sin -- another violation of one of Dr. Boyd's principles in his thesis. And on and on it goes. My point is that the book \\"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God\\" isn't convincing enough in its argumentation from the New Testament. It's as if the author wrote it off the top of his head with no feedback from any other scholars before going to print and without the benefit of knowing that he'd have to argue his case more forcefully. Perhaps in the next edition, Dr. Boyd can grapple with the attitude of the Apostle Paul in the New Testament more, because as I see it, if he can demonstrate that Paul is really saying what he is saying, he's won his case."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"To be honest, I truly wanted this book to be true. It speaks many truths, but not the WHOLE TRUTH.How can judged sinners experience God's love in hell?How can wrath be dispensed 'lovingly'?The Bible most Christians are familiar with strongly disagrees with the author's well-intentioned advice and manmade doctrines.The Old Testament closes with a stern warning in love for those who would be turned to repent of sin (not so much repenting of religion, although religious sin is especially damning) - see Malachi for yourself.The New Testament closes with the Book of Revelation, which perhaps the author is unfamiliar with. In love it is asked that he and those who find this book having some verisimilitude to investigate how God not only feels about sin, but beast followers who refuse to repent. Love and Wrath need to be equally addressed, but once Love runs out, Wrath kicks in (about which there is nothing loving or compassionate as this book seems to understand the concept.)Actually as the greatest act of love next to sacrificing Himself on the Cross for sin, Jesus warned His audience - and us too - more of Hell's heat than of Heaven's light. Read the Gospels for yourself as to what Jesus' emphasis was - not just to the religious, but the irreligious.A new book is needed as companion to this volume: Repenting of Incomplete Christianity: Fairly Balancing the Wrath of God and the Warmth of God toward humanity."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"Classic case of a guy who picks a few verses to make a point, while completely ignoring huge sections of scripture. The assumption that judgment and love are in polar opposition to one another is foolish at best, deceptive at worst. God loves unconditionally, and at the same time judges righteously. Paul instructed the Corinthian church to pass judgment on a fellow believer, out of love for him. The author also says we should never make conclusions based on good and evil, and that to do so is repeating the sin of Adam & Eve - apparently forgetting the fact that the Bible is filled with instructions regarding good and evil!he says we should never judge others and that to do so indicates hypocrisy and a lack of love - his book, however, is filled with judgments cast at believers and churches based on the author's assumptions about their motives. He assumes that any a believer (other than him) evaluates another person's behavior we are obviously trying to cover up some sin in our own lives. I think Paul, Moses, Nathan, Elijah, Jesus, and pretty much all of the prophets who spent significant chunks of time confronting others about their sin, would disagree. Maybe - just maybe - sometimes we confront sin not to try to elevate ourselves - but out of genuine love and concern for another person's spiritual well-being. Maybe sometimes we confront sin not out of hypocrisy but out of a love for and commitment to truth and holiness as revealed in God's Word.On top of all this he bases most of his theology on his own fanciful interpretation of what the tree of the knowledge of good and evil represents. The original sin, he says, was judgment. I'm not sure who he thinks Adam and Eve were judging when they ate the fruit, but it seems to me the original sin was disobedience to a simple command. Call me crazy.This book is highly misleading and inexcusably unbalanced. It does not represent Scripture or the character of God. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"What could have been a solid admonition of the church to practice more love and less judgmentalism comes off too harsh, unlovingly intolerant and ironically judgmental itself.First, there is hyper-interpretation of the meaning of the Tree of Knowledge of Good & Evil that is the basis for the argument. Gen.2-3 state both Tree of Life and Tree of Knowledge were in the \\"Midst\\"=Center of the garden. This incidental reference to tree location is extrapolated as Central Thesis into what can only be called Theologorrhea: an allegorical interpretive fabrication whereby this bad tree assumes CENTRAL PLACE as an idol-a-tree in our life. Every time we judge something/one to be either good or evil, right or wrong, we are reverting back to playing the judge with this bad tree at Center-hub of our idolatrous world. Where does the author get these peculiar notions? Not from anywhere else in the Old or New Testament. He might have a case if Scripture weren't so silent on his idol-a-tree-at-center-stage thesis.Next, he unabashedly advocates same-gender relations being Good-not-Evil as long as monogamous/covenantal by his own standards. He blasts the conservative evangelical church for not treating this issue with the moral equivalency of being overweight. If grace extends to this non-morality issue, it ought to include the morality issue as well. Again, peculiar, non-scriptural notions. Back to the Garden, God did not create Adam & Steve, but Adam & Eve. Paul clearly says in 1Cor.7:2 - \\"since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.\\" Paul also is adamant in 1Cor.5:11-13 - \\"you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is grossly immoral or greedy or idolator or slanderer, drunkard, swindler. With such a one do not even eat. What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside the church? God will judge those outside. Expel the wicked one from among you.\\" (See also 2Pet.2, Jude 7). This seems to bounce right off the author's selective-bible-quoting defense shield.Third, by blasting all conservative evangelicals, he stands outside and removed from this faith-group which demonstrates several things. He himself, by not using 'we' shows himself as liberal non-evangelical. He himself, by judging what is being done as evil,not good; wrong, not right, ironically falls into the trap of eating from his own imagined idol-tree of knowledge. He ends up being a Pathological Judger of those very believers who he labels as judgers parasitically drawing life and feeding from the idol-tree at the expense of others.Finally, all credibility, if not lost already, fades like the smile on the Cheshire Cat in Wonderland with his ongoing condemnation of all who do not love to the level of his thesis' expectation. It's like, \\"You in the church should love this way and not judge that way or you are not Good, but Evil. Repent of the idol-a-tree of Knowledge and only Love, Love, Love.\\" But by going after this log in the eye of fundamental conservative evangelicals (from whom he disdainfully distances himself, which is its own act of judgmentalism), he doesn't see or tend to the telephone pole in his own eye. He as accuser can judge as long as its done in love by his standards, but the church can't without being hypocritical, parasitic, pathologic, loveless.This line of peculiar reasoning is to be expected, perhaps, from one who argues by citing Bonhoeffer, Kreeft, Ellul (\\"Jesus' revelation is against morality..it is impossible to derive a moral system from the Gospels&Epistles..the; proclamation of grace,pardon,freedom are the direct opposite of morality..the origin of sin is not knowledge, but knowledge of Good & Evil..Jesus gives us His Own commandment 'Follow Me', not a list of do's and don'ts.. to be a free person with no morality but simply observing the ever-new word of God as it flashes forth..we are as free as the Holy Spirit who comes and goes as he wills..This freedom is love.\\") ten times more than the Bible itself which contains all the correctives the church needs to Love as Jesus loved and \\"Stop judging by outward appearances, but make right judgments.\\""},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"Tragically misconceived. As if the angry author is venting against perceived mistreatment at the hands of the evangelical church. To suggest Christians 'replicate' God on earth by somehow mystically participating in the Trinitarian Divine Dance is turning from Biblical accuracy to sloppy, sentimental parachristianity - on the fringe, outside, beyond what Scripture plainly teaches. If only the judgmental author could see the speck in his own eye when he attempts eye-surgery on the broader evangelical community he attacks! He should repent of his own 'righteouser-than-thou' religious attitude of self-appointed fruit inspector of imperfect churches that need Jesus' message of Revelation's 7 Letters, not this claptrap."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"One star for the good point of urging Christians to avoid Judgmentalism. Toward self or others, believers or not. Amen.Much of the rest of the book is a disquisition on SOME aspects of the Character of God to the omission of HOLY HOLY HOLY.Jonah is quoted from where God spares the Ninevites by sheer mercy. Overlooks Nahum a little later in history where grace period runs out and God's HOLY WRATH executes Divine Judgment on Nineveh which earlier had been spared.John 3:16 is majored on which is fine. But where is John 3:18?? whoever believes in Jesus is not condemned, but whoever does not believe STANDS CONDEMNED ALREADY because of unbelief in Jesus' Name.Discerning Christian readers taking warning against judgmentalism to heart need also to take warning against overemphasis of ONLY ONE SIDE of the issue.God's HOLY HOLY HOLY Character needs equal emphasis.Reading this book gave the impression of God SOLELY as Lover, Relater,Friend-of-Sinners, Welcomer-to-Heaven, Parent, Compadre, Embracer, Forgiver, etc. and that's fine to a degree for one side of the Scriptural Coin. But the Bible is more than the book of Jonah or John 3:16. What about God as Judge, Condemner, Banisher-to-Hell, Sentencer, Enemy-of-Sin, Confronter, Sovereign Destroyer of Evil, Wrathbearer, Holy Hater of Lawbreaking?This book is rejected as not doing justice to Scripture IN TOTO.

Will he love his children in the same way as he wants us to love others? Would he let his children walk in the path of an oncomming car, because out of love, he does not want to tell them the truth? The truth is Mr. Boyd that God loves the sinner, but hates sin. Ask Jesus to forgive you and come into your heart and you will be saved. He shows us the truth in Hisword. Get back to God's word."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"My inspiration for reviewing this book came not so much from its impact on my own life - though that was significant - but from the negative reviews which only serve to reinforce Boyd's thesis.One reviewer writes:\\"Too lopsided on one aspect of God's character ... Does not balance personal skew with God's holy wrath against sin.\\"These words exemplify the essence of Boyd's concern, as stated in the chapter titled 'The Center is Love:'\\"Even as I write these words, I can hear someone saying, 'Yes, we must love. But we must balance love with truth. ... Love has its place, but we must not forget God's wrath.' ... We have to wonder where anyone got the idea that love in any way competes with truth, holiness or biblical doctrine. Love is the central biblical truth; it is the essence of all holiness.\\" (p. 57-58)Boyd in no way infers or states that we should gloss over sin in our own lives and the lives of others, but in discerning evil, or sin, we should be motivated by the love of Christ that lives within us, not our need to draw worth from our power to judge others, a desire rooted in our fallen, or 'old man.'As Boyd so clearly states, our focus on hatred of sin is often rooted in our desire to play God, by deeming who is worthy of love and who is not, based on their love-ability. This, simply stated, is heretical to the very nature of the God, who IS love, and portrays a skewed image of Abba Father that believes the divine's hatred for sin, not his lovingkindness, sent him to the cross.All the writers of the New Testament clearly state that all we do should be done in love, and even our acts of apparent harshness, discipline and discernment need be motivated by what is best for the others involved, not a sense of righteousness. Boyd captures this sentiment wonderfully and saturates this thesis with countless scriptures and a theology that, while unsettling to our paradigms, is sound to those who have tasted of the grace of God.The further accusation of antinomianism is baseless, and, as is so often the case with those who are quick to toss about this term, indicates a failure to understand its actual meaning. Antinomianism is the belief that God's grace, as evidenced through the cross, eradicated the law by destroying the reality of wrong and right, good and evil, and this belief is a a lie; it IS heresy. Boyd's thesis far from antinomian. Like the Apostle Paul, he is simply stating that its power to either condemn us when we fail to fulfill its demands or its ability to ascribe to us worth when we fulfill is demands IS DEAD.While we still seek to discern sin and the lies that bind us, the law and its power died to us at the cross, and the only thing that matters now - the only law that binds us, is the law of liberty, or as Paul states, faith expressing itself through love.This IS the gospel. We no longer view God, ourselves or the world through the grid of the law, but through God's love, and God's love is selfless and always seeks the best for the other, and so, as Boyd states, we must discern those things that harm us - the lies we believe and the sins that bind us - but never to establish our goodness before God, as our goodness is found only in the person of God through Christ.I believe Boyd expresses well the truth that love need not be balanced with truth, as if his lovingkindness, grace and tenderheartedness and his truth, holiness and majesty are opposites, but these are all many expressions of the essence of God who is love. Boyd quotes philosophy professor Peter Kreeft to drive this point home:\\"God is not half love and half wrath, or 99 percent love and 1 percent wrath. God IS love. Wrath is how his love appears to us when we sin or rebel or run away from him. The very light that is meant to help us, appears to us as our enemy when we seek the darkness (p. 59).\\"Boyd further states: \\"All the attributes of God are to be defined by Christ. In the crucified Messiah we see God's just and holy wrath against sin, but we see it as a manifestation of God's love. ... Everything that God does, even his expressions of holy wrath, are done out of love (p. 59-60).And at the risk of overquotation, let Boyd's word best summarize the heart of this writing: \\"Hence, as those who are called to live in such a way that people can know God by knowing us, we are called to love. We are only balanced in our understanding of love when we understand that it is the one thing we must live in - to all people, at all times, in all situations, without exception. If we do this, everything else we need to do will get done. If we don't do this, there's simply nothing else worth doing (p. 60).\\"While one may not agree with all the practical applications of Boyd's thesis, the doctrinal and spiritual soundness is unquestionable in light of the apostles' writings and the living expression of God's love as found in the life of Christ."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"Please do yourself a favor and disregard the majority of the negative reviews of this astonishing book.These only confirm the main premise of Mr Boyd's argument:a large number of American Christians have been mainlining juice from the fruit of the wrong tree for years now.Thus, they have lamentably and tragically and ironically allowed themselves to become a 'community of accusers,'whose perverse aim is the 'moralizing of life,' which is the total antithesis of what Jesus initiated!With this book as well as a previous one (The Myth of a Christian Nation),Mr Boyd is prophetically addressing serious flaws and downright sins in present-day churches.He makes the most compelling and scripturally persuasive case as towhat has turned so much of Christianity into an aggressive and cold-hearted pathogen amidst a culture thatdesperately needs Christ-like lovers--whose love is as reckless, extravagant and promiscuous as that of Jesus.I could refute many of the false arguments and objections raised below by quoting from the book.Instead I say: buy it and read it; this is a well-balanced argument and thoroughly faithful to the Spirit of the Word.It will answer much that has baffled you and confirm what you have known was not right in many a congregation.But I will address one legitimate observation:the seeming contradiction of a book that forbids judgement judging the judgmental attitude of others.Here's a quote from the book that I believe settles this issue:\\"Jesus' religious reputation was tarnished in the eyes of religious peoplebecause he did not honor many of the religious taboos of his days.Walking in unity with God, Jesus possessed a joyful freedom--indeed, a recklessness--that was scandalous to those whose worth was derived from their supposed ability to judge good and eviland their willingness to separate themselves as good apart from those they judged as evil...\\"But Jesus wasn't concerned about his reputation.He did what he was called to do and let others matters at the hands of his Father.Jesus came to heal the sick, not to placate the religious sensibilities of those who thought they were healthy.To heal the sick, you have to love the sick, which means you have to fellowship with the sick.And this means you have to ignore what those who (mistakenly) think they are healthy, think about you!\\"... Far from tiptoeing around them,Jesus sometimes seemed to go out of his way to confront religious leaders who lived from a variety of forbidden fruit.While he demonstrated only compassion toward ordinary folk,and especially toward those ostracized and/or judged by the religious establishment,Jesus publicly expressed anger toward self-righteous religious leaders--the Pharisees, scribes, and Sadducees.Though these people were 'the most moral of people, lived the best of lives,and were perfectly obedient and virtuous, they substituted their own morality for the living and actual Word of God [Jacques Ellul].'They were experts on eating from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.\\"Jesus aggressively intended to stop these leaders because they shut the door of God's gracious kingdom on people,placed heavy loads on people's shoulders, and lured people down their own path of destruction.With their highly refined moralism, they incarnated the serpent's lie about how to be God-like.Consequently, Jesus had to publicly confront these religious forbidden-fruit eaters...\\"It is important to notice that RELIGIOUS SIN IS THE ONLY SIN JESUS PUBLICLY CONFRONTED.The religious variety of the forbidden fruit is the most addictive and deceptive variety.Instead of acknowledging that the knowledge of good and evil is prohibited,religious idolatry embraces the knowledge of good and evil as divinely sanctioned and mandated.It gives the illusion of being on God's side even while it destroys life and hardens people in direct opposition to God.\\"Religious sin is the most destructive kind of sickness....\\"Amen!"},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"I am still mulling through my own actions after reading this book.I was a fan of \\"Letters From a Skeptic,\\" and was pleasantly amazed to find this title and see how Boyd beautifully expounds on Bonhoeffer as well as the Scriptures in God's mandate to humanity to fulfill the Greatest Commandment, to love God and neighbor. There has been much debate on what this looks like, and Boyd paints a narrative from beginning to end, walking through the Scriptures and paying attention to what Jesus' way of life could look like today.If the church of Jesus could grasp one iota of this argument, it would be better for it, something I believe this book is trying to accomplish.There will be those in conservative evangelical circles (I include myself there, although I am moving further away) who will be upset by the reading of this book, which Boyd suspected as outlined in chapter 11. Boyd is not soft on sin, but he is hard on judgment.If you were to ask a question of anyone here about what the #1 thing Christians are known for, would they say love? I would wholeheartedly think they wouldn't (a Barna survey in August 2004 said that 91% said \\"hates gays.\\"). Boyd presents a clearly detailed, biblical philosophy, with heavy influence from Bonhoeffer, about how we are to love others as Jesus loved with holiness, accountability, and the integrity of the Scriptures not being compromised. He outlines in detail how most of us in the modern American church are not familiar with first-century church context and how they confronted each other on sin issues.Chapters 11 and 12 are worth the price of the book alone, but every chapter of this book is priceless. This is a book that every pastor and Christian leader should have close by. It is a detailed outline through the Scriptures on how God has wired us to love without conditions through Jesus Christ. Even if you disagree, pick it up and read it yourself, it is a must read."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"Controversial pastor/theologian Gregory A. Boyd known for his strong and honest opinions in theology reveals his true pastoral heart for a non-judgmental vision of the Church. With the passion of an evangelist and the conviction of a prophet Boyd claims that \\"the Christian religion has to a significant extent become the defender of and promoter of the Fall rather than the proclaimer of the Good News that alone can free us from the Fall.\\" This is because the Church eats from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil and therefore stands in God's place of judging rather than loving others. Boyd offers some very keen incites from Jonathan Edward's Triune Creationism, Dietrich Bonhoeffer's theology of the fall, and about the nature of the human heart's longing for self-righteousness.However, at times Boyd falls on his sword by unashamedly making the same kind of judgments of Christians he seeks to condemn them for; probably born out of response to his legion of critics. He becomes very ambiguous at times when trying to distinguish loving intervention with judging others, which leaves him more or less against the practice of Church Discipline. He also blurs a distinction between the sin of gluttony and being overweight, and then awkwardly tries to contrast them with homosexuality.Nevertheless, Boyd makes his case for a clarion call for believers to repent from judgmentalism and practice love and mercy towards not only other believers, but sinners as Jesus would."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"I love the title of this book. It provoked my imagination right away.Though the early chapters of Boyd's book were a bit too academic in tone for me, I knew it was foundational in laying out his argument for the supremacy of God's love. Boyd is actually not being a renegade radical in this regard. There have always been amongst us those who would remind us that God is love (from Mike Bickle to Bernard of Clairvaux and quite a few in between). I have no disagreement with this message at all. As for those readers who think this message is a distortion of God's character, well, Jesus got in trouble all the time because of how loving he was to the wrong kind of people.If you are looking for a book to gain greater insight into the loving nature of God this is a good one to add to your library.As for Boyd's argument that gluttons are welcome in church, but homosexuals are not, I think he's simply telling it like it is. I think Boyd's message was clear : we've let judgementalism (religion) stifle our identity to be lovers of God and lovers of one another."},{"Title":"Repenting of Religion: Turning from Judgment to the Love of God","review":"Even if one does not fully agree with Dr. Boyd's full premise, this book will certainly make one stop and think.

Theological beliefs made no noticable difference from me and my family's point of view. Now, over three years after my scandal, Christians are finally starting to differentiate themselves with demonstrated love. Though they may not use Boyd's language, they certainly apply these principles and it is healing to me. These are the principles Gayle and my children used when deciding how to respond to my failures, and as a result, my family is whole. Neither hateful judgmentalism nor endless suggestions about how to be a better person from unloving Christians were helpful to me or my family. Instead, those who were kind, whether they did it because of their theology or just human kindness, helped us the most. I thank God for this book. It gave me language and insight regarding my experience and observations over the last three years. My hope is that it will instruct all of us to use our faith as a springboard of life, love and healing instead of judgment, hate, and heartbreak.

It is clear that he wants people to understand the message, because he goes up many different sides of the mountain (so to speak) to reach his conclusions.

The alphabet is taught in its natural context - Jewish worship and beliefs, a few letters at a time and with plenty of background material to cement the letters and sounds into the student's mind. Writing is taught along with the letters.Directed specifically those who want to learn Hebrew in worship, this work is invaluable to anyone - Christian or Jewish - who wants to study the Bible in its original text.The second book is due to come out in 2001 - Watch for it!"},{"Title":"Aleph Isn't Tough: An Introduction to Hebrew for Adults","review":"I found this book to be very clear, with useful exercises in reading and writing Hebrew. The letters are not taught in alphabetic order, but rather in logical groupings that are often used together in words. The vowels are added one or two at a time, and though I felt challenged, I was not overwhelmed. I found it fun, and even reading right to left seemed natural as I became familiar with how the consonants and vowels related to each other.Besides teaching the sounds of the letters, there are sections on Hebrew word roots, which I found immensely helpful in understanding some of the thinking and spirit in the language. I felt as if I'd been given a key into a whole new way of thinking. For example, there are names of G-d that relate to certain root words in ways that are surprising and wonderful, and there are foods we eat on High Holidays because they are a &quot;pun&quot; on another word that is a spiritual quality we ask for in the new year. The extra dimension this book adds beyond mere pronunciation is its real gift.I recommend this book to adults with an interest in exploring Hebrew. After just a month, I was able to read (slowly) from the prayer book, and find myself asking questions that I would not have thought of had I only known the English translation."},{"Title":"Aleph Isn't Tough: An Introduction to Hebrew for Adults","review":"I liked this primer much better than 'Learn Hebrew Tody, Alef-Bet for Adults'. It offered better exercises, clearer pronunciation guides and more in-depth grammatical explanations. An excellent first choice for the adult beginner."},{"Title":"Aleph Isn't Tough: An Introduction to Hebrew for Adults","review":"This is a pretty good book for an introductory Hebrew class. It provides a mixture of basic Hebrew and siddur Hebrew, introducing many word roots used in the prayer book. This satisfies the requirements of the average Hebraically functionally illiterate American Jew who has only a marginal interest in actually mastering Hebrew, but would like to be able to pronounce and \\"follow along\\" during Sabbath prayer services. Definitely not the only book one would need to know Hebrew. No grammar or linguistic niceties, simply a book to help you have some ability to know where you are in the prayer book. I am not sure I would recommend this as a beginning book for someone who is serious about learning Hebrew. It is more of a thing unto itself, not necessarily providing a grounding for further study."},{"Title":"Aleph Isn't Tough: An Introduction to Hebrew for Adults","review":"If like me you are wanting to teach yourself Hebrew this book is an excellent resource for doing so. As one other reviewer rightly commented it breaks the Hebrew alphabet down into smaller portions and thus makes it easier to memorize. Another plus is that writing of the letters is taught along with their pronunciation. One of the best things was the help in pronouncing the letters correctly. The information on roots made the learning of Biblical Hebrew a much less daunting prospect for me. Of all the Hebrew teaching tools I've come across so far, this one is my favorite."},{"Title":"Aleph Isn't Tough: An Introduction to Hebrew for Adults","review":"I attended Hebrew school 3 times a week for 6 years until my Bar Mitzvah in 1966). When I quit, I could read Hebrew but understood little or nothing about what I was reading and do not recall any lessons in the structure of the language or its syntax. When we joined a synagogue a couple of years ago, I could still sort of read a little, but had forgotten a few letters which made my ability to read pretty much useless. But I digress.Aleph Isn't Tough goes through the entire Hebrew alephbet, teaches pronunciation of all the characters, demonstrates many word roots and their modifications that form related words (all with translations, of course), teaches the distinction between a main character and its altered form when used at the end of a word (e.g., mem vs. mem sofit or final mem) and teaches all the vowel sounds. And also teaches a number of exceptions to pronunciation and spelling that I am quite certain I never learned in those 6 years spent all those decades ago. This is a lot for a beginner book, but that is unquestionably what this is.As the title of the review indicates, this book (first in a series of at least 3 that I know of) is NOT intended to teach modern conversational Hebrew. Rather, it provides an introduction to reading the Hebrew of the Torah and that of the doxology found in all modern siddurs (Prayerbooks). This first volume uses as its basis the Shabbat service. The words that one learns and the sentence fragments and sentences are all part of the Shabbat service. So the book does double duty as an introduction to the Hebrew language as well as an introduction to many of the most important phrases of the Shabbat prayers.I believe this book (which is definitely more appropriate for adults rather than children because of its style and pacing) would be sufficient to take someone from not reading Hebrew at all to being able to follow along with the Shabbbat service. In my case, just a few hours with the book was enough to get my Hebrew reading to a level at least as good as I ever achieved as a young student, with the added benefit of a rudimentary understanding of the structure of word formation and the rules of pronunciation. At the very least, I am able to go over my son's Hebrew School homework and correct his spelling and reading. It will be interesting to see how long it takes him to surpass me. At which point I suppose I will pick up Volume 2, \\"Aleph Isn't Enough\\".J.M.

Well, the author does make an attempt, with lessons and exercises, but honestly, I either just can't learn a different alphabet, or my \\"phobia of having to speak a foreign language\\" was kicking in.I bought \\"Aleph Isn't Tough\\" to use as a \\"self-learning\\" text to practice with a friend. My friend went on to take genuine lessons, but I stuck with the book, only to find it just plain difficult.I recommend this book, however, for adults who have had an introduction to the \\"aleph-bet\\" at some point in their lives, most likely when they were young.The book's target audience is the adult reader, but I must confess that I probably am \\"too adult\\" to not be intimidated!All in all, I believe this book to be a fine introduction to the Hebrew aleph-bet, and basic writing skills and reading. BUT...if you are terrified of the language, you may have a bit of a problem. Perhaps more practice would've helped me.In Judaism, it is not \\"proper\\" for a person to study (learn) alone.

Unfortunately, his twin sister, who doesn't yet ride a 2-wheeler, also loves it. So for her 7th birthday we bought a 2nd one. They are a neighborhood favorite! Our friends just got one for their son, and had to buy a 2nd for their daughter! So be sure you only want one when you order.

All around a great product!"},{"Title":"Promise and Fulfilment: Palestine 1917-1949","review":"This is where my knowledge of the modern history of the region all started. I was in college when I read this book, and I believe that prior to this, I had never heard the word \\"Zionist\\" in my life. But I had heard of Arthur Koestler, the author of \\"Darkness at Noon\\" and \\"The Sleepwalkers.\\"And I knew that Israel was a country that had fought against Egypt in 1956. And that Israel used ladies as fighters in its army! And I knew one more thing. That when war broke out in 1956, and a British captain in the Mediterranean was told that Britain was at war, he said something like, \\"Fine. What side are we on?\\"Still, when I read this book, I was floored to discover how badly the British had betrayed the Jews of the Levant. I'd imagined the Levant as being almost empty, except for a few Arabs, until the end of World War Two. I simply assumed that Jews hadn't been there since the second century.The chapter on \\"The Little Death Ships\\" was a big shock to me. There was no doubting the truth of it: I checked other sources and it was pretty much all confirmed. I'd spent several months in England, and nobody had told me any of this. Nor had I known anything about the War of Independence that Koestler describes so well.But there was one magical moment when the British, having been so complicit in the murder of millions of Jews during World War Two, could have done something easy and intelligent to partly redeem themselves, in July, 1945, when the Labour Government took power. A major Labour Government campaign promise was to give the entire Mandate to the Jews, making it into a Jewish state. Suppose that government, once taking power, had started to do that, but suddenly compromised, and given some of the land to the Arabs? Koestler points out that \\"the moderate Arab leaders would have regarded this as a gift from heaven,\\" and would have been \\"convinced that they had successfully diddled a British Government which had promised the whole\\" of the Mandate to the Jews. That was the best opportunity for peace in the region in the twentieth century.Instead, of course, the British came up with completely irrational vindictive, and predictably disastrous policies. They were not willing to let the Jews have any rights. But they were not willing to do what the Nazis had just done in Europe, and exterminate the Jews (something just a few British divisions could have accomplished militarily with ease, although there might have been some political ramifications). So the British wound up in a fight with the Jews that they could not win.Koestler says that Bevin's viciously anti-Jewish policies created Israel. I disagree. I think the 1939 White Paper was what did it. Although that act helped kill off many of the Jews who would have been citizens of the new Hebrew state, it was what convinced almost all Jews that a state of Israel was a necessity, both for practical and moral reasons.I thought it was interesting that the British appeared eager to find excuses to betray the Zionists, and how \\"they wanted to be bullied and blackmailed out of their commitments to the Jews.\\"One other thing made me stop to think for a while. Koestler was shown photographs of \\"grinning men in Arab uniform posing for the photographer with their bayonets plunged into stacked heaps of naked mutilated corpses.\\" And he says it turns out that from the early days of Arab violence against Jews in the region, Jewish corpses were generally mutilated. If that's true, that is just one more behavior modification that is going to be necessary for there to be peace."},{"Title":"Promise and Fulfilment: Palestine 1917-1949","review":"Koestler, a leading intellectual in the middle of the last century, turns his famously skeptical and unbiased eye on the 30 years that preceded the founding of the State of Israel. Based on copious research, personal experience, and clear thinking, his analysis reveals how the situation that exists today in the Middle East reflects the factors that shaped developments almost a century ago, beginning with the Balfour Declaration. This document legitimized Zionist aspirations, and its later abrogation was a key factor in the turn from peaceful colonization to violent confrontation that persists to the present."},{"Title":"Dope on a Rope - Oddments from the Mind of Kim Underwood","review":"I'm lucky, see, because I live in the same town as Kim Underwood and get to read his Sunday newspaper column.Why do people like Kim's writing? It's joyous. He is joyous. Compassion seems all out of fashion nowadays, and cynicism has boldly taken its place. Thankfully, we still have a few books out there to bring our attention to ubiquitous things. To celebrate the mundane. To contemplate the everyday matters of life.Dope on a Rope is a very guy-next-door take on life. He a well-versed snacker. His dog Buster (aka &quot;his dogness&quot;) figures prominently in his life. And I'm pretty sure that he makes up at least one new word each week. Many of his essays read like short homilies on the state of his life. This makes perfect sense, being as he probably picked up a few techniques from his father, the minister.Everyone who wants to be a better neighbor needs to read Dope on a Rope. Good neighbors pay attention to one another and the life around them. Makes you wish Kim would buy the house next door."},{"Title":"Dope on a Rope - Oddments from the Mind of Kim Underwood","review":"I grew up in New York reading almost daily columnists like Buchwald, Hamill, and Wilson Sr. I remember the \\"Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight as a novel and not a former class of the St. John's basketball team. So when DOPE ON A ROPE arrived, I felt comfortable reading a compilation of what I expected to be small town columns written for the Winston Salem Journal's by Kim Underwood.Talk about New York stereotyping, I found a warm, often humorous but sometimes serious look at life that could been written anywhere in this country. Don't worry Mr. Underwood, I will not tell the world about your mauve (not purple) shirt or what dope jumps from a hot air balloon attached to a bungee rope even if a Playmate is accompanying them. This compilation is fun, well written while readers gain insight into the \\"oddments from the mind\\" of a writer who makes his personal look at life a lot more interesting than canned asparagus (think what those shoots look like) or is it spinach? DOPE ON A ROPE is plain ole fun.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 Unleashed","review":"Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 Unleashed promised to be the book I was looking for, especially when it had the 2.2 version number in the working title back in the Fall of '99. Debian was undergoing some radical transformations (X, FHS, etc.) and I wanted to know what was going on. As the Debian Team continually pushed the release of 2.2 back, I assume the publisher (determined to include a CD-ROM) eventually decided to just make it &quot;2.1&quot; and call it a day.Fortunately, this book deals with Debian in such a marginal manner that the version number doesn't matter a hill of beans. This is the typical 1000+ page Linux book plus the word &quot;Debian&quot; on the cover. Chapter after chapter introduces UNIX, X, editors (WordPerfect?! hardly appropriate...), servers, a host of programming languages, and all of the bizarre UNIX commands we know and love, but Debian specific information about these tools is scattershot at best.This wouldn't be so bad if, after going over a standard UNIX topic, the authors took time to explain how and why Debian implements that topic the way it does. In most situations they don't. Most of this text could've been ripped straight from the &quot;Using Slackware Linux&quot; book I bought in 1995.A classic example is the woefully inadequate chapter on email. Debian installs Exim as its standard MTA. But &quot;DG/L2.1U&quot; contains 11 pages on sendmail and 8 pages on listar (listar?!). There is one mention of Exim in the book that basically says, Debian will install Exim as your default MTA. I guess it's up to you to figure out how to configure it.&quot;DG/L2.1U&quot; devotes about 95 of its 1000+ pages to Debian topics, including dpkg, make-kpkg, the Debian bug tracking system, installing Debian, and the Debian Free Software Guidelines. But that's it. Really.If you know very little about Linux or UNIX and you want to install Debian, you might want to buy this book. Or you might want to buy any other, it won't matter."},{"Title":"Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 Unleashed","review":"After receiving this book I spent about 3 hours examing most of his aspects. I have to confess that for me this book wasn't new at all having seen it before in a bookstore (and having had another half an hour to &quot;test&quot; it). My first impression was &quot;it's too big&quot; so I preferred to buy &quot;Learning Debian GNU/Linux&quot; by O'Reilly (which you can find, of course, in Amazon :-). Then, beeing a kind of Unix/Linux books collector, I've changed first idea and convinced myself to buy also this one. IMHO, I think this book is great (not only in dimensions !) if: 1) you are not a Linux novice and 2) you like to have a kind of &quot;Linux compendium&quot;, I mean a book speaking of arguments from shell to Java programming, from Debian packages (some) to Samba and so on. A kind of &quot;all-in-one&quot;, but of course with all these arguments a Linux (also a Debian GNU/Linux) encyclopedia should be at least made by 6 volumes like this. If you are a novice I suggest the other one I've mentioned before. If, like me, you are interested (I mean you have deep interests) in Debian Linux, window managers and some programming language (like Perl), you'll buy at least other 3 books (one for each subject), the official Debian distribution, and you'll like to give a donation to Debian group.

I thought it was an execllent introduction for a new user - one book can't be all things to all people. But the installation guide was great for someone who has never touched a Linux install before. I'll agree with one of the above reviewers... it could stand to be a little more in-depth with core Linux daemons like apache and sendmail. I did think the section on Samba was outstanding, but was a little confused when it came the entire section on networking and BIND. A little less on programming with TCL and Python, and a little more on the common tasks the administrator takes on every day.Still, I think it's a great primer, and it was certainly enough that I got a box up and running without too much of a headache."},{"Title":"Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 Unleashed","review":"Don't let &quot;2.1&quot; influence you; the linux version really doesn't make a difference.

Another strength is that is generally very easy reading and easy to follow for a beginner. You don't have to know what you are doing to learn a lot. The Samba chapter is topnotch with sections on troubleshooting and everything. The shell scripting chapter is nice too.The downside of this book is that nothing is really done in detail. For instance the chapter on shells lists some differences between C shells and bash shells, which was good. But it has nothing really about commands themselves. In some ways this book can't decide if it's for beginners or more advanced people. The chapters on internet services (httpd, nfs etc) are really simple.

The other \\"tours\\" outside the Old City walls are interesting from an Israeli/Jewish perspective since they have such a bias. The author repeatedly points out how slummy and garbage-strewn certain areas were before the Jewish immigrants tidied things up. I found that annoying. On my most recent visit, I was most interested in learning more about the Mughabi Quarter formerly located in front of the Western Wall. This author mentions that Morroccans once lived there but neglects to explain that Israel bulldozed the entire neighborhood just days after the Six-Day War. That's a grave omission."},{"Title":"Looking Ahead 4: Mastering Academic Writing","review":"I bought this book for my writing class. It is a nice book with great quality!

When my 6 year-old son saw the cover he begged for me to read it immediately. He loved the book and is asking if there are others available (which there are because this is one in a series).We had just finished \\"Growing up in Ancient Greece\\" by Chris Chelipi which I thought was a bit boring. \\"Adventures in Ancient Greece\\" duplicated the same information and included additional information. So if you are wondering if this comic book style book (less serious tone) is lacking in content, I can assure you that it is not.The format of the book is comic book style with sidebars that read more like a regular text. The storyline is that a boy and his two sisters enter a time travel-travel agency and request to go to the next Olympic games in the future. By mistake they are transported to Ancient Greece. A boy gives them a tour of Athens and explains daily life in Ancient Greece. They experience daily living such as the role of women, slaves, and foreign visitors vs. men, voting, worship, parties, and common foods eaten. They also find themselves in the middle of a war that is called to a truce before casualties occur, at the Olympics, and finally on a warship that is engaged in a war before coming back home, magically. There is some sarcasm and some silliness. Some of the sarcasm borders on disrespect, such as when the boy gives them olives to eat, and proclaims they are the best in the world and the boy thinks, \\"this is a treat?\\" The girl is annoyed that women lead subservient lives and makes some sarcastic comments. I chose to skip over some of the silly and sarcastic comments. In the end I know my son learned important content from this book, which is the goal!"},{"Title":"Adventures in Ancient Greece (Good Times Travel Agency)","review":"This series is designed for the 4-6th grade audience and as such has a lot of silliness between the characters.

It is great for new Star Wars readers around 10 years old. It is nice because it does not confuse you with complicated Star Wars terms and yet has a very good plots. It is not all that long only about 100 and some pages, another reason it is good for young readers. I would finsh them in 3 to 5 days. I would never be able to put these books down. It is one of the few Star Wars books that does not use the main characters Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, ETC. It also does not require you to read the seris in order (though I recommend it). The author does a great job explaining the history you need to know. I would not recommend this book for vetran Star Wars novel readers.

At the beginning of the story, Zak and Tash Arranda were traveling with their mysterious uncle Hoole (who is a Shi'ido or shape-changer), and his sophisticated and dry attitude droid DV-9, or Deevee for short, through hyperspace. Their destination: a planet named D'Vouran. Tash and Zak, Tash being the older sister and Zak being the younger brother, were still dealing with feelings of grief, uncertainty, and loss over the destruction of Alderaan, which killed their parents and all whom they loved and held dear. This situation wasn't helped by their new guardian, uncle Hoole, who was a relative only because of his brother marrying into their side of the family, and since all of Tash and Zak's relatives were killed, uncle Hoole took them under his wing. They knew very little of their uncle, and he told them very little about himself and his past, and when they traveled with him on one of his errands, he likewise told them little on the purpose of his errands. This troubled them. So for the past few months they continued living like this with Deevee acting as their babysitter, at which the droid complained at every chance he could. To help sedate their grief, Zak became a dare-devil, and Tash buried herself in searching for any information she could find on the Jedi, who she was already interested in before all this, and dreamed of becoming one. So, in this journey, as she had done times before, she went to the cockpit and dreamed of flying a spaceship as a Jedi. She put her hands on the controls. The stillness of hyperspace lasted only a few moments, and then the craft was jerked violently out of hyperspace. Uncle Hoole and Zak came storming into the cockpit as the craft headed toward their destination, D'Vouran, fifteen minutes ahead of time. Tash moved out of the pilot seat and uncle Hoole took his place and fought to bring the ship safely into the planet's atmosphere. They landed, but the ship suffered damage which would keep them grounded until it was fixed.For better or worse, they had arrived at their destination, but Tash had a horrible feeling about it.This was an excellent page-turner that had balance to it. The book was well written and had a good measure of humor in it. The writing style of the book was sort of like what Jude Watson writes most of her books in, which makes the book a rather quick read. It was a good read, though. The atmosphere and suspense of the book was well balanced, the scary scenes were conveyed in such a way that it didn't turn out looking silly, and the characters had depth to them.I enjoyed this book. If you are a hard-core fan of Star Wars, you'll probably feel obliged to go out and purchase this book without previewing it first. Although you certainly could do just that, I suggest if you can to take it out of your local library before you purchase it to see if you really like.And so the review comes to an end now.-Jake Smithers"},{"Title":"Eaten Alive (Star Wars: Galaxy of Fear, Book 1)","review":"It may not be quite as Star Wars-y as most books, but this is still an excellent adventure. It is very thrilling and suspenseful and has some cool characters. Imagine a worlds-better version of Goosebumps in the Star Wars universe and that's only a part of what this is all about.

We saw Anita's life hand in the balance alongside Jean-Claude - will they ever get together..... already ordered the next book. Absolutely loved this book very short read (two nights) couldn't put it down. There is also a new possible love interest for Anita in this novel and we are left hanging for the next installment as to who she will pick! can't wait."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Well, Circus of the Damned is one of my favourite books in the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series. It has great character development and introduces some new and attractive faces that show up quite frequently later in the series. Though because this book is rather early in the series and Ms. Hamilton's writing career, there are some rough spots in the plot and characters that are smoothed out in later books but are apparent in this one. Though the plot is rich and thick with intrigue and mystery, it has holes in it. In the beginning of the book Ms. Hamilton focuses on the investigation of the murders of two persons, and the vampire pack that did it. But once Anita Blake is caught up with Jean Claude and Alejandro and the Lamia, the murder investigation is almost forgotten. It is alluded to that Dolph and RPIT found someone connected to the murders but Ms. Hamilton never really says who did them or why. Another thing I noticed that seems to keep recurring in the Anita Blake series is that once Anita confronts the bad guys, she disposes of them in nothing short of light speed, despite the fact that earlier in the books the bad guys were incrediably powerful and/or old. The author seems to reach a point when she just wants to be done with the book, and the plot suffers. Surprisingly though, none of this really took away from the book. The characters are so interesting and deep and the events that happen are very rich in description that the book is still compelling and a good read. The writing is humourous as always, rich and full of style individual to Ms. Hamilton. Try this book, I've read it numberous times and it only gets better."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"The third installment of the Anita Blake series pits our favorite necromancer against a vampire looking to make her his human servant and a giant cobra. Of course, Jean-Claude's none too thrilled about that as he wants Anita for himself. She needs him, too, but she also has her reservations.This series introduces us a bit more into the world of lycanthropes and we meet another big player in the series, Richard Zeeman. He's Jean-Claude's wolf to call, and more competition for Anita's heart.Building on the themes of the first two books, Anita grows more into her powers. I was glad to see Jean-Claude get more screen time in this book compared to the second. There is plenty of action and I enjoyed this book a bit more than the second. It's less gory, but you still feel the grit of the underworld. At this point in the series, I recommend continuing onto book 4."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"i really love this series, i cant believe people are so hateful sometimes on reviews. i think hamilton does a wonderful job creating a rich and wonderful world full of interesting and creative creatures and lives. i would highly recommend to anyone who loves mystery intrigue and horror all roled into one, oh and with a side of sex, that never hurt anyone. lol"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"The third installment of the Anita Blake series by Laurell K Hamilton, Circus of the Damned, was the book that got me straight hooked on this series. I liked the first two books enough to keep reading obviously, but this is the book that grabbed at me and made me want to hurl myself into the Anita Blake universe. The first time I read this book was sometime ago- rereading the series for the Anita Blake Challenge hosted by BCC.Anita is still hard at work as an animator and preternatural assistant to the police force. Jean-Claude, Master of the City, is hounding Anita about becoming his human servant- and surprise surprise she ends up near the gorgeous vampire she is trying to avoid. That is right, a grotesque, blood-drained body looks like it could be the work of a pack of rogue vampires and it leads her right to the Circus of the Damned. This is what I love about Anita Blake and her world- there is no down time. Anita has a full plate and that gives me action, action, action. I love a good Urban Fantasy with nonstop commotion. I mean, she has a lot of silly, feisty characters to beat down in this book! Don't worry- Hamilton is brilliant so you won't get lost in the hustle and bustle.Oh, I can't forget, although I'd like to, we are introduced to Richard. Ya know, back when he was likable. In the later novels he becomes a bane to my existence. Whiny. Temperamental. He hates who he has to be and who Anita has become. Boo hoo. He is great in this book though, haha. I like that I can dislike Richard in later novels though- I find that I don't quite love a book if there isn't at least one character I can have a strong disdain for. Wow, rambling. This definitely isn't one of my most well thought out reviews...My only complaint about Circus of the Damned was the immensely tiring description of clothing and weaponry. This isn't a huge complaint, sometimes it works when an outfit is painted with the author's vision. However, sometimes I like dressing the character too. ;) Erm... other times I'm just being impatient, dying to know what happens next and when there is piddle paddle in my way I get frustrated. Haha.I loved this book. Fantastic, fast paced, satisfying. If you're into vampires and urban fantasy I recommend you hop on this series."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"So far this series does not have a good ratio of good times to bad. Not that it needs to be 50/50, but cover-to-cover misery makes me grumpy. It's like reading about someone's perpetually bad day. All-in-all, I felt unsatisfied after reading this book. It just lacked something. It was more like a bit of a story here and a bit of a story there, but not a lot of anything. Filler material really, interesting tidbits but not fulfilling. Another reviewer called this book hot...I must have missed those pages."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Man o Man, I was unable to pry myself away from this book! I had to know the fate of Anita and all those that surround her. I was awaiting various endings; each time I read another chapter, Anita's destiny changed in order to remain alive and in control to an extent that suited her. It seems that her main goal, besides making sure that all the villains were put to rest indefinitely, was to remain in control of her mind, body, and soul.There is something about Anita that every preternatural is curious about. They want to dominate her, whether it be to use her for their benefit in a larger scheme or just to protect her. Her stubborn and hard headed sensibility will not allow either, she would rather die.This book had me squirming and screaming at the brilliant gore and raw romance of the perfect flowing words from Anita's mind. She makes me so angry at times with her inflexible and adamant ways. Sometimes I wish that she would just give in a little; especially with Jean-Claude, no, but she will not, she is if not better than to give in, but cautious. Ultimately, she is afraid and suspicious of her feelings, of his intentions, and of his species.This series is a really graphic horror with bits of sexual tension admittedly makes the readers mouth water! Can not get enough of the this heroine; I'm anxious to get my next fix! Lunatic Cafe, here I come!"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"I didn't like this one quite as much as the last one, The Laughing Corpse, but I liked it more than the first book. The most important thing for me is that this book showed another layer to the series: in the first book, the focus was on the powerful and terrifying vampires; the second centered around the undead and humans who raise them -- the evil of humans rather than the evil of vampires, in other words. This book is about the humans who have to deal with these evil things. The bad guy in this one was good, though it centered a lot more on Anita and Jean-Claude and Anita's attempts to live a normal life, all of which are effectively ruined by her association with Jean-Claude, because she knows who the Master of the City is and where his daytime resting place is, so everybody who wants to kill him -- and it's more than a few -- wants to bribe, threaten, and torture the information out of her. It was an interesting depiction of what it's like to be a human drawn into the vampire's world. It also made Anita seem much less high-powered -- though she did have her bada$$ moment at the end, oh yes she did.I liked Oliver enormously; I thought it was a fantastic idea and a wonderfully drawn character. I liked his motivation and the ways he intends to accomplish his goals, as well as his obvious personal power as seen through his control of such incredibly powerful minions. I didn't like the lamia, but I'm not supposed to, so that worked out well; it's an interesting way to handle the villain, to have a personable mastermind with loathsome henchbeings. On one level I wanted Oliver to win, mostly because I'm tired of Jean-Claude's assurance that he'll win and that Anita will surrender to him. Why? Because he's pretty, that's why. He's way too much of a prettyboy, utterly confident that his looks will enable him to get any woman, utterly convinced that once a woman gives in to her attraction to him, she will never resist him again. It's annoying. The conversation just keeps happening the same way:\\"I'll never give in to you, Jean-Claude.\\"\\"But you want me.\\"\\"But I can't love you.\\"\\"But you liked kissing me.\\"\\"But I can't love you, and so there will never be anything more than a kiss.\\"\\"I'll wait, ma petite.\\"And on and on it goes. Now, this doesn't detract from the books, and it did make this one better for me because of the events that happen between Anita and Jean-Claude, how she turns on him and why, and the end result of her unexpected (to Jean-Claude; seems like it was always just a matter of time) betrayal of him, and I do agree with Anita's final choice of Jean-Claude as the least of the several evils facing her -- but I want her to slap him. A lot. Maybe muss up that pretty face a little bit. Although more scars would just give him character, like that damn cross scar gives to his chest. And I have to admit that I prefer Jean-Claude to the alternative, Alejandro. Basically this character and his dealings with Anita make her a more sympathetic character without having him become truly loathsome -- this is the problem Anne Rice had with Lestat, for instance. His villainy was just too villainous, and it couldn't be maintained over a series -- and there was a series without a sympathetic character. So I much prefer this to that. He still needs a slappin', though.I'm seeing great potential in these books to go the distance: the main character is both powerful and, as this book establishes, very human and thus a bit outclassed by her immortal enemies -- though she uses all of the tools at her disposal to maximum effect, which works out quite well -- and the other main characters are complex and multi-dimensional. Because despite my irritation with Jean-Claude's prettyboy seduction techniques, he is actually much more than that as a, um, person, which is why I don't really hate him. But it isn't just him: Willie McCoy, and Anita's boss, Bert, and the other animators, including the new guy, all have their strengths and weaknesses. They are all very realistic, and thus very interesting. At the same time, of course, there is some serious booty-kicking going on in these books, and who doesn't like that?"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"In the third installment of the Anita Blake series, Laurell Hamilton creates a circus that goes beyond the title.Hamilton gives Anita so many enemies out to kill her that there is a running gag of it being a very bad week. Although the plot could be called over-complicated and there are so many new characters you wonder if they're part rabbit, the book is entertaining and enjoyable.Anita's personality develops further in this novel making her even more of a sympathetic heroine. I think any woman who has faced adversity can relate to Anita surveying the damage done to her bedroom by zombies and well-meaning police officers and only care about whether the blood will come out of her stuffed penguins.The blood flows freely in this novel, but the gore was toned down a bit from The Laughing Corpse. The end and Anita's relationship with the master vampire could have been handled better. I understand the necessity for it since Hamilton had written Anita into a corner, but it was still rather disappointing."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Wow! I really enjoyed the first two books in the Anita Blake series, but I guess I figured that Laurell Hamilton would start to take off the accelerator and maybe even run out of ideas by about the third book. \\"Circus of the Damned\\" is the best book in the series so far. It's simply astounding how much action has been fit into a 300 page novel. A day in the life of Anita Blake consists of police investigations, vampire hunts, necromancy, social events and not much sleep. Every time one situation is over, another one sweeps her up into intrigue, danger and supernatural encounters. It could almost be completely overwhelming if it wasn't so constantly entertaining.Whereas \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" introduced the reader to the world of vampires and \\"The Laughing Corpse\\" brought zombies onto the scene, this third book introduces werewolves and lamias (shapeshifting snakes) into the mix. The reader simply can't get bored with new monsters around every corner, not to mention love interests and ancient blood wars. I must admit when I first started reading the Anita Blake series, I thought it was going to be filled with gothic dreamy romance and not much horror and action. Laurell Hamilton has managed to include all of those aspects and the gore level is extremely high. There are decapitations and throats and rib cages being ripped out all over the place. While the fantasy romance aspects and tough chick antics of these books may draw in female supporters, unsuspecting readers need to be aware that the author doesn't pull any punches. If you don't like blood and guts then you'll find many parts of this book in particular to be rather gruesome.If I am to criticise anything here I'd have to say that Anita herself is becoming a little too powerful. I mean, it's awesome to have the diminutive sexpot beating up bad guys and monsters left, right and centre. But she's now defeating million year old vampires and fighting off several extremely dangerous creatures unassisted. I guess I hope it doesn't turn into a superhero style series where the main character doesn't have vulnerabilities as that would take the fear factor straight out of it for the reader.This being said, I couldn't be more excited about continuing onto book four and I love the no stuffing around writing formula that Laurell uses. It's hard to have so much action and still create a world full of history and one that contains real characters, but she seems to have a real knack for it. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"I just recently (July 2004) 'discovered' the Anita Blake series, and I love these books !!

Even though you sense that Jean Claude will not be killed in this novel you still find your-self wondering how Anita will get herself out of this particular jam. The author keeps adding interesting characters. Richard and his story line seem promissing. Edward adds a dangerous touch. I must admit to being a Jean Claud fan.I read books 1 to 3 extreemly fast. I was just too excited about what would happen next. I am now waiting for books 4 to 9 to be deliered to my door. Let's hope the rest of the series is half as interesting as the first three."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"While re-reading this book after I finishd the series I realized something, every single character, from Anita and Jean-Claude, down to Irving step completely out of character. While this book is by far, probably the most humorous book in the series, its characters are sorely lacking. It's a must read, simply for its hilarity, and for the rest of the series to make sense, to get through the book, you mustn't take the characters too seriously."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"In this, the third of the Anita Blake - Vampire Hunter series, Anita finds out what it is to become one of those dolls that stretches when you pull on their arms. Jean-Claude wants her because he is intreigued by her. She can look into his eyes after all and not fall for his spell. And she did help him defeat the last Master of the city, didn't she? But Alejandro just wants her to get to Jean-Claude.Again, which is worse? A vampire in love with you or a vampire who want's to use you"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"About the Book:In this third installment of Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series, there are several murders happening that seem to be the work of a rogue group of vampires. Meanwhile, Anita is still having issues with Jean-Claude, master of St. Louis, who is wanting Anita to become his human servant. The thing is Anita isn't willing to gamble her soul, not even for immortality. Unfortunately, the master vampire from the rogue group isn't going to give Anita the choice.Review:Rereading these always reminds me of why I fell in love with the Anita Blake series, how much they can grab you and hold you. Circus of the Damned is no different. That's not to say it's not without its flaws, but overall, it is a very entertaining read. Even with the repetitive phrases (ri-ight being one of many) and the cheesy clothing taken from the 80's (and this is coming from someone who loves the 80's), Hamilton managed to create several memorable characters, which you found yourself rooting for time and time again. Seriously, I would hate Anita as a person and yet I want her to succeed.So what is there to like about Circus of the Damned? Well, I admit that really enjoyed the villain and the reason behind what he was doing. I don't want to give anything away, but his reasoning made sense. Now, a lot of people that I have talked with had had an issue with how he was defeated. Again, without giving too much away, he agrees to limit his powers in a duel. Personally, I thought it made sense why he limited himself, but many others disagree. This seems to be a huge deciding factor how much someone liked the book. Even if you found the villain a bit lame, there should still be plenty to make it an entertaining enough read. There are giant snakes, werewolves in action, and even a lamia.Honestly, from what I recall, the main downfall I had with this book was Anita herself, especially with how she treated Larry. For those who don't know, Larry is the new animator (zombie raiser) that Bert hired. When Anita first meets Larry, he is raising a zombie. Anyway, he doesn't have the energy to control said zombie. Needless to say, Anita saves the day from potential danger and tells Larry off. This I have no problem with, but later, she keeps going on and on about how dangerous their job -- to the point where people come after them. Um ... Anita, me thinks that you are getting your animating job confused with vampire slaying. Yes, we later find out that Larry wants to be a vampire hunter, but until then, Anita is saying that animating is the dangerous job. I'm not saying it can't be, but not to the point that she is implying. If it was, I doubt people like Charles, who strongly dislikes violence, would be an animator. I don't know; maybe it's a bit of a nitpick, but it kept getting brought up, and Anita was never really shown as being wrong.Overall though, I still found Circus of the Damned really enjoyable, even though I have a severe disliking for the author and what the series has become. Sure it has its flaws, but it manages to pull me into Anita's world every single time, and I still find myself recommending the earlier books to several people."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"This series has been awesome.

My one problem with this series is the character of Jean-Claude, or rather, with the way Hamilton always chooses to dress him. He is almost always wearing lace and see-through shirts. That's just a little too effeminate for me. And there are way too many descriptions of his nipples. Sorry, but I am just not a nipple girl. I think Anita should forget Jean-Claude and go for Richard or Edward."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Very timely shipment and the book was in condition as stated. I will definitely be buying from this person again. Thank you"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Anita is still working as an animator and an assistant to preternatural police force. Anita has a full plate as usual, after a full night of corpse raising, she's then hounded by members of \\"the vamp hater Church or somesuch\\" to give up the resting place of the Master of the City (Jean Claude), then a body turns up drained by what appears to be a rogue pack of vamps which leads her to The Circus of the Damned and into close proximity with vampire Jean Claude, a sexy vampire she'd rather avoid. He's been trying to make her his human servant but she stubbornly refuses, even when it means putting her own life in jeopardy. There's a whole lot of that \\"Ma petite I have marked you, you are mine\\" and \\"I kill vampires, I don't serve them\\" nonsense going on. She must train an apprentice animator, face down an angry lamia, crazed humans, out of control zombies and deal with a dangerous master vampire. It sounds exhausting but I have to hand it to Hamilton because I was never lost. We're also introduced to Richard when he was still sweet and sexy and not quite so angry and rigid as he appears in the later novels.Once again there is way too much focus on clothing (who cares) and the gun descriptions (snore). Personally, I am still not dying to discover what color Anita's Nike swishes will be every other page and if the match her t shirt. I already know that she is not a girly-girl because it's mentioned over and over. We all know Jean Claude has a preference for lacy floofy blouses and his own nipples. Do we need to be constantly reminded of this? It's a little painful to read this stuff but the quick pacing and intriguing characters carry the book for me and I enjoyed the many plotlines here, none of which focus on sex I might add.Despite a lame villain and too much arguing from Anita, I enjoyed this as much as the previous two in the series."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"When I think of scary circus stuff, clowns leap to the front of the list. Of course, there are fanged clowns in the Circus of the Damned. How could there not be? It's the perfect milieu for Anita Blake, the heroine of Laurell K Hamilton's \\"Vampire Hunter\\" series. Anita is an animator: she raises the undead for a living, which goes to show you, by page one, she's not a squeamish woman. More about this circus. There are demon acrobats, and fanged clowns, and sinuous snake charmers and giant snakes. And it's all run by the vampires of St. Louis.It's also the daytime resting place of Jean-Claude, the new Master of the City, who has marked Anita twice and is, to her enormous displeasure, her vampire Master. Don't worry readers: she says she'd die first before taking the next two marks.There are several points of tension in the plot. A pack of rogue vampires are trolling the hills making seemingly-random kills. Anita is spending far too much of her time helping out the police, according to her money-hungry boss, and is missing her appointments. He is finally persuaded to hire Larry, a very green animator, to assist Anita until he can learn the trade. Meanwhile, area vampires are threatening Jean-Claude's position as Master of St. Louis. His first thoughts are to his doubly-marked servant Anita, who must willingly submit to him before his peers in order to solidify his power. The reader learns more about lycanthropy (generic animal shapeshifting) in is book and we meet the last of a race of creatures.Hamilton hasn't really explored Anita's lovelife, except to say it's mostly-nonexistent. Throughout the book, she is busy almost having a date with a brown-eyed handsome man. Life keeps seeming to get in the way so it seems readers will have to wait until the fourth (or later) volume in the series before romance creeps into the protagonist's life.The book is well-written, like the first two, and Anita becomes more lifelike with each new volume in the series. She's cynical and unafraid to espouse her dislikes. She's married to her work and exercises, not because she likes it, but because she will eventually need to outrun the bad guys. The series is popular. I'm supposing the character will develop further as the storyline progresses. It's what I look for in this sort of novel because, let's face it: the only thing that scares me more than clowns is a puncture wound. I don't read the novels because I love vampires. I will keep reading as long as Anita grows."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"I am really getting into the Anita Blake stories, and I found Circus of the Damned by Laurell K. Hamilton to be an incredible book. The story seemed to continue on in the standard that I'm beginning to expect from the series.There was very little that I could find at fault with the story. Some of the writing was a little too descriptive for my taste. (I'm probably one of those rare people who doesn't like everything to be completely spelled out for me.) There were also times when it seemed like there were lines added for the purpose of filler.The plot moved along quite well. The bad guys were fairly easy to distinguish from the beginning, but Ms. Hamilton did a good job in building the story around them. The book was definitely enthralling enough to keep me interested in reading more of the series."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Have not read the book.

Anita struggles with breaking in, and keeping safe, an newbie animator, hunting down a rouge master vampire, and questioning the limits of her love life.Circus of the Damned introduces Richard Zeeman, who's showing quite the interest in Anita. He's hot. And not dead, which gives him the advantage over Jean-Claude. Surprisingly, when Anita must decide how loyal she is to Jean-Claude, it has nothing to do with romance in Circus of the Damned.Anita must find a master vampire that's leading a band of human killers. The mystery has a lot of back and forth to it, eventually leading to a surprising reveal.Circus of the Damned brings us further into the world of the shapeshifters. While not strictly a werewolf book, we do see a good deal of them and other weres.My lone complaint is the ending of Circus of the Damned, after the mystery is completely resolved, feels a lot like when a character wakes up and says \\"oh, it was all a dream.\\" Some truly interesting stuff occurs in the course of the book only to be taken back at the end. I really dislike when the plot takes you places only to have the author say \\"just kidding\\" in the last few pages of the book.Circus of the Damned is ripe with deadly fight scenes and danger around every turn. A fantastic continuation of the series and completely un-put-down-able."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"I do enjoy Laurell K Hamilton's writing. I enjoy how she has changed over the years in her writing. Listening to the Audio CD's gives another dimension to her books. Since I only buy the unabridged versions, I enjoy the fact that the book I have read in the past is now available for me to listen to on those crazy drives to work. It calms me down...even as the action increases in the books. Love it!"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"The third novel of Hamilton's Anita Blake series has the petite necromancer fighting a giant cobra and a rogue vampire, Alejandro, who wants her for his human servant. Anita is still resisting the advances of Jean-Claude, St. Louis's master vampire, but she does need him on her side, if not in her bed.Anita's reluctant involvement in the odd goings-on at the supernatural Circus of the Damned introduces her to Richard, the werewolf of her dreams, and Larry, her powerful but nervous partner in zombie-raising.What I think:This book was exciting as the first two that I have read. In this book, Anita who is Jean Claude's vampire servant was still pressured of the thought because she didn't act like one. as stubborn as she is, she still refuses to be Jean Claude's vampire servant because she doesn't want to be bound forever to him. Anita encounters Mr. Oliver or The Earthmover, who is member of the vampire council that wants to kill Jean Claude to take over St. Louis.Initially Anita tells the old vampire because she was mad with Jean Claude but eventually kills him together with Edward. this is the book where Anita meets Richard, Jean Claude's animal to call (Wolf).This book is worth reading if you haven't though of buying it yet! Anita is the kind of character that you want if you enjoy Angelina Jolie flicks. Tough chick, sarcastic, yet this book includes the love elements that you may want to read in a book, though not the mushy-type of romance. All in all, the Anita Blake series never seems to fail me.["},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"So far, I am liking the Anita Blake series - it's a good place holder as I'm awaiting subsequent books on other similar series.

The action is almost non-stop in this book, which is part of a powerful series by Laurell K. Hamilton. Anita is strong, witty and still seems human. She feels like a real character and though her world is more fantastic than ours, her self admitted flaws and her undoubtable strengths make her seem like a real human being.

Read her series for Anita Blake. The series only gets better as it progresses, and Circus is incredible. The characters are freaking awesome!"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Plot Summary: Anita is being worked to the bone raising corpses, and she's still dodging the attentions of Jean-Claude, the master vampire of the city. When Anita's police consultation work interrupts the animator business, her boss hires a powerful, fresh-faced, ignorant kid to pick up the slack. He's a wanna-be vampire slayer, and Anita takes him under her wing, like a puppy who needs protecting. A bunch of powerful new vampires show up, all eager to take Jean-Claude down, and since Anita is one of the few humans who knows his identity, she becomes everyone's favorite target.There actually wasn't much plot to this one. Bad vampires want to take control away from Jean-Claude, and Anita gets caught in the middle. That pretty much sums it up. The plot may be shallow, but the action was so hot that my eyeballs feel dry from reading it nonstop. I just couldn't read it fast enough during those life or death scenes; I must have flown through the pages at lightening speed. I'm not sure how this novel would stand up to repeated readings, but it's a fantastic fantasy thriller the first time around.There was some progress made between Anita and Jean-Claude. I'm not sure where this twisted relationship is headed, but it's far from dull. I happened to be in the library today, and a lady was sitting on the floor directly in front of the shelf that holds all of Ms. Hamilton's books. She told me these were the best vampire books ever, and I could tell that she's read them all, but she couldn't stop ogling them. When I meet fans like this, or maybe I should call them fanatics, I'm inclined to think their fascination stems from Jean-Claude rather than Anita. I suppose time will tell as I get deeper into this series. For myself, I read these because Anita is such a tough little cookie."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Superior horror novel to the fourth book, Lunatic Caf&eacute; (which I read first, oops).I've seen critics complain that there is not enough romance and I must disagree. This is a horror book and it has horror, blood and gore enough to satisfy even Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans.Dead bodies strewn the lawns of this town, thanks to a group of rogue vampires. The police are clueless and so they call in Anita as part of their \\"preternatural crimes\\" unit. Anita is not a cop and at times she wishes she were, as she gets pushed around by the police and feels she knows better. I am wondering if she will actually get a cop license.New creatures and activities abound: We learn of a Lamia, a snake shapeshifter that can kill with the gobs of poison dripping from its fangs. We meet Oliver, a million year old vampire who wants to become master of the city and defeat current laws that let vampires open businesses and saloons.One of these businesses is of course Jean Claude's Circus of the Damned, a place that people go to to get frightened out of their wits safely (they hope). Unfortunately the place becomes a fight to the finish between Oliver and Jean Claude.We learn more about Edward, bounty hunter, who wants to kill as many vamps and other monsters as she can.Anita meets Richard and begins to fall for him, until she finds out what he really is (which is further developed in Lunatic Caf&eacute;).My favorite scenes include training Larry, a new animator, in the fine points of zombie-raising, where he taxes himself beyond his powers and creates a zombie that could potentially kill his own family!Or Anita being trapped in a dark cave, with the vampire Alejandro, who has seen the Aztecs rise and fall, and wants her for his own. She stumbles and screams but gets her licks in with a Browning automatic filled with silver bullets!Gore and blood without being overly fascinated with it, Laurell Hamilton really pounds out the story that is easy to read, fun to imagine and exciting as any Buffy story has a right to be.Pick this up!"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"This is the third installment in the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series by Laurell K. Hamilton. As with the other two, this one also had a strong kick-ass woman in the lead. We find out a bit more of Anita and the monsters that exist in her world. There is also a suggestion that Anita has even more power than we have been so far been lead to believe. This is may be shown in the next books but have yet to be determined for me.Anita's nemesis and lust interest, Jean Claude, the vampire master of the city actually bugged me in this book. He knew the way to get Anita to see him as, at least, something more than someone who is her antagonist, but refuses to rise to that level. This behavior also makes sense in the characterization of Jean Claude as he is also seen as very egotistical. There is also an introduction in a new love interest for Anita in Richard, the science teacher. I think he will make things either more interesting or more complicated for her life as the series progresses. Of course with all those choices in her personal life, she has paranatural murders to help solve, and two new master vampires to fight. Both very old masters and one of the master vampires who is impossibly old. She also encounters more werewolves and a Lamina who is an ancient \\"mythical\\" snake-like creature.Good book and I recommend reading this series."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"This book was great once I got in the mood for it! If you can take all the sex and just add the adventure with it then you get a deep engaging read. If you get hung up on all the sex like it's a porno or something then you won't like it. I think of it like an adult situation. There is adventure, there is sex with a mate and there is violence then comes breeding and death. So I really think you should give this 3rd installment a go."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Of course, I loved it - but no one is surprised since I love anything by LKH. I think most of the characters in this book are well developed as, of course, is the world they inhabit. I liked the vampire politics as well as the conflicted nature of vampires being US citizens. One of the inhuman creatures wasn't well developed. Her \\"race\\" just didn't seem well developed the way the shapeshifters and vampires are. I didn't quite feel like I understood what was going on with that, but I suppose Anita didn't either, so it worked in context. I liked the introduction of Richard. Very fun. ***** Spoiler, read no further***** The ultimate bad guy as a \\"really old rogue master vamp\\" kinda thing seemed a little hokey - but it was dramatic. Anita's Deus Ex Machina act at the end I found frustrating, I'd have preferred something more real."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"This is the third book in Laurell K.

From there we're drawn into the growing power struggle within the St. Louis vampire community. We meet lots of new and interesting creatures, umm, characters along the way as Anita gets dumped from one situation to the next. This book is virtually non-stop action! A lot is done to further develop the relationship between Anita and Jean-Claude, but a new love-interest is introduced as well. Laurell Hamilton does an excellent job of handling her characters and allowing them to develop as the plot advances. She introduces some really sinister bad guys in this book, but I can't say more without spoiling the plot.I highly recommend this book!

Hamilton gave Anita a new beau but I could almost see why she did it. In every romantic plot, you need to give a huge surprise to keep readers interested. At least that is what i think.

You'd think I'd have a finger on it since I'm on book #3, but I don't. I've read these last to using the MP3 audio versions, and I do like the narrator she does a fantastic job, but I can't put a finger on what I like about this series. Maybe it's the potential, maybe it's the gruesome, horror like aspect that's not too scary, because I don't do scary. I just don't know. I am ready for Anita to get a serious romantic partner, yeah, yeah she gets all date like in this book, but with all that blood shed and danger there needs to be a touch of romance. There's a touch of sexual tension between Anita and Jean Claude, but she needs to get out there and do something besides maim, murder, fight for her life and raise zombies. Anita is a great character she's wonderfully sarcastic, young but 'old', and very human, she's breakable and not afraid to admit her flaws, even embracing them which makes her a likable and relatable character. I loved the challenges placed on the Master of the City via very old vamps and it kind of showed where Anita's loyalties lay which could be interesting later on, but the same old formula seems to be in place. Anita goes and raises zombies, gets called by police to investigate a crime, life in jeopardy, saves the day. I get tired of formulas, I enjoy all the new mayhem, but the formulas do get old. Am I going to read book 4? Uh, yeah in fact the nice little paperback version is sitting on my bookshelf just waiting for me to pick it up. I just hope I can enjoy these just a little bit more in the future."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"I really enjoyed this series. The characters are great and the premise (the supernatural just being a part of the real world) was really interesting. I am born raised and still in St. Louis so that added to my enjoyment. I do think Hamilton extends out the sexual scenes to almost boredom, but the rest of the books are wonderful."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Anita Blake once again is in a heck of a lot of trouble fighting monsters, zombies, human enemies and friends. As she comments, in the last four months Anita has been stabbed, beaten, shot strangled and vampire bit. In this book she has even more violence both physical and magical directed at her. And she manages to prevail through a combination of tenacity, toughness, talent and training.In Circus of the Damned Anita continues her feud with Jean Claude who tries everything to get Anita to succumb to his wiles and become his human servant. Other master vampires are also interested in Anita due to her necromantic powers and reputation. In addition she is assisting the police in an investigation of several murders that are perpetrated by a rogue vampire pack, breaking in a new animator at work who is nave and dangerously enthusiastic, and she has a new romantic interest and therefore is trying to go on a date. Fat chance because it's Halloween so business is booming.Th.\\"e tale of Anita Blake continues to fascinate. She a tough cookie with a heart of gold and cannot bear to see people victimized. Nor will she tolerate any attempts to dominate or intrude upon her. Anita has a strong bullshit detector and does not have time for some of the hierocracy and niceties that most people expect--particularly from a female. She has a sarcastic sense of humor that allows her to see the funny side even in the face of death, and a laconic yet rich style of narration. Highly enjoyable non-stop read!"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Clipped from wheelsofterror.com review:They say three times a charm; here all three were a charm, but it's a mark of a great, important new sub-plot that's born in this installment.Richard, a powerful lycanthrope who from here on stays throughout the series as an important character, is introduced. This creates more havoc on the goal Jean-Claude has, as well as major changes in Anita's personality. This delicious sideline isn't explored more until the next book, but the introduction of it here is intriguing.As always, the action kicks off in the first chapter, and the ending is another delightful show down between powerful creatures where it seems that nothing will be right again. As before, it ends with a depressing note between the lines, a sense of realism that's impossible to ignore when it's pushed right up in your face.There's a great mystery on who hired Edward (another favorite character, the cold hit man you can't help but adore) to kill Jean-Claude, whether Jean-Claude will end up surviving, and what the other Master vampires in town want with our favorite necromancer.Besides all this, Anita's personal life is being ran through the cleaners. More about her secret self and powers are explored, and as always the police work is dark, fascinating, and gore-laden. Jean-Claude's previous ambitions from Laughing Corpse are shown here more than ever - they have one or two truly steamy scenes that rocked my boat. With what happens at the end, the spark ignited by this series in my mind was lit even further. Powerful stuff.Another A+ installment in the series. Read book 1 to 3 for a small slice of Anita Blake paradise."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton's done it again: she has once again surpassed her previous 2 books in this third installment. In this story, we find Anita Blake back in the hornet's nest of vampires and undead power struggles. This book has more interaction with the spellbinding Master of the City, Jean-Claude, which is always a plus.There are a few new characters introduced, one being Richard Zeeman, a junior high school science teacher who just happens to turn into a werewolf once a month. Another new addition is Larry Kirkland, a youthful, very naive addition to Anita's animating firm.The plot in this one revolves around a struggle between two forces: Jean Claude and his vampires and a rogue, ancient vampire with some very radical, deadly beliefs. The action scenes are incredible, and the battles, oh! Anyone who has read any of Hamilton's work will adore this book."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"I just completed the third book in the Anita Blake series, and all I have to say is: Poor Jean-Claude. True, he may be dead, and he may not have a soul, but Anita should have a heart. Give the vampire a break! This time around, Jean-Claude is not the only dead guy who wants Anita as his human servant: now Alejandro (an even bigger jerk than Jean-Claude) wants her too. What's a girl to do? Instead of being flattered over this twisted triangle, she is highly annoyed - good thing she has a new boy-toy to take her mind off of things. Enter, Richard, a mysterious friend of Jean-Claude who has a heartbeat, but is keeping something very crucial from her. Yikes.I just love this series by Laurell K. Hamilton. I will admit that at first, I didn't think I would like it. But, after a few chapters of the first book, it hooks you, and you don't want to stop reading until you have completed the entire series. Which reminds me, I should stop reviewing this and start reading The Lunatic Cafe."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"I love Anita Blake! She's so human - (i think) flawed but brave, vindictive with a dopple of mercy if deserved! The world of Anita Blake goes beyond the possibilites in fantasy. After reading her stories you may believe that you'd find Animators Inc. actually listed in the Yellow Pages! Circus of the Damned is powerhouse story and will leave wanting any circus in your past or future! I finished this in six hours because I couldn't leave the book without knowing just what was next in store for Anita, Richard her werewolf love interest, and Jean-Claude, the suave and debonair Vampire who loves Anita with all of his undead heart! It may sound an undoable storyline, but under Hamilton's pen it works beautifully!!"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"This is the third novel in a wonderfully fresh take on a somewhat tired genre. Imagine a petite female Spencer (cf. Robert Parker) turned loose in a world in which vampires, zombies, were-creatures, and ghouls really exist. Hamilton's originality and creativity even prompted her to have the Supreme Court recognize the constitutional rights of vampires, so that staking them is a crime. As with the first two novels, Circus of the Damned was one of those few books to which that the old cliche about &quot;not being able to put it down&quot; really applies. I stayed up until 1 AM the first night and then woke at 7 am to finish it. A fun combination of the vampire and female PI genres that really works. Although the violence is a little over the top, it is still highly recommended."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"While reading &quot;Guilty Pleasures,&quot; the first book in this series, I so enjoyed this author's writing style and the story that I ran out and purchased the next four books in the series. I just completed Circus of the Damned and it was as good as I would have expected. With this author, I'm not afraid of being disappointed. If you're even remotely interested in vampires and the supernatural, as well as a good suspenseful, and action-filled story, try this series of books."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"I've been trying not to judge this series to harshly, although I have not really liked anything in the first 3 books. The universe created by Hamilton is interesting. Voodoo is real, vampires have night clubs, zombies can be brought from the grave etc. etc.These books, although well imagined, feel like they've been written by a melodramatic, emo, 13 year old girl. Flipping through some of the later books (16? I don't know I really just grabbed one off the library shelf) it seems that our little emo chick starts to get into some crazy stuff. The series seems to spiral into nothing but porn.If you must, give it a try. If it were me, I would stick to Anne Rice for vampires and Jane Austen for interesting women.Twilight was better. seriously."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"I recommend that if you're reading the Anita Blake books you make sure and read this one before you go on to the next ones in the series, as it has some important explanations about what happens to Jean Claude's marks, and introduces a couple of new characters who play a big part in later books. And it's a DAMNED fine read!"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Not bad. I liked this one better than I did The Laughing Corpse.As far as the story went, I liked it just fine. It isn't one of my favorite books, by far, but the story wasn't bad. To be honest, I don't really like Anita. It isn't that the creation of Anita is bad, I just don't like who she is. I appreciate her loyalty and hard-working attitude, but I'm really over her \\"better than you\\" speeches and tackiness that she constantly exudes.I typed this review six times already, and I keep erasing it. The gist of it is there are a few things about Anita I just don't like, and it makes it hard for me to like her as a whole. While I like the overall story, I get tired of Anita always trying to piss people off, always being so angry, and always jumping on everyone's toes. Why should I, the reader, give a crap about an aggressive, self-righteous antagonistic person who acts like that? Just because she also works out with her friend and offers REAL coffee when someone comes over? It's hard to like the story, and most of the characters, but not the MAIN character."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Having led off with \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" and \\"The Laughing Corpse,\\" Laurell Hamilton has laid all the necessary groundwork to make this series work. In \\"Circus of the Damned\\" she builds on the previous to volumes give a fuller, and more frightening picture of an alternate earth where vampires, werewolves and other monsters are commonplace members of modern society.While helping the St. Louis Police investigate a pair of human murders carried out by an unknown vampire pack Anita Blake realizes that there is a new master vampire in the city. One that is intent on terrorizing the populace and challenging Jean-Claude as Master of the City. In a series of startling confrontations she finds out there are not one, but two such vampires. The first, Alejandro, was young when the Aztecs were spilling the blood of sacrifices. The other, Mr. Oliver, has roots that extend into time immemorial. Either vampire is powerful enough to challenge Jean-Claude, and neither has any intention of observing the uneasy truce between humans and the undead.In addition, Anita must deal with a Lamia, weresnakes, out-of-control zombies, and a whole host of vampires that are envious or opposed to her relationship with Jean-Claude. And Jean-Claude himself keeps pressuring her to take the third and fourth marks of the vampire, becoming his human servant. If dealing with all the really bad guys isn't hard enough, Anita has to deal with a new romantic interest, Richard Zeeman and an overly enthusiastic apprentice animator, Lawrence Kirkland. Did I mention Edward the assassin and a very large number of werewolves?When the conflict between the three masters come to a head, Anita finds that she has become one of the focuses for the battle to come. Not only Jean-Claude, but Alejandro as well, are intent on having her as human servant. Alejandro, however, has no intention of being polite, and is capable of forcing the role on Anita - the vampiric equivalent of rape. The story moves fluidly from scene to scene, building steadily to the inevitable and spectacular final showdown which has enough surprises to satiate even the most finicky reader.Hamilton has proven herself willing and able to handle complex plots and still keep her characters from becoming two dimensional. \\"Circus of the Damned\\" is no exception. All of the characters, from the illustrious Jean-Claude to the lowliest human servant come brilliantly to life. The effect is hypnotic, and I find Anita Blake stories too easy to read in one or two sessions, leaving me looking forward to her next book. With this, the third in the Anita Blake series, Laurell Hamilton fully demonstrates the strong writing skills that have made the vampie hunter a best-selling series."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"A friend introduced me to the first Anita Blake book, Gulity Pleasures, and I've been hooked ever since. Circus of the Damned, is a wonderful, violent, exciting and a real page turner and a hell of a bookWhat I really like in this series, is that Anita Blake get's stronger and stronger as a female character. Anita is everything you want in a hero, tough, sexy, and smart. Anita lives in a work of Werewolves, shapeshifters, vampires and zombies.In this book, Jean-Claude still wants Anita to be his human servent...the problem is that there is another vampire (who is very old and very powerful) who wants Anita for his human servant as well. Anita does the only thing she can...and I won't tell you what what is. If you want to find out what happens, you'll have to read it for yourself. :) I can promise you, you won't be sorry. One would think that 2 master (and powerful) vampires are enough for this book....but Anita has to battle aganist a giant snake!! I can't stress enough how good this book really is.Laurell K. Hamilton is a wonderful story teller who keeps the reader glued to the book with a wonderful style of action, suspence, humor and horror. Hamilton offers the reader a solid plot with many, many twists. Once you start reading Circus of the Damned, you'll have a hard time putting it down. If you start this book you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"After her great success in &quot;The Laughing Corpse,&quot; one of the finest horror novels I have ever read, Laurell K. Hamilton tries to reach the same heights again in &quot;Circus of the Damned,&quot; the third volume in the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series. For the first time the focus is primarily on the vampires, although Anita's job as an Animator has always been more accurate a description than Vampire Hunter. Once again she is the target of every character in the novel: Jean-Claude the Master Vampire of St. Louis wants to put his final two marks on Anita to make her his human servant, but so does Alejandro, an even older vampire who wants to take Jean-Claude's spot. On top of that there are two other master vampires in town this time around: Yasmeen, who simply wants to rip Anita's heart out, and Oliver, who wants to slaughter humans so that this nonsense about vampires having legal rights will come to an end. Meanwhile, over on the human side of the equation, the leaders of Humans First want to take out Anita for not helping them slay the Master, Edward is back wanting the name from Anita so he can do the same thing, Dolph wants her help in tracking down a pack of vampires that are killing humans, Bert wants her to train Larry Kinkaid the college student turned animator, and just to make things really interesting, Richard, the middle-school teacher who hangs out with Jean-Claude at the Circus of the Damned, wants to go out on a date with Anita where they spend the day spelunking.While we do find out a bit more about Anita's discovery that she is a necromancer and the issue of her being the human servant of a vampire is finally (?) resolved, the conclusion of &quot;Circus of the Damned&quot; is a bit too reminiscent of the climax of the previous Anita Blake novel. However, Hamilton scores points by continuing the exploring the &quot;real world&quot; implications of her America where vampires have legal rights and the characterization of Anita Blake continues to develop nicely. There is plenty of action and the book is not as gory as its predecessor, but is still one of those &quot;may be too intent for younger children&quot; type reads. Do not come here expecting Buffy."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"I had heard of the Anita Blake books, but never thought that I would read them. I like books about the supernatural, but I was going to be stubborn and stick to those that I had already read. But then my friend suggested them to me. Finally, I decided to buy the first one (Guilty Pleasures). I read it, liked it enough to buy the second book (the Laughing Corpse), but stopped halfway through it. Finally, a few days ago, I decided to finish it... and I cannot understand why I didn't finish it when I first started it. I was instantly caught in the story, and finished it instantly, and began with this one: Circus of the Damned. There is something strange about Laurell K. Hamilton that lures me to her. Anita Blake is not the flawless Buffy, and the books are not your standard vampire novel. They take place in the future-ish, where vampirism is legal. Anita is a short, sarcastic woman who fights vampires and raises zombies and sleeps with stuffed penguins. The way Laurell K. Hamilton writes is addicting, and hilarious. I find myself laughing at some parts.So try it. :)"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Zombie Queen, Necromancer, really didn't love Jean-Claude. At least, that's what she kept telling herself. But soon Jean-Claude is not the only vampire trying to make her his servant. There seems to be a bunch of Master Vampires and they ALL want to become Master of the City. To do that they have to find and kill Jean-Claude. Which means they need Anita to tell them where he is, whether she wants to or not!The undead battle is about to begin, with vampires, werewolves and even an immortal tossed in for the fun of it. Add Edward (and his lovely flamethrower) and you have the fight of the century. Winner take all. The only problem Anita has with all this is she seems to be First Prize.Lets get ready to rumble!"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton, Circus of the Damned (Berkley, 1995)This is the third installment of the long-running and wildly popular Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series. Hamilton assures us that the series changes somewhat after this in her afterword. I'm thinking that's a good thing, because at this point, it was starting to get into a rut.It's mostly the small stuff. It seems that Anita punctuates every piece of sarcasm with \\"Honestly.\\" or \\"Really.\\" here-- she did it before, but not, it seemed to me, to the extent she does it here. The cat-and-mouse games with Anita and Jean-Claude have just gotten boring-- there's no real progress, even when there seems to be. It's almost like the characters have no chemistry, despite both of them professing same constantly. Honestly, if this book lacked a plot, I'd have probably given up on the series right here.But a plot it has. There's a rogue pack of vampires loose in the city, and they're led by a master-- someone who might make a challenge for the leadership of the city, presently in Jean-Claude's hands. To complicate things, Anita meets a vampire whom she suspects of being infinitely older than either of the masters already on her plate. This one has goals that seem to be in line with Anita's-- and the only price he requests for his involvement in the situation is for Anita to hand him Jean-Claude's daytime resting place. Which, it seems, everyone and their mothers wants.As far as plots go, it's certainly not a bad one. It gets weighted down by the story's soap-opera aspects, but it's readable once Hamilton gets the ball rolling and starts throwing in the actual plot elements. I'm hoping the next one is back up to the standard set by the first two. ***"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"This third book in the Anita Blake series was a major disappointment after the first installment, \\"Guilty Pleasures\\".Admittedly, the character of Anita is still enjoyable to watch in action, and the writing style, first-person narrative from her perspective, is still enjoyable. But for one thing, the quality of the writing wasn't nearly as good as it was in the first book; I found as many sloppy errors in this book as I've come to expect in a mass-market paperback; this, after finding NONE in the first book. For another thing, there were numerous flaws in plot continuity; what ever happened to Edward's contract on the Master Vampire of the city, that suddenly, he's fighting with Anita on Jean-Claude's side, no questions asked? Was this just a case of Edward showing faith in Anita's judgement, and he'll get back to that later on? We're never given a clue.But the biggest problem I have with the plot is the concept of the super-master vampire, so old he's not even of homo sapiens stock; if a 1000 year old vampire is notably more powerful than a 500 year old, then a million-year-old vampire does NOT need any help from Anita to find and kill Jean Claude. He automatically knows the name, address, and zip code of every vampire on the continent. Nor can he be killed as easily as all that; if he can be killed at all, it ought to be at the end of an epic struggle. Further, if he CAN be killed that easily, he HAS to be smart enough not to put himself in that position; if he wasn't brighter than that, he'd have died about 985,000 years ago. At least.The book's fun, but not particularly good. A shame; I hope the rest of the series more closely resembles the first."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Looking back many years ago to when I was reading this book for the first time, I think this is the one that got me hooked. This is partly because of the love triangle that is introduced and partly because this is where the series hits it's stride. This installment, more than any other, has the perfect blend of romance and plot. This is one of my favorites in the series and after four or five rereads it's still highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Circus of The Damned, a book by Laurell K. Hamilton, and it rocks. This book is book #3 of the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter Series, telling the story about Ms. Blake, a legal Vampire Executioner, called by the Vampires: the Executioner.She is dancing with death, in between a Vampire War, due to her being the prenatural expert for the police. On one side of this war for St. Louis, is Jean Claude, the Master of the City, with a real bad thing for Anita. On the other is Alejandro, a Vampire from the Aztec era. Somewhere in between is Mr. Oliver, the Oldest living Vampire in the World, who looks and acts human, but is actually so old as to be from the Stone Age. Then enter Edward, aka Death, looking for the Master of the City. Edward is an assassin, who kills the 'monsters'. Anita is the only person that Edward knows, who knows who the Master of the City is, and Edward will do anything to get the information. The four meet on Halloween night, in the Circus of the Damned, to fight for the fate of St. Louis.Throw in a Lamia, a creature long since believed extinct, an animalistic Vampire, that feels no pain, crosses can't stop, and is going on a killing spree, a rogue group of Humans, trying to kill all, and any Vampires. We shouldn't forget to mention the rogue group of Vampires, who are going on a killing spree, and Richard, a mild mannered teacher, with some very strange friends. And you get a prelude to the disasterous meeting that is going to happen Halloween night.This book is a must read, for anyone who wants too know anything about Vampires. You don't need to read any of the others, but I strongly urge you too anyway. The Series is one of the Best in the Business, and this one is the best of the them all. I wouldn't suggest reading it, unless you have a couple of Hours to spare, because I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"To recap (for those who don't read every one of my reviews, because I've heard that there are a few of you out there) I really didn't like the first book, \\"Guilty Pleasures.\\" I thought that book two, \\"The Laughing Corpse\\" got a little better. This installment of the series seems to have finally hit some sort of stride. It is far from perfect, but I enjoyed this one more than the previous two.I felt that there were fewer things that came up out of nowhere (such as the Deus Ex Machina villain in book one) and I felt mostly satisfied with the characterization. I thought that the inclusion of a new Animator and an extremely ancient vampire were interesting. Overall, this novel seemed to flow better than the previous two.I did have a few problems with the book, however. The characters were drawn well, but their actions did not always seem consistent with previous books (didn't the bounty hunter still have a contract on the Master of the City?). Some things still seemed thrown in with no regard for plot (okay, so why was one of the new characters naked when we first meet him?). And I would still like a better analysis of the world this story is set in (what, exactly, are the first two marks? where did vamps come from? are they evil? if not, why do crosses burn them?).In short, this series does not seem to be terrible. It can kill some time and satisfy a vampire craving. However, don't expect the intelligence or depth of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or the intriguing ambiguity of Anne Rice. I don't know where the series will go from here, but so far it's kind of fun. Maybe not fun enough to get me to read the rest of them, but we'll see. :)"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"this is a great book... i think, even better than the laughing corpse, since the plot is believable and relevant to the whole story.bad news #1:this time it's a group of rogue vampires that is making a big, red, bloody splash around st. louis... and it's up to spook squad and anita to solve the crimesbad news #2:AND it directly involves jean-claude. not good... considering that anita is trying her best to avoid seeing him at all cost. silly girl if you ask me. and she's adamant not to be the human servant of jean-claude.bad news #3:*somebody* else is planning to do away with jean-claude - and wants anita to be *his* human servant instead!complications #1:mr. oliver - a very, very and i mean *very* powerful vampire, has his own perverse agendas...complications #2:a new love interest in the form of richard zeeman ... yummy? yes... problem free? no. just how blind can the girl possibly be? very, judging by the way the story goes...add in a couple of angry human mob, a freaking giant of a cobra, a possibly feral vampire and a vampire coup in-the-making, and you get the gist of what circus of the damned has to offer.personally, i find that this is a rather trying read. not so much because of the plot, which is excellent, but the way anita dances around the subject of jean-claude. hell, she knows that she can't resist him - at all - and she's trying to confuse the issue with richard. i think in this particular novel, we can see how she won't admit that there's more than just lust between jean-claude and her... but noooo... she had to be real obstuse about it all.other than her vacillations, the plot is tightly executed and the characters well developed. although i think to a certain extend the baddies are quite cliched stereotypes of hell-bent-world-dominating types... not really original if you ask me.as usual the writing's not that evenly paced. a bit slow in th beginning and only interesting about half the way through the book... geez, i seem to say this in every book of hers (lkh) that i've read...and the spook squad? you just gotta love them!all in all this is a good read, i think mucho better than lunatic cafe... but please read the previous books so that you'll be able to appreciate this book better."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Anita is getting better and better. This is exciting reading but if you do not like snakes, look elsewhere. They even grossed Anita out. This is a 'cannot put down' book.

I forced myself through books 1-3 hoping it would get better but have not been able to pick it back up again even though I bought them all! I don't like the way Anita Blake is described physically with cuts all over her body, she almost seems mutated. Her attire seems outdated and frumpy and I don't feel what lure she could have to the master vampire. Bottom line is that I have not been able to connect with her character. Soon, I'll run out of books on my reader and I'm hoping when I pick up the next book in this series and I'll be hooked. I love a book that I can't put down and unfortunately this series hasn't shown me one yet."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Anita goes back to her love-hate relationship with Jean Claude in this third installment.

So it's extra good. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Having read the first and second in the series, I realized I could not give a review of the second because I was so bored I forgot the whole book, so thought I would skip to the third which I just finished. I did enjoy the first book to some degree, can't remember the second only having finished it last week, and I found the third book very slow to get through. It just didn't grab me. Again, I like the mix of characters, but do find Anita Blake way too over the top and unrealistic. Even with the most fantastic of characters in the fantasy genre, there is always something you can relate to, a touch of humanity that makes the character believable. With Anita Blake, she's made to be almost untouchable. A 24/25 year old that is THAT tough? I don't think so. She comes across as idiotic sometimes. And the attitude she has is ridiculous. Hell, even if she cried once in a while, one could relate to her on some level and accept that as part of her character without her being weak. And in this book, I found the character annoying and boring. I found the character of Edward annoying.I don't understand why the author needs to cut the chapters up so quickly either. I almost lost track of the plot at one stage because the chapter stopped and the next one started with Anita taking a phone call, and then that stopped and the next chapter started with her having a conversation with her friend Ronnie, whom I had completely forgotten about and had to go back and read it over again to see where she came from.Not the best of writing. Again, the characters and story gets you in to some degree, but if you're looking for top notch writing, this fails. If you want to be entertained somewhat and like vampires, this will get you by."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"\\"Your questions will make something simple last all...day.\\"Just three books in, and already we can see a pattern forming. Dudes come to Anita to have her do something; she says, in no uncertain terms, \\"No\\". Dolph calls her to investigate a murder; it ends up being the weirdest, most unusual murder Anita has ever seen. Jean-Claude makes the moves on her; Anita tells him to F@#$ off. Anita does minor investigating, bad guys come out of the woodworks to try to kill her, Anita is rude and sarcastic to a bunch of people, and suddenly Anita is fighting off the Most Powerful *FILL*IN*THE*BLANK*.This book is no different. Some Human First members want Anita to rat out Jean-Claude; she refuses. She is called to a murder scene; the victim has been bitten to death by 5 or more vampires. Back to Jean-Claude where she and he fight like cats and dogs. FIGHT SCENE! Then Anita is racing off to her \\"night job\\". FIGHT SCENE! Bad guys try to kill her, Anita stumbles onto some new vampires, and before you know it, the city is about to be turned upside down by a 1million year old vampire--the oldest EVAH.I'm rather torn about this book. There are actually things I like. Anita values her independence and free will and does NOT like Jean-Claude's stalker-ish behavior. The book is pretty fast-paced, and if you don't go in expecting Anita to do much investigating (pretty much everything just falls into her lap--how nice!), it's pretty exciting. It's also nice to have some action scenes, instead of many, many kissy-kissy scenes we see in vampire books. And, oddly enough, I actually LIKED Richard and Anita's cute meet (though I have heard tons about how THAT ends up...and it makes me sad :( ).But there are oh, so many things that drives me nuts about these books.1. Anita Blake. God, this is an unlikable woman! I can only take so much of this, \\"I am better than everyone else, even though I am ONLY 24 years old and have been in the business a whopping THREE years\\". Half the time, she sounds like a petulant child, bragging about how many toys (guns) she has and how well she can use them or telling someone to f@#$ off (and she does the latter A LOT). Or bullying around with the police (who should be fired for all the sexual harassment!). The other half of the time, she sounds like a 40 year old woman, coaching someone who is ONLY FOUR YEARS YOUNGER THAN HER and calling him \\"kiddo\\".2. Action Scenes. Is it possible to have too many? When you forget what was going on and what the plot was, yes. This happened to me frequently. Why the big fight at Circus of the Damned with the Snake? Why did the vampires reveal themselves to Anita (when she had NO IDEA who they were before) at the cemetery with Larry? Why was Anita so easily duped into driving an hour into the boonies only to be chased into a cave where the vamps try to kill her? Isn't this supposed to be Anita, the most awesome, kick-@ss Vampire Hunter in the Mid-West?3. Clothing. Every person has to have a run-down of what they are wearing. And not just once; no, we have to know what EVERYONE is wearing at any time. So when Anita changes, you hear about it. When Jean-Claude is on the scene, expect at least a paragraph or two on his frilly shirt.4. CTRL+C -> CTRL+P. New \\"characters\\" have nearly the same description as old ones. St. Louis must have the highest population of beefy, muscular men who lift weights, because, I swear, it seemed not a page went by before Anita mentioned how muscular so-and-so was and how he must lift weights.5. TMI. In case you were ever curious what exercise routine Anita and Ronnie do when they hit the gym, don't worry. LKH will let you know what machines they start at, who is best at what (Anita is better at arms, Ronnie with legs), and when they do cardio. Just what I open a Vampire novel to read. NOT.6. Super-powered villains. For once, couldn't Anita just defeat a troup of vampires, instead of a showdown between her and the Most Awesome, 1 Million Year Old Vampire? What about a voodoo practitioner instead of The Best Voodoo Practitioner in Missouri? I have no idea how all these super powered beings keep coming to St. Louis (not the biggest city in the US) and just throw themselves in front of Anita's Browning.Okay, so that was a lot of complaining. This book wasn't horrible. It was okay, it's just that after reading three Anita books in a row, I'm burned out. I think I need a break before I attempt to tackle Book 4 (if I want to at all--I am beginning to think this series is just not my cup of tea). Certainly not the worst out there, but I've read better too.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"The third installment of the Anita Blake series,is one of the best, in my opinion. It has a little of everything, suspence, horror, mystery, romance. You definatley should read this series in order, as each book builds from the last. This one, not only builds on the Jean-Claude character, which we all love, but introduces a new love interest for Anita. The triangle is forming, the horror is getting more horrific, and Anita is as tuff as ever. Love her style.

I'm on the 4th of the first 9 which I ordered all at once since I like to start with a character and follow her/him, and I'm rolling right through them. My only complaint is that the author could use a good proofreader and continuity checker, something you'd expect from a \\"New York Times bestselling author\\". I'm getting irritated with constant spelling and grammatical errors, but decided to do a review when I had to backtrack in this book about Anita's car. There's a serious need for continuity checking when her car is totaled in chapter 25, then in chapter 28 she drives to a vamp meeting with no mention of where she got a car, she them bums rides with an animator-in-training for several chapters, she gets kidnapped, etc., etc. (and in book 4 has a new Jeep). Sorry, but nobody in St. Louis with three cents to their name would go 12 hours without wheels, let alone an always-prepared slayer. With any luck, these errors are minimized in later books."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"In this, the third volume in the Anita Blake, vampire hunter, series of books, the author does not disappoint the reader. Anita, our intrepid vampire hunter, is once again called upon by the St. Louis police to assist with some unusual murders. It appears that someone or something is killing humans in the city, and it appears that it may be a renegade pack of vampires that is doing so, hell bent on challenging the power of Jean Claude, the vampire that reigns supreme as Master of the City.Moreover, Anita is footloose and fancy free, notwithstanding her attraction to the Master of the City, when she meets Richard Zeeman, a hunky junior high school science teacher. The only thing is that Richard has a secret that may impact on how Anita may feel about him. Their budding romance, however, is never the focal point of the story. Rather, it is a sustaining and tantalizing backdrop to the adventures of Anita, as our feisty, tough talking heroine tries to save the city of St. Louis from a fate worse than death.Once again, the author holds the readers' interest with her richly detailed alternate universe, where vampires, werewolves, zombies, and other monsters are part of the landscape and live side by side with humans in a somewhat uneasy alliance. The plot is fully fleshed, as are most of the characters, and the dialogue is crisp and snappy. This is a fun, fast-paced series of books, and I look forward to reading each and every one!"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"I found this book to be one of the best in the Anita Blake series.

I admire her struggle to maintain her ethics AND stay alive. She is afraid but goes ahead any way she can to get the job done - even if it means defending those who are or were enemies. I've read the entire series several times since I first discovered her last fall. I admire her fortitude and persistence. I didn't even LIKE vampire books until I took a chance on a recommendation from a book club. I guess to &quot;sum up&quot; Anita's adventures it would be: Never a dull moment.

Obviously one has to suspend a lot of disbelief - Anita beats a lot of baddies who are bigger than her - but Ms Hamilton writes will enough to persuade you to do this. These are great stories of the supernatural and magic, which move at a fast pace - none of your languid Anne Rice-style eroticism here. But then, this is what makes them entertaining. The other thing that lifts this series above the ordinary is the characters, which are well-drawn, and appealing. It's nice to read stories populated by people with feelings.

Anita is portrayed pretty vividly, and it's clear that she makes some pretty tough choices as she goes along.

Jean-Claude shows his heart. More kick-butt action from Anita. More murders, although the actual investigation scene wasn't as graphic as hunting down the animalistic vampire. Anita meets two more master vampires, both older than Nikolaos from Guilty Pleasures. She agress w/Mr. Oliver, the older master of the two, when he requests that she give up the name of the Master of the City so he can take over and reverse the legislation that legalizes vampires. He wants it back to survival-of-the-fitest becasue he strongly believes that the legalization of vampires will lead to extinction of humans. Anita accepts a date w/Richard however is poisoned. I don't want to give away any more but in this book Richard tells Anita that he believes Jean-Claude loves her and that he wishes her love in return. She denies it at first then admits that in some dark corner of her heart she might love him after all. But the fact that he is the living dead she refuses to believe it. She, however, starts to wonder how undead he really is, being that vampires are not supposed to have a soul or a reflection - yet Jean-Claude has a reflection.

Hamilton's Vampire Hunter novels, discovers in \\"Circus of the Damned\\" that she is a full fledged necromancer, as well as an animator and vampire slayer. She is truly a woman of many talents. Anita's boss contracted her out as paranormal advisor to the police's Regional Preternatural Investigation Team. Her friend and colleague, Detective Sergeant Rudolf \\"Dolph\\" Storr, contacts her, as the novel opens, to inform her that a dead body has been found - the first of many. After she examines the gruesome corpse, her worst fears are realized. The man had been brutally murdered, by multiple vampires. Apparently a rogue Master Vampire and pack members are on the loose in St. Louis, because rogues are the only kind of vampires who kill in numbers.It should not be possible for a rogue and pack to be operating in the city. Vampire extraordinaire, Jean-Claude, the charismatic Master of the City of St. Louis, should be aware and in charge of whatever undead creature enters his domain. Unfortunately, Jean-Claude, powerful as he is, is new to the job and is having difficulties asserting himself in his new position. Others are disputing his claims and vying for his title as city leader. Jean-Claude is a capitalist entrepreneur vampire, and owns the vampire strip club, Guilty Pleasures, the vamp comedy club, The Laughing Corpse, and also a circus called, Circus of the Damned, which features, amongst other acts: The Skinless Man, a voodoo ceremony with zombies rising from open graves, clowns from the other world, and snake charmer, Shahar, who works with the world's largest cobra - and boy (!) this baby is huge!! Perhaps if Jean-Claude didn't have his fingers in so many pies, he could better protect his primary job title.Anyway, Alejandro, the rogue vampire, happens to be the world's oldest creature and the most powerful one Anita has ever faced. He wants Anita to be his human servant so he can use her powers to help him gain control of..., well...everything. Jean-Claude, who has the hots for Anita, has given her a bite or two - just enough to make her 'almost' his own. However, he prefers to seduce Anita, not to force her. Anita thinks Jean-Claude is pretty cool too - but wants nothing to do with him because she doesn't want anyone, or anything, to have control over her. In other words, she prefers her men to be alive. So while these two undead studs are duking it out over the lovely lady and the St. Louis turf, she gets kidnapped by a lamia and cohorts, and taken to an underground cave where she fights for her life; struggles with a radical group of right wing activists who want to murder all vampires and undead creatures - even the innocent ones; continues to raise five zombies per night for her demanding boss, while training a new employee; begins dating the oh-so-handsome, and very nice, Richard Zeeman, a science teacher with a terrible secret, etc.. The novel culminates with a fabulous gang war scene in the middle of the circus - giving new meaning to the words \\"Live Entertainment!!\\"Laurell Hamilton just keeps getting better. Her characters are what makes this series so special. Anita is the author's secret weapon. This gal has attitude with a capital \\"A.\\" Her wit is wry and she is a major cynic with a tender heart. She is a feisty, attractive and independent 21st century lady who is as good at raising the dead as she is at slaying the undead. Ms. Blake's sense of morality is unique. No matter what the perks are, she refuses to become a monster - or even the human servant of a very sexy vampire who has fairly liberal ideas where women are concerned. She will never give up a human to a vampire, no matter what the crime. She'll never leave a man, or woman, behind. And she won't date corpses. Hamilton's minor characters are fantastic also - in every sense of the word. The humor, dark as it is, never falls flat. The narrative is well written and fast paced. I highly recommend this book, but it will be more enjoyable if you begin by reading the first two episodes, \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" and \\"The Laughing Corpse.\\"JANA"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Everyone else has given you a run down of the plot, so I'll skip that. This is an entertaining read. But to be honest, I'm just holding out for the \\"gratuitous\\" sex in the future novels that everyone complains about. These first few books are so void of sex and anything romantic, I'd guess Anita is a lesbian. Seriously. Besides the author's refusal to allow Anita to be attracted to, date, or even kiss a male, she repeats the same nerve-grating phrases, such as but not limited to: Nike Airs, Nike swoosh, bully for me, bully for him, Browning, Browning, Browning >:\\\\ Can Jean-Claude please wear something other than lace? And Anita wears printed sweatshirts, jeans, Nikes, and a fanny pack and somehow we are supposed to believe that a hundreds-of-years-old vampire is attracted to her?

The mystery took a back seat to vampire politics and people wanting to kill Anita. These books are completely character based, which I don't mind, but the character in this installment didn't shine for me. First, we have numerous vampires trying to make Anita their human servants without her permission. Jean Cleaude saves Anita again for a price she isn't happy with, and she complains about it numerous times. I felt for her, and understood her objections, so it was tolerable. But add into the mix a large group of vampires and snake creatures trying to kill Anita for a barely understandable reason and I get a bit irritated. The final showdown at the end of the book was great, and I enjoyed it more than any other part of this book. Other than that, I just didn't feel connected to the events happening in the story. All of the new characters/bad guys introduced were flat and not interesting at all. Having read the 11th book and on before these books I have a feeling I'm not going to like the next book, Lunatic Cafe, which focuses on Richard and Anita's relationship. Overall, I'm pleased with these books, they are gory and tough and nails with interesting main characters. I'm not so happy with the mediocre mysteries that seemed crammed in to satisfy the fact that these are supposed to be mystery novels."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"In this, the third volume in the Anita Blake, vampire hunter, series of books, the author does not disappoint the reader. Anita, our intrepid vampire hunter, is once again called upon by the St. Louis police to assist with some unusual murders. It appears that someone or something is killing humans in the city, and it appears that it may be a renegade pack of vampires that is doing so, hell bent on challenging the power of Jean Claude, the vampire that reigns supreme as Master of the City.Moreover, Anita is footloose and fancy free, notwithstanding her attraction to the Master of the City, when she meets Richard Zeeman, a hunky junior high school science teacher. The only thing is that Richard has a secret that may impact on how Anita may feel about him. Their budding romance, however, is never the focal point of the story. Rather, it is a sustaining and tantalizing backdrop to the adventures of Anita, as our feisty, tough talking heroine tries to save the city of St. Louis from a fate worse than death.Once again, the author holds the readers' interest with her richly detailed alternate universe, where vampires, werewolves, zombies, and other monsters are part of the landscape and live side by side with humans in a somewhat uneasy alliance. The plot is fully fleshed, as are most of the characters, and the dialogue is crisp and snappy. This is a fun, fast-paced series of books, and I look forward to reading each and every one!"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"I've become addicted to this series! Laurell K. Hamilton knows how to keep you turning the pages all the way to its staggering conclusion. Circus of the Damned is the third part of the Anita Blake series and the best one thus far. A pack of vampires has murdered several people. Anita has to figure out who is in charge of the crimes. What ensues is a battle between various vampire masters who want to replace Jean-Claude as the Master of the City, and Anita is right in the middle of said battle. Jean-Claude and Alejandro want her as a human servant. She has to choose between the two -- something she isn't prepared to do...Circus of the Damned, like the first two novels, is action-packed from beginning to end. Hamilton does not allow any breathing room between the horror scenes. Her novels are riveting and suspenseful from beginning to end. What I like most about this novel is the progress, however small, between Anita and Jean-Claude. Anita has reluctantly caved to Jean-Claude's charms a bit. I love Jean-Claude! He is a great character -- mysterious, complex, sensual. The reader also gets a glimpse of erotica in this offering. The building of tension is second to none. The action, horror and suspense aspects are better than ever. I recommend this series and I cannot wait to start on the next one."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Anita Blake has a full time job animating zombies (to serve as witnesses, finalize their estates, or comfort families), but she can't escape her part-time job as paranormal advisor to the police and vampire hunter. When she gets a police call about a murder, she suspects vampires--but the scene of the crime reveals something much worse--multiple vampires attacked. It can only mean one thing--a rogue master vampire and his servants is loose in St. Louis. And a vampire pack requires frequent feedings. Anita knows that the killing will be only the first in a series--unless she can stop it.The thing is, a rogue master vampire should be impossible. Jean-Claude is master of the city and no master vampire should be able to enter his domain without his being aware of it. But the invader isn't some weak and fresh corpse--he's the oldest, most powerful, and deadliest vampire Anita has ever faced. And he's intent on ending the current rules that treat vampires as citizens--even though it means he'll have to overthrow Jean-Claude first.Anita faces a dilemma. Jean-Claude is gradually turning Anita into his human servant--something she doesn't want despite the sexual feelings she has for Jean-Claude. But does she fear him enough to turn him over to his enemies? Complicating her feelings toward Jean-Claude, Anita meets Richard--a too-good-looking science teacher with a secret and an obvious desire to date Anita. Then there's her fellow vampire killer, Edward who just might have to kill Anita to get at Jean-Claude. The poor girl isn't having much luck with her love life.CIRCUS OF THE DAMNED is an early novel in the Anita Blake series. In CIRCUS, the lines between good and evil are faded, but they still exist. Vampires are evil and must be killed. Some can become temporary allies, but they can never be trusted. And Anita dare not put herself in any vampire's power--even if the alternative is her death. Although CIRCUS is sensual, it lacks the outright sexual orientation of more recent Anita Blake stories.Author Laurell K. Hamilton always writes compelling action and CIRCUS shows the young Anita as she battles through waves of vampires, vampire-hating fundamentalists, and snake people. It's exciting and compelling stuff with just enough sexuality to entice the reader and make us wish for more."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"i read this book because a friend of mine had bought it but had not gotten around to reading it, so i did. i'll start with the bad things. It was way to much action. It seemed like it was just one big action scene after another. if your an action guy then this is a good book for you. if on the other hand you like your books with a little more depth and insight, then this would be a wasteful read. it also doesn't have a lot of character analysis and you dont have any sympathy or empathy for any of the characters. The ending was bit cheesy as well. It was unreal and it could have been played out better. Plus the author writes vamire lore to her liking to go along with the story, not with what is more widely known.What i can say for the plus side is that i was into the story and couldn't put it down (i finished it in 2 days and missed a days worth of classes.) the action scenes were well written as well and the author is very descriptive.i personally think that it would have been better if the book was longer so that we could get to know Anita Blake and the people invovled in her lives a little better. also it would allow a little breathing time between the action scenes. again, if you like action then buy it. it just wasn't in my taste of books."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"I usually reserve four stars for items that I truly love that lack the fine sheen of perfection, but I found myself no choice but to give this four stars even though it is not a favorite of mine. I gave the first two books in this series three stars, they were average, sometimes enjoyable, but I never found them truly involving. At a friend's insistence I continued on through the third book, and although there are some major plot holes here and there, there were truly gripping moments for the first time in the series. The undauntable vampire slayer/necromancer finds herself going up against the oldest vampire she's ever faced, dancing around the edges of romance, and still warning off the master vampire that wants her as a servant and/or lover. In the mix are strange serpentine creatures and werewolves and lots of bloody battles. The conflicts in this book, while hardly believable since they all include vampires, werewolves, and shapeshifters, are still compelling and sympathetically written. The plot holes, while sometimes jarring, are kept to the details (Blake wrecks her car, but then is driving around the next day and only later is it revealed where she got a car). Still, this is better than either of the two prior books and deserves higher marks although I will admit that reading the other two books is necessary since the relationships do develop over time."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"If I could give 3 and a half stars, I would. With the exception of the spelling and grammatical errors and the way-too-quick ending, this was a very enjoyable read. A million-year-old vampire??? Please! But the rest of the book was good enough for me to overlook those problems. Finally, Anita is developing real relationships with other characters, both with friends and possible lovers. The action is fast and the body count is high. Hamilton's world is shaping up nicely and I'm looking forward to book # 4, THE LUNATIC CAFE, which I hear is one of the best."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"While i enjoyed Guilty Pleasures and Laughing Corpse, this book, which is the third Anita Blake adventure, is what really got me hooked onto the series.The book starts off as usual, with some suspects and gruesome crimes, then really gets the ball rolling in non stop action with our favorite heroine.The action/adventure scenes are great, the dialogue funny, and the new characters introduced are all sparked with flavor. The ending battle royale in this book is truly an awe to read and makes you crave for the next novel that much more.This is easily on of Hamiltons best books and is one of the top supernatural/fantasy/horror ones out there too, so do yourself a favor and pick it up."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"As I compulsively read one more Anita Blake story, I tried to analyze what makes them so fascinating?

Imagine yourself floundering though a totally dark cave with an ancient lamia (snake/woman combo) and three vampires after you.The gore in the second book repelled me, but this time the descriptions of mayhem seemed more focused on the action and didn't wallow quite as much in blood (or maybe I'm just getting used to it).Whatever... Laurell Hamilton sure has fashioned a world that grabs the reader.

Anita is an expert on the paranormal. As a necromancer and licensed vampire hunter, she raising the dead and kicks vampire butt for a living. Circus of the Damned combines elements of supernatural and detective fiction and continues the story down the same lines as Hamilton's first 2 novels.

I am so glad I did because it is th best vampire series written in my opinion.. the characters are strong and have personality. It is like buffy the vampire slayer growm up...amd guys the sex written is pretty damn hot and awesome..if you don't like it or are weired out by it... thats just sad cause you don't know what good sex is like.

In Anita's world vampires have recently gained legal recognition as being alive through a Supreme Court decision. They are not quite citizens, but you are not allowed to kill them on sight anymore either. The Circus of the Damned is a creepy tourist attraction staffed with real vampires and shape shifters that is owned by a master vampire named Jean-Claude who also owns a strip club where the more beautiful vampires and shape shifters entertain human audiences. It's a combination of gainful employment for the otherwise unemployable and pragmatic entrepreneurship from a man/vampire who understands how to build a power base. The Circus really highlights the human qualities and the non-human differences that make up the preternatural culture and it starts to move Anita's vision of the battle between good and evil from black and white to shades of gray. Yet it's more about the characters than it is about themes. This is the book where Jean Claude learns the hard way how not to court a vampire hunter, and it also introduces Richard Zeeman who is Anita's other love interest and the \\"boyscout\\" to Jean-Claude's tragic flawed hero."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"This author was suggested to me by a friend.

Who said that the life of a necromancer was meant to be easy?As if having the master of the city panting after you isn't bad enough, Anita Blake finds herself the object of Alejandro's attention, a dangerous vampire who makes it clear that he wants her to be his human servant. Unfortunately for her it doesn't stop there. With her suitor Jean-Claude still fresh in his position, another powerful vampire wants to dethrone him and assume power over the city. With his desire for Anita widely-known in the vampire community, she is caught in the battle of the undead, where the finale takes place at the Circus of the Damned in front of unsuspecting humans. To quote our heroine, she would be flattered if only her life weren't at stake.CIRCUS OF THE DAMNED is another enthralling and fast-paced novel. It is filled with interesting and well-rounded characters that all contribute to the mayhem, excitement and gore that makes up the roller-coaster world of Anita Blake. Hamilton certainly knows how to build up the adrenaline as seen in Anita's adventures, from her meeting with a Lamia (half-human, half-snake), encounter with werewolves and introduction to the newest animator and aspiring vampire-hunter, Larry Kirkland. Edward, the ruthless bounty hunter, is also back and we know how scary the man is. Then there is the sexy Richard Zeeman who will be part of the love triangle in future books. However, the best thing about this book is the showdown in the circus ring.

That would have been more than enough for me, but I was surprised by a book that is even better than \\"The Laughing Corpse\\". Anita, the animator / vampire slayer / necromancer, returns in a fast-paced, riveting thriller that does not let the reader go, not even for a second. For those fans of the series, you will even find some new elements in this book, like a new creature called lumia, but I will let you find out for yourself what its \\"features\\" are.After some rowdy encounters in the last episode, Anita finds herself contacted by Inger and Mr. Reubens, two former human against vampires (HAV) members who are now part of a more radical group. In the eve of a new era, where the legislators are considering giving vampires the right to vote, Reubens and Inger are looking to kill every vampire in USA, starting with the master of the city. Naturally, the master of the city is none other than Jean-Claude, the vampire who has marked Anita twice and only needs two more marks to convert her in his human servant. Anita refuses to help the former HAV members and as usual will face unorthodox persuasion methods. In the midst of this problem and in her capacity of police advisor on vampires, zombies and the like, Anita is faced with a murder victim that shows fang marks from several different vampires. This is a clear indication that there is a rogue master vampire on the loose and that he is extremely dangerous. There are a couple of vampires that fit the \\"description\\", including Jean-Claude and Malcolm, but there also are new guys in town!There are a lot of connections to previous events in the series, and even though certain explanations are given to allow those the are encountering Anita for the first time to follow the story, it is much better if the reader is familiar with what happened in the past: Nikolaos, Phillip, Edward, Jean-Claude and the marks he gave Anita, etc. Compared to the previous books, I found that this one has more humorous moments and sexual tension, while maintaining the level of action and gore. For those that like vampire stories this is a series that you cannot afford to miss."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"\\"Circus of the Damned\\" is the third book in Laurell Hamilton's \\"Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter\\" series, about a young woman who has a full time job raising zombies form the dead, and a part time job killing vampires. It follows \\"The Laughing Corpse\\" and has her squaring off against 3 \\"Master\\" vampires.I have read the first Anita Blake novel and bought this by mistake, thinking it was the second book in the series. While I recommend reading the first novel, \\"Guilty Pleasures,\\" you can then move straight into this book, as I was able to follow along easily and appear not to have missed anything. Like with the first book, I felt very awkward reading this. It is basically a \\"vampire romance\\" novel, in that there is a lot of subtle talk about sex, and a lot of male Fabio-type vampires running around with their shirts off. Hamilton loves to talk about how Vampire nipples. After my third nipple reference, it became clear that as a male, I am probably the wrong demographic these novels are targeted at.Nevertheless, the novel is a quick read and can be entertaining if you can get over the incredibly annoying use of the first person narrator. I got so sick of Anita's comments and having her every thought vocalized. How many times does she have to say \\"Bully for me,\\" \\"gag me with a spoon,\\" and \\"point for him?\\" It gets real old after the third or fourth chapter. My other big complaint was that this book needs a new editor. It wasn't loaded with mistakes, but I found at least 6 or 7 pretty glaring grammatical or spelling errors. There is no reason why a published novel that has an editor should misspell \\"too\\" as \\"to\\" or leave out entire words in sentences by mistake.Lastly, the book is a quick read and was pretty action-packed, so I will probably read a few others in the series, provided my guilt at reading a book described on the cover as \\"filled with erotic chills\\" can be overcome."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"\\"Circus of the Damned\\" by Laurell K. Hamilton is the third book in the Anita Blake - Vampire Hunter series, and it is a fantastic read. The action never stops, and the reader is utterly absorbed into Anita's weird world of vampires, werewolves, and zombies. Though not for the faint of heart, this addictive series will have readers applauding Laurell K. Hamilton and craving much more of Anita Blake.In \\"Circus of the Damned\\", Anita, tough-as-nails necromancer and vampire executioner is called in by the police to investigate a murder, seemingly perpetrated by vampires. After examining the body, Anita is sure that there is a rogue master vampire and at least four of his followers in the area, who are responsible for this murder. This means that there will be a new victim each night until these murderous vampires can be stopped.In attempt to find out who these vampires are, Anita ends months of careful avoidance by asking to meet with Jean-Claude, the incredibly sexy Master Vampire of the City. Anita meets with Jean-Claude at one of his businesses, the Circus of the Damned, where she ends up having to fight off a perverted master vampire, an enraged human servant, and a giant cobra gone berserk. What a night! And what a lot of fun to read!In this book Anita is still fighting against Jean-Claude's affections (silly, silly girl) and meets a new love interest, Richard Zeeman, a Junior High science teacher and werewolf.In addition to everything else going on in her life, Anita must also train an eager and naive new animator named Larry Kirkland (and keep him alive), and deal with a bunch of right-wing fruitcakes from a violent new anti-vampire group. As you can see, Anita's adventures never stop, and Hamilton expertly ties all the threads together in a coherent and enjoyable way.Anita's chilling encounters with the rogue vampires are full of heart-pounding suspense, and the thrilling final showdown will have every reader on the edge of his/her seat - guaranteed.\\"Circus of the Damned\\" is tons of suspenseful fun, and is the ideal book for those days when you just need to get away from everything for a few hours. With a story that grabs you by the throat and won't let go and vivid and compelling characters at every turn, this book is irresistible. So don't miss out, buy this book today and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"The Anita Blake series is truly addictive (it even managed to snare a friend who pooh-poohed the rest of us for years). Circus of the Damned has a lot of great action and introduces some new characters and plot elements, but it has one very annoying timing flaw I wish they'd correct. At one point Anita's car is wrecked, totalled. She then drives out to a meeting (and makes a special point of it, since she is characteristically--and rightfully--paranoid about riding with someone else) then back to the office to talk with her boss. It's only later that night (and several chapters further) that she explains that there'd been no time to rent a car and that they'd had to use Larry's to make her work appointments-- leaving us with the question, what on earth was she driving all that day? This should never had made it past the editor. It would be fairly easy to correct, and I'd hoped they would do so before reissuing it in paperback and book club editions, but no such luck. In a series with relatively few and minor inconsistencies, some of which can be forgiven as the characters and plot matures, this one annoys me every time I read it. Otherwise, it's a great read, good bad guys, good action, etc. It's not my favourite in the series, but it has some of the best pageantry and sets up the rest of the storyline. Besides, how can you go wrong with giant and/or seductive snakes?"},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"This is the last book of the Anita Blake series i have read as of this review (need to order the rest :o ) but i can safely say that this series is a winner. Each book so far has carried the series' plot forward, while at the same time you could pick one up and read it in any order, as they can almost be called separate books in a greater story line, much like the New Jedi Order books where for that series.Not too long in length, this is a good book, and a quick read. i would recommend reading this in a place where you can focus on it, and wont be distracted. The first book i picked up (was the second book of the series, whoops!) i read on an airplane. i would imagine a long bus ride or other form of long travel it would be good for as well.The only down side i personally find with this book, and the others of the Anita Blake series, is that i want to go and read them all after finishing one. Well, i guess thats not a bad thing, per say.Last comment, as i have read now three of the series' books you could well call me a fan. If you are looking for a completely objective review, i suggest you take this one with a grain of salt..."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Anita Blake returns in this third installment of her well-known series. The police call Anita to consult on a murder and she quickly detects that the victim had been attacked by five vampires, mostly like a master and his pack. Since the few masters resident in St. Louis don't seem likely to have committed the crime, Anita starts looking for newcomers, but they just might find her first. As if this isn't enough, she receives a visit from her old friend Edward, the master assassin, who threatens to kill her if she doesn't reveal the name and resting place of the city's Master Vampire. All of this is just the start for Anita as she struggles to save the city, and herself, from a threat more ancient than anything she's ever faced before.Circus of the Damned returns the focus to vampires and their politics after the voodoo detour of The Laughing Corpse. Jean-Claude, the city's Master Vampire, has given Anita two marks out of four toward becoming his human servant and very much wants her to accept the last two. Her refusal to do so is hurting is position among other vampires in the city. Other masters have come to the city ready to challenge Jean-Claude and try to woo Anita into joining their cause. Anita has to choose where her loyalties lie.The major strength of this book shows in the action scenes. They take up a significant portion of the book and are uniformly suspenseful, even gripping at times. Anita lives in a very dangerous world and the author does an excellent job of portraying this. The weakest portion of the novel shows up whenever there is a conversation or Anita's narration includes her own thoughts. If Anita is talking to the police, they basically have the same conversation every time they meet at a crime scene. If she speaks to Jean-Claude, she has the same conversation every time. Even her own thoughts take on the exact same form over and over again.After enjoyingGuilty Pleasures (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter), I was disappointed byThe Laughing Corpse (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter: Book 2). I was hoping that Circus of the Damned would be a tie breaker of sorts to see if I would keep reading more or not. This is certainly a more entertaining book than The Laughing Corpse and provided a welcome return back to vampires as the chief villains. Unfortunately, Laurell Hamilton's writing style has grown so stale and clich&eacute; for me that I don't have the desire to go any further with Anita Blake. These books all read like a poor imitation of Dashiell Hammett and the style never grows or varies in the slightest. I'm glad I bought this book because it ties up all the loose ends from the prior two books, but there's nothing here compelling enough to make me want to keep coming back for more."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"I think the reason that I liked this book best so far of the series, which I'm reading in order, is that Hamilton spent less time describing the most gory crime scenes imaginable and MORE time on characters.However, I've begun to notice that she recycles her descriptions of things, such as Jean Claude, Edward, Irving, Luther. The words she uses to describe these people, even Ronnie, her best friend...are all the exact phrases/words used in the first of this series. I like having characters that go from book to book in the series, but, I think that as Anita grows/changes, so should the writer. I'm SURE Laurell K. Hamilton could give these characters new, different, fresher descriptions instead of pasting in the old, tired ones.. I mean, what about those of us who are reading each book....why bore us? We're your target audience, the repeat buyer!However, I enjoyed Richard in this one, but still can't figure out why Anita never asked why he was naked in Jean Claude's bed the first time she sees him. I'd need the answer to that before I went out with a guy.Better character development here....MUCH better than her last, the Laughing Corpse. That book was horrible. Just all about how many disgusting, gory scenes Ms. Hamilton could write. Ok, give us the violence, but ya gotta have character and plot too. This one is her best effort so far that I have read."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Circus of the Damned is the name of an entertainment center (sort of) owned by our favorite vampire, Jean-Claude. What we and Anita know, and what she doesn't want to let anyone else know, is that it is also the daytime resting place of Jean-Claude. By the way, when we get to _Killing Dance_ later in the series, Anita will spend some very important time in the basement of the Circus, herself.In this episode, we have one of the most interesting bad guys in the series, Mr. Oliver, the oldest vampire Anita will ever meet. How old is he? Hint: sloping forehead and chin, prominent brow ridge, short... yeah, homo erectus, not homo sapiens. However, just one enemy at a time would be boring for Anita. There's also another master vampire after her, one who would seem old if Mr. O wasn't around- he's an Aztec. And there's a rabid new offshoot of Humans Against Vampires, called Humans First. Oh, and a lamia - giant snake-woman. Well, aren't giant half-snake, half-women the sort of thing you expect at a circus?But the most important thing in the book is Richard. Richard is a very nice junior high school teacher who just happens to be a werewolf. And yes, Anita will be dating the occasionally furry Richard, though at the end of the book she's still refusing to date Jean-Claude. Furry is one thing, dead is another. Or, as she says, &quot;Most women complain that there are no single, straight men left. I'd just like to meet one who's human.&quot;For those wondering about the whole series, you can find out more about the characteristics of vampire novels in general and how this series fills some of those characteristics, by reading my reviews of earlier books in the series, such as _Guilty Pleasures_."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"This go around Jean-Claude is being challenged by a centuries, perhaps millenium old vampire. Ok, this is where Ms. Hamilton has her biggest problem. Could a toddler kick an adults [rear]? I think not. Ms. Hamilton unfortunately uses action movie cliches----the villain must die for the battle to be won. She's losing the profit of a Rogue's Gallery that represernt a serious threat to Anita, Jean-Claude, Richard and their assorted friends and minions. If someone shows up in an Anita Blake book as a villain, you know a few things. They die, she probably shoots them and they aren't ever on the line of a true villain. I mean the line of morality. Though Anita often worries about morality and spiritually, her world is too black and white. Win or lose. Good and evil.What these books need is a reason to keep going back, threats lurking around corners, and possibilities that in a new world where such mythology and lore is commonplace, the old morals don't mean as much. Anita attacks her personal decisions which put her between a sociopath and a prude, which don't mesh but rarely are we given a perspective on this world that is being created. There is constant mention of a Federal Act to announce vampires as \\"real\\" and give them full rights. But if they're walking and talking are they truly dead? There seems to be the underlying push of fundamentalism religion challenging the vampires and Anita but it's an argument that doesn't hold water. In order for it to do so, there should be more intimate knowledge of a world perspective on this. Who's president in Anita's world? What does the government think of all of these superhumans running around. Ms. Hamilton foreshadows often but doesn't deliver real answers on this partially because of my stated problem with Anita Blake novels. The first person POV. This kind of widespread mayhem needs to be shown popping up on plenty of radar screens in teh media, government and so on in this world.The story shows all of these people but rarely does it show how they're actions ripple outside of Anita's sphere. At the end of this novel, it becomes a comic super team fight between Anita's folks and the villains. I'm not saying they can't win, I'm simply saying that if someone has been alive thousands of years and has powers untold from being a vampire, would a bullet really do anything to him, a stake of wood. Unfortunately none of these long lived people are imbued with wisdom which is what so many years would bring. And their motives are so out of line with someone of advanced years that it makes you wonder, the throwing around of teh age of a vampire, does it mean anything. It's suppose to be impressive but if a twentysomething Anita can kill them so easily are they really all that tough?I would like to see Anita and pals measured against others yes, but the others, villains or whatever have to be taken as seriously as the protagonists for their danger to mean anything.This book is good as another brick in the wall, but its one fo the weaker bricks."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"There is a dose of politics in this one, both the human kind, and the vampire kind. The human issue is one of separatism, basically, as the Humans First organisation wants more information on and the ability to get rid of, the vampire power structures in the city.This book again has Edward, which is always good.Imagine if the Executioner or the Punisher got bored with hunting and killing crims and decided on something trickier, and you have a bit of an idea what Edward is about. Except that he is not so keen on the girls as the Executioner.Another powerful group of supernaturals also roll into town, and there is a nice, big, battle, which is action packed and a lot of fun."},{"Title":"Circus Of The Damned (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter)","review":"Laurell K Hamilton writes a great series of books and I enjoyed this a great deal.
