The character has flaws that she takes a long time to realize, showing a very real situation that happens to all of us. We all become pretentious when we do something right and we tend to want to repeat feats without considering the particularities of each condition. We want to be observers without look each situation with attention and we want to be wise without learning to listen."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's works are an extreme favorite of mine but this is not my favorite. Emma is really snobby and a meddler. Hers is not a personality I would want others to emulate but she is well meaning. Mr. Knightley is the best character of all. There are several very fun characters in this novel."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, author Jane Austen tells us in the very first sentence, was handsome, clever, and rich, and blessed with a happy disposition. In her first page, she suggests that the young Emma has perhaps had her own way in things too often. In her first chapter, we learn that Emma credits herself with having arranged the fortunate marriage of her governess to a wealthy neighbor, and believes herself more than ready to manage the social affairs of her hometown of Highbury.\\"Emma\\" is perhaps Jane Austen's most delicious romantic comedy, built around the match-making attempts of Miss Woodhouse, and the mangled relationships and social disasters that ensue. Although Emma means well, she ignores the advice of her good older friend Mr. Knightley to leave well enough alone, begining with her attempts to raise up the social status of her friend Harriet Smith. In the end, amid the ruins of her plans, Emma may face some difficult choices, and a fateful but priceless conversation with Mr. Knighley about her future.The comedy ripples through every chapter. Austen's supporting cast is well-chosen and well-written; this is a fun novel, and much more than a comedy of manners. Along the way, the reader will be treated to Emma's education in life, a worthwhile journey with an interesting ending. \\"Emma\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma is somewhat of a flip from Pride and Prejudice. Not as good, but still worth reading. Emma is the privileged one in her society and as she tries helping a less fortunate friend find love, she discovers that she is not as wise as she once thought. With a steady flow of characters and a great growth depiction in Emma, I just might read this again.The beginning dragged on a bit, you really have to get past 60% before anything particularly interesting happens, and I even really disliked Emma at first. However, she changes slowly (as opposed to the ever upsetting sudden growth that happens so often in other books) and even finds the classic romance of her own. Austin has a way of depicting things that describe so much more than she says. By the end I loved Emma, and even her most annoying companions. Don't read for a fast moving story, but if you want something that is relaxing and refreshing, Emma is your thing."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Beautiful Deluxe Edition!

Perfect for gift giving!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I am 11 and a 1/2 years old and simple love books that take place in Europe in the 1700 or 1800's. However, this book was absolutly boring. Out of all of Austens works, which are not all to exciting themselves, this has to be the most boring and drawn out. There are long pauses of nothing but tea and long walks, and once in a while Emma will set up one of her friends. This match does not last long, however. Personaly if I were her &quot;friend&quot; Harriet, I would think myself better off without her companionship. To my knowledge Jane Austen wrote this &quot;little gem&quot; for the prince of England whom she did not exactly admire. I wouldn't be surprized if his didn't admire her so much after he finished reading it. If you are looking for a exciting and gripping book do not choose Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I hate it. So boring. I fell asleep at the first page. its great if youre into that old 1800s kind of speech."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Four hundred pages of the idle rich filling up their vain and empty lives by meddling in other people's affairs while exchanging gossip and pointless drivel about their relative social standing, followed by one hundred pages of an embarrassingly bad romance novel, plus one very annoying character (Emma's father) who clearly has undiagnosed Asperger's syndrome. I wanted to slap everyone in the book. The only happy ending for this book would have been for all the characters to lose all their money and have to get jobs and actually do something for a living. Yes, I understand the points that Austen was trying to make about social mores etc., but those points were clearly made within the first 20 pages; the remaining 480 were superfluous. I wanted to rate this book higher by saying that \\"although the characters and plot are insipid, annoying, and boring, the writing was wonderful,\\" but I can't, because Austen's writing is almost as annoying as her plot."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Yep, that's about the only claim to fame of this shallow, eye-batting bit of fluff and nonsense. Needed some sex to spice it up and maybe a few curse words or a little war, courtesy of Napoleon across the Channel. Sex 'n violence, that's the key. I mean couldn't Emma have been ravished a little by one of the courtly fops who paid a call and couldn't she have gouged an eye out with a hairpin or red-hot poker in defense of her virtue? Helllooo, action and excitement, like Clarissa had a century earlier with Richardson? He knew a thing or two about keeping a bored middle school honors English class going. Yep. It would've helped. I've held a grudge against this insipid it's-somehow-great-because-it's-old bubble-headed tripe since it was forced on me like a bad blind date in the 8th grade. I hated this book. The only reason I'm giving it three stars instead of lower is that it did have a few redeeming moments and plus anything from another age that gives us a small peek into the lifestyles of the past (even a shallow and vain group of peasant-exploiting petty aristocratic-wanna-bes from the past) is worth something. Oh, plus there was the whole Clueless spin-off thing. Yeah, Clueless was so huge to us in the mid-90's we even used to go, \\"WWAD?\\" (What Would Alicia Do?) So I can't let myself utterly excoriate this headache-inducing, bulimia-inspiring, plot-thin-as-supermodel-tale from the dim brain of Miss Austen, a woman deeply in need of a good love affair. (If you catch what I'm saying.)It mystifies me they managed to make a passable film version out of Emma ten years ago during the Austen craze in Hollywood. If only the book had been that tolerable.All right, Austen fans, slam my review if you want, but all you readers-for-fun out there, those of you I might have saved from a long boring nothing-happens kinda novel: YOU'RE WELCOME!!!!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic. In short I think other great books have lasted the test of time but this is certainly not one of them. It too easily loses your attention."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"After reading Emma by Jane Austin I am very much considering not reading another book by Jane Austen.I was very dissapoited with the book.

For the last month or so, I've been trying to read \\"Emma,\\" and I believe I lack only 50 pages. I'm determined to finish. Actually, I started reading it about a year ago. If I can suffer through 10 pages a day, I think I'm doing well. I plan some type of celebration once I'm done.One of my graduate students used the word \\"tedious\\" to describe Jane Austen. I agree 100%. Sometimes you must read a sentence a dozen times; then, maybe, you have an inkling of what Ms. Austen is trying to say. Maybe not. She simply goes on and on and on.Personally, it's novels like \\"Emma\\" (or any other novel by the outdated Ms. Austen) that turn kids against literature. When I was in the 10th grade, we had to read \\"Silas Marner,\\" a totally painful experience. I reread it years later, thinking maybe I had misjudged it as a teen. I had. It was even more painful.i'm really thinking about beginning a Website, \\"Real Men Don't Read Jane Austen.\\" But that's sexist, isn't it? I can only hear Ms. Austin responding, \\"Do you mean to say if real men don't read me, unreal men do? What's an unreal man? Are there both real men and unreal men in the world? Is 'unreal' the opposite of 'real'? But what's 'real'? Is it the opposite of 'unreal'? Oh, my. My my. What's 'real'? What's 'unreal'?

Try another Austen book."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"After reading this novel, I realized how entertaining/touching an old book could actually be. The story was about a woman (Emma) who despised marriage, and felt that there was no need to dedicate her life to only one person. I felt that Emma was a very strong character, she knew what she wanted and would not let anyone alter her decision about marriage. However, at the end of the novel the character succumbs to societal pressures and marries the man (Mr. Knightely) that desires her companionship. That shows that her character's personality is not as strong as it seems. Throughout the whole novel she lets the reader believe that nobody could ever modify her view on marriage. Yet, I feel that the love story was very touching, not many people are dedicated to a person to the point where they will wait for them for as long as needed. Love conquers all is a saying that I have always wished to be true, but never thought that it was possible. Emma swore that she would never change her mind on this issue, but after admitting to herself that she was in love with this man, she desired to be with him as much as he did with her. After reading this novel, I realized that people can have soul mates, and that if you really love someone, never let them go because you never know what will happen. I feel that everyone should read this book, because even though it was written over a century ago, individuals now are able to read it and feel like they can relate to the characters, at least I felt that I could."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma is a wonderful story.

For the rest of their peers, I hear Jewel has a book of poetry you can try out."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I was amazed to read all those reviews by people who gave EMMA ratings of 1 and 2. they obviously missed the point of the novel and were too ignorant to understand it (which I find hard to believe considering I'm only 11 and I read it when I was 9). EMMA made me laugh, cry and everything in-between. It's a classic worth reading over and over again."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma is twenty years old, living in the countryside of Victorian England. Her father is a wealthy hypochondriac, constantly worried about his own health or the health of others. He dotes on Emma and can see no wrong in anything she does. Emma's mother died when she was a small child, and her older sister married and moved away some years ago. This leaves her as the mistress of her estate, with much leisure time to interact with her socially acceptable neighbors and to try her hand at matchmaking.At first Emma's schemes seem to be going well. She decides that her new friend Harriet, although not of the same social level as Emma, would be perfect for Mr. Elton, a well-connected neighbor. Everything seems to be as Emma had hoped.... until it all falls apart in misunderstanding and hurt feelings.Emma is stubborn, though, and refuses to give up even when things among her social circle get more and more confused. Will she be a successful matchmaker? Will she decide to give up her determination never to get married?I found the characters in this novel very dull and shallow. I didn't find Emma at all appealing, nor did I like any of the other characters in this book. Some of the writing is beautiful and it was interesting to get a glimpse into what life was like at this time, but I found the plot utterly predictable and was a bit frustrated that it took so long for all of the mistakes to sort themselves out."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"True to Jane Austen's prediction that with the creation of her character Emma was a person that not many people would like, Emma is one of the least likable characters in British literature.This snobby, rich and manipulating heroine was despicable to the end, yet the book was hilarious to read. The characterizations were complete and read like real and interesting people. There were the irriating Bates', the hypochondriac Father, the dashing and elegant neighbor and brother-in-law, the accomplished Jane Fairfax that Emma is fiercely jealous of, and the fawning lower class friend Emma wants to &quot;set up.&quot;The comic exchanges between characters, the complexity of the plot and the witty back-and-forth between the &quot;players&quot; makes reading Emma a lot of fun indeed. You don't have to like or agree with Emma the character to enjoy this great piece of literature. If not for Jane Austen's intriguing use of the English language that just sucks you in and holds you captive, I could have never gotten through this book with so much joy and entertainment for my clear disdain of the puppeteer Emma.However, that's what makes the book a masterpiece and why we still enjoy it 200 years later. For a more true, well-rounded heroine, I prefer Anne of Persuasion and Elizabeth of Pride and Prejudice. Both novels have likable leading characters created by Jane Austen.Emma is rich with complexity and rife with interesting, funny interludes and dialogue between the characters. Depite it's flawed main character, it was highly enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Those who gave this book a three or lower must not know how to appreciate formal writing.

Hey, go out and read Remains of the Day. That was about a butler. And it was great. Emma was a good book. It's a good story. But I guess some people are to busy staring at the TV screen to notice.

When I got it in late August, I got about twenty pages and had to put it down. Now, I picked up where I left off, and I really enjoyed this one. I don't know why I couldn't get through it before. Maybe I was just in the mood for a different genre.Emma is the story of Emma Woodhouse \\"handsome, clever, rich\\". She is also extremely spoiled, and her favorite pastime is making matches for all her friends; pairing them up with men. Her beloved tutor, Miss Taylor, was recently married to Mr. Weston. Now Emma's attention has fallen on Harriet Smith. She pulls Harriet away from Mr. Martin, the man she truly loves, and tries to match her up with Mr. Elton, a wealthy handsome young vicar, with disastrous consequences. That's the main plot.There are several other side-stories: that of Jane Fairfax, an orphan taken in by a friend of her father, Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston's son who was adopted by his uncle, and of course, Emma and Mr. Knightley, a long-standing friend.Emma is a character that you don't like; I kept wishing that she would just mind her own business. Mr. Knightley redeems her a bit; he's smart, and realizes that Emma should not be interfering. But there's not much he can do about it. But he is a great character. Austen's writing is very light and witty, which I enjoyed.I read the Penguin Thread (Deluxe) edition, and I've got to say, it was just beautiful. Seeing the image doesn't do it justice. Penguin uses 3D imaging to scan a woven pattern. So basically, you can feel the stitches on the front of the cover and the back of the cover (and the back side too.) Beautiful, beautiful design, and I look forward to reading some of the other books from this series.Emma was an enjoyable read; though I didn't love it as much as Pride and Prejudice, I definitely liked it more than Northanger Abbey.4.5 stars.You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen is a master storyteller.

Its main character is lovable but incredibly flawed. Her saving grace is that she is prepared to acknowledge her repeated errors. The other characters are also both interesting and believable, though the hero Mr Knightley is a bit too good to be true - but then most of Austen's heroes are a bit bloodless except for Darcy and perhaps Willoughby. Emma, the novel, is also a mystery. Both the two subsidiary leads, Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax seem to have secrets which are not revealed until the end of the novel.

There's the usual cast of comic characters, and some scenes really are a scream, but the heroine, Emma Woodhouse, and her 'consort' Frank Churchill are a bit too brattish for my liking. Their 'humour' (acidly bitchy spoilt brat gossip about the most kind-hearted and guileless members of the village) is just a little too vicious for me, and their appalling treatment of Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith, and the hilarious Miss Bates left me feeling a bit sick.

A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"In the quiet and picturesque village of Highbury there lived a self-professed matchmaker of little experience and expertise yet she believed herself to be in possession of superior observational skills and the ability to see into everyone's heart. Emma Woodhouse, our twenty-one year old matchmaker of Highbury, rates the marriage of her governess to a wealthy and respected gentleman, Mr. Weston, as one of her laudable matchmaking successes and decidedly takes on the challenge of finding a suitable wife for the vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. Alas, Emma is not the talented matchmaker she thinks she is and makes frequent blunders in judgment and is often blind to the romantic inclinations of the people around her...What then ensues is a spectacular comedy of manners that is heartwarming, satirical, lively, and charming.Mr. George Knightley, brother-in-law to Emma, does not approve of Emma's new matchmaking hobby or her new friendship with Harriet Smith, \\"the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.\\" Harriet Smith, a seventeen year old parlour border at the local school, is inferior to Emma in sophistication and sense. Mr. Knightley would much rather see Emma with a companion that is her equal in intelligence and influence her positively. Mr. Knightley is one of the few people in Emma's life that recognizes her faults; and believing her too often indulged and spoiled he makes no qualms about admonishing her for these faults. Unfortunately, Emma is often willful and ignores Mr. Knightley's wise counsel.Jane Austen is quoted to have said Emma was a \\"heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\\" This is true for some Austen fans who rank Emma Woodhouse as one of their least favorite heroines. However, there many readers that find her likable and claim her to be one of their favorite Austen characters. Emma Woodhouse is unique in that she is wealthy and well provided for, thus giving her little inducement to marry. In addition, even though she enjoys pairing up her friends and neighbors, Emma has little inclination or interest in finding love for herself and declares that she will never marry. (So much for having a romantic heroine!) Nonetheless, I am very fond of Emma, her lack of experience in the world has made her naive and the indulgence of her family has swelled her head, but she is not an unworthy or unlikable heroine. Throughout the course of this novel Jane Austen beautifully depicts the journey of Emma's maturation and displays her blossoming into a self-aware, humble, and sensible woman.My favorite thing about \\"Emma\\" is the charming village of Highbury and all who reside within. There is such a pleasant mix of endearing and exasperating characters: Miss Bates, a poor spinster who dearly loves to share news with her neighbors; Mr. Woodhouse, such a generous and a caring man who suffers from nervous anxieties about the health of his family and friends; Mr. Weston with his jolly and sanguine temperament; and Mrs. Elton, who believes herself to be the first in consequence in the town and is extremely vulgar and conceited. According to Miss Bates \\"there are few places with such society as Highbury.\\" How very true!While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most famous and popular of Jane Austen's six major novels, I believe that \\"Emma\\" is truly an excellent, accomplished novel that is not to be overlooked. I may not recommend it to someone for their first experience with Jane Austen, as it is a bit lengthier than the others, but I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy traveling to the time and world of Jane Austen whether it be in book or on screen!Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

Emma prides herself on her matchmaking ability. The happiness of the marriage of her former governess is her obvious proof. When she takes on Harriet Smith as her charge and determines to find the perfect match for her, her attempts fail time and time again. Disappointed in the outcome of her attempts, she resolves to only contribute to Harriet's happiness as her friend. In the end, when it seems that a match for Harriet may finally be made between Harriet and Mr. Knightley, only then does Emma realize the truth she has denied for so long and the folly of what she worked so hard for may cost her heart.Emma is a classic by Jane Austen and this is my first time reading one of Austen's works. I certainly understand why the book is considered a classic. Austen engages the reader who wonders about the outcome until the very end. The style in which it is written requires thought and time to truly understand the story. It is definitely not one that can be read through at a high speed and still comprehended at a high level.

I would not recommend it to anyone who does not enjoy reading, but I would recommend it to people who are fans of romance."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I was very impressed by the response time and professionalism of the seller.

Emma Woodhouse is used to her position of consequence as mistress of her widowed father's house, and proud lady of an old, respected family. She over-estimates her own power and importance, running into trouble when she tries to govern the affairs of her neighbors. Mr. Knightly, brother of her sister's husband, scolds and chides while her senile daddy worries more about her staying up too late, or dancing in a crowded room. Mr. Knightly is always right, as, over and over, the strong-willed Emma is forced to admit; but the reformation of her ideas may be too late in coming. He goes away to London just when she realizes she cannot be happy without first place in his heart. A must read for all fans of classic literature."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"By E.G. (AP)\\"Seldom, very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken...\\" This was a hard lesson for twenty-one year old Emma Woodhouse to come by. Emma takes on the role of a matchmaker, believing it is in her power to arrange marriages. Predictably, Emma eventually fails at her task. Failure causes Emma to lose innocence and become less ignorant to what in fact she can control.Emma is of a rich family; she's good looking, and she's clever. Emma is held in awe by most, especially her father who believes she is flawless. With such qualities and ideals at her disposal, Emma has very little to distress or vex her. The same circumstances convince her that she will never marry and promote naivete making reality a hard concept for Emma to grasp.Emma lacks knowledge of societal expectations especially where marriage is concerned. Taking place during the Victorian time period, one was expected to marry inside his class. Emma doesn't grasp this ideal which leads to failure and disappointment in her pursuit of making matches.Emma tries to acquaint Mr. Knightley with Harriet and to a certain extent, Jane. Emma discovers that she's once again led herself and Harriet astray. This instance in the book along with the knowledge that Mr. Knightley is one of few that can see faults in Emma, foreshadows an eventual change in plot. This is also the point in the story that a change in Emma's character becomes evident.When reading Emma, allow yourself plenty of time. There are many intricate details Involving who's interested in who that are interwoven into the plot and would be easy to pass by if not reading leisurely. It may be helpful to read a passage twice if you find yourself questioning what just took place. In order to fully enjoy the story; don't hurry through the book.A few of the characters have similar names. Sometimes the only thing separating one person from another is a subtle Miss or Ms. This can be frustrating if you don't fully grasp whom the book is speaking of. Again, read slowly and reread a passage if there's confusion about who the talked of subject is.Some characters are void of the story for an extensive amount of the book. This is also frustrating, as it may be hard to recall what role the character plays. It's beneficial to jot down character names and a few descriptors about them so when they reappear, their role can be recalled. Or, you may want to take time to flip back in the book and reread the scene in which they first appeared.Jane Austen did an exceptional job of writing satirically in order to portray silly ideals that Emma and society held. The standards for which marriages were arranged by become superficial and absurd through Austen's diction. Because it is apparent to the reader that Emma is chasing a dead end with her beliefs of who has taken interest in who, it's humorous when Emma comes to this realization herself. Austen chose exaggerated adjectives of perfection to describe Emma this creates a snicker because obviously Emma is not perfect but rather nave.Emma recalls memories of high school dance date set-ups that went wrong. It's comical to think back on either playing the role of matchmaker or having been the victim of a matchmaker when the quest for a date to the homecoming dance or prom is thrown into full effect. Most times the involvement of a third party misconstrues things much like Emma did. Feelings can be hurt similar to those of the characters in Emma making the matchmaker feel foolish but hopefully providing a lesson to all involved."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma is a great story, the heroine, depicted to be a selfish woman, who has been raised to believe she has no flaws, shows us through the book, how she learns tobe a woman that many people would dream to be. She shows true nature, adn acts as any human would. Her ongoing task to matchmake all her friends end in disaster, but in the end all is well. She handles her problems as one should, adn learns not to think so highly of herself. People say that it is too &quot;worldy&quot; but the book is one of the classics, Jane Austen outdid herself, this is my favourite Jane Austen book, it shows us that we all have flaws,a d that no one is ever perfect."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I really thought this book was wonderful! It was the first Jane Austen book I've read and I loved it! It was easy for me to keep the characters staight because I saw the movie first but totally enjoyed it the book too. Most people who gave this book a bad review called it, &quot;boring&quot;. One thing you should know: Jane Austen is not a writer of action novels. She likes to spread the story out. For anyone who have read her other novels, you know what I mean. If you found this boring, you should wait until your a little older to read this one. Although I like P&amp;P better, this was definatly not a bad book if your in the right mode to read it."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I love this book because it's timeless. True, it's set in the 1800's, but this book could have been written today. I know it's hard to sympathize with Emma, but deep down she just wants to see everyone happy.

No one book can ever be loved by everyone. For other readers that enjoyed this as much as I did don't get upset when others don't like it, they just don't WANT to have to translate the different dialect from a different country over a century ago. It's not that they can't, but the more modern setting suits them better. It is true you do have to be a serious reader to get through this novel. If you loose hope in the first few chapters you're not giving it enough time, at this point you've just been introduced to the characters, dialect, and culture of these people. The first 4 or 5 chapters are the hardest, but that's because you're having to learn so much with out any aids to guide you. For everyone who did not enjoy this no one should scoff at your taste, but in the future don't trash mine either. We have different taste neither is betteror worse, just different. For anyone interested, yes, their is a plot but you have to understand Jane Austen's style to see it. If you like a challenge and you like to have your heart pounding in tune with the characters this is a book for you. Bye the way, I am now 16 but I read three of Jane Austen's novels as a freshmen in high school.

Dominating the novel is the character of Emma Woodhouse--vital, Interesting, complex, and predisposed to playing power games with other people's emotions. Austen called her a heroine &quot;no one but myself would like,&quot; but she endures as one of Austen's immortal creations. Charting how Emma's disastrous foray as a matchmaker precipitates a crisis in the small provincial world of Highbury, and in her own heart, this novel of self-deceit and self-discovery sparkles with intelligence, wit, and irony. In fact, as critics say,Emma is indeed a fine piece of work which was was written, surprisingly, by someone who lived a rather secluded life. It has all the Austen trademarks, as the constant concern over marriage and social status, which was a poignant and true characteristic of her time."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen was a truly gifted author whose simple stories, memorable characters, and insights into human nature make her writings as relevant today as they were in the early 1800's.Emma is the story of an attractive and fortunate young woman who has never had anything really bad happen in her life, and who believes herself to be much more wise and worldly than she actually is. For one who has led such a sheltered existence, never leaving home or intending to marry, Emma believes herself possessed of incredible powers of perception and feels that she knows what is best for those she loves far better than they could possibly know for themselves. It is this belief of hers that causes her to meddle in the affairs of those close to her, creating chaos, confusion, and misunderstandings everywhere. Her well-intentioned interference produes comical results and eventually teaches her a valuable lession about minding one's own beeswax.I was sorry to see this book end"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I have read few books written with such a brilliant pen. There is more than a touch of sarcasm when Austen writes of society, but this is perhaps what keeps this book so alive. It is surprising how little society has really changed since the Victorian era. Emma comes across as a spoilt child, but lovable, as there is a shade of Emma in all of us. We all share the need to be involved in everything, and meddle with everyone's affairs, and there is a tale of unrequited love in all of our histories, even for a short time. I have not yet seen the film, as I am not sure of whether or not this would spoil it, as though there can be no doubt about the brilliance of Hollywood, Jane Austen should be present to direct it"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"My mom got this book from the library not long after we saw the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow. She found out in the movie credits that it was based on a book (we caught the movie on TV by chance) and found out it was by Jane Austen. Since her favorite book is Pride and Prejudice (which she had tried to get me to read for years without success) she read the book, as I did soon after. It's funny that even though Emma is one of Austen's longer books, it took only one movie to render it perfectly, whereas the much shorter Pride and Prejudice needed seven videos altogether!However, this is a review about the book, not the movie. Ahem. The book was great, and like all Austen's books never loses your interest. It is a bit drawn out and your mind may wander a bit during the course of the story, but it was a great story. Emma, the character Austen said no one would like, is much more likeable to me than the pathetic sop that is Fanny of Mansfield Park. She is much different than all other Austen characters; she is rich and has a thirty thousand pound dowry (at least I think so, I forget exactly; I read the book a while ago) which is a lot compared to the other penniless heroines who have at the most a thousand pounds. She is twenty-one, handsome, and though her snobbery is a turn off at the start of the book, you can't help but fall for her charms. She is, as the reviews say, irresistible. And Mr. Knightly is just like most other Austen heroes; a real dreamy guy -sigh- I'm so jealous of these girls. He's not romantic though, and unlike other books, the romance is a minimum, with barely an, \\"I love you\\" in sight.The situations are original and entertaining, and the mismatches of Emma the would-be matchmaker (with no sight in mind of marriage for herself) are very amusing. I would recommend this book to any Austen fan, but for beginners I would recommend Pride and Prejudice or Northanger Abbey, as they are shorter and much lighter, funnier stories. Emma is a bit more quaint. My only complaint is the speeches of that girl who talks too much, what's-her-name; she talks for pages on end, interrupts herself and is in general much more boring than amusing. Highly recommended, buy it now!!!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I confess: I often read Jane Austen as an exercise in self-discipline. However, caution should be exercised in reading her books. Little surprises turn up which force a certain circumspection of all characters and events. In \\"Emma\\", we meet with the practice of \\"giving up\\" children, illegitimacy and the concomitant existence of, and suspicion of, extra-marital sex, flirting clergymen who, naturally, view courtship as a Machiavellian enterprise, egotism, snobbery, hypochondria and maybe even a little attention deficit disorder--heroes, heroines, villains alike. It is a great tour de force. Austen draws her characters well--who hasn't met a Miss Bates or a Mrs. Elton in their lifetime? Finally, also watch out for those little dollops of wisdom interspersed throughout--they pop up, wake you up and then are gone, leaving you in the midst of the question of just what is the best way to prepare a piglet's leg."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's book Emma is creatively woven together with the characteristics of Emma Woodhouse, a young lady with much prestige. Even though the flaws of her character are questionable, her intentions are clear. Her role as a matchmaker during a unique time period creates a diversion from reality in the high social class where Emma resides. The encouragement by one lucky guess pushes her to create absolute non-sense. A reader only hopes to read faster in order to reveal and figure out the out come of all her mistakes. Emma hooks readers, addicting them to the humor and \\"tangled mess\\" in which she finds herself. This beautifully illustrated book quickly creates an exclusive impression every time it is read."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"As with all of Austen's novels, the reader will find the breadth of human character within the cover. The novel demonstrates a biting wit as well as a sentimenal side. I first read this book when I was fifteen and I was absolutely captivated. If you have not read this book then you are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"This book was wonderfully uplifting and entertaining. I enjoyed it immensely, and I believe you will as well, if you like amusing stories dealing with romance, confusion, friendship, matchmaking, and true love. Do not listen to some of the other reviews that say this book is a rip-off of Clueless. Obviously the people who posted those are incredibly ignorant, especially since Emma came out a very long time before Clueless, and if anyone was eligible to sue, it would be Jane Austen (if she was still alive) suing the makers of Clueless. Again, this was a very enjoyable book, and I would definately recommend it to anybody!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Actually, every Jane Austen is essential, so the title of this review is pretty unnecessary.I just finished Emma. I've had this book on my shelf for over a year, hesitant to read it because I've seen the movie (the Gwyneth version) about 100 times. I was worried that there would be no suspense in the book for me, having memorized the movie characters so well.I needn't have worried. Books are never the same as movies. I found even more to love about Emma as I read this book, and grew to like other characters (such as Jane Fairfax) more, and other characters, such as Frank Churchill less. While this book did not hold the suspense for me that Pride and Prejudice does (still!), it was nonetheless a great read and I can't wait to reread it next summer."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I am not normally a fan of this type of novel (hell, I read science fiction), but I read this book for an English AP class this summer, and I must say that I liked it. As a snapshot of English social life at the time it was written, it is faultless. The plot, while somewhat inconsequential by today's so-called &quot;standards&quot;, is entertaining, and leaves the reader in a state of suspense up 'till the conclusion. The dialogue is also very charming, witty, and definately a product of it's time, but relevant. There are novels throughout the history of literature that stand as epoches for certain time periods, and Emma can be realistically called one of them. It wraps up the early 19th century English social life period very well, and more realistically and less sense of being dated than Pride and Prejudice or some of Jane Austen's other novels (or those of her contemporaries.) If you like this type of novel it is a must read, or, if you're like me, it is something interesting to pick up when you want something different from what you usually read."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I absolutely loved this novel!! I'm also glad that before reading this novel I read Jane Austen's other famous works because I had practice with Austen's confusing vocabulary. Once I got used to it I was able to appreciate what was truly happening with Emma. I highly recommend this book to young girls that have a pedestrian outlook on love, because after reading this novel I learned that love isn't always about emotions but you have got to be sensible as well. Emma is a woman to be emulated, not because of her match-making attitude but of her convictions and strenght. She does not need a man to complete herself, but after finally allowing her eyes to open she does find bliss with the man she loves. I can go on and on about this novel, but then what would be the use of reading?? Get yourself a copy now! You won't regret it.."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"This was a book that I 'tried' to read in 5th grade and fell asleep, now years later I decided to give it another shot. To my suprise, Emma was a delightful book. At times it may seem boring, but at those times I learned to savor the details that I did read. I thoroughly enjoyed all the characters and plot twists. Jane Austin is an absolutely amazing author! I do not reccomend this book to younger kids who have trouble reading or get bored easily, but it is perfect for teenagers and up, esspecially girls. :)"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Having been a devoted fan since early childhood, I have read all of Miss Austen's books at least twice, and I find this the most endearing. 'Emma' is a dazzling combination of wit, not-too-dreadful mishaps, mild drama, and affectionate, though insightful, looks at society.Emma, though a little petted and given to overconfidence in her intellect (brilliant people often struggle so), is definitely endearing (even more so than Gwyneth Paltrow). And, of course, Miss Austen's inventive method of relating dialogue is delightful. Of Mr. Woodhouse, the definitive hypochondriac: &quot;He was afraid they should have a very bad drive...He did not know what they had best do...&quot; Jane Austen has a splendid way of drawing the characters through such dialogue - it is almost as if they come alive.If you ever read one book of Miss Austen's, read 'Emma'!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma, written by Jane Austen is story about a clever, rich, and high society woman, named Emma Woodhouse. Throughout the beginning of the novel, Emma is portrayed a nave child, with a broad imagination. Due to her broad imagination, Emma bases her own happiness solely upon her matchmaking abilities. However, although Emma has the best intentions, her actions eventually lead to the worst results.Through the key marriages of Mr. Elton, Mr. Churchill, and Mr. Knightley, the theme of self-revelation through the actions of marriage is revealed in the novel, Emma.Emma attempts to make a match between When Harriet Smith and Mr. Elton. However she is blinded in noticing Mr. Elton's love for her. Mr. Elton does declare his love for Emma, which leaves her bewildered. After this incident, Emma's first revelation is that her matchmaking abilities are flawed and resolves that she will no longer match-make.Emma then meets Frank Churchill. Emma soon begins to realize that she might be in love with Frank Churchill. However, soon after Emma learns of the impending marriage between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax.However, soon after this event, Emma's third revelation begins to arise. Emma recovers from the disappointing event concerning the marriage of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax, and finds herself suddenly appreciating Mr. Knightley. Emma now begins to realize at this point in the novel that Mr. Knightley is her true love.In the beginning of the novel, Emma Woodhouse is portrayed as a conceited and imaginative child, who lacks the knowledge of true love and self-respect. At the end of the novel, through the events of marriage between Mr. Elton, Mr. Churchill, and Mr. Knightley, Emma ironically becomes a mature and selfless woman. Although Emma's character throughout the novel changes dramatically from a spoiled heiress to a mature and selfless woman, I believe that Emma's endurance and triumph of numerous obstacles of oppression, gave her the strength to liberate herself from her stereotypically society, thus allowing her to realize and attain her own desires and dreams.In conclusion, I would consider Emma a very good book. However, I think the novel's only faults are that it was extremely long and at some points very difficult to understand."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma is a great classic novel and probably one of Jane Austen's best! If you like this book I also suggest the wonderful movie adaptations. Both the one starring Gwynneth Paltrow and the one starring Kate Beckinsale are quite lovely!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings in existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress ir vex her.\\"So begins Jane Austen's classic novel of the mishaps of matchmaking. Upon the marriage of her governess, a match Emma purports to have arranged herself, Emma next turns to finding a suitable husband for her new young friend, Harriet Smith. She encourages Harriet into an infatuation with the vicar, Mr. Elton. Her plans fall apart, however, when Elton reveals to Emma that she is the true object of his affections. Rejected, Mr. Elton flees to Bath and finds a wife almost immediately. When the long-awaited Frank Churchill finally comes to visit, the entire social set of Highbury is swept into a tangle of suspicion, charm and deceit. Although Frank is commonly viewed as a perfect match for Emma, she feels only friendship for him, and views him instead as a potential husband for Harriet. In spite of Emma's multiple failed attempts at matchmaking, there are two couples married and one engaged by the end of the novel.Jane Austen was one of eight children, the daughter of an upper middle-class clergyman. Although her family was not wealthy, they led comfortable, socially respectable lives. Well-educated and with a love of reading, Jane Austen began to write at the age of twelve. She never married. Her first novel, Sense & Sensibility, was published in 1811, followed by Pride & Prejudice. All of her novels were published anonymously. She died in 1817, and is buried in Winchester Cathedral.I found this book to be as charming and delightful as the film, which I first fell in love with long ago. Jane Austen's wit is very much in evidence throughout the novel, and greatly improves what might otherwise be a somewhat dry style. Austen referred to Emma as \\"a heroine whom no one but myself will like much.\\" However, I found Emma to be engaging and delightful. I recommend this book to all fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"So what does a &quot;handsome, clever, and rich&quot; girl like Emma Woodhouse do when she has no professional aspirations and no intention ever to marry? In addition to painting, playing the piano, and condescendingly visiting the poor, she is what might be called a social organizer, which primarily means finding husbands for single women and arranging all the social details involved in doing so. Her decision not to marry stems from her opinion, conceited but sincere, that there's not a man out there who could entertain her as a lifemate; and besides, with her mother pushing up daisies and her older sister Isabella living away in her own marriage, she already has a husband: her father.Jane Austen's novel weaves a group of several characters, balanced almost equally between men and women, into a web of romance in which the reader is led through various scenes and situations in a guessing game of who will end up with whom. Emma makes herself the prime mover of this group, but she is not as infallible a love broker as she would like to think. After she has successfully matched her childhood governess Miss Taylor with an affluent man named Weston, she turns her attention to the naive and impressionable Harriet Smith, for whom she has identified the young vicar Mr. Elton as a suitable beau. But then Elton declares his love for Emma, who of course is not interested in him, and...oh, what a mess.The plot thickens when a pretty girl named Jane Fairfax arrives in town to inspire Emma's curiosity and jealousy because she, unlike Harriet, is charming enough not to need Emma's assistance and tutelage. The main heartthrob among the women is Frank Churchill, actually Weston's son from a previous marriage, an impulsive and not totally honest young man whose amorous unpredictabilities shake the foundations of Emma's schemes. The man designed to be a traditional hero is George Knightley, sixteen years Emma's senior, who acts as Emma's moral anchor and monitors her matchmaking endeavors, gently cutting her down to size when her head gets a little too big, such as when she tells him that Robert Martin, a farmer, isn't of the proper class to be Harriet's husband.Austen maintains the right narrative pace, giving her major characters just enough room to develop themselves plausibly through interactions with some colorful minor characters. Emma's father, the slow-on-the-uptake Mr. Woodhouse, a man of extreme sensitivity to gastronomical disorders and temperature fluctuations, is an innocuous but amiable fellow who appreciates his daughter's loyal devotion but is judiciously content to remain in the background of her life and activities. The Highbury seniors are represented by the elderly Mrs. Bates and her slightly less elderly daughter Miss Bates, who has a marvelous talent for prattling about trifles in which nobody else is interested. She can be outdone only by Miss Suckling, the annoying chatterbox Elton decides to marry after being jilted by Emma.Emma is not a bad or cruel person--she genuinely feels guilty about Harriet's continual romantic misfortunes and her own momentary sarcastic behavior towards Miss Bates. However, it cannot be denied that she's a snob whose goal is a Perfect Society with all the right ladies married to the right men, and to hell with all those other little people (the farmers, the servants, the unattractive, etc.) who don't fit into her master plan. But Austen herself admitted this much, showing that Emma is far from perfect herself and allowing her to learn a lesson in humility by the end of the novel, for which she is duly rewarded--the denouement is a little too neat, but of a style so familiar to us by now that &quot;Emma&quot; seems nearly two centuries ahead of its time."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I can never decide whether Pride and Prejudice or Emma is my favourite book by Jane Austen. Emma has all the Jane Austen hallmarks - wit, exuberance, and laugh out loud moments, coupled with realistic, well drawn characters and a real feeling of being in the Regency (which is hardly surprising, as that's when the book was written).Emma is a spoiled young woman who has everything she can possibly want in life: a doting father who lets her do as she pleases, friends, family and a beautiful home. She is understandably please with herself, and this leads to complications as she tries to sort out everyone else's life. She's meddling and interfering, and yet so well meaning she comes across as a likeable character rather than as a busybody.She takes up Harriet, a young woman of doubtful birth, and encourages her to set her sights on Mr Elton, the local vicar, as a future husband. Poor Harriet is completely bowled over by Emma, and is persuaded to like Mr Elton over the farmer's son she is really in love with. Emma is oblivious to the fact that Harriet and Mr Elton are completely unsuited, and that Harriet and her farmer are made for each other.Through a variety of hilarious scenes, Emma comes to realize she doesn't know as much as she thought, and learns that it's better to let other people manage their own lives.The minor characters are wonderful: Mrs Elton with her barouche landau (anyone who's read the book will know what I mean), sweet Miss Bates, and dreadful Mr Elton, who has designs on Emma.Eventually, Emma learns how to understand her own feelings, and leaves everyone else free to listen to theirs, which leads to a satisfying ending all round.Hugely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen novel. Yes, Emma the heroine is a flawed human being. She is a spoiled little rich girl always trying to manage other people's lives, an effort that never turns out well. For example, she convinces her less-well-off friend, Harriet Smith, that she deserves better than the honest farmer who loves her and whom Harriet loves, and almost upsets Harriet's chances of happiness as a result. Emma continues in this vein throughout the book, at times being on the verge of doing serious harm, until at last the moment of enlightenment comes - a moment filled with shame and confusion.Of course, the overall plot in this as in all other Austen novels is the problem of getting married, and in that respect these books represent the original \\"chick lit.\\" The difference, of course, lies in Austen's brilliant satire of characters like Miss Bates, the village gossip, and in her glorious ability to make the words sing."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I felt that Emma was a great book and an informative look into the past, when it was written around 1815. It was interesting to read how everyone called the other Mr., Miss, or Mrs. It was a little confusing because of this, because, for example, there is a Miss Bates and a Mrs. Bates, and sometimes it's hard to remember which is which!The story is a good one, a great novel that pulls you in, but with lengthy descriptions, and once in awhile it drags. Throughout the story, my 21st century \\"hurry up\\" mode would prefer it to move along more quickly.The storyline, similarly, is also a bit slow at times, but it's a wonderful romantic novel with a human character like Emma. She has flaws, but is enchanting, as are the rest of the characters in the book. it's also very humorous and has a great ironic twist. I definitely recommend it, but to at least a freshman in high school, because it is a challenging book."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"i absolutely love this novel.

I first read it when I was about seventeen, and I loved it as much this time as I did then. It is truly a joy to read such wonderful writing and be so sweetly entertained.The character of Emma is so fully realized and believable. Her ineptness as a matchmaker simply adds to her appeal, and makes you love her even more for her shortcomings. And the inevitable romance that finally comes to be near the end of the novel is so completely rewarding, that you will be smiling broadly as you read the last few pages.Of Austen's novels, I've only read Emma and Pride and Prejudice. After completing Emma for the second time, I'm eager to pick up her other books and lose myself in her enchanting narrative."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"At age 13, I found the language challenging, but today at 17 I find it delightful. Nothing agrees with me more than rereading my now favorite book. Though the language is challenging for a young or first time Jane Austin reader it is well worth wading through the odd words and strange grammer to see into the heart of the story.The story touches so close to my heart it is a pleasure to read and dream of that someday romance with me in the place of any one of Austin's ladies. Now if I can find a man as gentlemanly, handsome and kind as Mr. Kingley."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I listened to this as an audio book which is a somewhat different experience than reading it. I often listen to books when I commute and this did keep me occupied for many miles. I appreciate much of Austen's writing and her interesting character portrayal. It's also very interesting to note the rigid social structure of that time and place. However if I had to have read this in print, I doubt that I would have gotten through it.As others have said, the central character, Emma, is just not very likable. She is very rich, very spoiled, an only child who was pampered by a governess and a highly indulgent father and is granted the highest respect from everyone in their town due to nothing but her fortunate social position. This is not a person who is plagued by self-doubt! She believes that she is the cleverest person around and has no qualms about manipulating others. When not manipulating, she is abundant in her very, very snobbish judgments of others. True, she matures somewhat in the year that the novel covers, repenting of her past misdeeds and promising to become a better person. Still it's too little/too late for my taste and I can only wonder that the \\"hero\\" who appears to be a candidate for sainthood, has chosen Emma as his beloved. I think he would have been better off with any of the other women in the novel.There are so many other novels of the period that far surpass this one; don't waste your time on Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"My first Jane Austen and I loved it!! A story of hope in a hopeless situation. The ending was a bit far fetched. All in all a delightful read that I will read again. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, the heroine of Emma, is often very hard to like. She is spoiled, impulsive, conceited, and rich. However, Austen's writing is, as always, richly detailed, light-hearted, and sharp-witted, which makes this classic book a must-read for anyone who has ever watched Masterpiece Theater, read women's or historical fiction, or dreamed of living in a time where women were oppressed but sure looked pretty doing it. If you read Austen in high school or when you were younger and found yourself bored to tears, I would suggest going back to give it another try. I read Pride and Prejudice when I was a young teen, and thought it was incredibly lame--who writes a romance without a long, passionate kiss? However, when I went back to Jane after watching a few of the movies, I found it surprisingly playful and humorous, with strong female and male characters, some excellent dramatic moments, and solid comic relief.Emma is definitely not my favorite Austen book. Emma is simply too manipulative and naive at the same time for me to really root for her or against her. But the quality of the writing alone is worth the trip. I've read this a few times now, and I always find something fresh in the dialogue, the observations, the interactions between female characters, and female and male characters. So, if it's been awhile, you're looking to read it for the first time, or you're simply looking for a well-written diversion, this is a great choice."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma was such a character who in my opinion, was a little bit too conceited - she had thought to know of the feelings of other people that made her feel very confident of her match-making skills; and yet, when these matches failed to be, she thought the failures were all her doing too! Just the same, as in any chick-lit novels, everything was well and as it should be towards the end.It took me almost three weeks to finish this book, and I questioned myself why. It just didn't have that pull on me that I sometimes found myself browsing the net rather than reading the book. It's always a struggle for me to read 18th century writings; I always have to go back and reread for a more thorough understanding of what's being said. This is my second book by Jane Austen, and I'm probably getting tired of all the ceremonious ways of her period. Still, I could not fault the writing, being from a long ago era and true to it; it also elicited \`hate and like' feelings towards the characters which is a sure indication of good literature...But still, I labored through it...so three stars to be fair to Ms. Austen and to myself."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"It's not my favorite, but I was still struck by how Austen knows the human heart so well. During the first part of the book, I wanted to spank Emma Woodhouse on several occasions. She was annoying, exasperating, conceited, arrogant, and so sure of herself that is was hard to read about her. However, underneath all that, Emma is really a kind, good, generous person. She treats her father with such tenderness and concern; that was a beautiful thing.But, I know women like her and when they discover their faults, they are full of recrimination. I just loved Austen's insight into women and their natures. Some of the characters are so real, so rich; Mrs. Elton, Miss Bates. But, I'm not sure there is someone as saintly and good and patient as Mr. Knightley; he was just not totally believable to me.However, over all, I enjoyed this book. I think Jane Austen is a remarkable writer; verbose, yes, but perhaps that is the way people talked then. At any rate, Emma is a book to read and enjoy if you like period literature!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Emma\\" isn't the most sophisticated or complex of Jane Austen's book but is my favorite by far.

Her previous work, Pride and Prejudice, is one of the great masterpieces in English literature. Unsurprisingly, Emma does not measure up to P&P, but is still a delightful read in its own right. The same themes that readers have come to associate with Jane Austen are all present in Emma: courtship, marriage, Victorian reserve, and, of course, social status. The biggest problem I had with Emma is that the characterization is not near as solid as in Austen's previous work. The only truly interesting character is the main protagonist, Emma, whose wit and vivacity sparkle throughout. The only fair way to read Emma is to do so without comparing it to Pride and Prejudice. Doing so, this book stands just fine upon its own merit. Just don't expect lightning to strike twice."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder.Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled. Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol or marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults.Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

Unlike all the others, Emma is a wealthy young woman who does not have the pressure of making a good marriage to ensure her happiness and in fact is determined never to wed. Likewise, due to the affections of her father and governess, Emma has been indulged and encouraged all her life into behaving just as she pleases, and as one of the few members of nobility in the small county of Highbury she is a big fish in a very small pond. Due to this, she considers herself superior to others and confident of her own perception of things: to put it simply, she is a snob. Yet she is not dislikeable - she is loving, well-mannered and kind, and deep down she realises that many of her actions are folly - it just takes her a while to get to these conclusions.Crediting herself for the recent marriage of her governess to the estimable Mr Weston, Emma takes it upon herself to play matchmaker for Highbury's society. Her eye is fixed on the eligible clergyman Mr Elton as an excellent match for her new friend Harriet Smith, a girl of obscure birth and minimal wealth. Despite the cynicism of Mr Knightley, an old family friend and the caution of her dear Mrs Weston, Emma is too wrapped up in her own opinions of how human hearts work to heed their advice...Further irony is found in the fact that whilst Emma is busy organising the hearts and minds of those around her, she has utterly no regard for her own and finds on many occasions that her perceptions of people were completely mistaken. But this is where readers' affection for her lies: she is beloved *for* her faults, not in spite of them, and such imperfections make her a rich, understandable character. Furthermore, these faults give her room to grow and improve as a person, and she is not the same Emma at the end of the book as she was at the beginning.\\"Emma\\" is also filled with many memorable supporting characters, very few of which are painted in black and white terms - rather they are small portraits of true human life, each with their own good and bad attributes. There is the talkative Miss Bates and her niece Miss Jane Fairfax (who Emma is cool toward due to the fact she detracts attention away from herself), the pretentious Eltons, Emma's sister and brother-in-law, and the and the dashing Frank Churchill, (Mr Weston's son) on whom rest many hopes by his family of an alliance with Miss Woodhouse.Austen writes in beautifully delicate language, which is filled with many of her best moments of wit and insight into the human condition, especially in her themes of social hierarchy and acceptable forms of manners. It is a common belief that authors of the past are hardly ever critical of their own times or station - Austen gloriously proves these narrow-minded people wrong as she weaves together her characters and their various ways of life with commentary on them all. Like all such reads, it's not for a lazy reader as it needs your constant attention and care. But like all truly good literature, it is well worth the effort and considered the best novel in the Jane Austen canon."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Written by renowned author Jane Austen, Emma is quite an intimidating book to attempt at first glance and takes some patience to read; yet the patience is greatly rewarded. 21-year-old Emma Woodhouse is young, beautiful, rich and witty. She finds satisfaction in her successes and pleasure in the art of matchmaking for others. In her arrogance, she believes that she knows what is right for everyone, and is determined to \\"set the world straight\\", appointing herself cupid for all of Highbury. Fortunately, Emma is eventually \\"enlightened\\", drawn out of her self-delusion, and everything works out in the end. Jane Austen's admirable style and incomparable charm gets away with the happy ending without seeming like a sappy soap opera.The characters in Emma are many, yet all incredibly human. Through wonderfully witty dialogue, these characters are depicted with amazing clarity. Emma's confidence in her knowledge of the world and ability to plan out the lives of others is simply hilarious! It's impossible not to fall in love with her wit, humor, good intentions, and ignorance. Of course, the paranoid Mr. Woodhouse, the talkative Miss Bates, and the innocent Harriet are also memorable characters. The wonders, complications, and misunderstandings of love and marriage are told brilliantly in this entertaining novel!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"A wonderful read! This is a story about a girl named Emma. She is pretty, wealthy, and a little bit haughty. And why not, since she is of a social standing where she feels she's entitled to look down on those inferior to her position. Even though she had such superior airs, I still couldn't help but liking Emma.She tries to play matchmaker to a new friend, and it's a disaster. Despite her actions, I couldn't dislike the character of Emma. She does feel guilty and remorse when she realizes her actions causes turmoil and pain for others. She feels horrible when she realizes her misconceptions of others. She is contrite and sorry for the trouble she causes to those around her.I think one of the things I liked best about this book was the characters. There were so many places where I laughed aloud at Emma's father for his eccentricity and odd behaviors, or reading Emma's thoughts on certain people. It was really a delight to read!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Almost universally, I find books to be far superior to their movie version, and I think most avid readers would be inclined to agree. However, in this case, without having seen the film first, I never would have considered reading this book because I often steer away from classics, finding them difficult to understand and hard to follow. I was quite enamoured with the highly romantic film Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam that I felt inspired to listen to this audiobook. The reader did an outstanding job of making me feel as though the story was happening around me and I was a part of this community, and actively participating in their festivities.Of course, my analytical mind couldn't help comparing and contrasting the book with the film. There are so many different characters, many of whom had very minor roles, or were spoken of but never appeared in any actual scene. Having seen the film first, it was far easier to \\"know\\" who everyone was, and how they related to each other. The book had many more scenes that filled in more details and had deeper character development, which drew me into the story more intensely than before. There were aspects of the film that seemed more romantic (the interactions between Emma and Mr Knightly, for example), and I preferred the way the film ended as compared to the book. But in both versions, Mr. Knightly was extremely swoon-worthy!!!I feel very inspired to read the book in print, now that I am sure to understand and appreciate it to its fullest. And I have just ordered the DVD film version starring Kate Beckensale, which is reputed to be the most romantic of all!! I have officially been \\"turned-on\\" to Jane Austen, and plan to read her other books, comparing and contrasting them to their respective film versions as I have so enjoyed doing with Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Siri Amster- OlszewskiAugust 24, 2006Emma, by Jane Austen, was one of the most enjoyable books I have read recently. I chose to read Emma because, having read and loved Pride and Prejudice by the same author, I wanted to explore her other books as well. The characters in Austen's stories are both intriguing and comical and her description of the era in which they take place creates a clear view of society in those timesI was enchanted with Emma because Austen beautifully blends together a simple story of a girl and a documentation of the societal behaviors of the time. It provides insights into the life and social customs of a lady living in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.One of the book's principle topics is marriage. The main character, Emma, approves of matchmaking for marriage and, through her, the reader gets a view into the different motives for marriage. For some people, marriage was simply a way to advance in social status; for others, marriage was for love. In Emma's time, marriages had to be matched according to social status. One could not marry below their status. Marrying too far above one's status could end up disastrously.The book tells the story of Emma Woodhouse who is a pretty, wealthy, poised, and clever young woman. Her mother died when she was too young to remember or miss her and was raised mainly by her governess, Miss Taylor. Miss Taylor behaved like a best friend rather than a governess due to her mild temper and love for Emma. Therefore, Emma grew up without any firm rules or structure. This freedom caused her to think quite highly of herself and of her opinions. It was her excessive self-confidence that led her to often make mistakes creating misfortunes for others and embarrassment for herself.Jane Austen, by the style of her writing, creates some well-defined character while including other character that are left more open to the reader interpretations. For example, while Emma's faults are very apparent, I found her innocence to be charming and it created sympathy for her character. Other examples of characters like Emma are Jain Fairfax, Harriet Smith, and Mr. Elton. In contrast the character of Mr. Knightly, the family friend is set in stone. Within the first few pages of the book he is established as the moral role model of the story. Mr. Woodhouse, Mr. Weston, Mrs. Weston (the former Miss Taylor), Frank Churchill, and Miss Bates are all other characters that give off a particular feeling, the feeling that Austen intended. These characters all have good and bad qualities, all of which are left up to the interpretation of the reader. The novel is written in third person, however the detached narrator often sees through Emma's point of view. Having the effect of a not so neutral bystander.I highly recommend Emma to anyone who enjoys a light-hearted, witty book that captivates and enchants. While reading this book you will find yourself captivated in the pages of one of Jane Austen's masterpieces."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I admit, it has been a few years since I read Emma. I haven't gotten to read the rest of Austen's works (yet!), but I think she is a fine writer. As a writer, that's a high compliment. I don't mean to say she's, well, fine.. I mean she is fine and honed and respectable.. and great.I picked this book up at my library when I was tired of random teen angst-based novels about first boyfriends and horrible pasts. I wanted something written with real language, with a style. I wanted something old and truly good, like the classics I had read and been read as a young child. I wanted something with SUBSTANCE.Because of this, it took me awhile to get back in the habit of really reading. For a week or so, Emma lay in a drawer, only partway read. It was difficult not to skim and my head would swim with the small print and dark pages. I lamented, but shrugged it off as life got busy.I came out of the shower one day, with an urge to get back into it, and ended up standing, hair wet, in front of my dresser, book rooted up out of the confines of my underthings, and wasting time.I read it constantly until I finished it, as I always do when reading a new book, but this one was different. This one invoked a hunger in me, and I was definitely satisfied when it came to an end.The constant little subplots and dramas surrounding arrogant, but rather good-natured Emma, the engaging characters, with such distinct and memorable personalities, and the wonderful twist of the ending (everyone else says they were so sure, but I, for one, was surprised, I admit) were all...wonderful. Austen is, I say again, a fine writer, and no wonder she is of the classics.I have heard, as well, that she did not think anyone else would love Emma. I ask, how could you not? The people who are so vehement about her flaws clearly have many of the same. She is one of the most enjoyable heroines I have had the pleasure of visiting, among such \\"flawed\\" characters as Anne Shirley (her incessant daydreaming and such a temper! ;), in all my years of reading. And that's a very long time."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen perfects the art of character development in Emma. The long, twisted plot carefully and slowly develops each character using rich detail that makes the characters come alive with personality. Without the rich detail and character development, I do not feel this book would have stood the test of time and become the classic that it is. Emma is a heart-warming book with enough orneriness mixed in to make it amusing."},{"Title":"The Dutch twins ([Twins series])","review":"I have memories attatched to this book. My grandmother read this to me as a little girl, and to this day I enjoy reading the simplicity, the absolute ease of the style. I take this book now and read to my grandmother because she has alziemers. If I didn't have those memories I admit I might not feel so special about it, but those are the memories I never want to forget."},{"Title":"The Dutch twins ([Twins series])","review":"The name of the publisher should have clued me in to the fact that this edition is only an imitation of a real children's book. Perkins' original book was charmingly illustrated; this has no illustrations at all. This is disorienting as well as disappointing, since even the first line of the text refers to an illustration. The lack of illustrations greatly reduces its appeal to younger children. The edition is flimsily bound, and closely resembles a manual that might come with your new Kenmore washer."},{"Title":"The Dutch twins ([Twins series])","review":"Kit and Kat are twins. They live in Holland with their mother and father. Kit and Kat are not their real names; their real names are Katrina and Christopher, but they will not be called Katrina and Christopher until they are four and a half feet tall and that will be a long time from now.So goes this little collection of stories about the two little Dutch twins. They go fishing with their father on the dyke and drive a tiny milk cart with their grandfather and sell cabbages with their father and help their mother clean their house and wait for Saint Nicholas to come to their house and bring candies and cakes. Simple little stories, filled with little details about windmills and dykes and wooden shoes and Dutch church. Such lovely little stories that I read all 191 pages at one sitting.Because the stories are so old, they are available online for free. A little research about author Lucy Fitch Perkins reveals that she wrote a whole series of twin books, including Mexican Twins, French Twins, and even Eskimo Twins.1001 CBYMRBYGU\\"I told you to go slowly,\\" said Grandfather. \\"Now look at the cart, and see what you've done by not minding,--spoiled your best clothes and Kat's, and spilled the milk!

There is a huge difference, and I should have heeded the warning of one reviewer about the lack of illustrations. The Tredition Classics version, whose cover looks like the one displayed here, has none of the charming illustrations I loved as a child. It doesn't even start each chapter on a new page. It's all run together and very poorly made. The little \\"take a look inside the book\\" link is completely deceptive. The \\"look\\" shows the illustrations and something akin to the original fonts. That is NOT what I received.On the other hand, the \\"Yesterday's Classics\\" version that I ordered of The Japanese Twins is very nice. While I've been looking for copies of the old out-of-print books, some of them are really collector's items now and out of my price range. This reprint includes the illustrations and looks very similar to the originals. I'll look for a copy of The Dutch Twins from Yesterday's Classics, since I am returning the one by Tredition Classics.Unfortunately, it's sometimes hard to tell which you are ordering. This description (for which I'm submitting the review) has the label \\"Tredition Classics\\" in small print if you look closely at the white line across the middle of the cover, so it is exactly like the one I received.

I read this aged 8 and adored it: it gives the young reader an idea of what the Netherlands was once like through the twins' adventures, with wonderful b/w illustrations. Getting their skates, celebrating St Nicholas' Day- and who could forget Kit falling in the dyke and getting pulled out by his baggy Dutch trousers? Or catching hold of a windmill's sails and being carried up in the sky.

Large print and very few stories."},{"Title":"Waylaid","review":"An outstanding first novel!In Waylaid, Ed Lin deftly navigates the delicate balance between the ire and angst of growing up Asian in a non Asian society with the beauty and poignancy of just growing up. His nameless protagonist begins a journey of self discovery that is as heartbreaking as it is hilarious, as honest as it is raw. Set in a &quot;No tell Motel&quot; on the Jersey shore, Lin's twelve year old main character finds himself (as we all have at some point in our lives) caught between the rock that is every American man's dream, and the hard place that is every American boy's fantasy. This is a wonderful novel whose universal message should be read and enjoyed by every American, Asian or no. Props to Ed Lin!"},{"Title":"Waylaid","review":"The nameless narrator of this short novel is a twelve-year old Chinese-American boy who is struggling to grow up and finish school, while working in the decrepit seaside motel run by his parents. The motel is a dingy and depressing place, catering to transients and the down-and-out. Our narrator attends school and works at the motel and dreams of having his first sexual experience.Not a novel of complex ideas but of sad and desperate yearnings. Things get worse when the young man's father has a stroke, and the little family is no longer able to maintain the business. What will happen to them now?Despite its dreary theme, the book is endearingly funny, with snappy dialogue, and unexpected tragicomic scenes. It paints a searing picture of loneliness, struggle, and alientation--the American dream's dark side. It is well written and well worth reading. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber"},{"Title":"Waylaid","review":"I picked this book up at the library as I remembered seeing stuff that was on the cover before, I live in NJ too, as this book is set in NJ. I loved this book, it ranks right up there with Green Grass Grace by Shawn McBride. I read it all in 3 hours. Great book. A great read for a rainy afternoon or a hot day at the beach."},{"Title":"Waylaid","review":"This is a terrific first novel that hits all the great themes: struggle for identity, sexual discovery, and the tension between familial duty and rebellion. Waylaid is good, simple story telling that is steadily entertaining while also enlightening. Congratulations to Ed Lin, who I'd never heard of before but who I look forward to reading again. This book deserves more notice than it has received."},{"Title":"Waylaid","review":"WAYLAID does exactly that to readers. It takes them on a journey ostensibly to the gritty world of the Jersey Shore back in the 1980s but really to the mind of a 12-year-old Chinese American boy who's stuck manning the counter of his parents' fleabag motel.To some, that description might sound depressing. But to others, it's the recipe for drama. And even to some 12-year-olds, a dream job.Whatever the case, the book sucks you in into a world peopled by unforgettable characters. The strongest trait of the book, however, is by far the voice of the protagonist. It's a refreshing air of irreverence filled with longing that forces you to read on.If you're into books about yuppie Asian American success stories or Asian American versions of chick-lit, complete with at least a dozen references to various Korean dishes, this book really isn't going to do it for you. But if you want to read a book that's real, WAYLAID is about as good a start as you can get.This book is a book that I wish I could have written. It's genuine and it's got heart. And on top of everything, it has tons of laugh-out-loud moments that will delight you even in the face of the dark realities it depicts. It also helped me to write LAS CUCARACHAS, my second novel."},{"Title":"Waylaid","review":"Great book! Very well written. The situations are depressing but the dialogue is so snappy and witty that the book is almost a quasi comedy. I love how it moves away from the typical Asian American immigrant story to something darker and is definitely more sexually explicit than most books in the same genre.This book has universal appeal. It's not just an Asian American book nor a minority experience book. There's a part of the book that speaks to all of us."},{"Title":"Waylaid","review":"This novel of a young Chinese American is a classic bildungsroman in the Bukowski \\"Ham on Rye\\" sense. America in the 70' and 80's suffered from a dilapidated post-vietnam depression that is captured very accurately here. You can see the paint rotting off the wood in Lin's world. His world is gritty, reminding me of the LA suburb that Bukowski describes and the contstant excess he was faced with as well. He is faced with prostitutes on a daily basis. Older men befriend him and treat him like an adult; only to fall to vice and the police later on. In some ways, this book is a mirror reflecting so many struggles people face in pulling themselves from the mediocrity or our childhood years."},{"Title":"Waylaid","review":"A beguiling and bittersweet coming-of-age tale told from a unique perspective.

The way Ed has pulled this book through is amazing.I need to read his latest book.5 stars."},{"Title":"Waylaid","review":"Waylaid by Ed Lin is the antithesis of the typical (or stereotypical) Asian-American account of academic or personal success in America. Ed Lin describes a different slice of Asian-America - one told through the eyes of a twelve year old Taiwanese American whose parents own and inhabit a drab roadside motel in a nameless section of Jersey. If Los Angeles and New York are the epicenters of East Asian success, Ed Lin's New Jersey is the hushed corner of Americana where an alternative Asian saga unfolds.The moldy motel where our narrator relates his experience is populated by a randy cast of characters: hookers and johns, transient war veterans and overbearing Asian mothers. The narrator's preoccupation with losing his virginity amidst the comings and goings of the motel's sexual clientele revealed a side of my own self which identified with the trappings of obsession. Much like him, the exposure to sexual imagery turned me on at an early age to a decidedly adult subject.After reading Lin's gorgeous piece of fiction, the greatest comfort is in the knowledge that we understand each other: both of us grew up in the shadow of Asian American stardom."},{"Title":"Waylaid","review":"Lin tells an amazing story that is devoid of pretense and is richly heartfelt.

The cover stock is so stiff and the margins in the spine-side of the pages are so narrow that I am using muscles in my hand that I didn't know I had - just to keep the book open and view all of the print.

Full of interesting old maps, illustrations, and diaries, the book takes the reader along on the perilous voyages of the 15th-17th century explorers whose expeditions changed the world forever. Beginning with a description of the medieval view of a small world populated by mythical monsters, AGE OF EXPLORATION shows how the quest for gold, spices, and converts inadvertently created new views of reality and shifts in political power. While capturing the wonder of Europe's Renaissance \\"discoveries,\\" the book does not romanticize these voyages, plagued as they were by starvation, scurvy, mutiny, and inhumanity toward the new lands' native inhabitants. Even as the world map grew larger and more accurate, myths stubbornly persisted, whether in the form of Columbus's continued belief that he'd reached the Indies or Vasco de Gama's insistence that the Hindus he met in India were Christians. Ironically, if not for these myths--and the exaggerated tales the explorers told upon return--interest in sponsoring more voyages would probably have waned."},{"Title":"Age of exploration, (Great ages of man, a history of the world's cultures)","review":"Came in great condition, working on completing the series.

This book is written so that the average home owner or buyer, as well as the Skilled Professional Home Inspector, will gain valuable information about the many areas that need to be checked when buying or inspecting a home. As a ASHI Certified Inspector I find this book to be a excellent reference book, and I refer to it often. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to gain valuable information about Buying, Inspecting, or maintaining a home."},{"Title":"The complete book of home inspection: For the buyer or owner","review":"This third edition of the book contains a lot of information for would be home buyers, whom the author claims is his target audience. I definitely wish I had read it before I bought my first house. It'll help you evaluate the condition of items from your roof down to your crawl space or basement and everything in between. It is written in an easy-to-understand format and is well organized so you can find exactly what you are looking for.I am studying to become a home inspector myself and found this book to be a very useful first step. The North Carolina Home Inspection licensing bureau still pulls quite a few questions for their licensing test from this edition of the book."},{"Title":"The complete book of home inspection: For the buyer or owner","review":"This book was actually written by the man who founded the American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI). Great information."},{"Title":"The complete book of home inspection: For the buyer or owner","review":"It was very informative! It is good to have a book like this ,that way if you ever buyanother home,you will know what is going on when they inspect your home!"},{"Title":"The complete book of home inspection: For the buyer or owner","review":"If you are looking for a book that will teach you a lot about real estate and home inspections then this is not the book for you. The chapter information and text content of this book was very basic and did not teach me anything I didn't already learn from other books that were much better. Inspecting homes is something I have done for many years and I would not recommend this book to any customers or contractors. If you know absolutely nothing about real estate then you might learn a few things but not too much."},{"Title":"The complete book of home inspection: For the buyer or owner","review":"We have a home inspection business and I read many books on real estate topics. This book was OK but certainly not worth recommending to our inspection clients. Some of the topics discussed are irrelevant to home inspections - such as mold! There were many topics lacking in the amount of information the author provided. Maybe if you don't know anything about houses or construction you might learn a little bit from this book. If you have a novice level of knowledge about house inspections then you should buy a different book since this book won't teach you anything new."},{"Title":"The complete book of home inspection: For the buyer or owner","review":"Despite the flaws in this book I haven't seen a better book for home buyers and owners. (Although it might not be obvious that is who this book is targetted at, not professional inspectors.) So if you are in the market for a house I would recommend you at least browse through this book.The good parts are that the author lays out a methodical approach to inspecting a house and usually includes good descriptions of how to investigate and evaluate the various components and systems of the house. The end of most chapters contains a checkpoint summary of that chapter.The downsides are that the information in the book is almost a decade old now; this second version was published in 1993. Sometimes the author assumes knowledge that I didn't have. The book is targetted at a lay audience but doesn't really have enough illustrations and definitions and examples to really deliver on this promise. For instance, when inspecting a hot-water heating system he says, &quot;A forced system will have a circulating pump in the return line near the boiler.&quot; It would be nice a picture was shown to illustrate the difference between having a circulating pump and not having one.Also, the author gets something wrong in at least one place. When talking about tankless water heaters he says, &quot;From an energy-conservation point of view, a tankless water heater is not desirable. It is inefficient and wasteful of energy.&quot; This is untrue today and I doubt whether it was true when the book was written. The US Department of Energy in their reference brief on tankless heaters acknowledges that tankless heaters are more efficient and less wasteful of energy; that is part of the reason they are used in Europe and Japan where energy prices are higher than here in America. They also tend to have longer life expectancies than conventional tank heaters.I find the author's statements strange because they make little sense. It also makes me a little worried because now I wonder what else he got wrong that I don't know about. Despite this, I still think the book is very useful to potential home buyers."},{"Title":"The complete book of home inspection: For the buyer or owner","review":"This book covers all the major components of home inspection. It is not so obvious by its content that it is intended primarily for the home buyer. I definitely recommend it to home inspectors as it is as good a reference as any of the books written for home inspectors. There are a lot of first-hand cases experienced by the author in lower New York that will give helpful inspection clues to buyers/inspectors. Unfortunately I do not consider the book the &quot;bible&quot; of home inspection. I have not yet come across such a book.. when I do I'll be sure to let you know (in its own review)."},{"Title":"The complete book of home inspection: For the buyer or owner","review":"I found this book to be very readable even to a home repair novice like me. It contains a lot of information about what to look for when buying a house, and additional information about how houses are constructed which should be useful when maintaining one. I read 3 such books and this is by far the best."},{"Title":"The complete book of home inspection: For the buyer or owner","review":"For a new home owner or home inspector, this book is a good, basic book that even a lay person can understand (one that has no knowledge of the field).

I highly recommend this for someone starting out in the business as a reference book."},{"Title":"The complete book of home inspection: For the buyer or owner","review":"As a new comer to the home inspection business I was looking for a book to give me the basics. Based on a colleague's recommendation I bought Norman Becker's book and I want to commend him....it covers more than just the basics, it's a very indepth discussion of ALL, and I mean ALL, of the problems and issues one encounters as a home inspector or a new home buyer. It is written in a style that makes not only pleasant reading, but Norman explains the issues in simple, easily understood language, whether you're an inspector just entering the business, a long term experienced inspector or new home buyers, first out of school or an experienced, ready to retire buyer! It's not easy to satisfy such a wide spectrum, but Norman does it extremely well, making easy and enjoyable reading for all who have the interest or need.As for technical content, I say again that the book covers everything one needs to know about the subject, so much so that I keep one copy on my office desk and another in the car so I have quick access to an excellent reference guide at all times.It has never failed me when I needed a quick update on any issue, no matter how small or big. You know how you often check to make sure you have your wallet in your pocket when you leave the house....well I make that same check to be sure I have Norm Becker's book within my reach at all times.I'm sure the book not only satisfy's an individual's need such as mine, but from the quality of its content, I believe it has made, and will continue to make, a positive impact on our home inspection industry.Please thank Mr. Becker for making this home inspector's entry into the field not only more effective but easier and more pleasant.Bill Mason,"},{"Title":"The complete book of home inspection: For the buyer or owner","review":"As a Commercial and Residential Inspector, I found this book to be a good reference book over many other's I have purchased to learn more about performing good inspections.

I still find myself referring to it. Every good inspector has read this book and anyone thinking about doing home inspections should read it. The book is clearly written and covers all of a homes systems (the new edition has the latest topics), explaining how each system works and what to look for when checking it. It gives good detail without getting overly technical and is easy to read. Home buyers should read this book so that they are well informed about their biggest purchase and will know what to look for and what questions to ask when they find their potential new home."},{"Title":"The complete book of home inspection: For the buyer or owner","review":"This book thoroughly walks the reader through the home inspection procedure in a step-by-step fashion. It is definitely worth buying and reading. Some chapters, such as the one on wood-destroying insects, have much detail. Others have a bit less detail and would benefit from additional illustrations and text. The author focuses on safety and cost considerations in performing home inspections. Sometimes he is a little puritanical in championing safety considerations first, but it's hard to knock that. He gives many useful tips to the novice home inspector, for example on how to check septic systems for proper function. I've read this book once over and have reread some chapters. It deserves careful study of the individual chapters. I intend to carry the book with me when I look through prospective houses."},{"Title":"The complete book of home inspection: For the buyer or owner","review":"Most books of this type are written by people with little understanding of the engineering involved in pre-purchase home inspections.

There are two pages for the numbers one through ten. The first page shows the number, with the name of the number in English and Spanish. On the facing page is a picture, with as many instances of that object as go with the number.The illustrations in MY NUMBERS/MIS NUMEROS are spectacular. They look as if they were made using cutouts of construction paper, and combine overall simplicity with some fascinating detail. For example, for the number one the illustration is of a salamander with little round ends to his toes. My son puts his finger out and traces over the shapes with fascination. Each of the ten illustrations is excellent.My 10-month old son loves MY NUMBERS/MIS NUMEROS. It is one that he will pull out of the book basket and look at at on his own. A good friend of mine, an artists and former teacher, loves it. Her 2 year old son also enjoyed reading this book, enough that we read it over and over when I recently babysat him. I am also enjoying MY NUMBERS/MIS NUMEROS as a way to brush up on a bit of my Spanish.The vocabulary: 1 salamander, 2 leaves, 3 strawberries, 4 hearts, 5 carrots, 6 snakes, 7 stars, 8 bumblebees, 9 ladybugs, and 10 butterflies."},{"Title":"My Numbers/Mis Numeros","review":"I have been using this entire series with my son since he was born, and he is now 14 months.

There are 4 in the series. Numbers, Shapes, Colours, and Opposites.All equally good."},{"Title":"My Numbers/Mis Numeros","review":"A enjoy looking at this book just as much as my children do. I am a mother of 4 and a preschool teacher. The colors in this book are simple and bold. It is a great resource for teaching Spanish/English and numbers in the classroom. I like the fact that the Spanish words are not the simplest choices. It challenges the Spanish learner in me. I use this book with pre-schoolers mainly 2 year olds. It is easily adaptable to the older classroom learning Spanish."},{"Title":"My Numbers/Mis Numeros","review":"This whole series is useless. Each of the books has words that are translated incorrectly, and/or are plain poor choices (such as selecting items that have different regional names in different Spanish-speaking countries).For example, in this book, \\"Salamander\\" is translated as \\"Lagartija\\". Really? The Spanish word for Salamander is \\"Salamandra\\" (\\"lagartija\\" means lizard - which is a reptile - while salamanders are amphibians - totally different groups of animals).In addition, often there is no gender correspondence between the translation and the selected object. For example, the number \\"one\\" is translated as \\"uno\\" (which is correct). But then, she chooses a word that is feminine (\\"La Lagartija\\", making it \\"UNA lagartija\\"). Given that there are thousands and thousands of words in Spanish, why not choose one where both instances of the translation match? Especially since there is no explanation on how nouns in Spanish are associated with a gender (unlike English, where most words are gender neutral).In the back cover of all this collection, the word \\"collect\\" is translated as \\"recolecta\\", which would be equivalent to \\"gather\\". The correct word would be \\"colecciona\\".In a book that has about 10 words total, and designed to teach a foreign language, these errors are unforgivable."},{"Title":"My Numbers/Mis Numeros","review":"This series of books is lovely, colorful and easy to read to our baby.

After he outgrows these books, we are looking forward to utilizing them as a resource for art projects.

Written originally in 1922, and published by Abingdon-Cokebury Press for the 1952 version we have, it is a simple, yet profoundly DEEP little book that makes one wonder how we, as a nation, could have remotely grown so far apart from God!This little book reveals that Truth is Truth for all time, and that no matter the generation, there are always those who DO know the Father's Face and Touch of His Hand! As the beginning sentences of the preface states, \\"Everyone may and can live abundantly. The business of life is to live and to live well and adequately and abundantly. But this age knows almost everything about life except how to live it. It is not enough to know ABOUT life -we must know HOW TO LIVE life.\\" And those four sentences were written 52 years ago!What does it say about our age? I think, namely that we have grown so vain and self-absorbed that we have not taken the time to give of ourselves, but only sought to see what we could gain. This little book should be on everyone's coffee table wish list ... not for its looks, but the depth of the nuggets of Wisdom it contains!"},{"Title":"Abundant Living","review":"After nine years of recovery, and reading many different kinds of books on recovery, religion, spirituality, etc., I've come to many authors that I fully enjoy.

Switched this spring to two different Jones books, this one, and \\"The Way\\". One in the morning, one at night.

The guys around him are calling to him, however he can't hear them because of the rattling tin so close to his ear.So often we are like that, God is speaking but the rattling tin of the world drowns out His voice.

I still have the first edition. I've been using this book since college. I have managed hundreds of programming projects and found this book (and earlier editions) a must. All my projects originate around this process. The result is having my programming projects on time and on budget."},{"Title":"Managing a Programming Project","review":"In 1983, I was privileged to attend a one week project management course put on IBM. It was an excellent course. But perhaps the best thing about the course was that IBM gave each student a new copy of two books that were essential to appreciating the material taught in the course. The two books were \\"The Effective Executive\\" by Peter Drucker and \\"Managing a Programming Project\\" by Phillip Metzger. These two books still probably stand today as the two really essential guides to effectiveness in a modern career in information technology. I've just now finished rereading Metzger's wonderful book. And it seemed therefore a fine occasion to offer some thoughts on this truly wonderful book.The book presents a simple, easy to understand, yet complete and rigorous guide to the management of a software development project. Metzger takes the posture that his reader is the manager of a moderately sized software development project. Interestingly, his definition of a moderately sized project, when the book was first written, now three decades ago, was a team of approximately forty individual contributors with the appropriate levels of management. Today, we have learned to run most of our software projects leaner. However, the teachings that Metzger shares still resonate.Metzger's book actually goes quite well both with Drucker's classic on general management, \\"The Effective Executive\\", and with \\"The Mythical Man-month\\" by Frederick Brooks. All three of these excellent books provide the reader with sound guidelines and wonderfully tried and true philosophical statements relative to the accomplishment of work in modern organizations. We strongly recommend all three. Yet, Metzger's book, in a way, stands apart. I'd direct the attention of readers in particular to Metzger's final chapter on making a difference. There, Mr. Metzger shares that a manager can, and does, make a huge difference in the lives of people around him. It is vital to keep in mind that this difference can be hugely positive, or otherwise, dependent entirely on how thoughtfully and carefully the manager goes about his important business. It is a tremendously important lesson for all those blessed with significant responsibility in modern organizations. If you are so charged, I commend this wonderful book to you strongly. God bless."},{"Title":"Managing a Programming Project","review":"i am sure this book is very helpful for most programmer, manager and even though you are beside of programming business.but, the writer wrote this book with a lot of old word or slang like.i am not the native speaker, so i put my dictionary on my desk when i read this book.but, the content itself is wonderful.."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"When I was little, my dad used to read this book to me every night before I went to sleep...I enjoyed it very much!

I cannot give it five stars for two main reasons: Interpretation and Ethnicity.I agree with the other reviews that I find myself hesitating as I read. The editors draw conclusions about texts. I believe it's ok to infer things from context, but if the Bible didn't say it, then don't mention how God 'feels'. I'd rather read the passage, ask my kids questions, then help them find the theme for themselves. Granted it's hard to get my kids inductively looking at scripture at age 3&5 BUT I think its good to make them think and start letting God help them interpret.The next big issue is the artwork. My wife and I have purchased other Bibles for our children that have WAY more multiethnic images than this. A Blonde hair blue eye Jesus is a cultural lie from the pit of Hell in my opinion and is a hindrance to talking about Jesus to various cultures. We used this as part of our homeschool Sonlight curriculum and their other reading material is wonderfully multi class AND multi racial- So I was surprised at the Bible Choice.That being said, the book is a great summation of most of the overarching themes/stories (you lose the minor prophets in the OT).

It is an excellent book for children, with many pictures. Each story is accompanied by the scripture reference that the story is taken from. A basic for any Christian home library."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"This book has interesting pictures for small children as well as the scripture each \\"story\\" is taken from.

It is a nice starting point to jog your memory on so many great adventures from the Bible!"},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"I had this for my kids when they were young and loved it. Later gave it to my married daughter, but it got lost when her house burned. I was so glad to find this book again. So I purchased for my grandchildren. You never get too old to teach little ones about God."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"I absolutely love this bible. We have 2 young boys and have read several childrens bibles all the way through with them. They enjoy this bible and even I am learning things from it. It weaves into the text cultural and contextual facts that aren't always obvious when you read scriptures and it very clearly presents each story and brings it to life in a way that is understandable for even our young kids. I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"This is the bible story book I grew up with. My mother or father read it to my siblings and I every night. Despite a close to 7 year age gap between myself and the 'baby' this daily event was educational and a pleasure to us all for many years. Much of my bible knowledge came from the repetition of hearing those stories year after year. As another review has stated, this retelling includes more of the bible than other bible story books I have seen, enabling a fuller familiarity with the framework of the whole bible. An excellent family devotional for 2-92."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"I was brought up with family reading time every day from Egermeier's Bible Story Book. It is still the best one available by far! After a long search we found the book and were delighted to receive a 42 year old edition in very good shape, and just in time to present it to our daughter for her baby shower. Thanks for a successful end to our search!"},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"This book is fine for any age that would like to learn Bible history. The stories go from creation to the early church. Children like the stories that follow the Bible very closely and adults get a great over view of Bible History...now it is easy to know when the divided kingdom started and who were the kings of Judah and the North and when the different prophets had their time of ministry."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"Egermeiers Bible Story Book is a classic children's Bible story book which has been around for many years. It basically tells both the Old and New Testaments in story form while staying very true to the biblical text. It is an excellent beginning source for those who want their children to have a familiarity with the scriptures."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"My grandmother read this book to my father, my father read it to me and I read it to my children. The bible stories are real--captivating and true to scripture! What an awesome way to pass down a heritage of faith!"},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"We read from the bible, from a bible comic book and this bible story book.This is a great addition to our family readings of scripture. Our even a 3 year old can listen and get a thought out of this.Wonderful. Even I learned some new things/perspectives.Very insightful. Just enough for little ones.We do emphasize that these are not pretend stories, but true stories from the bible. We don't want them to mistakenly grow up thinking that these are false little fairy tales that never happened."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"My mother used this book when I was a child, now I'm a grandfather. It's still one of the best written for multiple ages. The stories are usually 1-2 pages long. We love giving Egermeier's Bible Story Book to new parents as a shower gift."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!! This is our transitioning Bible. Our son is 4.5 years old and needed more than a page of \\"babied\\" over Bible stories. He loves it! He also is asking more questions... if you are not prepared for this than you might need to stay with the other \\"baby\\" Bibles. This is exactly what we wanted and needed to get into more deep conversations."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"We bought this Bible for our niece's 1st Communion. I think it would make an excellent 1st Communion gift! We also bought the Golden Book Bible, so that we could compare the two. My husband and I both liked Egermeier's better. I tried reading it to my 5 year old, but it didn't hold his attention. I think it would be a great Bible for a 7 or 8 year old. It has a picture about every 2 pages. I think that if it had a picture on every page, it would hold our son's attention. The Golden Book Bible was very good, and it had pictures on every page. I think Egermeier's is easier for a child to read and understand! I have really enjoyed reading it myself. I have a hard time putting it down! We will definitely buy one for our children when they get a little older, and we look forward to reading it to them! I also thought it was a great price on amazon!"},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"This is the same Bible story book that my mother read to me.

I recommend it for your home."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"My ten year old reads this bible. She has tried other children's bibles but this one is easy for her to follow and she is able to clearly retell the stories and characters with no problem Other Bibles have more and better pictures but she prefers this one for readability."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"My Grandparents gave me this book for my first Christmas in 1954. I remember my parents reading it to me and I used it to homeschool my children. A great gift for any child.It covers the Bible from Genesis to Revelation in a manner that children can understand, but not so simple that adults can't learn from it."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"My most vivid memories as a child are of my dad reading this book to us, every night before my siblings & I would go to bed. It is such a wonderfully accurate book that teaches so many truths about the word of God in such a wonderful way! I am ordering some now to give as gifts, and to read begin to read them to my baby boy. I am so glad it is still in print!"},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"We are a homeschool family and have used Egermeier's Bible Story Book to give our children a complete overview of scripture in preparation for reading on their own. Excellent for adults who have never read through the bible and want a faster way to get the whole picture. This story bible includes more stories than others we've seen and tackles some of the more difficult issues gracefully. Although simplified, the content is not &quot;dumbed down&quot;. This one gets passed on.."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"The finest, most biblically accurate children's bible story book I've ever seen. Originally printed in 1923, this book brings biblical truths alive in over 275 stories which have enlightened and emboldened my six year old with God's word. Controversial subject/situations; adultery (King David), murder, multiple wives (Jacob, etc.), homosexuality (Sodom &amp; Gomorah), etc.are treated sensitively, respectfully, without error, but entirely appropriate for kids. I am making this a MUST gift for all new parents."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"I have read numerous Bible story books with my ds (age 7) over the years. We probably own ten different ones, easily. Most have cartoonish pictures and repeat the same stories with the same basic parts of the story (leaving out lots of details). We read Egermeier's last year, and we are more than half way through it a second time. He just absolutely loves it. It was not unusual at all for him to beg me to keep reading!Egermeier's has almost all the Bible stories there are (with a very few exceptions). Those stories that ds had heard many times before often included details he hadn't heard before. It made the Bible come alive for him. Any Bible story book that leaves the children begging for more is a winner in my book! It was enjoyable to me to read it as well.I would highly recommend it to any one who wants to move on to something meatier than your run of the mill cartoonish Bible story book for children. I also think it is worth reading through for a second time. It is definitely a keeper!"},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"This is a book that I have read and had read to me many times. It is the Bible Story Book that my parents read to me before I was old enough to read, and I continued to read the wonderful Bible stories on my own for many years. I purchased a copy for my child and each of my grand children as well as the children of many of my relatives. The stories are presented in language that is easy for children to understand, and is exciting for them to hear and read. The only way to really appreciate this book is to read it aloud with children, listen to their questions and comments, and share with them the great stories of the Bible. To say the least, I highly reccommend this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"This is mostly a wonderful, in depth Bible stories collection. It includes many narratives from the Bible that most children's books leave out, but softens or skips the less age-appropriate elements like incest and promiscuity. It's very approachable, even a 4 or 5 year old can listen and understand it quite well.There is just one major problem I run into over and over in it though: the author makes assumptions as to the thoughts, feelings, and intentions of the people and even of God, interpretations not present in the actual Bible. It's fine to discuss possible or likely thoughts, feelings, and intentions, but adding it amidst things otherwise faithfully paraphrased is confusing and awkward. I find myself needing to skip the sentences she does this in, sometimes catching it in the middle and stopping, or discussing it further with my son to clarify.There aren't as many pictures as in many bible story books and it does take longer to get through each part than in others. The inclusion of so much more than the big children's Bible stories (you know, just covering Eden, Noah, David&Goliath;, Daniel, Jonah, and similar condensing in the NT) is great though and hitting almost all the points of each story is excellent.I would still recommend the book, but read aloud with caution. Take care with the interjections and interpretations, especially of what God intended to do or felt, as they're based on tradition and opinion not scripture."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"If you are looking to share the TRUTH with children about the Holy Scriptures, this is the ONLY Bible story book to consider.This well-done, intellegently-easy-to-understand book (which was originally written in the early 1900's...this version is mildly abridged) uses God-inspired TRUTH to captivate it's audience rather than cartoons and silly nonsense.If you are looking to avoid the 'dumbing down' of God's Holy Word, sticking as close to Scripture without the extra details that lose those of a shorter attention span, THIS is your book!Invest in this gem with confidence...you'll enjoy it as much as the children :)"},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"We own many Bible story books, but this one is my favorite. We read from this book every day, and the kids love it. It includes stories that are left out of many children's Bible story books. It is wonderful to read in order, and it really keeps the attention of the children. When it's time to shut the book, my kids say, \\"What's the story for tomorrow called, Mommy?\\", because they so look forward to reading this book."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"When I was a young girl, I had this Bible story book. And when our children were born, we bought the same book for them. I am now purchasing one for our first grandchild. This Bible story is very true to actual Bible, which is very important. There are no denominational \\"spins\\" on the greatest story every told. The individual stories are short enough for a bedtime story. The reading level is easy for a young child to understand when the stories are read to them, but a high enough level that older children enjoy them as well. I highly recommend this Bible story book for anyone wanting their children or grandchildren to learn the real truth of God's word."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"This is an excellent bible story book. I read it to my children everyday. I love Egermeier approach to topics that would be hard to explain to little ones."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"I had this book when I was a child and loved to read it before bed. I'm now 32, with 2 small children. I found this in a box when we moved and got it back out. I'm actually really enjoying reading it myself. I had wanted to go back and read the Old Testament through to get more of an overview, but it's so confusing sometimes with all the different kings and countries trying to really determine what is relevant to each story. This is perfect for reading through the Bible to get a \\"big picture\\" overview. Then you can go back to your study Bible for in depth study. I had just bought a simpler one for my 4 and 5 year olds, but when we finish it, I'll start on this one to read to them as well."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"The stories are wonderful, the same as the book I read as a child. But the illustrations have been changed and they are not as good."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"When my brother and I were children, my dad read this to us almost every night. We are 63 and 65, both serving God. I gave one of these to each of my 3 adult children so they could continue the tradition with my grandchildren. I honestly believe that is why I know the Old Testament as well as I do. It is a great, easy to understand, Bible story book."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"I like this Bible because it's a paraphrase, and thus easier for children to understand, and because it has pretty illustrations. The translation is a little awkward and a little old-fashioned, but the author has some fascinating insights into the Bible that have enhanced my understanding."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"This item was received quickly and in perfect condition.

I specifically ordered the edition that she had when she was young. The supplier showed a picture of that edition, which by the way is the same as you have pictured in this email to me. I paid considerably more for it (twice what I've seen the newer edition advertised for) because the older edition is now out of print. The supplier stated that he had one copy of the older edition left, which was still in its original wrapping. However, when the woman received the book, it was the newer edition. She was thrilled nonetheless, and has read it, as she said, \\"Like a dessert you want to savor and never finish.\\" The woman patient is very happy about the quality of the illustrations in the book, despite the fact that they are not the pictures she remembers. I never told her that the book she received is not what I thought I was purchasing. I'm happy because she's happy. But I know I paid more for a book that she never received. I feel that I've been had. I purchase very few items on line (maybe three things in my life) because I haven't trusted the sellers. My lack of trust has not improved by my experience of purchasing Egermeier's Bible Story Book through Amazon."},{"Title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"This is the Bible Story book I grew up with. As a child I liked the pictures and still am grateful that the people look real and aren't cartoon characters. It helps you realize these are actual events that happened.

I learned about this book from Joe McGee."},{"Title":"John Jay, Defender Of Liberty Against Kings & Peoples (History - United States)","review":"John Jay until quite recently, had been largely forgotten as one of the country's founding fathers. He was a devout Christian, quite pious, a family man, an exempliary law expert (was the first chief justice of the supreme court), at one time the president of the United States (pre-constitution days), governor of New York State, Foreign Minister, Federalist, fiercely anti-slavery, President of the American Bible Society, and above all, an American at heart.This biography, written in 1935 by Frank Monaghan was quite comprehensive and very informative in covering most of Jay's political, judicial and social life, including most of the relevent history of the time. The writing style was slightly dry when compared to a McCollough or Dinker Bowen biography, but generally the story of Jay's life was quite interesting. Monaghan credits Jay with being an early federalist at a time when most people were either patriots or indifferent or tories. Jay seemed to be neither. He fiercely loved this country, but he also was able to view human machinations for what they were. He was present at the continental congresses but didn't get to sign the declaration of independance because he had to return home to attend to some responsibilities. He was also one of the authors of the Federalist Papers along with Hamilton and Madison. He never shirked from responsibility even when it was fashionable to do so (during the years under the articles of confederation). He refused to answer ill for ill; this being an unheard of behavior in today's acidicly partison times: interesting to note that the early days of this country were also dreadfully partison at times. He helped form many of the statutes and customs of the supreme court was was THE MODEL of judicial restraint, refusing to even hear a case for the first year and a half. Interestingly enough, Jay's time on the supreme court came to an end because he resigned partly due to the fact that the circuit court responsibilities (which the supreme court justices were required to serve on back then) required extensive travel all over the country and had the results of being physically draining and an impediment to seeing his family.All in all, this was a very good book about John Jay. I found him to be of the same caliber as any of the other founding fathers that today we recognize. If you have any interest in American history or if you are interested in law, I would recommend this book whole heartedly. Fan's of Christians in politics and judicial systems would also find this book quite interesting and enjoyable."},{"Title":"I Wouldn't Be Scared","review":"Beautiful book by an amazing artist and author.

When I finished book one, I began to wonder if I should read the others. I am not a wimp, except when it comes to animals getting hurt (having wittnessed a dog/cat attack, which still gives me nightmares) I had some serious doubts about continuing with this series. But I sucked it up and went on to read book two. As I finished that one I remembered the line that the little boy said to his grandfather in 'Princess Bride: Jesus, Grandpa! What did you read me this thing for?'. I commend those of you who can read these books and enjoy them, I however find them what what...dispiriting."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Though my daughter was thrilled to get this book for her collection, I have to say I was slightly disappointed.

While I had a great time reading it, while it was well written, and while I was unable to put it down for 3 hours straight, it simply does not deserve that high of a rating.There are two major flaws to this book: the Cheese factor and the Weirdness factor. The Cheese factor is very high on this book, simply meaning that it is a light-hearted, entertaining romp that is at first spellbinding, but after a while fades into cheesiness.The second factor is definitely the more serious one: the Weirdness factor. In this case, the Weirdness level is off the scale. I'm not arguing the book was stupid, but most people are hesitant to sit through 288 pages of kitty warfare. The whole concept is far from creative and crosses into the bizarre zone.Warriors: Into the Wild is a good light read, but relies on a secularism that will leave readers puzzled."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I must admit that I have not read this book. However, Gabriel King published \\"The Wild Road\\" in 1999. I did read that book and it's sequel \\"The Golden Cat\\". This is not an original idea. I gave it 3 stars because a book about cats can't be bad at all."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I purchased this relatively unknown book due, in part, to the positive reviews. I was misled. As an avid reader, this book was underdeveloped and poorly written. The numerous typos are distracting and the characters lack depth. I forced myself to read the book, hoping it would improve but it did not. Save your money do not buy this book or anything by this author."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"The plot is original and refreshing, but the story is written in a bland, Disney way. The author tries to put in twists and turns in the plot, but it was all very predictable. She tried to define the character's personlities, but waht should be done in a subtle, quiet way had to basicaly be written down in bold faced ink. The plot centers too much around Firepaw, and I found it annoying that he was glorified above all the other apprentices. He also seemed to be the only one able to see certain betrayels, and he was always the glorious leader, disobeying rules and being portrayed as a hero, much like Harry Potter.I was hoping that the underdogs (Graypaw, Whitestorm, BLuestar, Ravenpaw, Yellowfang, etc.) would get some of the spotlight and credit in this book, but as I said the story is very Disney-like. The hero is a handsome thinker and rule-bender who wins the heart of a pretty female blah blah blah. The book shows a black and white portrayel of good and evil, and we all know it is not like that at all. Books that show the good guys' and bad guys' motives, allowing you a deeper understanding of the book and the world, is what I wanted, and I was grossly disapointed. The characters were not feline either, they took on many human traits...they just didn't act like cats. Anyone who has read David-Clement Davies or Richard Adams will not enjoy this book. I think that either one of these authors could have done so much more with this plot and the characters' developement...the black and white portrayal in this book is a bog turn off for me."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I'm 60 years old and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these books.

Soon, he figures out about conflicts and various happenings that have been going on. He is especially suspicious of the clan's deputy, Tigerclaw. With his new friends Graypaw and Ravenpaw, he begins the search for the truth.Gripping, imaginative, and realistic, these books take you into the story. I highly reccomend them."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I loved this book! I strongly reccomend this to animal lovers and anybody who loves cats or nature. It is action packed! Chapers are always ended with suspense to keep you reading. Give it a try!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Erin Hunter did a beautifull job with this book. Be warned though, the first book is so thrilling and exciting, it creates a cliffhanger and you just have to read more!!! In this book, \\"Into the Wild\\", you follow the life of a young house cat named Rusty who discovers the ways of the wild cat clans that live in the nearby woods.Although he does become a clan apprentice, he is given a hard time about being a \\"kitty-pet\\", and not being clan born. Mysterious deaths are happening among the clan, and Rusty is determined to find out who or what is causing them. And what about the dark, mean Tigerclaw, Rusty's clan deputy?

I've read the first and second book - it's my favorite series!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I was skeptical about this book when I purchased it, but once I began reading, I could hardly put it down! I believe I read most of it in a period of 3 hours :) Erin Hunter really puts you into the book, as though you're watching from a spot on Firepaw's, or Fireheart's, shoulders. To me, this book has excellent imagery and I can easily see the surroundings the cats are in. When a book is so detailed like that and to me is like watching television, it is definetely a wonderful book. Not only is the writing excellent, but so is the actual plot. You definetely must read this amazing novel."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Warriors: Into the Wild is an absolutely fantastic book. Erin Hunter did great on this one. Rusty is a housecat who longs to live in the wild, and finally on eday his dream comes true. But the clan he joins is in grave danger, and he must protect his trusted clan from traitors on the outside. But are there traitors within his own clan that he doesn't know about?

Great for a eader of any age."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I think that this is a very good, thought out book. When I first saw it in the book store I was sort of interested in it but I didn't get it. I thought about it for awhile and the next time I came back I decided to just buy it and give it a try. I am glad that I did because it is turning out to be better than I thought and I can't for the next book!!!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"If you liked the Redwall series by Brian Jacques, you're gonna love Warriors. That is, if you like cats who act like cats. Mice, rabbits, and birds have the same kind of presence that fish do in Redwall: food. Matthias and Basil Stag Hare would not be in a good position here.The author, Erin Hunter, is actually not a person, but three people: Kate Cary (takes turn writing), Cherith Baldry (takes turn writing), and Victoria Holmes (comes up with ideas and monitors consistency). All live in the UK, and as quoted in the back of the book, are:\\". . . inspired by a love of cats and a fascination with the ferocity of the natural world.\\"Story overview:---------------A young \\"kittypet\\"-or so called by the Clans-named Rusty, lives a pleasant and comfortable life among the \\"twoleggs.\\" Though he spends many hours sitting on a fence looking into the forest, it wasn't until he became bold enough to go exploring that his life changed.While exploring, he was attacked by a cat named Graypaw. After fighting him off other, cats from the ThunderClan approached him. They made him an offer: join their clan and give up his \\"kittypet\\" life forever, and he will live as free cat. After giving it some thought, he decided to join.Life became difficult for Rusty. He was given a new name: Firepaw, and a new home. He learns what it means to be a part of something, to work hard, to have real friends, and to eat like a real cat. Once things start to fall into place, life for him becomes even more complicated when one of the other clans decides to take over all the territories. Now the lessons really begin as ThunderClan fights back, and the lives of his clan depend upon him.My thoughts:-------------The names thrown out at the beginning are enough to make one's head spin, but amazingly enough they are not that hard to follow. Hunter seems to have taken a Native American'ish approach to them: Bluestar, Lionheart, Tigerclaw, Spottedleaf, Ravenpaw, Speckletail, etc. As an author myself, there's a few areas where I would question the quality of the writing (adverb city, such as \\"Yellowfang replied dryly.\\" and \\"Firepaw meowed urgently;\\" as well as overuse of exclamation points and italics) but regardless of this, it flows pretty well. I would call this book a page turner and a must read for kids (and some adults too).James D. MaxonAuthor of Traphis: A Wizard's Tale"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I really enjoyed this book!!! You need to read at least the first two chapters to get into it. Near the end it turns into a bit of a mystery! Im not sure what someone who doesn't like cats would think, but me and my cat-loving friends can't get enough! This does have a bit of violence in it, but nothing too bad! But before you buy this book, make sure a library near you doesn't have it."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I had so much fun reading this with my 13 year old book after book, we laughed and cried at some of the endings!

She got thru Harry Potter and other great books before this, but it was not until this series that she started carrying her books around with her all day, so that she could sneak in a few paragraphs constantly throughout the day. She would read 8 hours straight if we didn't make her put her books down. Now we have to tell her to stop reading. I also read a book to her at night at bedtime. We like to find books that we both like including such great titles as The Golden Compass, which required quite a bit of explaining. She had already finished the Warrior series on her own, so when we finished our most recent book together, she requested that I read the Warrior series to her at bedtime because she wanted me to share it with her. I am pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this series is to read, especially out loud. We both like it. My daughter is 9."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"All of the Erin Hunter books are great! I just love them and have read them many times over. I am not a reader, I hate to read!!! But give me a Warrior series book and leave me alone for a few days. They are the best.

Thanks Erin for opening up a new world for me."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Yo! It's me, StoryMaker. My Mom was doing this Book-It homeschool program where we have to read a certain book or amount of books in order to get a coupon for a free Pizza Hut personal pan pizza. I'm not always thrilled about this, though. Unlike my sisters, I'm not such a huge reader. Sometimes, however, if a book is just right, it's possible I could get hooked. I usually like books more when they have a style or tone that is readable for the modern kid. I also like a nice, exciting plotline. A plotline is especially good for me if I can understand what the characters are feeling and why they do what they do and if I can feel for the characters. I also sometimes like books more if they aren't \\"chronicles\\" - that isn't to say I don't like a series that is chronicles, I just don't always favor a single book where the storyline is in little pieces (i.e. when it just goes from a single event to another single event - it isn't a single, smooth storyline, so it's harder to get hooked because the ending is not as anticipated because, well, there are lots of endings, so there's less of an urge to get to the end). This month, my sisters said this book (Warriors: Into the Wild) should be my goal and my Mom agreed. So, I ended up reading it. Turns out, this is a just-right book.What twolegs (clan-cat speak for \\"humans\\") do not realize is that clans of feral cats dominate the forest beneath their nose. The original four clans are ThunderClan, WindClan, RiverClan, and ShadowClan - and there's trouble within the clans. ThunderClan cats have fewer and fewer kits, which means fewer and fewer warriors. The clans are constantly fighting for food, so ThunderClan's lack of warriors makes it weaker. Plus, ShadowClan is being leaded by a fierce tyrant called Brokenstar, adding to the turmoil. Eventually, a group of heavenly cats called StarClan send a message to ThunderClan. The message is, indeed, the phrase on the back of the book: \\"Fire alone can save our clan.\\" Then, a daring kittypet (clan-cat speak for housecat) named Rusty ventures into the forest. Strange...his fur happens to be the color of fire. It isn't long before he gains his ThunderClan name, Firepaw...and then the adventure begins.One of the great things about this book's tone/style is that it seems good for the modern kid and for someone who likes classic books. This book really seems like it would be good for many different people. It's full of adventure and it really has all of the good-book requirements I've listed. Of course, I can't say it's perfect. It was a bit annoying that Firepaw didn't tell Bluestar, the clan leader, important information for feeble reasons. I'd also like to note that there is some somewhat detailed violence. Also, some folks (especially parents who ban Harry Potter) might believe the whole StarClan thing to be astrology. I don't really think the idea of StarClan is really harmful, though; after all, #1: It's just a fiction book and #2: It don't really think it's like they worship StarClan. Parents, if the violence and \\"astrology\\" worries you, simply read the book before you let your kid read it. When Harry Potter was new and folks complained about it being against religon, my Mom read it for herself in order to approve of it.I also really like the idea behind it: clans of wild cats, with the cats having different ranks and positions. This makes it great for RPGs and Fan Fiction. It's fun to make up your own forest with your own clans and members. In fact, we first heard of it on a message board where people were doing an RPG for it.Overall, I think that you should really give this book a try. Due to the violence, I think it's probably best if you are at least 9 if you read this. (Just BTW, at least 3 cats die in it.) Seriously, somebody who isn't such a big reader plowed through chapters in it...give it a chance. Signed, StoryMaker. \\"Gotta trust the kid's review!\\""},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Any cat lover or animal lover should read this series! My favorite thing to do after school is to sit on my bed, my cat curled up next to me, and read a warriors book. This book is a great start, explaining everything and getting you set up for the rest of the series. I am currently reading the new prophecy book #2, Moonrise. If you are just starting the series, here's something you should know: you have to read the books in order! And DON'T read the backs or the character lists of books ahead of you! I made the mistake of looking at the character list of the new prophecy book #4 (Starlight?) when I was reading book #4 of the regular Series, Rising Storm, and saw something that you will find out in the 6th book, Darkest Hour. This is a very good start to a very good series!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I won't say anything about the story (there are enough reviews already) except that it's about a kittypet (house cat) named Rusty that feels attracted to the wild forest. He eventually joins ThunderClan, one of 4 Clans, and becomes the apprentice Firepaw. Each book has its own great plot, and one big mystery that continues to fold out throughout the whole series. It's full of suspense, intrigue, mystery, action, friendship, grief, happiness, death, excitement (about... um... A LOT)... and of course cats! Each new book is better than the last. I have all of them except the New Prophecy (a runner-up series) #6 Sunset and the Power of Three (3rd runner-up) The Sight. Read them all. You'll be hooked. Then, after reading Warriors and at least some of The New Prophecy get Warriors Field Guide (contains spoilers!) and when you've finished Dawn (TNP #3) read the manga (The Lost Warrior). You'll become a HUGE fan. Oh, and a warning: if you buy a set or something with the first four, DO NOT, by any circumstances, read the fourth one without having the fifth one close by (I won't say why).

There are four clans of cats in the woods and he had joined Thunder Clan and the other clans are Shadow Clan, River Clan, and Wind Clan, which has recently gone missing.

Rusty is a housecat that looks outside every day, and meets cats from a forest Clan. He decides to join them. The cat gets a new name, Firepaw, and makes a friend, Graypaw. I won't give away any more of the story, but it does involve attacks from other clans, a possibly treacherous deputy, a pretty ThunderClan cat, an ambitious leader, and some doubts about being a 'kittypet', or housecat.Some exciting bits are when he's not exactly following the warrior code, fighting, and dealing with the ThunderClan deputy. Although this book is one of the best in the world, it isn't exceptionally well-written and the characters you want to see more of,(Spottedleaf, Lionheart, Mousefur, Runningwind), don't have very developed personalities.Still, you should read this and all the books to come!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I got this book from a friend on my birthday.I read the first centence and couldn't close the book.I felt like i was there in the forest.This \\"cat fiction\\" book is the best i've read.Everything is so detailed that its like a movie in your head.It's got everything.action,slow times,exiting,not romance but everything else its got.The point is...THAT THIS IS A REALLLLY GOOD BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"The whole series of these books so far, Into the Wild, and Fire and Ice, are some of the greatest books i have ever read.

Even some adults!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This is possibly one of the best books of all time (which I almost dare not say because of my faithfulness to the Animorphs series [which I also very highly recommend]). This action-packed tale is full of suspense and a must have for cat lovers. The author gives an idea of what might actually go on in our cats mind and shows how complicated cats really are.Here's the basic plot: Ther are four clans of wild cats that rule the forest, following laws laid down by their great ancestors. Anyone who disobeys these laws is punished. But humans are moving in, and prey is becoming scarce, so some clans are desperate enough to break one of the top laws, and are hunting in other clans' territories. Battles pursue and thus warriors now are becoming as scarce as the prey. One clan, the Thunderclan, is so desperate that they take in a \\"kittypet,\\" a cat raised by humans. Rusty, a young kitten, shows the skills needed to be a warrior, and is invited into the clan with the new name of Firepaw, even though some are not sure of his worth. More problems arise, and the story continues with several questions running through your head, one of which is this: Will Rusty prove his worth as a warrior, or be forbidden to forever live as a \\"kittypet\\"?This tale never quits surprising you. It's so good that as soon as I started reading it, I couldn't put it down, and thus finished the 272 paged book in half of a day (not that I'm saying it's too easy and is a kiddy book, it surely isn't, I'm ten in an advanced students program, TAG, and I enjoyed it and would recommend it to kids ranging from a smart 9 year old to a 12 year old, or even older). I can't wait to get the next one! I hope you liked my review, and enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"When I picked up the book for the first time, I couldn't put it down!

My 6-year old still insists on books with pictures most of the time but does not complain about listening to this at all. My 7-year old and I are riveted and having quite the bonding experience over this. Many of the reviews complain about confusion with the names but both my sons know exactly who is who, even when their names change with their rank (Firepaw the apprentice becomes Fireheart the warrior; leaders end with the suffix \\"star\\" and we've looked ahead in another book and see Firestar mentioned so we know Fireheart will one day become a leader). Even characters that have only popped up once or twice are easily recalled by the boys, which I think is attributable to the engaging quality if the story.

I was a true couch potatoe, and barely left to go play with my friends. And the thing I hated most was reading. Any book, no matter how interesting, could't keep my attention, and didn't keep me reading. Language Arts was my least favorite class, becuase reading was so boaring at the time. When I moved to California ,I made a new friend named Tina. We both shared the intrest in video games, but she loved to read. Eventually, she told me about this book. I told her I loved cats, and read the prelouge. At first, I nodded it off, telling her that I'm not really into reading. But the next time I went over thier, I looked at the book again. It was like pulling me into it. It was the only book that caught my intrest. I kept reading, and pretty soon, it was the best book ever. It could make someone like Tina that hated cats before, love them. She even got 2 of them becuase of the books! When I was finished that book, my life changed. I started reading the rest of the series, and read the ones I've already read. When you read them, its like you're in another world. I, the one who hated books and never picked on up in my life, actually cried, laughed, and yelled positive and negative things about the characters in the book, like I was actually their. My language arts grade went up when I became one of the quickest and most observant readers in the class, and I even looked at my greenbelt, aware of the freedom it brings. This brought me outside, playing sports, and running around with friends. Every person that I suggest these books to read the first chapter, and can't stop! I assure you you will be satisfied, and even more! I read all kinds of books now, but nothing compares to the excitment, the saddness, and the love in Warriors: Into the Wild.BTW, I'm 13, so for all parents out their, my mother loves the books too. They're great for children, and their fall in love with the cats. But it's also great for teens and adults.

He makes new friends and is accepted by the clan he has always onced dreamed of living in.

Firepaw is scared that he is the only one that knows Tigerclaw's most deadly secret. Somehow Firepaw tries to tell Bluestar this big tradgic secret, and Tigerclaw tries to get him away from her. How will Firepaw tell something important to his leader when Tigerclaw keeps bombing threats on him? Will Firepaw ever be able to tell his leader how in dangered their clan is, or will he have to feel the wrath of Tigerclaw?"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This is one of the best books ever written, no dout about it. I think it even ties with the Harry Potter. The book is about 4 clans of cats ond one \\"kittypet\\" who has the choice of joining the Thunderclan. I won't say anymore accept that in the begining I was really confused but after a while I caught on to what was happening. I would highly recomend this book to anyone 6th grade and up. Belive me it's worth the money you will spend because you will end up reading it over and over again. And the best part is that it is a series so you can keep on reading! I have already devoured three of six books in the series."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"At first when I saw this book at the library I thought it was probably a wierd and boring book. I also thought it was for boys. I was wrong. It was so awesome! I even re-read it again. I loved the adventure and suspense. Now I'm in middle of reading #3 Warriors:The new prophcey Moonrise.These books are like my favourite series now.In the series I never found a book that I found boring.You must buy these books.They rule! Go WARRIORS!!!!!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I started the book when I was seven or so, and I almost couldn't put it down at night! Each chapter has gripping detail, enough violence to satesfy a kid my age, and the charecter's actions and feelings were so real-like that I felt like I was right there, at a Gathering, right there, at the fight between ThunderClan and ShadowClan, right there, in the ThunderClan camp. I'm ten now, have read the whole first series twice and have started the second series, and I'd recomend this book to any kid who likes cats, excitment, adventure, and a litle pinch of violence now and then in their books. The begining of the story of Rusty, the so-called kittypet, who joins a clan of feral cats and saves the day in the end, who came from Firepaw to Fireheart, the ThunderClan warrior!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I first saw this book when my sister brought it home from the library. It looked really interesting, and I could tell that it was going to be a really great book ... and I was right! Having cats and clans and stuff is a really awesome idea. I'm so glad they didn't personificate those cats because when that happens,a book gets really bad and you dont want to read it anymore. Well at least i dont. Read it!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Erin Hunter is one of the most promising animal writers I've come across in a long time. Warriors #1, Into the Wild, follows the story of a house-cat, Rusty, who is drawn into the forest and the tradition-bound cat clans who live within. Starting out as an apprentice and gaining both friends and enemies, Rusty - remaned \`Firepaw' by his clan - sets out to prove that cats of \`kittypet' origin can survive just as well in the wild as forest-born cats. Very engaging to read, the sort of story that packs as much action as it can between the pages. Erin has done a fantastic job creating the world of her cats, with a partial language, traditions, histories, and definite way of life for them. A gripping tale and an excellent introduction into the feline world for older and younger readers."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"At first I didn't mlike cats a lot. But when I read this book I turned into a cat lover. This was my favorite book until I read the second and third book. Those are way better. If this is going to be your first time reading this book. READ IT!!Here is a super short summary of what happens: A house cat named Rusty turns into Firepaw because he joins Thunderclan (from the forest) and he turns into an apprentice and has bad luck and very good luck."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I loved the book Warriors: Into the Wild. I have always dreamed about how cats would be like in the wild. I am a big cat lover and enjoyed the idea of the clan cats taking care of each other in the wild. I thought it was cool that there was a medicine cat, a leader, a deputy, warriors, and apprentices, and they were all cats. I always thought I was right there with Firepaw, a part of the story.The book is about a kitten named Rusty who may be the last hope for ThunderClan. He becomes a member of the clan, taking on the name Firepaw. He starts training as an apprentice in hopes of being a fierce ThunderClan warrior. Many cats teased him for his \\"Kitty pet\\" stench. Firepaw made two best friends, Graypaw and Ravenpaw. After many moons at camp, Firepaw finds a shadow clan warrior and is rewarded for his new prisoner. Shadow Clan is an ongoing threat because they are willing to kill any ThunderClan cat in sight. When Firepaw is faced with battle, he is wise and strong, proving him a warrior cat, Fireheart.Cat lovers would like this book. Fiction lovers would also like this book because in real life, cats don't talk. The book Warriors: Into the Wild, is a fun book with many different characters both mean and nice."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"As an adult, I feel that I have to tell you that this series will pull you in and make it extremely hard to put down. This is an emotional series where you get to know the characters and you will laugh, cry, get mad, and hope. Don't laugh, but I actually cried as I read the last few lines of this first series because it was like saying goodbye to all my friends. (At that time, the New Prophecy Series wasn't out). If you can believe it, you get so attached to these cats and you forget that you are reading.This isn't a childish book series (I was actually surprised to see it marketed in the children's section after I read it). It has love, murder, betrayal, honor, courage, friendships lost, and other aspects of life.There are twists and turns that keep sucking you into the plot. Actually, there are many plots going on, but they are well written and do not get confusing.Also, It is a series with good values represented, but in a naturally occuring way. I mean Rusty has to make some hard choices in the course of these books.Please try this series, I have yet to read another of its kind as no book can compare.Don't forget, though, they must be read in order.Oh, and you don't have to love cats to read them!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This is an excellent begining to my absolute favorite series in the world. When I first got this book it was because I kept seeing ads for it, so I decided to get it just to keep the ads happy. I fell in love with the book, and back then I didn't know about its sequels. A couple years later I got the next five books in the series. I read them all. Now I own every book and have read the first series 3 or 4 times, the second series twice, and I am eagerly anticipating the next books to come. For people wondering \\"Hmmm... Should I buy this?\\" GET IT! It is a wonderful series and I encourage people to buy it. I won't summarize the book because I wouldn't be able to do it any credit. Besides plenty of other people have written descriptions of it. All I can say is that this book is worth the money, and that this is a book that I will cherish forever. I love this series!P.S. - I know it says \\"A kid's review\\". Please don't pay attention to that, I'm not some 5-year old that thinks kitties are cute. And I don't think that many \\"kid's review\\" people are, so don't shoot this review down, just because of that title. I enjoy the books for what they are, not because their names are adorable and I want to hug them all because they're fluffy wittle kittens. (I would like to hug them though, and the names ROCK! They'd bite me for it though, oh well...)"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"My 10-year-old daughter has been in a bit of a funk after finishing the last Harry Potter, knowing that there would be no more new ones. She has read all the HP books at least five times and will certainly re-read the series again but this is the first book that has gotten her anywhere near as excited. She told me that Into the Wild would be good for boys OR girls and for any kid who likes Harry Potter. As she was finishing this book this morning she reminded me (again) to get the next one for her. She tried to describe to me how this book was like HP. Basically, the main kitty goes from ordinary \\"kittypet\\" to a powerful member of the wild cat community (sorry, I haven't read it so I know I'm not using the right terms) and, she thinks, will have to fight an important battle in the end. You get the picture."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I love this book. I am currentlyon the third and the series keeps getting better. I found the beginning especially because I normally hate beginnings. However, I love this one. It isn't a series to be a book ahead, but its a great one if you stick to the order. I think into the wild is great because nothing is like \\"he observed the tree in the giant forest and learned his true destiny\\" and that is SOOOOOOOOOO unrealistic. Luckly, as I said this book doesn't do that. However, Rusty (I'm saying that to give away nothing) does have visions, but he cant understand them. I hope whoever reads my review will read this book and experiance the joy of Warriors."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This incredible journey will take you and Firepaw on an amazing adventure. This book is fun to read because Firepaw goes on so many different adventures. He starts out as a normal house pet and gets invited to a clan. This clan is called the Thunderclan. At first he is teased and insulted, but ends up as a great warrior. You will never ever want to stop reading this incredible journey!!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This is a GREAT book! IT is full (packed) with adventure that grabs your attention. The characters are Rusty (Firepaw) Graypaw and Ravenpaw. It is about a house cat named Rusty (kittypet) who lives in a farm with humans (twolegs) and ventures in to the woods and meets a clan of cats. In the clan, he meets Bluestar (leader), many warriors, Graypaw, Ravenpaw and more apprentices. They fight other clans in battles."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This book is about a regular housecat named Rusty. One day while he was sitting on the fence he decides to go out to explore the forest. Little does he know that many eyes are watching him. Not long after the leader of one of the forest cat clans emerges from the forest and asks Rusty if he wants to join their clan.This series tells how the normal and peacefull life of Rusty becomes an adventure of survival, and full trust and protection to the clan.I thought this series was really, really, REALLY great. Even if your are not an animal lover. I highly reccommend it to anyone who is willing to give this series a chance. Hurry up and buy it now. Run I tell ya RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This book was awesome! Anyone who likes cats and fantasy must read it! Firepaw is the perfect feline hero; idealistic and fearless. And I adored the unlikely heroine Yellowfang. This book should appeal to people who like 'Harry Potter' as well. The reading level for it may be young, but it has excellent appeal for any cat lovers or fantasy lovers. I would warn very young children though that there are some heroes who die, and the lives of the cats are ferocious. But to sum things up, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"As soon as I saw the cover of the book I was Hooked. I am naturally an animal lover and so when I saw this it was like love at first sight. In this book Rusty who is a kittypet (a cat that is onwed by humans) goes into the forest to stumble upon a apprentice (a warrior cat in training) named Graypaw. Graypaw jumps on Rusty and when Rusty turns around the aggressiveness is gone from his eyes. After that they become friends and Rusty gets to join Graypaws clan. (Thunderclan) But not everyone in the clan is friendly towards Rusty because he is not clan born. Rusty gets a new name and is now called Firepaw in the clan. He gets trained to become a warrior and is now an apprentice. I would strongly recomend this book to anyone who loves a great adventure when they see one and to some one who loves anamals.

I lost it bad at the end of last semester and dawdled on my to-read list during my break and finally got it back after rereading Into the Wild.Now, Into the Wild isn't a YA novel, nor is it one of the genres I normally review - after all, animals as the main characters don't pop up enough for me to really take a look at it.But I really love this series and since I never reviewed it the first few times reading it, I thought - well, why not?Now, the writing isn't *zomgAMAZING*. It is, after all, both middle grade and featuring cats. But the world and the story itself are fascinating and fun to read; Hunter does an excellent job at creating a world that isn't stark black-and-white, where the villains are also friends, and where you actually don't know what's going to happen from one moment to the next.Well, I did, but I had already read it before.But it really is an excellent series from start-to-finish; both a quick read and fun-to-read, it's definitely something I'd recommend."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"No matter how many times I read this book I'm always thoroughly thrilled and always on edge.

Before that, he told me he would never read a book of more than a hundred pages because it was too long. It's two and a half months later and he is deep into the twelfth book in the series. The longer titles run around three hundred pages, and he finished one of them in twenty-four hours. He's nuts about the Warriors books, and so am I.The authors have taken several classic plots and woven them into an exciting storyline for kids and adults. Graystripe and Silverstream are Romeo and Juliet. Fireheart balances his loyalty to Thunder Clan with the love for his kittypet sister. Their social order is honor-bound. Kids get into the rigid structure of right and wrong - following the Warrior Code at all times. Tigerclaw is a satisfying villain that you love to hate. Negative reviewers said the books were too violent and they were offput by the description of how the cats killed and ate their prey, but my strict vegetarian son had no problem with this. He understands that it's natural for carnivores take pride in their hunting ability.The vocabulary is challenging for kids without being intimidating. These books are best described as Lord of the Rings with cats as the main characters. Fireheart is on a quest to save the clan, protect his family and lead fearlessly. If your children enjoy fairy tales from King Arthur to Star Wars, pick up this series. It made a reader out of my son, and I am grateful for that."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This book is a wonderful secret to the mystic cats of the wild this book was lovely enough for five stars"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"The beginning of a long and amazing story.

You can relate to the protagonist in some of his situations (not going to spoil them) and you can understand how he feels as he deals with these conflicts.

That\`s why I\`m writing this review.Rusty is your typical housecat. He\`s got a warm place to sleep, a little door that lets him go outside whenether he wants, and a meal waiting for him everyday, even if it is yucky, dry, brown pellets. But Rusty still isn\`t okay with this. He wants to catch and kil his food. He wants to sleep wherever he wants to. In other words, he wants more freedom. That\`s why one day, he goes beyond his housefolk\`s nest, and into the wild.Clash! Thump! Claws were unsheathed and Rusty was fighting for his life. While he was trying to catch a mouse, a grey cat, the same size of him, attacked him! These two cats were quite a match, but Rusty tried harder than the grey cat. He threw the cat off and pinned him down, and just for good measure, bit him. That\`s when two more cats appeared, one of them strikingly large and bulky.Rusty, who was terrified, flattened his ears and hissed at them. They quickly introuduced themselves as Bluestar and Lionheart. The cat that had just attacked him was Greypaw, Lionheart\`s apprentice. They also told him they watched him fight and he was good. Then they asked him to join Thunderclan. Now, your proably as curious as Rusty to find out what the hell Thunderclan is. So, I\`ll tell you. In the forest, there are four clans.

This Christmas he bought me the first series of Warriors and I'm loving this too. The images of cats on the covers perfectly (purr-fectly?) complement the story. The housecat--kittypet--Rusty sitting on his fence seems so very real, his thoughts so very plausible, his dreams just those I imagine a cat might enjoy. And his fear of the vet--of the Cutter--are so natural. So when Rusty meets the Clan in the wild, the scene is set for a decision the reader knows he's sure to make.Rusty, with his flaming coat, becomes Firepaw and starts his training in the Warrior Code. The clans live in a restless peace that's slowly falling away. Firepaw, knowing little, learns more than his fellows, and retains an honest trust and willingness to listen to a stranger's tale. And Firepaw, with his promise of fire, just might be the savior of them all.I love the way the author tells this tale from Firepaw's point of view, drawing the reader into a wild cat's life. I love the depictions of cats and their ways, the imagined history of clans in the wild, and the legend of starcats keeping watch over them. Kitten thoughts are translated beautifully into words, with scents of green and prey and the joy of the chase all coming to life. Into the Wild was a pleasure to read and I look forward to enjoying more in the set; a beautifully imagined world of beloved small creatures dreaming large and writing their stories in the space between Twoleg homes.Disclaimer: My husband bought me a set of six Warriors books for Christmas and I love them."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I have never really gotten a pure passion for a book.

This action-packed tale is full of suspense and a must have for cat lovers. The author gives an idea of what might actually go on in our cat's mind and shows how complicated cats really are.Here's the basic plot: There are four clans of wild cats that rule the forest, following laws laid down by their great ancestors. Anyone who disobeys these laws is punished. But humans are moving in, and prey is becoming scarce, so some clans are desperate enough to break one of the top laws, and are hunting in other clans' territories. Battles pursue and thus warriors now are becoming as scarce as the prey. One clan, the Thunderclan, is so desperate that they take in a \\"kittypet,\\" a cat raised by humans. Rusty, a young kitten, shows the skills needed to be a warrior, and is invited into the clan with the new name of Firepaw, even though some are not sure of his worth. More problems arise, and the story continues with several questions running through your head, one of which is this: Will Rusty prove his worth as a warrior, or be forbidden to forever live as a \\"kittypet\\"?This tale never quits surprising you. It's so good that as soon as I started reading it, I couldn't put it down, and thus finished the 272 paged book in half of a day (not that I'm saying it's too easy and is a kiddy book, it surely isn't, I'm ten in an advanced students program, TAG, and I enjoyed it and would recommend it to kids ranging from a smart 9 year old to a 12 year old, or even older). I can't wait to get the next one! I hope you liked my review, and enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Never mind that these are books meant for kids. The Warriors series is more imaginative, vivid and beautiful than the Harry Potter books will ever be. I, an avid reader who has been in the young adult section for years now, still read these books religiously. I've read the entire first series about five times now, and the latest series about three. Why? There are many reasons.For one thing, Hunter doesn't write down to her readers just because these are books meant mostly for kids. That's probably why there are so many kids, teens and adults that all love this series. It's almost become a cult, with no mystery as to why.Also, they are fast-paced but never lack detail. Readers will follow Rusty, a housecat with dreams of the wild, as he enters the world of the Clans; four packs of feral cats with their own civilization. Especcially in this first installment, Hunter never fails to explain Clan life in great detail, without losing her reader along the way.Another great aspect of these books is that they appeal to those who are religious and to those who are not. The cats' \\"StarClan\\" is where deceased warriors live to watch over their clans. While some might see this as a nod to our \\"twoleg\\" heaven, others simply enjoy the idea of their beloved pets still watching over them.Finally, the characters are more believable than you'd think. I have trouble reading books where the characters are \\"talking animals\\" because, if not done right, this can be disastorous. But Hunter somehow manages to make the protagonist and all his friends and enemies seem real. This is something some authors never achieve, and to do so with animals is a very impressive feat.These are not books for those of us who dislike animals or can't seem to believe in the unbelievable, but cat lovers rejoice! These are books written with you in mind."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"The book Warriors: Into the Wild was written by Erin Hunter. This book is one of the best books I've ever read. It was an action-packed, adventurous tale about a cat named Rusty. Rusty gets new names such as Firepaw and Fireheart, and lurks in one of the four clans. All four clans in the book go their seperate ways, protecting their territories and the hunting grounds that belong to them. Its not just Rusty, the kittypet who once lived with the two-legs, apart from the clan. There are more cats such as Bluestar, Tigerclaw, and Rusty's best friend Graystripe. There are some unnecessary deaths that happen in the book also. Another great thing that most readers will like about the book is the mood. The mood was set in an unbelievable dark, dreary, very scary way most of the time. Other times it was peaceful, bright, and calm in the forest. This book was very suspenseful which makes you want to continue reading. It was just about the perfect length for any reader, not to long or hard to read. In conclusion, this book is very good and I would recommend reading it, especially if you are a cat lover."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I liked Warriors: Into the Wild because it was different than I thought it would be. It was about a cat named Firepaw who ventures into the wild and leaves his safe, warm home to join a clan of wild cats. I also liked it because the cats act just like people. They have a leader, they go to the cat doctor, and they can join the cat army. Another reason I liked this book was because it didn't end how I expected. I would recommend this book to kids who like to read adventure stories or animal stories."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"as rusty, a normal household cat, goes along with his daily routines, he encounters the cats that will change his life forever. the wild clan cats he meet whose stories had been told to him so many times have finally come to life for him. rusty is shocked and anxious when ask him to join thunderclan (the other wild cat clans of the series are riverclan, shadowclan, windclan, and starclan). he accepts and is welcomed to the clan by MOST cats as an apprentice named firepaw*. he meets graypaw, who will become a friend of a lifetime to him. firepaw goes through many obstacles, like convincing the clan that he was a true warrior at heart and not a kittypet owned by twolegs. this book is told from firepaw's view mainly, which i thought was very exciting and it captivated me from the very first page until the very last. firepaw discovers the dark truth of tigerclaw and redtail, the deputy of thunderclan before he was killed in a battle with riverclan. no one knows the truth of redtail's death except for an apprentice (in the beginning, it's not firepaw...) - this was when things really become suspenseful! i especially thought this book was tragic; there were so many lost lives in the first volume of a wonderful series. all of them were courageous and were respected as honoured cats of the clans. of all the books of the original warriors series, the second one was my favourite (\\"fire and ice\\"), although \\"into the wild\\" was really the one that got me into this series of adventure and fantasy.*kits of the clan take the name \\"kit\\" ex. firekit, apprentices of the clan take the name of \\"paw\\" ex. firepaw, warriors take the name of many words, such as \\"heart\\" ex. fireheart, and \\"fur\\" ex. rainfur, and leaders of the clan take the name of \\"star\\", like bluestar of thunderclan."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I LOVE to read, I've even read all the Hary Potter books in one month and two weeks!

Through the series there is: Gore, romance, betrail, suspence, and death. Highly recomended for kids 13+. These books take you into a whole nother world once you start reading it. You just can't put the book down!Fireheart, a cat used to his pampered Kittypet life, former known as Rusty, journeys into the forest of things-unknown to him. Then he is invited to join Thunderclan and then his new life of a Warrior starts. Not everyone in the clan likes the thought of a Kittypet joining Thunderclan. So Fireheart has to deal with jeering and taunts.Now, if your little one is just BEGGING you to let them read the Warriors series, I would recomend that one of the adults read it first. This series, is by far the BEST series of books I have read."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This book is about a house cat named Rusty going into the wild to live with a clan of forest cats called the Thunderclan. There four clans that each have their own territory. This book is mainly about Rusty becoming an apprentice so he can become a warrior. His name will be changed from Rusty to Firepaw. Will Firepaw become a warrior? Read the book to find out.I like most of this book a lot especially about cats becoming warriors. There is nothing in this book I did not like about. This book is for people who like cats a lot and a little violence"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"What a great book! I'm a big cat lover and I even have five of my own. It really makes you think what life is really like for wild cats."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Rusty who is a kittypet, sneaks into the forest and is met by a strange cat named Graypaw. Graypaw's leader, Bluestar, has offered Rusty a place in the Thunderclan and he accepts the offer. Rusty becomes an apprentice and his named is changed to Firepaw. Firepaw is not really accepted into the clan because he isn't forest-born. Though Firepaw isn't very popular in the clan he still makes friends with two apprentices, Graypaw and Ravenpaw. Firepaw is mentored by several different warriors like Lionheart, Longtail, and Tigerclaw. Tigerclaw doesn't like kittypets and never treats Firepaw with any concern and makes it harder for Firepaw to be accepted by his clan. Will he ever really be accepted in his clan or will he be just a cat used to defend it clan?What I liked about the book is that it kept you reading. I've read all 6 off the books in three weeks so it really keeps you hooked. What I disliked about the book was how it got rid of about two characters each book and the books are also sort of sad. Another thing I like about the book is it has good details and sometimes I think I can actually see where the characters and what they are doing. The thing I hate most about Warriors: Into the Wild is that it makes you want to keep reading and reading and there is never really a good place to stop because every detail counts. So if you read it you can decide if the book is really as good as I say it is.I think that people who would like this book would be cat lovers or even a person who likes adventure. Another person I think would like this book is a person who likes a good fiction story. These books are in a series of six books and the books are Into the Wild, Fire and Ice, Forest of Secrets, Rising Storm, A Dangerous Path, and The Darkest Hour. This is the best series I have ever read and I would like to read the new series The New Prophecy which includes Midnight, Moonlight, Dawn, and Starlight and there are a few more that are coming out. I think anyone who reads these books would enjoy them and love them like I do."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"In the wild, 4 clans of feral cats fight for food and territory. Out of an ordinary house, a kit named Rusty joins Thunderclan, the group of cats who rule the forest in between Thunderpath ( a street or freeway or something of that nature) and Sunningrocks by the river. There he meets new friends, like the gray and black apprentices, Graypaw and Ravenpaw. He gets a new name, Firepaw, and spends his green-leaf hunting and training to become a warrior. But a certain warrior isn't as innocent as he looks, and, now that his friend knows a dark secret, he is caught up in a horrible mystery. Mean while, Brokenstar, leader of Shadowclan, the clan that rules the other side of Thunderpath, gets stronger and drives Windclan of the uplands off. Tension grows high in the clan territories and a fight seems immeninent...Chock full of wonderful descriptions and new ideas (9 lives to the leader of a clan) and fantastically original plots, this book will not let you let go until you finish the last page. Makes you really think about what your cat feels about being stuck in the house...."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"When I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I instantly fell in love with the plot and its characters. It was so complex, but I found that I memorized all of the cats' customs. I love how Erin Hunter finds magical explanations for a cat's nine lives and all of their mysterious behavior. This completely convinced me that cats weren't just fuzz balls!Warning: This isn't for the light hearted. There are many deaths, blood, violence, and murder. If I had to give it a movie rating, I'd say it'd be PG-13. Be warned, you might not want to read this."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"The Warriors books are the best!!!! The first book is my favorite, but the others are just as good. The best part about these books are there's alawys something exciting happening. Well, it all starts out with a kittypet named Rusty, the one day he is tempted to go into the forest and does. Then he meets a couple of wild cats and they want him to join their clan(Thunderclan). Then he becomes a apprentice and trains to become a Warrior. This book is exciting because my favorite animal are cats and when I was reading this book in couldn't keep my eyes off of it. It can also be sad, but I can't tell you why because you need to read the book. I have read book... #1 Into The Wild, #2 Fire And Ice, #3 Forest Of Secrets, and right now I'm reading book #4 Rising Storm. I love reading these books and I hope you enjoy reading them yourself!!! I LOVE ERIN HUNTER!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This was the best book I have ever read. Erin Hunter is a genius! I enjoyed it so much! This deserves 6 stars! ******* I feel like I know Rusty/ Firepaw/ Fireheart. Thank you Erin Hunter, for giving me the pleasure of this book."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Warriors is a wonderfull book. It is well written, and although it has a wide vocabulary, you can understand the words the Erin Hunter uses. Warriors definately deserves 5 stars. The series has a fast paced story line, and relates the adventures of cats with human stuggles. Although in some books, the depression that the cats go through is almost un-bearable, most of the times the books are light and cheerfull. I would recomend these books to any young reader who enjoys books like Inkheart, Harry Potter, and Time Stops for No Mouse."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"If you Love cats, this series is for you. The characters (cats) are believable,funny,lovable. It's a classical Good verses Evil. You will never look at your Kittypets the same way again. This book is written for young readers, but I found it very enjoyable and easy reading. The storyline moves along. It's good for all ages."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Okay, I have to begin by saying that I'm in my mid-forties, and my daughter was 9 when she started this book. I expected it to be a silly, boring and pointless story. Instead, I was captivated by the story of Rusty, a \\"kittypet\\" who longs to catch prey, and to live in the wild. In this book, he gets his chance not only to live free from his Twoleg Housefolk, but also to be part of a greater group of cats - the ThunderClan.The mythology and history of ThunderClan in the series is quite rich and adds to the intrigue. You find that ThunderClan is not just a clowder of cats in the wild, but in fact, has a structured society. There is the clan leader, a deputy, a medicine cat, apprentices, queens, and of course, the kits. Coming into the clan, Rusty, whose name gets changed to Firepaw, discovers early on that he has to work extra hard to prove his loyalty to the clan, and his abilities to contribute.It is through Firepaw's eyes as he begins his apprenticeship that we see the workings of Clan life. As it turns out, ThuderClan is only one of four clans in the area, and while they normally are quite territorial, once every full moon, they meet at Four Trees, to meet in peace and discuss issues of importance to their clans.I don't want to give away too much of the story, but there are some very tender moments of friendship, as well as exciting action scenes, and a climax at the end that makes you long to read book two.I just want to end this review by saying that before this series, my daughter didn't really enjoy reading and was a very reluctant reader. Since beginning this series, she's read four of the books, and her reading has improved greatly in school and at home! More importantly, though, is that we have a shared passion to talk about. I hope you will enjoy this series with your child or children."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I picked up the first Warriors book, \\"Into The Wild,\\" because I was curious to see how feral cats were being portrayed to children in this bestselling series. I was hesitant because, as someone who has worked with ferals for the past 20 years, I thought a children's series would dumb down these magnificent creatures and/or portray them in a terrible light. I could not have been more wrong.Erin Hunter not only has the mannerisms of ferals down pat, but her insight into their personality and what makes them tick is perfect. Everything from \\"patrolling the border\\" to the way ferals view \\"kitty pets\\" and how they take pride in their colonies is spot on. As for the cats she has created in this world -- you will fall in love with them, you will laugh at their antics, mourn their passings, and never look at a stray cat the same way. Even her \\"villains\\" can be viewed in a sympathetic light due to backstories throughout the series or in the graphic novels that explain how and why their personalities were formed. The creation of Star Clan (the ferals who have passed away and now watch over their clans) truly touched my heart. I appreciate these books not only for the wonderful stories they tell, but because they do not reduce feral cats to meaningless creatures; their lives are given the respect they fully deserve. The writing is not only geared toward children, but cat lovers of all ages. Children who read this series will have a greater appreciation and compassion for feral cats, while adults will revel in the magical world of the Clans.Beside giving this book (and the entire series) a 5-star rating, I'd also like to take the opportunity to invite everyone reading to visit Alley Cat Allies and learn more about the plight of feral cats in the real world and what you can do to help them. Unfortunately, the majority of ferals are not allowed to live out their lives in peace within their clans as the Warriors are; ferals are trapped and killed by animal control agencies and shelters. Remember: If you can, help others; if you cannot do that, at least do not harm them.Thank you, Erin Hunter, for a truly beautiful series and recognizing the complex, wonderful world of ferals."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This book about a house cat (kittypet) named Rusty, who dreams of hunting and living in the woods, is one of the best books I've ever read. This common house cat ventures into the woods, where he's been warned by other house cats to never go. They've told him the woods are filled with bone-eating, savage cats, but Rusty craves adventure and can't resist. He finds that the dark, mysterious woods are filled with cats, but they aren't the beastly creatures he'd been told by the other kittypets. The cats have a code of honor they follow, and they have rules and customs, just like humans (twolegs). They live in four separate clans - Thunderclan, Riverclan, Windclan, and the sinister Shadowclan. These groups are loyal to their own clan, willing to fight to the death to protect it. The clans have borders that can't be crossed, even when hunting for prey. Rusty joins Thunderclan and is renamed Firepaw. Conflict arises when Firepaw's new clan is being threatened by Shadowclan. They intend to take over Thunderclan, and they are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goal. Shadowclan's leader, Brokenstar, is the cause of all the turmoil, so Thunderclan determines that they can restore peace to the clans by banishing Brokenstar from all clan camps. Can the weaker, more vulnerable Thunderclan defeat the mighty Brokenstar?

I'm now in the Power of Three Series and I can't help wanting to go back and read Into the Wild over and over again. If you don't want me to spoil some parts of the book for you, I suggest not reading any further.It starts out when a young housecat named Rusty starts getting bored with his quiet easy life and ventures into the woods and attempts to hunt down a mouse. While he is in the forest a wild cat attacks him. He thinks about fleeing, but in the end decides to fight back. After the two cats are done fighting eachother they start talking. This strange cat is named Graypaw. He lives in the woods with a group of cats called Thunderclan. The clan has to fight to survive in the harsh wildernes. Rusty is amazed by this strange cat and is even more surprised when the leader of Thunderclan, Bluestar, asks him to join the clan. Rusty accepts and leaves his cushy life for the rough outdoors.Rusty soon realizes that life in Thunderclan is very different from what he is used to. Most of the cats in the clan are against having a kittypet (housecat) join their clan. Bluestar changes his name to Firepaw and then he begins his life as an apprentice warrior with Graypaw, Sandpaw, Dustpaw, and Ravenpaw. On Firepaw's first day in the clan a cat dies in battle. Firepaw realizes that life is not easy in Thunderclan.In Into the Wild Firepaw has to battle with rival clans, hunt for his own food, and rescue stolen kittens from an evil clan leader.If you like animals and adventure Into the Wild is the book for you! If you want to read this series I strongly suggest that you read them in order or else you'll get confused...Here are some things that you might want to know while you're reading it:There are four clans:Thunderclan- they are known for their strengthShadowclan- hostile cats (mostly)Riverclan- excellent swimmers and fishersWindclan- fast runners and good at hunting rabbitsIn clans every cat has a name with one of the following on the end:star- leaderpaw- apprenticekit- kitten(a warrior and medicine cat can have anything on the end of his or her name)I hope you have fun reaading this awesome book!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This series is the best series ever!

Rusty has always dreamed of living in the forest and sinking his teeth into a fresh mouse. He was thrilled when he was asked to join Thunderclan and become an apprentice. He takes on a new name, Firepaw, and goes on to training to become a brave and loyal Thunderclan warrior.The book was really great and I think Erin Hunter did a really fantastic job of telling the story from the cats' perspective. I like the way the author describes everything from the feel of the mossy ground under their paws to the scent of fresh prey in the cool morning air. But sometimes it could become a little repetitive when it comes to Firepaw's thrill when hunting and the cats sharing tongues. In some places the book was kind of slow when all Firepaw did was wander around the camp. Lastly, I did like the creativity with the names. As I noticed, apprentices had the word &#34;paw&#34; in their name and Clan leaders had the word &#34;star&#34; in their name.I would recommend this book to anyone because it really gets you thinking about the secret lives of cats and what I think is the author's purpose, to inform us how we're impacting the environment and what we're doing to these sweet animals.Hope my review was helpful-serenity"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I really bought this book just to see what my granddaughter was reading (shes 13). I thought they would be too childish to be interesting to an adult. Boy was I wrong. If you are an animal lover, you will love these books. Buy them in order!

Having plucked up the courage to venture beyond his (human) home and into the forest, he encounters a young feral apprentice warrior. The two fight and then become friends. The Thunderclan, the \`family' of the young apprentice, desperate to replenish their numbers with new stock, recruit Rusty into the clan and rename him Firepaw. In all, four Clans of the forest battle against each other for survival, each protecting its own territory and competing for food, and the Thunderclan need all the help they can get.The story is told from the cat's point of view. It is a tale of talking and warring cats with their own structured society based loosely on that of our own. A sweet added touch from the author is the naming of the cats. The ordinary warriors all have \`paw' in their names, and the leaders all have \`star' in their names, allowing for easy identification, which I thought was rather clever.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is well-written with some very descriptive scenes, though some may be a bit upsetting for children. However, it has plenty of action and adventure and an assortment of good and bad, and some clever twists here and there.

My 8 year old daughter absolutely loves them, but what little I have read when reading with her is just gawd-awful. Thank goodness she can read these by herself. I find it hard to believe the spectacular ratings these books have received here. I found the writing to be almost unbearable. The author uses the same few adjectives, verbs and adverbs over and over again, and she seems incapable of writing a sentence that does not contain the repetitive names of two or more cats. Has she never heard of pronouns? Maybe the story is compelling, I wouldn't know, but no story could be compelling enough to make me wade through this horrible writing. True, the target audience of these books is very young, but writing for a third-grader does not mean one has to write LIKE a third-grader."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"lots of hype and a lot of marketers on my favorite boards telling me to run out and buy.........

There are many reasons why this book was terrible, but i'll only say 3. 1: Books should be imaginative, but fights not only in this book, but in the WHOLE series are TO imaginative! 2: When Erin Hunter describes the way the cats feel like when they eat prey, it almost makes me sick, with blood being juicy and all that! 3:Yea, let the good guys win, bout' ALWAYS!!!!! Only in the BEGINNING of this book did i see a fight where the good guys lost, but throughout all the series prepare for the good guys to always win...Now, I'm not saying you CAN'T read this book, I'm saying if you DO read this book youll regret it...."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I picked this book up for my son, age 7, who likes cats. I was thinking that we could read it together. I started reading the book on my own to see what it was like. This book is NOT for young children. I don't want to have to explain to my son what at \\"Cutter\\" is and why cat's would be afraid of it. I don't think that young children should be hearing about the pleasure that cats (or any animals) get from a fresh kill. Those just aren't the types of things I want to introduce to him at his age. This book should really be targetted for older children (teenagers), not young readers. Besides the issue of the target audience, I do feel the writer does capture the feelings of cats as best as a human can capture an animals \\"feelings\\", but I also think that the writing is not particularly polished or engaging.

It is about cats, my favorite animal. I read the first book about three years ago, maybe two. I remembered those two years later that there were some really cool books about cats. But, I did not remember the name. Boy, was I surprised, when I went to the store, and there it was! Warriors: Into the Wild. I got the book, and began to read. I absolutely loved it!Rusty(later known as Firepaw), a young kittypet(housecat), has a dream, in which he is hunting a mouse in the forest. No collar, no Twolegs(humans), he was free. So, Rusty ventures out into the forest, and meets the young apprentice, Graypaw, who attacks Rusty. Rusty surprises young Graypaw by turning and fighting. So, Graypaw tells Rusty about the four Clans of the forest. Two other cats appear, after watching Graypaw attack Rusty. Bluestar(leader), and Lionheart(warrior) extend an invitation to Rusty to join their Clan, Thunderclan. Rusty is given the night to think about it.Rusty takes the night to think about it, finally deciding to join the Clan. He spends the rest of the day with his best friend, Smudge, another kittypet. Then, he goes to the place where he met the Clan cats. Lionheart and Whitestorm, another warrior, take Rusty to the Thunderclan camp. They are pleased at how Rusty kept up with them, and tell Bluestar. Bluestar is pleased, and tells the Clan that an outsider will be joining the Clan. A young warrior named Longtail taunts young Rusty, and Rusty fights with Longtail, losing his kittypet collar in the process. Bluestar says that it is a sign from Starclan that Rusty is to join the Clan. Rusty is given the apprentice name Firepaw, and shares mentors with Tigerclaw and Lionheart.Firepaw learns the ways of the Clan, called the warrior code. Not all of the warriors accept him, being born a kittypet. He is taunted by many of the cats, including two of the other apprentices. But, Firepaw ignores them, in order to help his friend Ravenpaw, who knows a great secret. He was at the battle, where the previous deputy, Redtail, was killed. Ravenpaw says that Tigerclaw killed Redtail, but only Firepaw believes him. Firepaw tries to tell Bluestar, but Bluestar doesn't believe him.On his first apprentice mission alone, Firepaw finds a loner(cat without a Clan) named Yellowfang. He feels pity for her, and catches her freshkill, and feeds her. Bluestar and a patrol show up, and Firepaw finds out that Yellowfang is the old Shadowclan medicine cat. Firepaw is given the job of taking care of her.Later, Shadowclan attacks Thunderclan, and Yellowfang proves her honor to Thunderclan by protecting the kits. She is given an invitation by Bluestar to join the Clan. Yellowfang accepts. Later, a Shadowclan warrior kills the medicine cat, Spottedleaf, and takes Frostfur's kits. Every cat blames Yellowfang, and Firepaw, Graypaw, and Ravenpaw go to find her. Ravenpaw stays with the loner Barley, because Tigerclaw is trying to turn the Clan against him.Firepaw and Graypaw find Yellowfang in Shadowclan territory. Yellowfang helps a patrol of the Thunderclan cats to rescue the kits, and drive out the cruel leader, Brokenstar. Brokenstar promises Firepaw that the battle is not over. When they get back to their own camp, Bluestar makes Yellowfang the new medicine cat.Firepaw and Graypaw become warriors, earning the names Fireheart, and Graystripe."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"\\"For generations, four clans of wild cats have shared the forest to the laws laid down by their warrior ancestors. But the ThunderClan cats are in grave danger, and the sinister ShadowClan grows stronger every day. Noble warriors are dying - and some deaths are more mysterious than others. In the midst of all of this turmoil appears an ordinary housecat named Rusty... who may turn out to be the bravest warrior of them all.\\"In the first book from the Warriors series, a young housecat named Rusty decides to journey into the forest for the first time, and in there he meets a few warrior cats, from the ThunderClan. They see that Rusty is quite a good fighter, and decide to invite him into their clan (which is a VERY big deal, because no housecat had ever been invited to one of the forest clans). Rusty's name is soon changed to \\"Firepaw\\" and he becomes an apprentice cat. This means that Firepaw would learn from a warrior mentor (he would learn from Lionheart) for a while, then he would become a full-fledged warrior. At first Firepaw is treated with hostility, but he makes two good friends, Ravenpaw and Graypaw. When Firepaw first comes to the clan, the deputy (Redtail) had just been killed. Everyone was convinced that a Riverclan patrol had killed him, but it was really Tigerclaw, who was trying to make his way to the top. Ravenpaw was the only cat who saw this, because he was out with Tigerclaw, who is his mentor, at the time. No one believed Ravenpaw (since Tigerclaw is so well liked), except Firepaw and Graypaw. However, even after killing deputy Redtail, Tigerclaw still wasn't the deputy, because the leader of the clan (Bluestar) appointed Lionheart as the new deputy. So, clan life is all good again until Lionheart died (he wasn't killed by Tigerclaw). This time, Tigerclaw is made deputy of the Thunderclan.Meanwhile, the Shadowclan is becoming more and more powerful each day, and wants more and more land. During this time, not too much happens except for the fact that Yellowfang (old medicine-cat of Shadowclan, now a rogue) is taken prisoner and Firepaw must take care of her. Nothing big happens until the end of the book, here's the story. At first, when some newborn kits were catnapped and the medicine-cat (Spottedleaf) is found dead, the whole clan accuses Yellowfang (except for Firepaw), since she was missing from the camp. Bluestar then sends Firepaw and his friends to go find Yellowfang and the kits. Graypaw and Firepaw leave Ravenpaw to live with Barley (a loner cat) because Ravenpaw thinks Tigerclaw wants to kill him. After that, Graypaw and Firepaw follow the kitten's scent into the Shadowclan territory, where they met Yellowfang, who said that she was only trying to save the kittens from the Shadowclan. Firepaw goes to get help from a nearby Thunderclan patrol, and Graypaw, Firepaw, Yellowfang, and the patrol invade the Shadowclan camp together, to retrieve the kittens. They all open attack the camp and manage to get the kittens without any harm. Back at camp, after Yellowfang was made the new medicine-cat, Whitestorm told Bluestar that they fought like true warriors, and Bluestar decides to make Firepaw and Graypaw warriors. They are given their warrior names (Fireheart and Graystripe) and before they begin their nighttime vigil, Tigerclaw told Fireheart that he has made an enemy. Into the Wild is an excellent book, because it has a variety of original characters, it shows cats getting human qualities, and it is stuffed with suspense.There are many original characters in this book including Firepaw. Firepaw is a nice, strong, likeable cat who is often picked on because he used to be a housecat, but he can fight better than some forest cats. Bluestar, Thunderclan's leader, is another good character because she is kind, she fights for what she believes in, and she is a great leader through the hard times in the book. Tigerclaw is another original character because he is very two-faced. To most, he is a nice, strong, loyal cat but, to the few that know about his plan to become leader, he is bloodthirsty, cruel, and selfish.In Warriors, three examples of cats taking on human qualities are when they talk, they think, and their personalities, which are like human qualities.There is a ton of suspense in Warriors, Into the Wild. One example would be when Firepaw, Graypaw, Yellowfang, and the Thunderclan patrol invade the Shadowclan camp and fight the Shadowclan cats. Another suspenseful time was when Firepaw was still named Rusty and Rusty met the Thunderclan cats in the woods. Yet another suspenseful part was when Tigerclaw told Fireheart at the end of the book that they are enemies, and the way he said it sounded very sinister.Warriors, Into the Wild is an excellent book that is filled with original characters, cats that are humanlike, and is packed with suspense.~Elizabeth"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"My mom and I walked into a bookstore looking for something. She picked up this book, handed to me, and told me to see if it was any good.I read the prologue in the store,thought it was ok, and bought it and the second one. They sat on my shelf for about a year, and then I picked up Into the Wild and began reading, and was immidiatly engrossed in the book.The begiinning is perhaps the weakest and most boring part when Rusty (Later known as Firepaw) is a kittypet. I wanted more to read about the cats in the prologue and almost put the book down.I used to have a hard time picturing the camps correctly, with the cats all having little tents and a table on which they put the prey. After I read the book the second time it was easier to picture in the right fasion, and every time I read it the images keep getting better.Now, Character Development.The only drawback on the book is that when certain cats die, I didn;t really FEEl anything except my taco being digested. The characters Firepaw, Graypaw, and Bluestar were the most developed to me, although there were others that were quite beautifully developed as well.This is a good book to read to get the feel of fantasy if you are thinking about entering that genre, because it is not to extremely fantasy for new readers (With the whole plot happening in or around a town or suburb) but readers familiar with fantasy will accept this book as a great novel.I have read all of the books up to The New Prophecy Book One: Midnight and am waiting for the day I buy the second one.

THey are so great!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I have read many animal fantasy books, and this is one of the best. The author has kept most of the natural traits of feral cats with a just a few magical elements added (multiple lives, magical stones, etc.). I like this series much more than the Guardians of Ga'Hoole. That series about owls is less believable because the owls have many human characteristics, such as reading, writing, and cooking."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This book overwhelmed me with passion for Rusty. One day Rusty was sitting on the fence of his home when his curiosity got the better of him, and he ventured into the forest he endlessly stared at his entire life. Suddenly a wild cat attacked him as he was stroling along. Using all of his witts he eventually through him off and sat starring at his opponent who lost all of his aggresion at once. The cat introduced himself as Graypaw, an apprentice warrior. Then the clan leader, Bluestar, of those wild cats came out of her hiding spot. Obviously she witnessed the entire thing. Suprizingly she praised Rusty for his good fighting, in spite of his origin as a housecat, and asks him to join the clan. Throughout the book, Rusty (or known as Firepaw when he joins the clan) is faced with difficulties from his past and present. He strives to shut out the jokes about him, and tries his hardest to become a warrior to protect his clan. As I read the book I was litiraly jumping with excitement. Anyone who loves cats will at least like this book."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Warriors: Into the Wild is one of the best books I've ever read in my life! It is action-packed, a little humorous, and there's a surprise at every corner. One of my friends introduced the book to me, and I'm glad she did for it's a real page-turner. At first, I was a little unsure if the book was suited to me because it seemed a little violent. But, I kept reading and I started to find that I love this book. I found some characters that I really related to. In fact, I love it so much that when I was on the first book my parents got me the next two books. I just started the second book and can't get my nose out of it. I love Warriors and I know a lot of other people who do too. ;)This story is about friendship, trust, and a little bit of war. It is also about trying new things, bravery, and not backing down. This story takes place in a damp, chilly woods that are not far from a person's house. In the beginning, a young a cat named Rusty is living with people at the edge of a forest. He meets a wild warrior cat named Graypaw. Graypaw convinces Rusty, now known as Firepaw, to join Thunderclan in a time of need. Then, Firepaw finds himself a full warrior and has lots of friends. Then, in a blink of an eye, Shadowclan is demanding Thunderclan territory! Firepaw and his Thunderclan friends are at war with Shadowclan. Though some die, Firepaw avenges them all. In the end, the leader of Shadowclan learns his lesson and dashes back into the forest.The main characters in Warriors: Into the Wild are:Firepaw - a young cat with a fiery spirit for adventure and is very trust worthy.Graypaw - Firepaw's best friend who is a curious cat and is also a warrior.Ravenpaw - also Firepaw's friend and warrior who is shy and frail but quick and powerful, though he had to run away.Spottedleaf - Firepaw's crush who is very beautiful and talented in nursing and taking care of kittens (a.k.a., kits).Bluestar - Thunderclan's leader who saw a warrior locked up in Firepaw's heart, yearning to be set free.Tigerclaw - a tough, serious, bold cat who loves to fight and has one emotion -- anger!Yellowfang - a black, shaggy cat who has attitude and was once in Shadowclan, but is now a Thunderclan medicine cat .Smudge - a black and white cat who grew up with Firepaw since they were kits but is not a warrior.I love this book, it inspired me in so many ways! I know a lot of my friends would love the action packed thrills of reading this book. I think that this book has perfect blend of these details: a pound of action, a dose of determination, seasoned with humor and you have the perfect recipe for a perfect book."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"You have read enough boring house cat books, get ready for a twist on the life of a cat.

The cats here act like cats and they do what cats do. These cats live in clans and each clan has a dedicated area in their small world in which each cat is restricted to live. There are wars and fights, of course, because the leaders of the clans die and there are power mongers who want better living areas than what they currently have.Hunter has created a leader and a medicine cat for each clan, who heals and rubs natural herbs into wounds.You can clearly see that the author loves cats and has studied them and how they act.This first book Into the Wild tells how a simple house cat Rusty decides to join the Thunderclan and become a member of the clan, and a warrior."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"WOW! This is the most exciting series I've read since Harry Potter! My 8 year old could not put them down, and neither could I. It has something for everyone. Love, honor, action, adventure, and the classic good vs. evil (good wins of course). Though there is violence, it is in context. Animals only fight to defend, or to eat.We are waiting on pins and needles for the next book to come out in January!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I started reading this book when i was 13 and at the time i wasnt into reading at all. I read \\"Henry and Ribsy\\" and some other books but just cuase my mom made me. Then i went on a long long plane ride (6 Hrs) and found this book shoved in my backpack with a note waying \\"finish this before you come back\\", so i decided i might as well get it over with and started to read.Rusty (later Firepaw) was an ordenary kittypet (house cat) who longed for adventure in the begining and didnt have any idea about just how much adventure he would find. The book goes on as he makes life time friends, shares thrilling adventures, and much more. There is really never a good time to put the book down.Erin Hunter did a fabuleous job in interweaving all the different twists and turns together to creat this book, sure it is not nearly as intilectual as J.R.R Tolkiens Lord of the Ring series but there is a reason, it is ment for younger kids. Yes, it can be a little predictable and sometimes things that should be obviouse to all the characters arnt but it never really hurts the book and it all works out to form a wonderful epic adventure for (i think) all ages (hey, i'm 15 and still read the new ones coming out).By the time the plane ride was over i was so ingrossed in the book that i was the last one off the plane and the stewardess had to ask me if i would leave. I never put it down till i finished it (and even after i read it 3 or so times) and when i got to my destination i called up my mom and told her to get the next books in the series so when i got home i would have them to read. These books are great and i cant recomend them enough. The only drawback that i can wee would be that some of the beloved characters die, yes its very sad and i really didnt like that but all in all these are some of the best books i have ever read.Also, the books after this one in the series are just as good, however once you read the first one you'll be hooked and you WILL read the others.

With many characters in the book that can only be described as \\"Prrrrrrrfect\\", the story is always on the move and continues to develop throughout the novel. The novel has many twists and turns as FirePaw(formerly a kittypet / on the cover of the book) tires his very best and gives it all hes got to prove himself to his new clan that has so lovingly invited him into there home.

Outside, a Mean and horrid leader from a different Clan drives out yet another Clan(and there's one more Clan, too!).I won't say anything else, as not to ruin the plot, but I will say this: This is a great book.

Mean while, Brokenstar, leader of Shadowclan, the clan that rules the other side of Thunderpath, gets stronger and drives Windclan of the uplands off. Tension grows high in the clan territories and a fight seems immeninent...Chock full of wonderful descriptions and new ideas (9 lives to the leader of a clan) and fantastically original plots, this book will not let you let go until you finish the last page.

I understand that the story isn't real. however, it is, because it depicts how REAL ferral cats live; Fighting for food, shelter, and territory just to survive. Also, if you've ever heard a real outdoor cat fight, it's awful, and getting the image of them fighting in the book, recalling how horrid catfights soud, can break your heart (not to mention your eardrums). but besides my soft spot as far as fighting animals and them being hurt goes, the book was indeed EXCELLENT and now I'm going to read book 2 to find out what happens!

Rusty is soon given the name Firepaw, and becomes friends with Graystripe. Due to his kittypet heritage, he is barely trusted. At the same time, ThunderClan's deputy has died, and Tigerstar's apprentice, Ravenpaw is terrified for some reason. ShadowClan is acting odd, and WindClan has dissapeared. But in the midst of it all stands a mysterious prophecy from StarClan: Fire will save the Clan.This is the beginning to an excellent series! The character development is phenomonal!

Soon he got the name FireHeart when he became a warrior.) FireHeart was amzing in the story. Who would of thought a kitty pet would.... Well I don't want to spoil the ending...

Then ran out the Wind and River Clans for hunting grouds, but will this be the end of the ThunderClan too? Or will they backfire?

At first I was hesitant to read it, but then when I started, I just could NOT put the book down. I read it through and wanted to read more, so I continued to read the series.

Still this book and the other books in the series are a lot more then you would think and they are certainly, alot more then just books for cat lovers. wheither you like cats or not this book and the series is rich in a mythology that is unique and interesting and a entire world that is both different from ours and yet the same. It is fiction at it's most appealling and echos the redwall series in some but deffinately not all respects. Further more while most of the redwall series has branched off from the original appeal (Ididn't really like the dirrection or tone of the newer redwall books, just personal prefferince)Warriors sticks with what works. And has a linear timeline where the stories (each a complete and interesting adventure in their own right) instead of being completely different stories in the same universe (different characters and circumstances that don't really go with each other) actually allow you to follow characters that you have growen to love. And there are no unexplaned jumps in time from one story to the next. further more there is something new that goes beyond redwall ever did and makes this series stand out as one of a kind (I really can't explain it any better)Some may be disappointed to find that much of the ending can be guessed before your very far into the story. But I have learned that the ending is not nearly as important as the journey and those that condem this book, are missing out on a incredable one. Further more keep in mind that this is a childrens book and while I am an adult and found it very appealling that doesn't mean that every one will.sorry about grammer and spelling."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"this is such a great series. my friend convinced me to read them, and now i am convincing all my friends to read them. they all love them!

After many territorial fights with other feral cat clans in the woods, Firepaw matures into a fine warrior, and is renamed Fireheart. But the book's main excellence isn't its plot, it's Hunter's talent for describing the world from a real cat's perspective. Consider this sentence, \\"He opened his jaws slightly to let the warm smells of the forest reach the scent glands on the roof of his mouth.\\" I recommend Into the Wild for tweens (9-12), especially those who love cats.

After a dream of hunting in the woods, Rusty decides to give up his pampered life and runs away into the forest. Soon, he encounters one of the wild cats, and after a short scuffle, manages to defend himself. The wild cat seems rather surprised by the fighting skill of the house cat, and is joined by two older cat, who also seems equally impressed. One of which, who reveals herself to be leader, offers Rusty a chance of a lifetime; to give up his soft life and join her clan, Thunderclan. After mental negotiation, Rusty decides to join Thunderclan, and becomes a warrior apprentice, much like Graypaw. Thus starts the adventures of Rusty, now Firepaw, filled with bravery, tragedy, and action. But darkness lurks at every corner. With members who are not to be trusted prowling their territory, the strange disappearance of Windclan, and demand to give up land or suffer by the ruthless leader of Shadowclan, Firepaw may just prove to be the bravest cat of them all, as he climbs the ranks from apprentice to warrior, and unfolds the link between his fur color and name from the looming prophecy: \\"Fire alone will save our Clan.\\""},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"The first book of Erin Hunter's Warriors series isn't half bad. For being a youth-oriented work (I am 28), it has enough plot to keep one going for a while and just enough imagery to not totally suck. For it's target age group it is excellent. If you have read Tad Williams's Tailchaser's Song, this may at first come off as a poory-made rip-off, but if you take it on it's own merit, it can be very enjoyable.I like the characters, most of them anyways, and I like the fact that the book takes it's own pace. Suspected treachery, Clan wars, and the timeless coming-of-age of the book's main character, Firepaw...every time the book lags a little it picks up the pace again just before tedium sets in.Now, don't get me wrong, this isn't the Greatest Novel Evar. Far from it.The way I look at it is this. My dad LOVES gourmet cooking. He does a fair bit of it as a hobby. The man can do wonders in a kitchen that I can't even UNDERSTAND. He knows the various properties of several herbs and spices and he actually gets CREATIVE in inventing new recipes.Yet even he enjoys the occasional grilled cheese sammich.The Warriors series is my grilled cheese. It isn't a real brain-stimulating thought-provoker, nor is it groundbreakingly creative or unique. It isn't written in a memorable style and indeed it is, style-wise, pretty plain (ESPECIALLY if you have ever read the afforementioned Tailchaser's Song or indeed any similarly-themed book such as the immortal Watership Down). However...taking all that into consideration it is still just a pleasurable read, a great way to pass the time. I love the story thus far and am now halfway through the second book, which is even better than the first. Isn't that the purpose of a book, at it's core, to entertain us?"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Other reviewers have covered the content. So I'll share our experience reading this series as a family. My 9 year old liked it. The prose and plots held the adults' attention. But with time, we felt the series was kind of oppressive. There's very little joy or positive energy in these books. The cats spend most of their time on the defensive, getting hurt. And because it is a series, there's a lot of rehashing between books. I also noticed that my child hasn't asked to read any of the author's other series. Instead, my child is now reading the Chronicles of Ancient Darkness series."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"The very first book in the Warriors Saga, Into The Wild, focuses on a Kittypet (A house cat) named Rusty. In the forest, there are four clans: ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan and ShadowClan. There is also StarClan, which is where all the clan cat's warrior ancestors are. Rusty is soon asked to join Thunderclan by the clan's leader, Bluestar. Bluestar gives him the name Firepaw as his new clan apprentice name. (All apprentices have Paw as the second part of their name, then when they are warriors they get a different thing, like for example: Fireheart, Firepelt, Fireclaw, Firedapple, Firefur, etc. And if they become deputy, then the leader dies, they become Firestar.) This books shows Firepaw's journey to becoming a warrior and showing loyalty to his new clan despite most of the clan cats disliking him or taunting him because he was a Kittypet once. By the end of the book, Firepaw becomes a warrior named Fireheart and more cats show respect to him. The Warrior books are wonderful books for young readers, (8-13, give or take a year) and take you through the journeys that the clans have as you enjoy reading these books. I'm a big fan of these books, and you can learn a lot more about them, play games, take quizzes, test yourself on Warriors Knowledge, get your warrior name, and get your clan at: www.warriorcats.comThanks for reading!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Warriors. Pretty straightforward title, no? The book itself, however, is different.[SPOILERS]Rusty is an ordinary house cat, coming and going between his fence along the back yard and his Twoleg home. He receives food regularly; although it may be dry and crusty, it's still food. Although, he soon learns he is not so normal.********Spottedleaf, the Medicine Cat for the Clan dubbed ThunderClan speaks a prophecy, \\"Fire alone can save our clan.\\"Rusty has dreams of the wild. Hunting mice and other prey of the forest. His seemingly dull life takes a turn when he meets his later best friend, Graypaw, in the undergrowth of the forest. The tussel a bit, and this leads the Clan leader, Bluestar, to meet Rusty.The house cat, Rusty, has a flame colored pelt. Heck, he's even dubbed Firepaw when he joins the Clan. You know he is the one the prophecy speaks of, but the Clan does not; it is quite amusing.Throughout the story, Firepaw, Ravenpaw and Graypaw uncover a truth about the warrior, Tigerclaw. But what is it that Tigerclaw has done? Does Ravenpaw know the truth?*********This book keeps you entertained the whole way through, and is a great choice for young readers and adults alike."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"A story about cats that will captivate you as you read it's pages.The first book in the warriors series,it is a very good book.If you think it's a little boring at first, I agree with you,but it gets very exiting.The cats don't have what we call \\"normal\\" cat names, but they do have names like Bluestar,Oakheart and Tigerclaw.The genre of all warrior books including this one, are realistic fiction and fantasy."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"this is one of the best books i have ever read. this book is packed with action and adventure i recommend this series to anyone."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This novel is all about a typical house cat called Rusty, except for reason. Rusty has strange dreams about running free in the wild, every step closer to catching a mouse. When he awakes, he wanders into the forest, deciding to hunt. A small gray head appears which leads him into a fight. Bluestar, the present leader of Thunderclan, asks Rusty if he wants to join her clan. Rusty thinks about it, and the next morning, he gives Lionheart his answer- which is yes.When he first steps into the clan, many cats complain about his stinky TwoLeg scent and his collar. A warrior, Longtail, challenges him to a fight. Rusty fights bravely and gives Longtail a scratch. Longtail teared off his collar, showing the mark of a clan cat. He is known as Firepaw. Firepaw starts his day with Graypaw, his future best friend. They have many mentors including Lionheart and Tigerclaw. At the start, Tigerclaw is accused of killing Redtail; but only Ravenpaw, Graypaw, and Firepaw. Eventually, he begins training with Bluestar, the leader. But one day, he was hunting in the fields when a familliar head popped up. Smudge was there. Smudge was a small cat which Firepaw had grew up with. Tigerclaw catches him with Smudge and reports this to Bluestar. Firepaw knows Tigerclaw is up to trouble. Ravenpaw had caught the whole scene that Tigerclaw killed the old deputy Redtail. Tigerclaw does not admit it, and the friends agree that if Ravenpaw tells, there could be grave danger. One day, a rogue, formally of Shadowclan, steps into Thunderclan territory. Firepaw feeds it, and Tigerclaw again reports to Bluestar. Yellowfang, the rogue, evantually becomes Medicene cat after Spottedleaf, the present medicene cat dies. The cats send Ravenpaw to Barley's farm because of danger.Toward the end of the book, a fight is picked up. Firepaw and Graypaw fight bravely and earn warrior names.

I'm an adult and I discovered it when I was working in a bookstore. This was a great intro to the series. What a feisty, lovable character Firepaw is! All the characters are interesting and serve their own purpose. The story has a good plot and stays on track. The basic concept for the series is taken from Native American cultures(for example, they have a \\"Medicine Cat\\"). If you read books such as \\"She Who Remembers,\\" you will see where Hunter got the idea from. I think it is actually a pretty original idea for a children's series."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I started the Warriors Series. Here's my review of \\"Into the Wild\\". (No Spoilers Included)The open-ended one sentence summary: A \\"kittypet\\" named Rusty is taken into the ThunderClan, one of four cat Clans who live in the wild.Content Inappropriate for All Ages: Violence. Lots and lots of violence.Characters: 5 of 5 StarClans. Rusty is the main focus of this book, and he seems a little bland occasionally, but otherwise good. You can easily care about Yellowfang and Spottedleaf, and the other characters are well-developed as well.Plot: 4 of 5 StarClans. Obviously designed to leave you wanting to read the other five books and: it works. Lots of suspense, and loose ends left over. I enjoyed reading about the cats' Warrior Code, rituals, and mythology, which wasn't too hard to keep up with. I didn't catch any plot holes, but I doubt the series will ever be considered fine literature.Impact: 4 of 5 StarClans. It was a good, suspenseful drama, you care about the characters, and you wonder what's going to happen next. There was a big shock at the end that I'm still not over. Leaves you wanting more, and this one doesn't torture you if you don't decide to read the next one. But if you do...All in all, 4 of 5 StarClans.PS.

The reviews for this series were great and I thought the story would be appealing to little boys.I always read to my son before bed, and as a parent some books I can't wait to read the next night, and some you dread. I really could not enjoy this book. Not a great story line. Too many characters with long names that sound exactly alike. I cannot keep all those cats straight. My son wasn't very excited to read it after the 4th chapter. Not a winner for us."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I enjoyed this book, but some of the cat's customs went further into the realm of fantasy than the concept of talking cats in the first place (like building a defensive wall). Also, I find it socially irresponsible of the author to portray neutering cats in a negative way. (It's sterilization or killing, because one way or the other the population size is going to be controlled.) I would recommend Solo's Journey (or if you want something that's actually in print, Tailchaser's Song) over this book, but when you've read that and want more, it's a fairly good way to spend some time."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I read this book because a friend recommended it to me, but I was sorely disappointed.As far as originality goes, this book is sub par. When I was reading Warriors I was reminded of another epic cat story, Tailchaser's Song; but everything in Warriors seemed merely a poor copy compared to that book. In Tailchaser's Song the cats are beautifully crafted and fantastic while still keeping the mannerisms and solitude of the cats you know. In Warriors the cats are more reminiscent of the creatures from Redwall with their colonies and social structure.Even the plot of Warriors seems inadequate. The characters are very 2 dimensional and stereotyped, and the climax of the story is very small. The author styled the climax so that it was the conclusion of a minor conflict in the plot, while the major conflicts were left unanswered. I am reminded of easy-reading children's books that have little to no climax.Warriors is a rather short book, so I am wondering why the author didn't combine several books in the series and thereby avoid the unforgivable plot mistake of leaving loose ends untied. Of course, Warriors is a low reading level book, so the author probably wanted it to be small in order to not scare away anyone shy of reading.However, I am suspicious that the author chopped the plot into pieces so the readers would have to buy more books than their money's worth to get any closure.If you like small books, or children's books then Warriors is the book for you.But if you are a reader with a voracious Tolkein-sized appetite, you might find better entertainment elsewhere."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Sorry. I couldn't finish this story. I really tried. I like cats, and I like good writing, but I just couldn't get into this one. Maybe it's the confusing names of the cats. Or maybe it's the over-the-top representation of feral cats' behavior. Or maybe I just am too old to get this concept. Whatever the problem is, I just can't recommend this book. But if it's free, try it. You can always delete it."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I have read the entire first series twice through and into the wild is a great start to the series. The main character is Rusty, a kittypet (house cat) who is invited to join a group of forest cats names Thunderclan after a fight with an apprentice named Greypaw. When he becomes part of the clan he is named Firepaw. But what does Ravenpaw, another apprentice, know about Tigerclaw, a warrior of Thunderclan? Who killed Redtail really? And what does the dream that Bluestar and spottedleaf received mean? Fire shall save the clan... Just a couple of words of warning. Make sure you read Into the Wild before any of the others or you won't have a clue whats going on!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I love this series, but mostly because it's about cats. I would have liked it to be written better, but I do not expect it from a childrens book.The only real problem I had with this series is the typo's and the grammar errors. I feel that a published book should have NO typo's or grammar errors! They are distracting and unprofessional.Besides that, I found the series quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"With the Warriors fanbase growing larger and larger, I figured I'd give the first book a try. I wanted to like it, but something about it just didn't hit the mark for me.First of all, the characters blatantly annoyed me. The main character, Firepaw, was particuarly grating. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the title \\"Gary-Stu\\" but it means a character who is beyond flaw, who is handsome, quick-witted, and rarely gets in trouble for breaking the rules. These are a few qualities I noticed in Firepaw that made him truly unlikeable for me. The scene where he bravely attacks the cat taunting him for his \\"kittypet\\" background and rips off his collar was enough to make me actually giggle.Another complaint I have about the characters is that they seemed like cardboard cut outs, with the same stilted way of talking (\\"Look, young apprentice. A sprout. Newleaf will be here in but a moon, and then freshkill will be running well again.\\" not a direct quote, but you get the idea) and not much personality except for the idea that they have a name and some color of \\"pelt\\".The plot left much to be desired, too. The author was killing off characters faster than she could introduce them! Shortly after Firepaw is accepted into Thunderclan, we learn that Greypaw's mentor, Redtail, has been killed in a battle. Overload of information? We barely know who Grewpaw is, let alone his mentor. We can't really be expected to mourn over his death, can we, after just learning his name. I found that for most of the book, knowledge was being shoved down my throat quicker than I could digest it. Thank goodness for the handy character key in the beginning of the book, or I might not be able to keep those swarms of characters straight in my head! (I hope you note the sarcasm.) This is where the lack of distinct personalities really comes into play: I spent most of my time going, \\"I forget...who is ___? I swear I've heard the name before...\\"My final complaint is the portrayal of good and evil. I understand that this is a children/young adult's book, but don't you think we can handle characters that have a little shading around the edges? Sure, there's a bit of treachery within Thunderclan, but--surprise, surprise--the main antagonist is the mentor who bosses his apprentice around, even when his apprentice is injured, growls and grumbles about everything under the sun, and has an ugly scar on his face. Really, Erin Hunter, could you be a bit more obvious? I'm not sure the little kids in the back understand that this guy is supposed to be bad.So, to conclude, I don't get along with the Warrior Cats. She must be doing something right, to have found such a wide range of fans, but if she did, I don't see it."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This book takes the view of a cat, Rusty, as he is accepted into ThunderClan, a group of warrior cats. Two villans, one on the outside, one traitor in the clan. Suspenseful, shocking, and action are all over this book. Not only does it end with Firepaw (formerly Rusty, now a warrior apprentice) becoming a full warrior, it leaves you hanging with the dangerous deputy, Tigerclaw, watching intendly on young Fireheart and the evil Brokenstar banished, but plotting. It leaves you itching for the future books, and starts a series that will make you read nonstop."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Into the wild is the beginning of the warriors series and in my view is one of the best books in the world.

Who is also an apprentice. Rusty's name is changed to Firepaw and he and Graypaw do many good things for the clan. it's awmazing to think about how your own cat could be like this. you never thought of it hunting or finding a mate and fighting other clans. you just think of it as a animal that likes to cuddly and play. but really their much more than that. they have minds, they CAN think. they're not just playtoys. they have lives that i want to help them live. anyone of all ages can read this book and love it. i do. it's one of the best books on the planet!!!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Interesting enough for me to really enjoy listening to my 8 yr old granddaughter read it aloud.

I looked at the cover and thought it would be kind of dorky. I gave it a try and after I got to the second chapter I couldn't put it down.

There are four generations of cats who have beliefs in a powerful race of cats before them called the Tiger clan, the Lion clan, and the Spotted clan. All were very powerful clans that were wiped out. The elders of the clans created four new clans, the River, Thunder, Shadow, and Wind Clans.

It took my reading the first two pages out loud to her to get her interested, but once she started she didn't want to put it down. She breezed through books 1 and 2 and I am now ordering 3 & 4. It's written perfectly for her age and reading level (5th grade). Plus, the typography and page layout are also perfect--lots of leading (line spacing), a decent point size and nicely spaced on the page so it's not intimidating. The story is imaginative and well-written, exciting and a good use of anthropomorphism. The illustrations (cover and chapter headings) are quite nice as well.

Actually, since back when \\"Erin Hunter\\" was only two people writing the books, and not four.

Unfortunently, just about every single Warriors book I have read makes me cry; in fact, I can't even think about the series without wanting to cry. However, I would definitely recomend this series to anyone.

I started this series as a senior in highschool and have enjoyed them the whole time. I never had gotten hooked on a series before this one. It's possible that, if you read a lot of longer books, you would find it a little boring, but I thought it was great for any age of reader."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I first saw this book when I was in third grade. It looked, well, \\"interesting \\". So I read it. At first, I was SOOOOOO confused. It was BOOOORING!!!!! In fact, it was so boring I COMPLETLEY skipped the first chapter. But once Rusty joined ThunderClan, it got better. When I was done, I thought '\\"that's it?\\". I read it over and over again for three hours straight. To be exact, that was five times in one day. I reccomended it to all my friends,but only one stuck with them. When you first get this book, don't put it down and say \\"it's too boring! \\". Read on. Then try to read Fire and Ice. Although Erin Hunter didn't open the serries in the best possible way, this is a must -read for all cat lovers, but some younger readers might not be happy with some of the battles."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I got this book for Christmas in 2010.

From book 1 to the third series of Warriors I read them. I just finished Warriors: Omen of the Stars #6 The Last Hope.

Another good part of this is that it is a very long series. 4 series of 6 books with a 5th planned, along with a series of super editions and entertaining field guides. I have only one complaint. I discovered this series on a trip to Brazil, and I had my nose in the books for so long that I nearly missed seeing half the sights. Obviously some of the books in the series are better than others, but I enjoyed all of the ones so far. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Wow, what an amazing book.

They are bound by the warriors code, which unites the clan. There is some dialect that may confuse some readers, like 'kittypet' or 'twoleg' but mainly they are self explatnatory. This book starts out as Rusty in his kittypet life then shows how he is introduced to the clans by Graypaw an apprentice who leads Rusty, now named Firepaw, into the Clans.

Even Watership Down had a slow start.Firepaw is a housecat that joins a feral cat clan. He gets scorn from other cats becuase he is a 'kittypet', or a housecat.

Maybe if they let on a bit more of his daily life then that would be great but other then that I have no complant. This book is just about the perfect length, not to long not to short. The cover is BEAUTIFUL. So much detail and coloring, like I said great illistrations on the covers.

I literally(sp?) couldn't put it down after I began. I finished the book in one day. (staying up very late I might add) I think that theauthor did a GREAT job with teh description, and the book puts you right in. Beware though...if you want to try this book, buy all of them first: the cliffhangers are a huge problem. It is also very well written, because while the author was writing this, he was keeping in mind a real cat. What they can do, how good thier senses are, and so on. The bottom line is, you HAVE to read this book."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"When the young housecat Rusty decides to explore the forest beyond his yard, he meets Graypaw, a Thunder Clan apprentice, and learns about the four clans of feral cats: the Thunder Clan, the River Clan, the Wind Clan, and the Shadow Clan. He decides to leave his comfortable housecat (or kittypet, as the clan members call it) life to join the Thunder Clan and become apprenticed to a warrior, not knowing about the dangers of enemy warriors, rats and snakes. I find this book very realistic (at least in most parts). For example, the cats in it don't use swords and shields, they just use their teeth and claws! One thing I want to make clear is that this book is nothing like the Redwall books (which I find boring). But altogether, this is a great book!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I love to read, and during the year of 2010, when I was in fifth grade, my dear mom bought me Warriors: Into the Wild. But schoolwork was in my way, nor was I interested. The next year when it was my 12th birthday, my step-dad bought me The Sight. He hadn't known that it was the first of the next Warriors series! But one look at those adorable cats on the cover reminded me of the first of the whole thing was right under my bed...I opened up that book for the first time, and I became lost in another exciting and fearful world of Warriors.It all began with a good-looking ginger kitten named Rusty. Known as a &#34;kittypet&#34; because of his domestication, he is surprisingly curious about the natural world outside his backyard. He sure loved his housefolk, but nothing could stop his wonders.As he explored the forest, he suddenly got in a fight with a gray tom called Graypaw. What kind of a name is that? But two other cats watched their quarrel in the ferns, who were known as Bluestar, this Clan leader, and Lionheart, a great golden warrior. After seeing the fight, Bluestar suddenly asks for Rusty's permmission as a ThunderClan apprentice. Rusty's dream had come true! The next day he confirms the wild cats' invitation with a willing yes.But some cats in ThunderClan were not quite fond of Rusty's arrival, except for Bluestar and Graypaw. After showing his worth to cocky Longtail, an experienced warrior, Bluestar grants Rusty his new apprentice name, Firepaw. He meets another friendly but timid apprentice named Ravenpaw, though the other two apprentices aren't very glad to meet Firepaw.This may have been just a natural-scented forest home of survival, but a mysterious death of Redtial, the former ThunderClan deputy, and Oakheart, the former RiverClan deputy. Those deaths and Ravenpaw's odd shivering around his mentor, Tigerclaw, make everything appear clear to Firepaw. He may be a former kittypet, but he shows dignity and true power, and could be the bravest cat of all.This is a truly vivid and dramatic book that the adventurous and pet lover would love. I've read the whole first series of Warriors, and Firepaw not only works on survival, but uncovers mysterious no other cat could have defied, falls in love with a cat you wouldn't expect, and searches for the meaning of a medicine cat's prophecy: &#34;Fire alone can save our Clan.&#34; Erin Hunter shows her worth as an author, just like how Firepaw shows his real heart of exploring. Anyone can enjoy this hooking book that keeps ya reading all night!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Even though these books are for younger readers, I have found that I am absolutely addicted.

When a dark secret is discovered it is up to Firepaw to find the truth and bring a mysterious warrior to justice.Erin Hunter knows her stuff when it comes to cats. She makes the story please any reader who has ever wondered what dreams of grandeur may haunt the family cat.I love this book and highly recommend it for anyone who wonders where that little wild kitty is going.Look for my next review of Warriors Book 2 Fire and Ice.

I honostly wasn't expecting much. Intead, I was hooked! I found so maany people who lied these books. It has so many thimgs involved in it- romance, mystery, and tons of action that's not gory at all. It also goes over some tough topics like religion (Starclan) and racism. Have you seen the way they talk about kittypets and half-clans? This book is great for everyone. Read it, and you won't be able to stop!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"The Warriors 1: Into the Wild review.A couple of days ago, I had to write a book report for my class. I chose to use a book my mom bought at a garage sale. It was this book, \\"The Warriors\\", a series by Harper Collins. I didn't know what to expect from this book. My mom told me I was just going to have to find out for myself (this doesn't usually happen with the books I read). I am glad to say I LOVED this book! It's very exciting, it has no boring parts, and you never know what's going to happen. I have to tell you what the book is about, but don't worry, I won't give you any spoilers. The main idea is that one day; an ordinary house cat named Rusty goes into the woods. He gets fiercely attacked by a cat named Graypaw, and ends up using his brain to beat him. Afterwards, Graypaw tells Rusty about the four clans; Thunder clan (Graypaw's clan), Wind clan, River clan, and Shadow clan. Each clan is sort of like a tribe of cats. As Graypaw is telling Rusty about Thunder clan, the Thunder clan leader, Bluestar, shows up and asks him if he wants to join the clan. Rusty thinks about it, and comes back the next day to join. I liked the book because it had lots of fighting scenes. If there was one thing I'd have to say I didn't like, it would be that a lot of people died. If they were the bad guys I wouldn't care, but they are some of the people you grow close to. The main event is the Shadow clan asks the Thunder clan for hunting land. When they say no, Shadow clan gets angry and attacks. Another thing you should know, is that some parts are pretty intense. Like when they're walking through grass, they all are attacked by rats, and the cats have to kill almost a hundred of them, it was pretty descriptive. I'm glad we found this book for my book report; I haven't found any flaws. So much happened in this book that I can't wait to see what happens in the second book. I can't wait to read it, it looks so good. I'm not mean so don't worry, I won't give away any spoilers. Anyways, if you read it I can almost guarantee that you will love it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to read a good book. Hope you get it! -Benji WA"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"My nine year old grandaughter had been desperately wanting to read this series of books, I had not been able to find the books anywhere locally here in Melbourne, she remembered that I had bought from the Amazon site, and got really excited when after logging into your website, there were her books,she is now on her third book, with two to go, I personally think it's great that a nine year old, computer literate kid still wants to sit and read, thank you Amazon, and I am sure I will be buying a lot more from your site,warm regards"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"i love these books. i guess you could get that from the stars. but anyway i know some people think these cats dont act enough like cats. guess what, its fantasy! :O i think erinhunter did a great job describing the setting and characters. the only thing i dont like are the cats dying."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"My 8 year old (going into 3rd grade next year) LOVED this book.

However, at first, he is afraid to leave, because of four clans of wildcats in the forest, and he loves his housecat life, but he becomes a ThunderClan cat. ShadowClan is getting too powerful, the other Clans, WindClan, RiverClan, and ThunderClan, are becoming uneasy, and some battles take place, with casualties. Some deaths are more baffling than others.I loved this story because it was very well written, and you didn't have to be a cat person to like it. This book was creative in the way that it used imagination to create a human-like feline society. The names were unique, such as Lionheart or Crookedstar. This was a great tale of friendship. I think that it is directed at 7 through 11 years old, depending on what you think of as appropriate. If you like this book, there are five more books in the series. Also, there is Warriors \\"The New Prophecy\\" which is a continuation of the first series, except with a different main character, and it takes place later in time. There are five of those so far."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read!

He has a black and white cat friend named Smugde, who warns him about going into the wild. He doesn't listen, (of course), and he ventures out into the wild. His housecat name is Rusty, and when he meets this cat clan, (called Thunder Clan), the leader, (Bluestar), gives him a chance to be a warrior. What he finds is adventure.. and finds many secrets! I mean, this book is FUN! With a fantastic prolouge that gets you used to a confusing plot with many lies, (by one cat), without explaining it to you when the time comes. Really, that would be boring. You really want to know the scene. Like knowing a secret before all of the cats do. So, I REALLY, REALLY think you should read this. I've only read the first book in this saga, but I'm going to read every single one that comes out. Like some people are fanatics and are hooked to Harry Potter. Well, this is better. It's ALL about cats, fantasy, action, mystery, and adventure. First Rusty had the name Rusty, then he had the name Firepaw, (when he was training to be a warrior in the clan), and then once he's a real, admired, warrior, and after much adventure, his name is changed to Fireheart. The rest of the book you have to find out about yourself."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Into the wild is a great book!!! It's about a kittypet (a housecat ) named Rasty.

They turned out to be really good. These books are action packed with adventure, and really show you the story. I'm now on the third book and can't put it down."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Ok, we know some of the best books ever, Robin Hood, Hoot, Shilho, ect. This book makes all of those books BORING! I'm not to big on cats, but still this book has everything. Drama, action, happiness, everything. I recomend this book to even non- cat lovers. But if will cry every time a cat will die (and I mean burst into tears and have it ruin you're whole week)then this book is not for you. The first one is the best. It is about a kittypet (house cat) named Rusty who just doesn't feel happy with his twolegs (humans). Soon he meets Graypaw, a ThunderClan apprentice, and is given an offer to join ThunderClan. Now, I'm not telling you any more. If you want more info, just go to warriorcats.com. They have a dictonary there that helps you learn any cat language, and understand more. NOTICE: If you don't like spoliers, stay away from certain places on that site! So like I said, this book makes every book seem like boring garbage! I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I think it's just a travesty to classify this book series as just for ages 9-12. Just as the Harry Potter books have become loved by people of all ages, this book series has the same potential. As a longtime fan of the book Tainchaser's Song by Tad Williams, I was always saddened that I could never find more books like that one...until now. Whereas, as a cat lover and protector, I had some initial issues with the message that cats resent being housecats and the gorifying of feral life, I was quickly able to remind myself that this is a fictional fantasy and should be read as such. I do suggest parents who do buy this book for their children remind them of that fact. With that said, after getting into the book I didn't want to put it down. And I can't wait to get the next one in the series. An adult reading this book will not feel as if it has been written for children - anything but. It is exciting, emotionally gripping, and superbly written."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"As I said, I LOVE WARRIORS! Warriors is a series that any kid or adult is sure to love and enjoy.

If you love cats then I am 100% sure that you will absolutely love these books! I use to hate reading, until my friends introduced me to this series and now I cannot put them down! And, personally I think these books are not just for up to 12-year-olds. I am older than that and I still love reading them. Honestly, it doesn't matter at all how old you are or how advanced the books are. What really matters is the story itself. Warriors is extremely well written and very addicting. It will have your tail twitching in excitement for the next one!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Do you need a good book for reading? If you do, then I strongly suggest you start the Warriors series with the first book, Warriors into the Wild written by Erin Hunter. The first book of this fantasy series starts out with kittypet, which is the word for pet cats used by the clan cats, named Rusty who is a household cat. Rusty, as he is then known as, lives with the Twolegs which is what the forest cats call humans. Rusty wanders off into the forest one night and becomes a cat of the Thunderclan. There are four clans: Riverclan, Shadowclan, Windclan and finally Thunderclan. Firepaw, what Rusty is named after he is accepted into Thunderclan, learns the way of the cats of his clan. He soon makes friends with Graypaw, and Ravenpaw, and they tackle their missions and adventures. Some of the parts to this which I found funny was they used a road that they called the Thunderpath as a border for territories, they called a lumber mill the tree cut place, and they referred to cars as monsters because it could run over any unexpecting cat. Their way of referring to something felt funny because to cat's they were the dangers of the forests, but to humans they're everyday tools and needs. One of the best parts to this book was it was a page turner and it was very easy to get addicted to it. The clan cats also acted in their own way like civilized and normal people. I think the authors' strong points was that it was a series so the author added a huge event, a life changing moment in the last sentence of every book and they also had surprises often. Also, the author did a great job with the story board, the plot, and the surprises. This book is in my opinion awesome, and a truly great book that begins the epic story of the cats of the forest. If you don't mind two to three hundred page books with a variety of surprises everywhere, I would not only recommend Warriors into the Wild, but the whole series. The best part is that they're not even done with the series yet!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"WOW thats all I can say... I think Im gonna make this short.

These clans include ThunderClan,Riverclan, Shadowclan, Windclan and Starclan. In addition,there are cats outside the major clans; such as, Yellowfang,Smudge and Barley.Hunter outlines a complex system of governance among thecats. Each warrior cat has an apprentice. Each clan has aleader and a deputy. In addition, there are cat queens andelders who dispense wisdom.The story opens with a wild catfight between ThunderClanmembers and an encroaching tribe of cats called theRiverClan warriors. Knowing their own turf, the ThunderClancats dived through some rocks and disappeared into theforest roughage without a trace.In another moving scene, Hunter describes the death ofRedtail from a stealth attack by the RiverClan . The ThunderClanceremony began with each member looking up to the Silverpeltthick band of stars. In the cat folklore, each dead cat in the clanwas said to represent one of the StarClan warriors in the Silverpeltconstellation. In an unusual post funeral event, Bluestar namedLionheart as a new deputy of the ThunderClan to replace Redtail.Eventually, the ThunderClan welcomes Rusty who is seen as apotential savior for the group. The medicine cat doesn't agreecompletely. Instead, he believes that ultimately the ThunderClanwill be saved by fire.Hunter's governing principles for the cats involves an organizationalhierarchy with leaders, deputies, warriors and apprentices. Thissystem of organization differs from the one envisioned byGeorge Orwell in Animal Farm. Orwell described a series ofcommandments for the animals to abide. And so, Orwell'sanimals can't sleep in beds, wear clothes, drink alcohol or killanother animal. In addition, all animals are equal.Warriors Into The Wild by Erin Hunter is a good beginner bookto introduce themes of governance in the animal kingdom. Hunter'sbook should be read and understood at some point before teens,high school students and other readers progress to the more complexAnimal Farm or William Golding's, Lord of the Flies.Credits: First Published on Blogcritics"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"hello i loved this book so much i was inspired by it. in fact i met erin herself. you see i introduced my school to warroirs in third grade i go to killian hill christin school in atlanta georgia. my school goes from k-5 to twelvth grade . ia ma now in seventh and am known all around my school from staff to students for introducing warriors."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"amazing. the best book i have read.full of adventues mysterys and love. a must read for any cat lover. i couldnt put it down. you will not regret this buy. i am reading the whole saga"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Rusty has always been a house cat, a pet, but he dreams of life beyond his backyard - beyond his neighborhood even. One day he ventures into the woods beyond his yard and meets wildcats for the first time. Impressed with his fighting instinct, they invite him to join their clan. Rusty finds his new life strange and intriguing and adapts quickly and is given a new name--Firepaw. Then again he has to adapt quickly as there is trouble among the four clans of wildcats. Accusations and rumors are flying. But it is to Firepaw's advantage that he is a newbie to the wildcat life and not entrenched in tradition. He must trust his own instincts to find the real truth of what is going on.I am a dog person, not a cat person, yet Hunter describes the wildcat life to the point that I began to imagine them as primitive people. The language is clean, the fights are not overly violet or gory though there is blood splatter. This one is much better than her Seekers.

Firepaw begins life as the housecat Rusty, renamed when he is accepted into the wild cat group called Thunderclan. Firepaw is an excellent protagonist - he's courageous and has a big heart, but he also makes mistakes and he learns from them. The Thunderclan cats react with varying degrees of emotion to an outsider joining their clan - welcome from Graypaw and Ravenpaw, to suspicion from some of the elders, to outright hostility from Tigerclaw, Lontail and Darkstripe. Firepaw has to proove himself again and again in a world filled with danger from predators, rival clans, Twolegs (humans) - and perhaps even his own clanmates.It's hard to resist cheering Firepaw on during his training, and it's easy to see what a warrior he'll make in the end."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"This is a captivating book that actually blows you literally away into ThunderClan.

However quite a few places in the book could have had more details.First off, Rusty's (later named Firepaw and then Fireheart) kittypet life should of had more content in it or otherwise Erin should have waited to introduce ThunderClan. Second, after Firepaw's inauguration into ThunderClan, the book skipped time. In fact, through out the story time was skipped. In these times, Erin should have told what happened during those gaps.Despite the numerous times the book went fast-forward on its audience, the story was well written. It also was detailed at important parts in the book. For instance, when Bluestar, Lionheart, and Graypaw (latter named Graystripe) meet Rusty.Overall this book was a pretty good book and I am very happy Erin Hunter has expanded the Warrior series extensively.May StarClan light your clan's and your paths, always.-Fogclaw of ThunderClan"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"The medicine cat of ThunderClan recieves a prophecy:Fire alone can save his clan.Rusty, a ordinary kittypet runs into Graypaw,and the leader of ThunderClan, Bluestar.

In the midst of this turmoil appears an ordinary house cat named Rusty... who may turn out to be the bravest warrior of them all."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Into the wild is the first book in a long exciting series. Rusty, a typical house cat, (or his owners think) longs to be running free in the forest in front of his owner's house. Even with his friend's warnings of savage wild cats who eat their own kind Rusty ventures out into the forest. What he finds is not what he expects. While trying to hunt down a mouse, he gets ambushed by another kitten who is so surprised by his willingness to fight back that he he begins to tell Rusty stories of his home, where civlized cats, \\"Clans,\\" fight together and hunt for each other to survive.Then Bluestar, the fierce she-cat leader of the kitten's Clan, Thunderclan, asks Rusty to join her clan, and he finds himself agreeing. Renamed Firepaw, Rusty becomes fast friends with Graypaw, the kitten who he had met in the forest. But clan life isn't easy. Many believe he doesn't understand \\"Clan ways.\\" Training to be a warrior, Firepaw meets an amazing cast of characters: Sandpaw and Dustpaw, two haughty best friends who don't believe Firepaw can ever be a warrior; Tigerclaw, an accomplished warrior who Firepaw doesn't trust; Darkstripe and Longtail, two snotty warrior bullies and Tigerclaw's \\"sidekicks.\\" Then finally Ravenpaw, a skinny nervous tom and Tigerclaw's apprentice.

He likes the forest. One day he is offered the chance to join the ThunderClan, one of the wild cat clans living in the forest. As Firepaw he becomes a cat apprentice and begins his long and hard training to be a warrior cat. After rescuing Yellowfang, ex-medicine cat for the ShadowClan, Firepaw and his ThunderClan are soon in the middle of a clan war against Brokenstar's clan. Firestar suspects that there is a traitor in Thunderclan, but he can't blame anyone before being sure he has evidence for it...just talk or suspicion is not enough.The author has created an interesting forest world with cat clans.Erin Hunter is actually many different writers, and not just one person. The author has written three sets of Warrior cat -books.I would recommend \\"Warriors: Omen of the Stars: The Fourth Apprentice\\" to children/YA/adults who like cats, action and adventure.

Will keep Harry Potter fans at bay while they wait fir the new book.It is very similer to Harry Potter just without the magic and with cats. I actually have some charecter comparisons. Firepaw is alot like Harry, they want to prove themselves and are adventurous. Grawpaw is just like Ron, they like to joke around and are almost always thinking about thier stomachs. Ravenpaw is just like Hermione they are cautious and are clever and quick. Tigerclaw is like Snape, they are cruel and dark. Bluestar is like Dumbledore they are both witty and fair.

Not just any cats, but warrior cats divided up into clans and fighting for territory and their lives. Shadowclan, Thunderclan, Riverclan, Windclan. This book does for felines, what Watership Down did for rabbits. It's written in a way that young people and old can both understand and enjoy it, and get different feelings out of it in the end. I am a cat person, not that I don't like dogs, but the feline temperament so matches my own that I feel kinship to the furry beings. I have wanted a fantasy series to read since Harry Potter ended, but I didn't want a clone, so I opted for a series with non human characters and what I got were Cats that brought out every single semblance of humanity they could. Cats are the one animal that still holds so much mystery to me, little puzzles with tails.Rusty is a kittypet, which means he is owned by twolegs (or humans). Wild cats feel sorry for kittypets, because they have to drink bitter water and eat tasteless food and they get \\"cut\\" and become fat and soft. He dreams of hunting mice and when one day he ventures out beyond the fence line to the forest to stalk a mouse, he is attacked and his life changes forever. I read this in one sitting, while my own kittypet slept in my lap, and afterword's I looked at him differently!! I can't wait to get my hands on the second book, and the one after that.

Both my me and my grandmother have read the books and have nothing but pure praise for Erin Hunter. She really makes you feel like you are there, you are in the story.

Firepaw gets away with alot of stuff but when caught is punished like anyother cat would be. The only really stupid thing is having Firepaw should not be apprentinced to Bluestar.

At the library where I work, I'd seen them taking out this \\"Warriors\\" series by Erin Hunter fairly regularly. For some reason it's near impossible to keep these puppies on the shelves. Curiosity got ahold of me, so I decided to sit down and read through the first of these somewhat odd stories. I would never have been able to guess that the secret lives of cats would be so interesting to children. Housecats, definitely not. But when it comes to the lives and loyalties of the feral variety, Hunter's definitely tapped into a rich resource of text.Rusty has a fairly good life. He lives with a family of humans (or Two-legs) that love him. He gets regular feedings, even if it's yucky dry stuff. He even has his own little cat door to come in and out of. Rusty isn't content, however. He dreams of catching mice in the forest not far from his home. When a night's exploration of that forest ends with a confrontation with the wild cats that live without human interference, Rusty readily joins them and their clan. Renamed \\"Firepaw\\", the cat learns that he has dropped smack dab into the middle of a war. The clan he has joined is called ThunderClan and is ruled by the magnanimous Bluestar. Other clans like RiverClan, WindClan, and ShadowClan fight continually for dominance over a rapidly dwindling food supply. ThunderClan needs recruits like Firepaw to stay alive, and through their training the new cat is on his way to becoming a warrior. Along the way he must face hunger, dismissal, and learn some shocking truths about the animals he's agreed to join.Hunter conjures up a well-thought out world in which cats have their own system of governance. This is a kind of \\"Watership Down\\", but with drawn out fighting sequences. The cats here act like cats. They don't put on vests and waistcoats and discuss philosophy. They don't stand on their hind legs or use their paws like fingers. These are real animals. For the sake of keeping them alive, Hunter does create a kind of Medicine Cat for each clan, who rubs natural herbs into wounds. That's about as technically adept as these kitties get. At the beginning of the book, the author presents us with two maps of the area where this book takes place. A cat-view map lists everything in their terms. A second human-view map makes it clear where exactly the cats actually are.This is not to say that the book isn't downright silly at times. Hunter loves giving these cats somewhat repetitive names like Nightpelt, Smallear, and Longtail. One cat, Lionheart, has the same name as a carebear from the 1980s. Poor planning on Hunter's part. She also falls into a classic children's literature trap. You know that when the main character has a vital piece of information that he should give someone as soon as possible and he says something along the lines of, \\"Oh good! Now I can tell this person this vital piece of information\\", that something's going to come up to prevent him. In this case, Firepaw is given to understand that a friend of his may be killed almost immediately. So does he immediately go out and tell the clan's wise leader? Heck no! He's given TWO chances to do so and each time he keeps quiet for obscure plot-centric reasons. That's really the kind of book that this is. It's fun to read, exciting, and with a new meticulously thought out world. It's also rather predictable.If you've a kid who's a fan of the \\"Redwall\\" series but is more interested in animals that don't wear clothing, this is the book for you. Both boys and girls check it out at a fast and furious rate. It's one of the few series out there that both sexes enjoy fully. A better written book than all the \\"Magic Treehouse\\" and \\"Droon\\" series out there combined but still less good than, say, Avi's, \\"Poppy\\" books or \\"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH\\"."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"My 9-year-old started the first book in the series a couple of months ago, and now she's read all of them at least once.

She reads them at night instead of helping clean up dishes. She has organized her friends into clans. They have clan meetings and put clan marks all over the things in our back yard.I've read the first couple of the books, starting with Into the Wild, and I can see why she loves them. The characters are so well drawn that you feel like you really know them. They face real moral dilemmas and behave in complex ways. Erin Hunter does not talk down to her readers. There's humor but no silliness. Very good books.My daughter is in fourth grade, but she reads at sixth grade level. The reading level of these books is like 5.5 or 6.0.

The Code had not been broken until now. ShadowClan is forcing other Clans out of their territories and is increasing their hunting grounds. But when an adventurous young kitty-pet wanders into the forest, he meets the ThunderClan leader, Bluestar, and joins, leaving his old life behind. The kitty-pet's name is Rusty. The Clan is suffering and Bluestar needs all of the apprentices she can have. With Blustar ans his new mentor, Rusty is trained for battle against the menacing ShadowClan. Many mysterious deaths are ovvurring and spies sleep and eat inside the camp. ThunderClan needs help and only Fire alone can save them.I love this book because I adore animals. This story has an enticing plot and should be read by by any animal or cat lovers.

To prove himself, Rusty battles Tigerclaw, a warrior of Thunderclan. Rusty battles it out, and leaves Tigerclaw with a nasty scar on his face.And that is how the adventure begins. Firepaw,(Rusty) begins his training to be a warrior. But, as Firepaw grows, he learns that there is danger in the forest, ready to strike at ANY given moment. Training to be the great warrior he will be, Fireheart will show the clan,prove everyone that he is just as great as ANY clan born cat is."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I must say that I did not like cats at all until I read this book. I am 15 years old and I was all ways a dog person but this book changed my mind completely! It was so good. One of my friends I met when I was camping with my family really liked to read. And so I was like wow! All of my friends have gone crazy about video games but I still stayed a reader when I still knew nobody that read. Well so any way the friend I met told my about the Warriors and at that time I have never heard of them so I checked the first one out of the Library and read it in 3 days! So I told him about eargon and the sequel Eldest and I also told him about Shadowmancer and Wormwood. Which those are really good book but they are also Young Adult.

The main character starts as just a house pet (cat) but then when he enters the forest the adventures will be endless. This book is a real page turner. You'll get engulfed in its one-of-a-kind storyline. You'll never want to put it down.

A kittypet named Rusty decides to join them. He is named Firepaw as his apprentice name and later Fireheart as his warrior name. He meets new friends and new foes. He has to travel and work hard before gaining respect and fully welcomed in the clan. There are four clans all together. ThunderClan, ShadowClan, Riverclan and WindClan. The clans are rivals but sometimes strike up alliances. Oh, but there is yet one more clan. It is not a clan of living cats but dead ones. It is called StarClan. They are the clan's warrior ancestors. Every moon, (month) the medicine cats of all four clans and their apprentices go to the moonstone. They touch their noses to it and StarClan sends them prophecies, messages and dreams. Only leaders and medicine cats know of what happens at the moonstone. I hope you enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I have grown up with cats my life and I always loved them. I still do but now I eye them more suspiciously after reading this book. It is an excellent book and very adventurous for young readers like me, all the way from the beginning where a young \\"kittypet\\" named Rusty goes into the forest to hunt a mouse when his soon to be best friend Graypaw fights him, to the end which I will not spoil. It is a great storyline and is mysterious with the death of the deputy Redtail. Not until the 3rd book does everyone in the clan found out who the killer is. I suggest everyone who loves cats to read this book. So far I have finished the first series of Warriors which are Books 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. There are 6 books in 3 series so there are 18 books. All in all, it is a very good series as well as this particular one."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"My daughter is seven and a very good reader. She loves the Warriors books. We bought her a bunch for Christmas and has already finished seven of them!(and we are still in January). I have gotten kind of \\"hooked\\" too. It is really like a soap-opera for kids, but in its simplicity and predictability, it teaches a lot about living with others, respect for others' feelings and the importance of helping each other. Yes, the good guys always win, but I wouldn't want it any other way for a kid her age.However, keep in mind that cats do die in the story, and there is violence--more than I expected, especially at the end of the first series (book #6). The second series--The New Profecy--is less violent, but some characters die violent deaths. Still, I'd rather have my daughter reading about violent cats than watching violent humans on television.Overall, it is a good series of books for children when they can read independently."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I have been a fan of Redwall for a long time now and I must say this is as good as Redwall.I just like animals. Nothing is wrong with that,and nothing is wrong with this book.It all starts when a normal house cat, Rusty,goes in to the woods behind his house.He starts to stalk a mouse,but he is attacked by a cat. This cat then gives up fighting when Rusty starts to fight back as hard as he can. When Rusty starts to talk to him he learns that the cat who attacked him is named Graypaw, a forest cat who lives with Thunderclan, one of the four forest clans.I might tell you more but I would ruin the whole book. Any way, FIVE STARS."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"The first book of the Warrior series is Warriors Into the Wild. There was this original house cat named Rusty. One day Rusty went out into the forest in back of his house. When he was in the forest another cat attacked Rusty when he tried to catch a mouse. Rusty tried to fight of the cat so he could run away. Later in the book Rusty choose to go live with the wild cats in the forest. When he made it to the wild cat's camp he got his new name. Rusty trained to become a good warrior cat and in the end he found out that this was all he every wanted."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"My 10/11 year old son just started reading this series. SO far, so good! We'd recommend it."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Ever wonder what a house cat is thinking? Have you ever thought about where your lost cat went? Humans are fascinated by cats strange behavior, but Erin Hunters book \\"Warriors: Into the Wild\\" will turn that fascination around!Erin Hunters \\"Warriors: Into the Wild\\" book is the story of a house cat named Rusty, when he leaves the safety of his backyard to enter the forest behind his house. Like his friend told him, Rusty's attacked by a wild cat, but when Rusty fights back, him and the attacker, Graypaw, become close friends. But when Graypaws Clan leader offers Rusty one day to decide if he wants to join the clan, he has one day to choose between his safe, boring life he grew up with his best friends and caring housefolk, or the deadly life he's always wanted with adventure and freedom at every turn.Eventually, the Warriors series makes a large Text-to-World connection, but I won't spoil it for you. It's mostly Text-to-Text. Each book having a connection to the one before, if it's a fight like a previous one, or there's a tragic story, just like the one before. But no two books have the exact same plot. It's always a new story, new adventure, even if it seams the same.The audience for \\"Warriors: Into the Wild\\" is between 9 and 13 year olds. Although other ages might enjoy the book too. Any cat fan should read the books if they have ever wondered what cats might think from day to day. The audience stays the same throughout all Warriors books so you'll never be disappointed. This book is a good combination of realistic fiction and fantasy and is very similar to other realistic fiction books; love, fighting, adventure, friendship; just with cats!One thing that constantly changes in the story are the characters. At any moment a beloved character dies, or a personal favorite cat, turns blood thirsty and murderous! Families can expand or contrast dramatically within the course of three pages! You're allowed inside the main characters thoughts, to see what they think about what's going on. A big change could occur for one person, but the other might have no idea what just happened! The characters make it seam so realistic, you'll think it's about humans; till one comes along and something disastrous happens, like starting forest fires.Ultimately, Erin Hunters \\"Warriors: Into the Wild\\" is an amazing book that puts the world into a cats point of view. After reading this book, you'll see your pet cat, and other cats very differently!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Rusty,the cat,prepares to leave the cover of his house and go out into the forest.

Some of the characters you'll meet are: LEADER (Bluestar), DEPUTY (Redtail) and MEDICINE CAT (Spottedleaf)."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I didn't buy the boxed set because I wasn't sure if I'd like the series.

The main character grabs you and keeps you rooting for him."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"First of all, I want to say that I was not sure how I would like this book. I had tried to read a similiar book called TailChaser in the past, but I wasn't hooked within the first couple of pages. This one wasn't like that to say the least. I did struggle to read it at the beginning as all of the cats have \\"clans\\" and their names reminded me of Native American names, such as my great-grandfather's, but once you get into the swing of the book, it was a great story and I was upset when my pages stopped turning... I ended up buying the second book because I liked the book so much! The main character/cat starts off as a typical housecat (which I have 3), and becomes this swift thinking, trained warrior that others have come to respect. There is a lot to keep you guessing and there are situations that happen in the book where you start to come up with your own conclusions as to who is the bad guy, what motive they could possibly have, and where things will go...then you'll need the second book. Great read, good for kids and parents of all ages. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"Fire alone can save our clan...Rusty is a normal housecat.

Firepaw is a young cat who is referred to as a kittypet.That is a housecat. Living by the forest he dreams of living wild. Firepaw(or Rusty at this time) is handsome for a cat. While in the forest, Firepaw decides to hunt a mouse. A warrior in training named Graypaw attacks him. Rusty manages to hold him off, even almost beating him. Afterword, Rusty is accepted into ThunderClan, which Graypaw is a part of. Soon afterwords Firepaw manages to defeat several cats, even a leader, without or in some cases barely any training. And whenever he gets in trouble he seems to be rewarded for what he did.This is the only problem with the book. I hope this review helps."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"It may be a tad slow in the very beginning but overall it is a fast paced action packed book about feral cats.

I didn't like cats, but I wanted to know what was so great about it, so I picked up a book from my school library. I'm now in seventh grade, and I haven't stopped since. These books have everything a reader could wish for- Action, suspense, a bit of romance on the side. There are mysteries and a lurking murderer. This is good for anyone, because the mushy parts aren't bad at all, and the violence isn't graphic, and short enough to not become a bore.When I started, I was old enough to appreciate the books, but young enough that I didn't mind the feelings of cliches that an older reader may get. Yes, I am suggesting you start reading these bighly ooks at an early age, but if you don't, skipping to the second series should be fine. This has a much newer plot to it, and I feel that the theme of Warriors begins to show more.In the third and fourth series (Yes, be ready for years of these books.) I feel that we begin to learn more about the clans themselves. This is done by taking three young kits and putting a dangerous prophecy on them. My favorite, Jaykit, is the most quizzical of them, and throughout the books is the one who's trying to understand how he got this prophecy. We are taken to a time before the clans, the place that most cats are too afraid to name, and even to a tribe of cats who mean more to the clans than we first learn about. The author has even promised that her fifth series will be about the very dawn of the clans, so we discover what that was like as well.I highly recommend this book, as it gives years of pleasure and matures with the reader."},{"Title":"Into the Wild (Warriors)","review":"I have read lots of Warrior books but this book was just well like I said TOO GREAT!Or maybe even well I just cant explain!

Lawrence and Titanic! The primary story, A Man with A Maid, an underground novel of the Victorian era, is a gentle and loving novel with mild bondage. The novel works on a lot of levels and actually has deep insights into the nature of sexual desire. Alice, a charming but rather frigid young lady has been raised with all the hypocracy of the Victorian era and doesn't even admit to herself the smouldering sensuality of her body and subconscious mind. She visits the man but is stiffly formal and pretends she has no interest in the man. He knows better. He lures her in and traps her in a snuggery -- an elaborate padded cell previously designed to restrain the insane, where nobody will hear her scream -- and he ties her up with cords and leaves her suspended. She is gradually forced to admit to her burning sensuality as he tortures her with pleasure (like feathers against her naked, tied-up body). He doesn't release her, yet he doesn't take her either; instead he tortures her with pleasure not pain until she can't stand it anymore. She finally begs for him... and he forces her to admit to herself that she really has sexual desires equal to his, that the Victorian era could not allow any lady to publicly admit to.... I was hung up about sex and read this as in college, it released me from my own inhibitions from childhood.Order two copies!

First they tell about how they caved vampire mountain. Then Seba tells how Mr. Crepsey was when he was Darren's age and Mr Crepsey denies all of it.

What I found about the entire Cirque Du Freak series, however, was that it was not JUST about being a vampire, or a member of a Freak Show. It teaches about loyalty and friendship; what a real 'family' is, even without the blood-relation.In fact, I was so smitten with this series (Mr Shan, are listening?), that I made a gift of all my books to a then 11-year-old friend, because I was confident there was little to no swearing of any consequence, no real sexual content, but a good wholesome and fun teaching story definitely well-worth my time and my young friend's.Hours and hours of good reading fun and miles of smiles afterward.

When Darren got to the top of vampire he discovered that when all the vampires get to Vampire Mountain a ceremony takes place.In the book I had a few questions. Like, \\"what are the trials of initiation?\\" But it was never answered. The author captured me with this book. He used a lot of explanatory words. I also like horror books about vampires.

Well here is a story of a boy trying to become one. The story takes place, present day. Darren Shan is traveling to a place called, Vampire Mountain to become one of them. Once there, he needs to be accepted as a full vampire.This book was at the top of my list, because it was both spooky and a fantasy. These types of books usually spark my interest. I would recommend this book for anyone age ten and older, because it is easy to read and understand. Or for anyone who prefers fantasy and survival books. The book kept you on the edge of your seat always wanting more and more.D- I enjoy this genre, fantasy books are one of my favorites. This book did a great job of doing just that, because you just can't guess what's going to happen next, nor can you can you tell. Plus it introduces you to new things or animals that you know nothing about. It allows you to use your imagination a little bit more then some other books do.I- When I was reading the book I found my mind usually didn't wander, but there were a couple of times that I did notice my self getting side tracked. However, when I got side tracked it was about the book. Sometimes just by stopping and thinking about what's going on and imaging what's going to happen next in the book"},{"Title":"Vampire Mountain (Cirque du Freak, Book 4)","review":"Fraaz Siddiqui November 30,2004Vampire Mountain, Darren Shan~London, ISBN 0-316-60806-8\\"Stop!\\" I hissed. \\"Don't let her out - she's poisonous!\\" Darren is on the journey to vampire mountain along with mr.Crepsley and two assistants desmond tiny has accompanied them with. On the way they find the blood of a vampanze. After that they meet a vampire general that's also a friend of theirs. His name is Gavner Purl. After Darren and mr.Crepsley told Gavner the news all of them became cautious. Also on the way Darren met wolves. One he- wolf, two- she wolves, and one cub.

They make it to vampire mountain. Darren meets somany vampires. The news of the vampanze lord has awakened. The genre of this book is realistic fiction.This book was exellent! I recommend this, because you need the understanding of it for the future books you read of the Cirque Du Freak series. This book builds up the action for the further books to come. In my opinion I think who would like this book is ages eight and up. The type of person who would like this book is really into war, magic, creatures, quick surprises, and a little imagination. This book was a page-turner, because on the back of the book it said, \\" page-turner\\", and second of all you couldn't stop reading until your parents said, \\" go to sleep.\\" There were many surprises in the book one of them were Harkat Mulds. His gray face had been stitched together, his green eyes, mask over his mouth, but you still could his agonizing sharp teeth, no nose, and small dots for ears.

Upon reading the first four books in the series it is easy to see why Universal Pictures* has decided to adapt the 12 books into 4 separate movies (each movie chronologically focuses on a book trilogy). The books are interesting, easy to read, and not too childish (as one might perceive from the large font and short page count) - but at the same time they do take a lot of time for things to really start going. It wasn't until the fourth book that any of the mythology has started to come into the play.The first three novels can easily be summarized as Darren Shan's introduction into the world of Vampire's and later a particular ensemble of creaturesFun. They can easily been seen as a collective story (as they deal with Darren's destruction of his human-life to his nave acceptance of his vampire life) but they also each have their own distinct manner.The fourth book is a bit of a departure for that. It seems that the author, now confident with his series and armed with an established world, has finally set out to tell the story he has been itching to get to. The book takes place approximately 8 years after the events of the third book and equally works as a sequel, while keeping a distinct distance from the series epilogue. In this novel the author has confidence in his story and his characters enough to finally delve into his vampire mythology and lore - something he seemed unwilling to do in previous novels.But this becomes a double edged sword for the novel: it brings the reader to a whole new level within the \`Cirque du Freak' world - but so much time is spent in the novel telling the back story that the book suffers from a lack of a plot. There is a beginning and a middle but no real end. There is no climax. There is character growth (a lot of it), but this particular installment finished unfulfilled because the reader is left with more confusion than anything else.If the reader can get beyond the books lack in plot (this book seems to set the tone that the remainder of the series will stray from self-contained stories into overlapping arc-like structures) they are rewarded with a very rich history, some particularly interesting (both psychologically, biologically and even in view of popular culture) liberties with the vampire. The character's of \\"Harkart\\" and the various vampire supporting-cast as well as the mysterious Mr. Tiny are all developed well beyond anything seen in the previous novels. For the first time as a reader I looked beyond the obvious peril and emotion in the book and starting to really care for the characters. Because I have spent more time with them, because they are more fleshed-out, and because his book easily hints at some pretty amazing storytelling in future books."},{"Title":"Vampire Mountain (Cirque du Freak, Book 4)","review":"About the Book:Six years later (eight years since the initial change), we return to Darren Shan's adventure. This time Crepsley plans on bringing Darren before the Council to see what verdict will be placed due to a child being blooded. Before that though, they have to worry about making their way up the snowy mountain with no help but their own skin (and barefoot). Along the way will prove dangerous, of course, as they run into rabid bears, wolves, and even vampenze!Review:Research! As a writer, you need to do research! Shan has been notorious for having flaws in this series so far (for example, in The Vampire's Assistant, Shan describes Evra's snake as slimy). Although this bothered me before, it was always simply a sentence here or there. Yes, it was jarring and brought me out of the story. It caused my suspension of disbelief to snap, and I found it so much worse in this book because it was staring me in the face for a good quarter of it. It was because of this that I actually rated this book three stars instead of four. The issue I have with Shan's lack of research was that a simple Google search could have provided the answer. So what bugged me so much in this book? While trekking to Vampire Mountain, Darren a pack of wolves. First off, they tended to act more like dogs than wolves, such as the male rolling on his back to get his belly rubbed. Granted, wolves and vampires are supposed to get along extremely well in this world. Even though this bugged me, if it was the only issue, I might have been able to ignore it. However, Shan was also constantly calling the wolf pup a cub, and at one point the pup actually manages to climb a tree, but the attacking bear cannot. I'm sorry, but even children know it's a wolf pup and that wolves don't climb trees. I can understand not getting everything right, but these are facts that even kids know.Other than the obvious lack of research, I found myself enjoying the book. Even though some of the things seemed odd to me (like bat broth), I really appreciated that Shan's vampires are not your typical vampires. We learned early in the series that Shan's vampires actually age, but in Vampire Mountain, we learn more about them as a group. Instead of your typical aristocratic type, Shan's vampires are more \\"masculine.\\" They are constantly having physical challenges, and their highest leaders are apt to be quite brawny. Shan's vampires actually reminds me of barbarians of sorts, and even though their ways had a familiar feel about them, it was interesting to view their traditions (even if I didn't always agree with them).Shan also managed to hit me with a good amount of surprises throughout this tale, such as when one of the Little People started talking or when you learn what they are. Shan also continues to let Darren make mistakes and be flawed, which I always appreciate, and Shan's fast paced writing and story telling keeps me more (especially with the cliff hanger he leaves us on). Cirque du Freak is definitely getting more interesting as the story unfolds. It really is a tale of its own caliber, an original piece. I just hope that the rest of the series isn't so poor in its facts so that it can be even more enjoyable and more believable."},{"Title":"Vampire Mountain (Cirque du Freak, Book 4)","review":"\\"Vampire Mountain\\" is the fourth book Darren Shan's great series, \\"Cirque Du Freak.\\" This book startes six years after book four and chronicles the journey of Darren and Mr. Crepsley to Vampire Mountain.

Great read!"},{"Title":"The Very Comely Countess (Sonnet Books)","review":"A lord marrying an orange seller is as unlikely a Regency plot as I've ever seen, and yet...the interplay between these two characters kept me spellbound all the way through to the end. Of course, Harriet Treene isn't your average, everyday orange seller, and it isn't just her beauty that captures the heart of the broodingly handsome Lord Bonnington. Her courage and character, her intelligence, her witty repartee--yes, even her bold Cockney accent--make her the perfect counterpart for a lonely earl seeking purpose and meaning in his life.Okay, I admit that it's a bit farfetched that Regency society would accept an orange-girl countess, especially one that was widely known to be the earl's mistress before their marriage. But you know what? This is one of those love stories that everyone dreams of in their heart of hearts--even those stuffy old matrons who look down their noses at any girl dancing the waltz without their permission--and I, for one, am willing to suspend judgment in exchange for the most engrossing read in the last six months."},{"Title":"The Very Comely Countess (Sonnet Books)","review":"In 1799 London, William Manderville an Earl concludes that the actresses he uses to cover his government work on the French coast are failures. He needs someone different and thinks he found his answer in the drawing done by a Duchess of an orange seller commoner. When William finds the orange seller Harriet Treene he shows her the picture saying his friend will pay her if she poses as a model.At the family pie shop, Harriet notices her older sister Bett looks tired from work, raising an infant, and being pregnant. Harriet decides to accept the Duchess' offer to paint her for a fee. Harriet visits the Duchess but William arrives and offers her a deal. He will finance a tea shop for her in exchange for her posing as his mistress on his messenger trips to France. As they act out the masquerade neither expected love or the danger that awaits them in France from an individual seeking revenge.THE VERY COMELY COUNTESS, the sequel to the DARING DUCHESS, is an exciting tale due to the espionage subplot and a glimpse at the working class, but especially because of the love story between a commoner and a noble. Though this book uses the same plot device as its predecessor and lacks the locale creativeness of the first book, fans will enjoy the tale because the lead characters are a delightful daring duo who deserve a lifetime together. Regency romantic suspense fans will gain much pleasure from award winning Miranda Jarrett's wonderful tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Very Comely Countess (Sonnet Books)","review":"To society, the Earl of Bonnington (William Manderville), is a dissolute rake, with nothing more on his mind than who will be his next mistress. Appearances are deceiving, as Manderville is a covert spy for the British government, making trips back and forth from England to France, ferrying secret messages and information to help the British cause. In order to do this, he poses as an aristocrat with nothing but pleasure on his mind, travelling with his mistress. When his last mistress almost blows his cover, he is on the lookout for another one, finding Harriet Treene, Orange Seller extraordinaire.I like the book's premise, but I agree with the other reviewers that Harriet's speech was entirely too distracting. She attempts to correct her speech, but still has it to the very end of the book. Some may say that defines her as a unique character, but there are ways to represent this without taking away from the book's content. I don't know how many \\"Hey, ho\\"'s I came across, but by the end of the book, I felt I was on a pirate adventure. I was waiting for Jarrett to throw in an \\"Aye, matey. Ya landlubber\\". In addition, the thrown in introduction of Zeke at the end felt as if Jarrett didn't know how to explain the evil character's purpose for revenge. One scene that was just odd was Harriet's orange juggling antics at the Duchess' mansion. I don't see how polite society would not ostracize the Duke, Duchess, and Bonnington after that.The main characters did have chemistry, and the plot line was interesting, if a bit unbelievable. As history shows, the Haut Ton would not have accepted Harriet into their ranks, and would have ostracized Bonnington, his family and relatives, also.This isn't my first Jarrett book, nor will it be my last.

TLOB is about rich, powerful, well connected and superficial people who do dreadful things and get away with it only because they can. Never mind if it's old money (the Feddens on the wife's side) facilitating new money (Fedden himself), they're all in it together so they're equally culpable. Nick's moral compass appears to be missing, but then his character is blurred, almost underwritten because his role is to hold the mirror to the corruption and hypocrisy of the Feddens' lifestyle and reflect the image of corruption upon himself. His naivety is to believe that he can sponge off his hosts and trade on their amorality without having to pay the price for it. His life spirals out of control as he goes from a relationship with black council worker Leo to one with Middle Eastern playboy Wani and then to drugs and finally rejection as his time runs out after inadvertently unleashing a scandal that threatens to capsize the political ambitions of his host.The artistic restraint that Hollinghurst typifies in his writing throughout is palpable and a virtue. The secrets the indiscreet and slightly mad Catherine Fedden help put into the public domain could blow the roof off but Hollinghurst reveals them in an almost nonchalant manner with double the dose of irony, cool and class.TLOB is an excellent novel, a mature and fully realized piece of work and certainly Hollinghurst's best to date. It is contemporary literature of enduring value and fully deserving of the Booker. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"_The Line of Beauty_, by Alan Hollinghurst, is a picaresque as well as a comedy of manners that satirizes the Tory elite during Margaret Thatcher's term as Prime Minister. Most of the action takes place where London's gay culture improbably intersects with the conservative ruling class.Nick Guest, a young homosexual, is \\"taken up\\" by the affluent family of Gerald Fedden, a Tory MP and lovable idiot. At the outset of the novel, the rather innocent Nick meets and falls in love with Leo, a more experienced man. Three years later, Nick is a more experienced man too, and we see him taking his new boyfriend, Wani, to a gay beach spot, where they pick up a third young man and take him home for cocaine and group sex. Things go way too far, very quickly, and another year later, Leo is dead of AIDS and Wani is dying while still pursuing his coke habit as best he can. At the same time, the veneer of respectability surrounding Gerald and his Tory mates is being rubbed very thin. Gerald wins reelection, very narrowly, but doesn't take the warning. He becomes a minister but then is disgraced in an accounting and sex scandal.A prominent theme in the book is decadence and decay: a riot of pleasure seeking disguises a weak foundation, but not forever. Another theme is Nick's coming of age: after the decadent world he lives in collapses, Nick recognizes the wider world in a sudden, brilliant revelation.Nick is not a saint or anything like one, but he is a benevolent spirit: if nothing else, he is polite and helpful and he possesses social graces. He is motivated by a pursuit of beauty, symbolized by the ogee curve, the line of beauty of the title. His ally is Catherine Fedden, Gerald's daughter, and the only member of the Fedden family in reasonable correspondence with reality. It is she who eventually demolishes the family by simply telling the truth.This book won the 2004 Booker Man Prize, and I don't know why. It is entertaining, and Hollinghurst has enviable powers of observation and description, but it seems inconsequential in comparison to some of its competitors for the Prize (like _The Master_ and _Cloud Atlas_)."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"This book has been called many things from sheer pornography to a masterpiece in the Jamesian vein. To me it fits the pattern of a \\"Bildungsroman\\" about a gay young social climber in the age of Mrs. Thatcher. I shall not try to recount its contents as this has been ably done by another reviewer. Nick Guest, our hero, reminds me of Tom Rakewell of Auden/Stravinski's \\"A Rake's Progress\\", less on the side of Nick Shadow but more an \\"Innocent\\". What I like about this masterpiece novel is the distinct vagueness of Nick's progress with his thesis, with his social ambitions and with his sexual desires. We never get to know any of those subjects: Are his Jamesian studies side- tracked by his magazine work? Is his attitude towards high society ambiguous or cynicall? And we never learn whether he is a hunter for sexual partners or an easy pick-up for the shameless rich.Together with the uncertainty of his future life (Will he become a scholar? Will he climb to the top of society? Has he caught the virus?), this novel achieves what few do - to create hunger for a sequel."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Oh what a magnificent novel; I'm absolutely delighted.

First I don't have a clue who'll accept it in the way I did and the answer on the second question is confusing (for myself too) because what is all about indeed? For the first time (as I remember) the theme, the story was irrelevant. And I do realize how that could sound odd when this refers to one book.I mean when you write the book you are writing about something concrete, no? Well, here I'm not sure in that. Here, the way of telling story was so bewitching, so beautiful that it made the story itself almost irrelevant. Sentences were so ... I don't know ... liquid; I had the feeling that I don't read but drink this book. Lovely! Those metaphors, irony, humor, deliciousness, elegance, etc. everything is justifying the title. &lt;u>The Line of Beauty indeed!&lt;/u>This is second Hollinghurst's novel I've read; first one was The Swimming-Pool Library and I liked this one much more. I don't know maybe I'm little puritan although I never thought about myself in that way :)Here I'll write little anecdote about those two books. Namely when The Line of Beauty won Booker Prize in magazine \\"Vreme\\" (Serbian \\"Time\\") on the cultural pages was title \\"Gay novel won Booker\\" and I thought \\"oh that could be something new and interesting\\" (since I'm absolutely hooked on Booker). At the end of that article was web address from where they took this article. I forgot address but it was site for gay and lesbians and I went to check what they say about this novel. It was a huge surprise; namely almost everyone were saying how The Line of Beauty is incredibly boring novel but The Swimming-Pool Library is exceptional.Now when I've read both novels I could understand why: in this novel there is no \\"action\\" while \\"Library\\" is so full of \\"action\\" that the pages are becoming sticky. So I'm wondering is this novel \\"gay novel\\" at all and what does this mean? Yes, Nick - the main character is gay but hey, I almost didn't notice that!Of course the novel tells about SOMETHING (after all my copy has 500 pages) and that something is probably above all, crush of that Jane Austin's England (ridiculous in its survival 'till present time), traditional, noble, prim and stuffy and some very untraditional (or unconventional) things such are homosexuality, drugs and AIDS which actually can be found everywhere if you scratch that posh surface.I'm fascinated with that \\"Elephant in glazier's shop\\"--syndrome where everyone are noticing the elephant but no one react, simply because that's not noble. Equally here, you may be debauchee and completely immoral but everything will be perfectly fine as long as you don't take wrong fork at the dinner party. Gosh, that would be such a catastrophe! Preserve surface intact is absolute priority!Also the portraits are magnificent, all of them. They are all members of English aristocracy or those who painted themselves in the colours of English aristocratism (although they usually have too much paint on their faces) and their surrounding (Nick). All of them are pictured so detailed that you could literally see their thoughts and feelings. Therefore I found Nick so close to me. I completely share his affection to art and beauty; his addiction to the people that loves, his hedonism, his humor, his sharp eye and sharp mind. Oh I could easily identify myself with his character (although I'm not gay but hey, love and passion are blind, aren't they?).Pure Beauty!"},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"For me, The Line of Beauty has a sharp dividing line between a novel I was bored by and a novel I enjoyed very much.The entire novel is very well written. Hollinghurst conceives what is a very interesting concept. The main character, Nick Guest is a middlish class young man who has graduated from Oxford and is now staying with a very rich family of an univesity classmate headed by a Conservative member of parliament. Nick is openly gay and just beginning to act on his desires.The world of the rich that Nick inhabits consists of characters that could have existed in any Jane Austen novel despite the time being the late 20th century. The Lords, Ladies, Dukes etc. don't seem to act much differently than their families have for centuries. This backdrop contrasted with Nick's journey into gay sexual promiscuity should make for an interesting combination. It doesn't really work for me though. I found the focus on the societal norms of the circle he interacts with to be frightfully boring. I found the first 250 or so pages to be really hard work. If I'd reviewed the book after 250 pages, I would have said well written, good concept but poor execution.The last third of the novel really turns things around. The plot points are more interesting. The spectre of AIDS becomes a big part of the picture. Additionally scandal touches the family and friendships are tested. Nick's societal acquaintances really start to realize that perhaps he isn't the right quality of person to be interacting with.The great scene that marks the turning point is when the head of the family that Nick is staying with holds a large party where Margaret Thatcher is the guest of honor. It is an very well written extended scene where 1980s Thatcher Britain is captured at a point in time. From this point on, I very much enjoyed The Line Of Beauty.Several people have remarked that there's a lot of gay sex. I'd simply say the lead character is a young gay man who is learning to express his sexuality. What the heck would you expect? The gay sex scenes are not particularly explicit and fit quite well in the story.Overall, I recommend the book but the boredom factor in the first part make it a reserved recommendation."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I thought the writing was excellent, pure literature. The story and characters were a little hard to get into in the beginning; but then it pulls you in, holds you, and defies you to put it down as you get to the end.The main characters were beautifully nuanced. The dialog was excellent and the descriptions were amazing. Not only do I know these characters, I feel I was there with them and wish I had them as friends. I would categorize the story as a drama with a strong emphasis on character study, though I laughed out loud a few times at the wit.To be critical, I thought parts of the plot were a bit choppy, some characters weren't as fully developed as others, and the timeline jump was a bit jarring. But this are all minor complaints.The measure of a book to me comes down to would I recommend it to others and would I read more from the same author. Due to a little explicit sexual content, I would recommend this to open-minded friends interested in top-notch literature. And, I'm writing this little review because I'm on Amazon checking out Alan Hollinghurst's other books."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"This book is highly engrossing, and while the themes are all very familiar, they force you to do a \\"double take.\\" You realize after you reach its crumbling finale that every detail of the story is a fair and overlooked representation of the 80's. The sexual encounters are perhaps the most essential revelations of this frame of mind; whithout them, the story would be no more than British television drama. But it is the unabashed recount of sexual encounters which unmask the ethos of this decade, the ravenous search for power."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"What really amazed me about this book and Alan Hollighurst as a writer, is his incredible power of observation and perception, and the way it's done with the fewest words possible. Set in London in the mid eighties, the book centers on Nick, a young gay man coming of age among the often snooty upper crust of the London political and social circles.As a social satire the book is brilliant, never veering off into the trap of easy stereotypes, but instead subtly skewering them with biting humor and precision. The book manages to capture a wide range of topics from class structure, to the division of race and sexuality, and although the ripple effects of the plot have devastating consequences, I still felt a sense of hope by the end.It's a novel that hopefully will trancend the confines of a \\"gay literature\\" label, and simply be remembered as a great and superbly written work."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"The Line of Beauty by Alan HollinghurstThis novel is the winner of this year's Booker Prize over a book I loved and ardently supported, David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas. Did it deserve to beat out Mitchell's opus? Arguably, yes. Where Mitchell's magnificent novel is raw, vibrant, explosive, exciting, poetic, and prophetic, The Line of Beauty is refined, subtle, understated, touching, eloquent, and reflective. Hollinghurst excels in creating a prose where everything is vividly rendered from mood, to tone, to atmosphere, to pacing, to setting, to plot, all within an economy of words. That is, though the book is so perfectly realized, it still retains the quality of a translucent prose that allows the reader to focus on what Hollinhurst wants the reader to see/think/feel. The reader is not at all distracted from the story by Hollinghurst showing off his literary virtuoso like Mitchell sometimes can be accused of doing. Rather, this book is a perfectly crafted work of determined, fully realized art. Hollinghurst runs a massive gamut of themes from art and beauty, to obession and love, to wealth and morality, to sex and power, and beyond. This is a deadly serious and utterly adept creative work that is here to inspire and mature the reader--rarely to entertain. It is not what I'd call fun to read like Mitchell is, but it sure as hell earns every ounce of praise it receives."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I finished reading \\"The Line of Beauty\\" about a week ago and have been sitting with it since, trying to come to some sort of conclusion about my experience with it. Finally, I have to say that I didn't find anything illuminating in this read. I understand the author was going for a kind of Jamesian update, and yet what was missing for me was some kind of revelation from the lead character, something other than a willingness to simply slide along opportunistically through days and years of a shallow uppercrust style of life, wholly unexamined. This lack of deeper awareness from Nick's character made the ultimate experience of the book feel equally as shallow to me. (Could this book have been written for a reader young enough not to have been aware of the tragic pitfalls of living high and heedlessly in the '80s? I doubt it). Hollinghurst's prose is exact, economical in his observations, offering pithy contradictions which seem to capture an entire character in one swift observation; but I began to tire of these 'bon mots' because I needed something more than clever observations. The story structure became repetitive and a little dull, and nothing deeper or greater was ever revealed: another lusty encounter, another line of coke, another party. I knew death was coming, but I learned nothing from it, and I doubt Nick did either. And so for me, the book did not satisfy."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Others have written well of this book. I simply wanted to add that I think Hollinghurst in general fills a niche in the gay fiction genre, in that he is first and foremost a richly talented writer with acute observational skills, and intensely intimate introspective capabilities (forgive the alliteration). That said his writing is also hot. He unabashedly explores the sexual lives of his characters, which makes him exquisitely modern and insouciant. Straight women friends of mine have enjoyed his work as much as my gay male friends precisely for this quality. Seldom does an avid reader come away from a novel with such a sense of satisfaction and intellectual fulfillment. Alan if you read this - we are all waiting for more."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Alan Hollinghurst's Booker Prize novel was one of the very best books I have read in a long time - and I have been reading Pultizer and Booker novels for the last few months. Wow, this book has the most facinating characters! The story is told by a young man who just came out of the closet. Instead of making his protagonist unrealistically kind or likable, Nick is extremely real and has many shortcomings that really bring his personality to life. The many men and one family that float in and out of Nick's early twenties life are so beautifully described via their interactions with Nick, that I honestly felt like I knew them at the end of the story. Overall, I was sorry to see this one end. It is a MUST read!"},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"This is a superbly written book. Thatcher's great experiment which placed economics ahead of social responsibility is in the background of the text. In the foreground are the hedonistic and greedy pursuits of the rich and famous and their hangers-on. Told through the voice of a young gay man, the story has some prurient descriptions of sex which some may find confronting. Skip those bits if you must but read the rest. It is essentially a tragedy, the characters' shallow lives leading ineluctably to bitterness, estrangement and death - pretty much what Thatcherism has brought us all."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"THE LINE OF BEAUTY, the latest offering from Alan Hollinghurst, is a brilliant, witty, and satirical look at the excesses of upper crust gay life in London during the Thatcher years. Hollinghurst's description of Thatcher's visit to Fedden's house is hilarious. But the real star in this book is Hollinghurst's prose: pure brilliance. I haven't read his other books (yet), but can't wait to devour them."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Alan Hollinghurst's latest novel, winner of the Booker Prize, is a beautifully written, richly nuanced work and certainly the best of his four novels. The action covers four years during the Margaret Thatcher years from 1983 to 1987 in the lives of one Nick Guest, aptly named, a recent Oxford graduate and in love with all things beautiful, sex, wealth and all the things that money makes happen; the Fedden family: Gerald, a conservative Member of Parliament, his wife Rachel, his children Toby, Nick's friend, and Catherine; Leo; Wani and a host of other lesser characters. The Prime Minister herself makes a brief appearance.This novel obviously is a tribute to Henry James. Nick is doing graduate studies on the style of James. There are referenes, some quite funny, all through the novel to the writer and to many of his novels. There is a clever scene, for example, when Nick and Wani do a line of coke (beauty?) on a book of James criticism. In a passage reminiscent of James' indirectness on the death of Poe, (\\"The extremity of personal absence had just overtaken him\\") Nick wonders how James would have described a certain character's healthy member: \\"If he [James] had fingered so archly at beards and baldness, the fine paired saliences of his own appearance. . . Nick said, 'Oh, it was. . . of a dimension.'\\" Just as in James' novels-- Ezra Pound is quoted as saying THE SPOILS OF POYNTON was a novel about furniture-- style and class are important to these characters. The sitting arrangements at fancy dinners mean everything. This novel, however, is more more than a brittle look at money and manners among the wealthy. It is ultimately about betrayal, sickness and death, the cynicism associated with political ambition and the tragedy of wrong choices. Nick is ultimately brought low; his tragic flaw is that he chooses the wrong people for his extended family.A master of language, Hollinghurst can describe a character or create a mood with one or two words: A piano tuner is a cardiganed sadist. Wani is simply a \\"closeted cokehead\\". A woman has blonde hair in expensive confusion. Nick's calves and thighs ache with \\"guilty vigour\\". Rachel's dark hair has \\"candid streaks of grey\\". The author also writes paragraph after paragraph of beautiful, insightful prose. Take the example of Nick as a gay man not being honest with his parents, whom he isn't very kind to: \\"And Nick thought, really the poor old things, they do as well as they can; but for a minute he almost blamed them for not knowing he was going to Europe with Wani, and for making him tell them a plan so heavy with hidden meaning. It wasn't their fault that they didn't know-- Nick couldn't tell them things, and so everything he said and did took on the nature of a surprise, big or little but somehow never wholly benign, since they were aftershocks of the original surprise, that he was, as his mother said, a whatsit.\\" Finally, even though there have been dozens of novels written about AIDS and we who are living have long since gotten past the hopelessness of the early years of the epidemic, Hollinghurst is able to recreate the utter horror we experienced on hearing of the first deaths of our friends and loved ones.This is a fine novel indeed. It's a shame that in many bookstores, at least in the United States, it will be stocked in the \\"gay\\" section or \\"alternative lifestyles\\", whatever that means. Of course Ian McEwan's novels are never found in the \\"straight novel\\" section; neither is THE SON ALSO RISES to be found on the \\"Caucasian male novel\\" shelf. Maybe Shakespeare's Puck was right for saying what fools we mortals be."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"At times, I lost interest in the first part of the book but enjoyed it more as the story developed. Fascinated by the insight into life, the class system, and politics in England during the Thatcher era."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Alan Hollinghurst - a classical novelist, author of \\"The Swimming-Pool Library\\", \\"The Folding Star\\" and \\"The Spell\\", is best known for his novel \\"The Line of Beauty\\". The book is a social and political satira, which for its realistic description, had won the man booker prize in 2004.The storyline lingers around money, class, social hierarchy, snobbery, beauty. However, the main theme in the novel is different sexual orientation and if that \\"type of love\\" can find a place in the world of the rich and powerful.The reader is taken back to Margaret Tacher's London: Tory MPs, politics, money and power. For the main character Nick Guest though, these upper-class things are perfectly unknown. An Oxford student, without any big financial opportunities, even a dreamer maybe, he searches for one thing- beauty. The beautiful in people and the beautiful in life. While paying a visit at his university friend and crush Toby and his family- the Feddens in their Nothing Hill mansion Nick finds what he is looking for. The Feddens are described by Hollinghurst as a stereotypical wealth family. Toby's mother owns a fortune, his father is one of the new Tory MPs and his sister Catherine is a problematic teenager, after who Nick has to look after. But they give him the opportunity to taste the life of the rich and powerful in which he dives with the curiosity and passion of a dreamer. In that new world he finds the beauty of art and the beauty of love.In the beginning Nick has a gay romance with Leo, a black council worker, with whom he looses his virginity. Their love is pure, innocent and beautifully crafted.The second part of the book gives us an image of a new Nick Guest, more down-to-earth and confident. His love story with Leo has come to an end. He is again looking for beauty and love and he finds them in Wani Ouradi - a close friend from Oxford. Wani gives Nick a job as an editorial consultant in his beauty magazine, but he also introduces him to drugs. One night, after few cocain lines, Nick suggests to Wani the name \\"ogee\\" - an architect term for double curve also called by Hogarth \`line of beauty', for his magazine. The title of the novel is revealed in that moment as well- as a combination of a body curve and a line of coke. However, the romance between Wani and Nick is too risky and after a major scandal in the end of the book comes to an end.Overall, Hollinghurst creates a satiric but realistic picture of 80s London and the upper-class. He describes every character's emotion, feeling, action so precise that the reader can easily recognise himself in one of the protagonists. There is a variety of issues -homosexuality, racism, power, presented by the rich's point of view, brought up to the general public in a comic way. However, the tragic twist at the end gives the novel a dramatic flavour. I would recommend it to anyone who loves melancholic stories, you will definitely enjoy your journey through this fascinating, well touched novel."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Yes, the characters indulge in all sorts of sins, from casual sex to snorting cocaine (the line of beauty) to financial shenanigans, but that doesn't mean the characters are uninteresting and the plot not engrossing. This was a book I couldn't put down. The author's prose are intentionally Henry James-like (the hero is obsessed with James) and each sentence is crafted to emulate the Master. I would recommend the book to anyone, especially if they have an interest in England in the Maggie Thatcher days, a period he brings to life with astonishing accuracy."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"The Line of Beauty is at it's simplest a coming of age story - about a young gay man who struggles to find intimacy and acceptance in a society that is superficial, mercenary and hypocritical. It is 1980s London and young Nick \\"Guest\\" lodges with the upper middle-class Faddons, headed by Gerald an MP in the Thatcher government. Here he struggles with the conflict between what he aspires to, what he actually is, and what others are actually willing to give him.This book is strongly themed. The line of beauty refers to the S-shaped ogee curve, where equal but opposite paths meet. This is reflected in village boy Nick Guest lodging with the upper class London Faddon family. It refers to his homosexuality, both in terms of being the opposite of heterosexuality, but also in a more literal way - the curve of the lower back as it becomes the bottom. The opposites are also represented in the two relationships that Nick has - both with men from non-Anglo-Saxon cultural backgrounds. These threads are all deftly woven together in a beautiful way. The writing also, as numerous reviewers have mentioned is first class.For me however, there were two flaws with the book that meant I couldn't give it 5 stars.Firstly, Hollinghurst fails to set the sense of time. Despite constant token references to Mrs Thatcher \\"The Lady\\", over-sized mobile phones and a Spandau ballet concert, there is not much in this book that really makes you feel it is the 80s. Technically the events could have happened today. We may think attitudes towards homosexuality have relaxed, but I doubt it is openly accepted in upper class conservative London circles to this day. The only thing which really placed me in the 80s were the deaths from AIDS in the latter part of the book. It at least reminded me that 25 years ago the prognosis for HIV was much worse than it is today.And perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this book for me was the poor character development. Most of the characters neatly represented class and cultural stereotypes. They were 2-dimensional at best, and the relationships between them never seemed anything but superficial. Even the protagonist Nick is full of cliched 21 year-old angst, niavety and sexual frustration. Part of this may have been deliberate, to reflect the ruthless coldness of 80s high society but it meant that I was unable to develop any feeling (empathy or dislike) for most of the large cast.The Line of Beauty is a worthwhile read just for the writing, though the story line may leave you a little disappointed."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"One of the most amazing books I have read to date. Hollinghust has a magnificent way of painting a beautiful scene and then magnify the subtlety hidden inside as if you were the character observing through his attentive eye. An exquisite glimpse into the social classes of London of the '80's and the clear distinction of what is deemed acceptable and that which is \\"vulgar and unsafe\\". A touching story of love and lust and inevitably that of loss. Absolutely a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"When I read that Hollinghurst had a new book out, and a prize-winner at that, I was really looking forward to reading it. I requested it from my public library and had to wait a couple of months for it to become available. After part 1, pg. 160 (Nick's first \\"love\\" affair), the book was due back, and I gladly returned it. Read the other 1-star reviews, and I TOTALLY agree with those in-depth reviews.I found it impossible to \\"relate\\" to and/or care about ANY of the characters in this book--two important criteria for a \\"good\\" book-- in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I really don't hate gay people or rich people but stupid people who have no real contributions to make to society but the means to do it do irritate me especailly when all they can talk about is pot, booze and who did it to whom. Fortunately the people I know in real life who are gay (or not) rich (or not)and British citizens (or not) are nothing like that. For book category I wanted to put \\"Unreadable\\". I don't how they judge what is worthy of a Booker Prize. First there was too much information. The first 40 odd pages give a DETAILED account of a gay many losing his virginity in a park with a man he had only met.The next few pages were bland ramblings of upper crust Brits talking about nothing. The conversations had no substance to them, the inside of the mind of the leading character was about keeping his place as a leech on these people and constant musings of a boy-crazy mind. After a while, I just got tired of him and his little world. Lately I've read or at least started to read books about rich people or wannabe rich young people whose sole aim in life is to party, get drunk, be disgusting and think about their own ID idotic lives mostly in London and some in New York. If I didn't know any better it would make me want to avoid these places so I don't have to accidentally meet these type of people. With all that's going on the world, reading about these infantile self-absorbed people seems like a waste of time. I can read for pleasure but I want the story to be about SOMETHING or funny or anything. I understand the end was better and had a current issue in it but I just couldn't force myself to trudge through all the insubstantial and adolescent shock-for effect pages to get there."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Did not care for this book. It was a struggle to get to the last 100 pages which read somewhat more interesting but was not worth it. Don't waste your time, you never care for the characters, nor did I want to get to know them."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"This is a remarkably well-written book, and a compellingly good read---quite an accomplishment given that there isn't a single likable character in it, not even the housekeeper."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I agree with a previous critic that this is one of the worst books ever to win the Booker. I hated it so much - its obsession with people of no consequence and the belief that it was 'recording' something important. It is crass and banal. Awful. Don't get me started on its attempt to be shocking!"},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read. A perversion of an unquestionably great talent (and I don't mean the sex). The worst thing in art is using talent to send out a message that is without hope.There is a lot of very explicit sex in this book. No problem with that. The problem is that none of these mostly very unlikeable people learns anything, grows as a person, shows any degree of integrity or finer human qualities. They show the worst side of humanity, something worth looking at, but without a spark of hope for something better, it is just a collosal bummer.True art uplifts, inspires, enlightens. It makes us face up to the worst of ourselves and ultimately makes us glad to be human."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I picked this book at random, off the shelves of a hotel we were staying in. I'd never heard of the author or the book but thought it must be good, or at least well-written, if it won the Booker Prize. In fact, I did nearly gave it five stars for sheer entertainment value because, after I'd read quite a bit of it, me and my partner took it in turns to read aloud random passages, which I assure anyone reading this, you'll find utterly hilarious if you do the same. However, in the spirit of being honest on Amazon, I'm actually giving it no stars because, trust me, all the humour in this book is of the unintentional variety.This story reads as if it was written by someone with no personality of their own, just a lot of unexpressed mundane thoughts about the world which he's now using the excuse of a novel to finally express, unfortunately. There are endless descriptions of how a character thinks he might react to something that's just been said, but decides not to, and why he decides not to, and how his non-reaction might affect the speaker differently to how he'd be affected if he had actually said what he nearly said but didn't. All of which wouldn't be so bad if the things people think but don't say - or even what they do eventually get round to saying - were actually interesting. But they're not. If you want an example, check out the chapter that starts with a group of men in a restaurant discussing the 'pansy salad'. Which - what imagination! - turns out to be a euphemism for trying out homosexuality; also, one of them refers to a 'butch lettuce', and another says everyone should try it at least once - the pansy salad, that is, wink wink, nudge nudge. Now, this may well be an actual conversation the author had with his pals but if so, then he needs ask himself what anyone sitting next to his table would have thought if they'd overheard it (clue: it won't have been 'What a fascinating and truly funny group of men'). I don't often blush with embarrassment when reading a book but this one is so pathetically mediocre when it thinks it's profound, I actually found myself worrying about what anyone outside the UK would think of us when reading this pile of self-conscious under-powered quasi-intellectual twittering.I thought the Booker Prize was given to outstanding writing, which to me means great themes expressed through brilliant prose, with memorable characters and inspiring dialogue. But on the strength of this lazy, badly written, small-minded, meandering 'story', it seems it's actually awarded to anything with a slightly obscure title that features characters who are as boring and predictable as most politicians. This kind of award gets me angry, because there are writers out there - often smeared because they work in a recognisable 'genre' - who produce truly thought-provoking work. Whereas this kind of mind-dribble is for awards judges who don't know how to think for themselves, to recommend to readers who also don't know how to think for themselves."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"One wishing to learn about racism in the gay community would do well by reading the collected novels of Mr. Hollinghurst.

Until the last fifty pages, I wasn't impressed with the book as a novel despite being impressed with the skill of the author. As a fiction writer myself, I admire someone who can present a fictional world almost completely in set-pieces presented in real-time with little exposition. It is difficult to convey depth of character or fully understand the conflict between characters without explaining their back-story. And there is none of that in \\"Line of Beauty.\\" I admire that Hollinghurst overcomes most of these problems by the brilliance of his set pieces, sharp dialog, great details of behavior, place and time that make me feel with unusual immediacy that I'm a part of that world.What I wasn't impressed with was the lack of character development. Particularly Nick whose fall from innocence seems so passive and superficial. None of the main characters really do much that makes for compelling action that reveals or develops their character.However, I found the ending surprisingly transformative. Characters who don't do anything for the entire book are suddenly forced to show themselves, particularly Nick. What happens doesn't feel forced or gratitutious. It makes complete sense and helps to justify and explain the lack of action up that that point. I also found myself feeling deeply about Nick. In the last pages I felt a range of emotions; sadness, regret, irritation, shame, guilt, loss and anger.The best thing about \\"Line of Beauty,\\" was that it left me feeling like I was inside Nick's head. As I was reading it I would look out the window, and think about Nick's thoughts as if I were him gazing out the window."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"This wasn't an easy read but it was well rewarded.

There's not much new about THE LINE OF BEAUTY: a clever boy is brought into a world of privilege, beauty, luxury and power by his friendship with a wealthy family. Here the setting is Margaret Thatcher's reign as prime minister, and the hero (the over-obviously named Nick Guest) is a University College London don kept as a kind of permanent houseguest by the wealthy Fedden family, who live in a gorgeous place off a private London square. The paterfamilias Gerald is a conservative M.P., and his wife Rachel is the daughter of a peer; they surround themselves with priceless paintings, fabulous objets d'art, and monstrously racist and insensitive Thatcherite cronies. (The Iron Lady herself makes a memorable appearance late in the novel at the Feddens' silver anniversary bash.) Nick enters into the house first as the friend and Oxford classmate of their son Toby (who remains disappointingly something of a non-entity in the novel), and then as the ostensible caretaker of their troubled daughter Catherine: the Feddens turn to him as a resident expert on the beautiful things they own, given his fancy education and his expertise as the son of an antique merchant in Northamptonshire. Meanwhile, Nick furthers his own aesthetic and sentimental education by carrying on a series of affairs with handsome young men both in and out of the Feddens' sphere.There's not much here to keep the novel going except for the inevitable crash when the Feddens turn Nick out and he realizes they see him as a guest and not as one of the family. So most of the novel is fairly thinly plotted, and depends on Hollinghurst detailing far too extensively such pleasures as Nick's cocaine binges (this novel takes place during the Eighties, after all) and the piano performances he hears at the Feddens and the rare antique silver ewers he sees there. Perhaps all this might be worth the lavish detail if Hollinghurst could make us care much about Nick or the Feddens, or if he had something more to say than that rich conservatives care only about themselves and are clannish and climb over the backs of others to get what they want; it might even have been worth something had Hollinghurst's prose style been at the impossibly high level of Nick's heroes, Henry James and George Meredith, rather than the educated if unremarkable style Hollinghurst affects here. But there's not much to the book at all. It's BRIDESHEAD REVISITED on a much smaller scale... in every sense of the phrase."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Then this book isn't for you. I gave it an extra star because it really is well-written but, my God, how boring! I'll never understand why books like this win prizes. I finished the book with a hope and a prayer that something would happen. Please someone get killed or pregnant or arrested or something! The only time things actually moved along were the last 30 pages. It seemed liked it was about the family throwing jabs at each other and everyone else. The family on vacation; the father running for office; the daughter and her manic-depression. I was constantly wondering \\"what did they mean by that?\\". Since the book is set in London and the author is a Brit. there were references and some slang that I simply could not understand being an American. I might even try to rent the movie -- maybe that was more interesting?I don't see myself going out and trying to find another Hollinghurst novel."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Hollinghurst has written such an amazing novel here, a fine piece of social criticsm, with stunning prose that is tempered and subtle and evenly paced. It would be perhaps too extreme to say that the world in which these characters move is a glittering one, disgusing the moral rot beneath, for none of these characters are completely irredeemable. Their impulses and flaws are all too human. But it is the social conventions and intolerances that entrap them and mandate a sense of propriety that lead to their downfall. This is a book that builds incredibly slowly, picking up the tiniest strands of drama along the way, and all comes to a devestating and inevitable crash, where everyone and no one is at fault."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Glancing through some of the harsh reviews for this book I am struck by the realization that some very sad people must be severly allergic to sterling prose. Or to honest and vivid gay sex. Or both!I found the structure of this novel---beginning in 1983 and then jumping ahead to 1987---evoked for me Virginia Woolf's masterpiece, To The Lighthouse. A main character dies in the gap between years in this book just as the beloved mother does in the Woolf novel. (A novel I am perhaps foolishly assuming ever lover of great prose has read at least once.)Beyond the perfect structure of this book I found the writing to be absolutely cherishable. I have not re-read sentences this often since reading The Hours by Michael Cunningham. And the characters in this book are very true to the 80's that I remember very vividly.This astonishing author has brought back the sharp pain that never really leaves---most of my beloved friends of those 80's are long gone. I miss them fresh after this book.If this book doesn't work a magic spell on you then you need to return to school and learn how to read with discernment and passion. Bravo, Master Hollinghurst!"},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"With more than 100 other reviews on this novel so far there's not a lot to add, I suppose, other than I did surprise myself by managing to reach the end. Everyone in this novel is a superficial and boring egotist, there is no plot, no character development, no interesting dialogue, no drama, no conflict, nothing even remotely surprising. Everyone fits into the stereotyped perception of British class society with absolutely nothing interesting to say about absolutely anything. Who finds delight in reading about such non-people? Who thinks such a non-story deserves the Booker Price? The terrible truth must be: the very same kind of people the book describes because the rest of us only want to vomit at all this obsession with aesthetics and complete absence of compassion. What a sad, sad world. Which, of course, it the very non-moral of this novel. Or to put it in another way: the Tories are a bunch of bastards who can take power because the people of Britain have always been too dumb and apathetic to chop their heads off, and because the people who have the intelligence to really change things choose instead to just sit on their butts writing or reading aesthetically wonderful but emotionally stunted books like this one. \\"And God looked down on this misery and said: You shall be punished by having not one but two Tory parties, and with these words he sent a fallen angel called Tony.\\"Still, on the positive side, I suppose, the novel IS absolutely brilliantly written. You can read and enjoy every single sentence in it on its own just for the way it is structured and shaped. Aesthetically perfect but without substance, in other words. Just like the main character and everyone that surrounds him. There's a strong consistency between form and subject matter: a nice little literary joke that could have made for a fine 10 page short story. Turning it into a 500 page novel, however, does seem like taking the joke too far.Finally, one kind of person I WILL recommend this novel to is any homophobic male who yearns to have his worst prejudices confirmed. Since the author himself is gay, I suppose the descriptions must be true. Self-loathing ad nausiam going absolutely nowhere."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Some of the most beautiful sentences I have ever read, but has a hollow feel.

If you're looking for gay fiction then this book is for you. It should be sold with the porn magazines - the first 100 pages ramble on and on about gay sex - but never get to a storyline. I tried to endure. I kept hoping there was a story! I grew up in Britain and thought this sounded like a great perspective on the Iron Lady (Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher) and 80's Britain.

It's easy to see why -- his novels are beautifully crafted and polished. He includes countless highly perceptive observations along the way. The Line of Beauty is no exception, but it is not a satisfying read. Perhaps because the characters are all so unlikeable and selfish.If you like Hollinghurst, by all means, you must read this latest. If you don't know him, read The Swimming-Pool Library and A Folding Star (my personal favorite) first. These novels, in addition to being true literature, also manage the remarkable feat of being incredibly sensuous and even erotic."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"More than I ever wanted to know about the inner lives of shallow people and the details of casual homosexual sex.

Highly unrecommended."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Having read last year's Man Booker prize winner, the disappointing \\"Vernon God Little,\\" I approached Alan Hollinghurst's \\"The Line of Beauty\\" with no small amount of trepidation. While lacking the scope of Hollinghurst's earlier novel, \\"The Swimming Pool Library,\\" and less ingratiating than \\"The Spell,\\" this is a very fine novel that has something important to say about Thatcher-era England (there, I managed to say it without using the word \\"go-go\\"). As in \\"The Spell,\\" however, it's often hard to reconcile the satire with Hollinghurst's obvious fascination with the very people he sets up to ridicule. Plus, as the novel's narrative center, Nick Guest (his last name says it all), is a bit too calculating to provide a touchstone character for the average reader (he is a 21-year-old virgin who answers a personal ad to have his first sex), and you may not care whether his fortunes rise or fall at story's end (they mostly rise--after all, Nick is only 25 at the conclusion of the novel and he manages to profit handsomely from his association with a wealthy lover). He is the man who came to dinner, with a vengeance. Having been invited home to spend the weekend by his college buddy, Toby Fedden (the attraction is hard to understand outside of the context of wealth and power), he stays on for four years, ostensibly to nursemaid the most fragile personality in the household, Toby's sister Catherine, who turns out to be the equal, in terms of calculation, not only of Nick, but of her own father, Gerald, a Tory MP whose ambitions run to having \\"the Lady\\" herself (Thatcher) as a houseguest. We're left with a suggestion that Nick might have AIDS, but there is little in the novel to support this--he is apparently a \\"top\\" who always uses protection and is regularly tested--although he is certainly unlucky in his lovers, both of whom get the disease. The pleasure in reading this novel, obviously influenced by James and Waugh, but also by Forster and Fitzgerald, is in the writing. Hollinghurst is a prose master who will have you reaching for the dictionary, as well as your French phrase book, to look up words like \\"enfilade\\" and \\"reredos\\" and phrases like \\"trou de gloire.\\" He is also an expert on music, art, and antiquities. He is an aesthete with a soupcon of self-loathing that is often betrayed in his prose. He reserves some of his harshest satire for two rich American \\"Queens,\\" whose names, Treat Rush and Brad Craft, \\"sounded rather like porn actors.\\" It is these gentlemen who want to turn Nick's script for a Merchant-Ivory type production of James' \\"The Spoils of Poynton\\" into a vulgar sex romp (they particularly object to the name of James' heroine, Fleda Vetch). Nick may be a homosexual, but he is also a mensch; he doesn't take it up the chimney, nor does he resort to embarrassing camp. His sex (and drug) life apart, he is a bit of a voyeur, an \\"extra player\\" who is neither \\"visible\\" nor \\"relevant\\"--an \\"accidental eavesdropper.\\" Which probably explains why he has no friends in the Fedden household, when the excrement hits the fan. For students of literature who despair of nuance in the novel, \\"The Line of Beauty\\"--its very title, from a treatise on aesthetics by Hogarth, suggests a well-shaped arse as well as a line of cocaine--is for you. If Hollinghurst would only learn a little Jamesian detachment, he might indeed represent the best hope for the modern British novel."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Read the book on a transatlantic flight and afterwards, but found it rather tedious. As a portrait of a chattering society, Proust did unmeasurably better and we don't need any more of that. As to the main character, Ripley (Highsmith) comes to my mind and he was a much more interesting character than Nick. And as a piece of political satire, it is also not very exciting or revealing. Whether it is a profound portrayal of gay life, I cannot judge. The book just did not engage me on any of these levels, and as a Booker winner it is quite disappointing."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"The writing is very good, but the true and simple test of a novel is to ask oneself these questions: Do I care about the characters? Can I stop reading this book right now and never wonder about how it ends? If you answer no to the first question and yes to the second, it is not a good work of literature. The Line of Beauty is, unfortunately, one of these novels. Tedious, overly mannered and stifling."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I just took a bath in '80s homosexual glam swirled with new money, old titles and Margaret Thatcher. This is a great glittery novel that points itself at Henry James - but I found it a nice offspring of Austen. Frankly, not a lot happens here outside of dinners and parties (and dinner parties). Yet, I came to the final third with the feeling that I'd been part of the era. There are a couple of critical, yet thinly drawn, characters. And maybe there has been so much media surrounding this coked era that it now seems cliche. The first criticism is the author's problem, the second is not.

But it suffers from the genre's weakness, namely limited psychological depth. And it is entertaining, never boring, but never quite engrossing either. I remember reading something about a Victorian convention that novels always ought to be set twenty or so years, or a generation, in the past. This meets the standard exactly, aiming to describe the roaring but now already quaint-looking Thatcher years. Nick Guest is family friend and lodger to the well-to-do Feddens, including Toby, his Oxford mate, Gerald, an up-and-coming MP and ministerial material, his wife Rachel, and their rebellious daughter Catherine. Nick is moreover gay, and forced to navigate between secrecy and the budding tolerance of the times. Much of the book is devoted to Nick's hazardous love affairs: hazardous if only because this was also the first decade of AIDS. But soon he becomes embroiled in the Feddens' scandal-ridden fall.The author pulls no punches, and his acerbic lines are good for the occasional laugh. But that is also where the fault lies. The Tories, and the Thatcher years, are given no respite. This novel has neither room for comprehension nor forgiveness. And I found Nick unrealistic at times, as a character - I am sure Hollinghurst is deeply erudite, and this seems in many ways his alter ego, but no one can carry Nick's encyclopaedic knowledge, ranging from English literature to French cathedrals to musical criticism and to eighteenth-century silverware, at age twenty-one. Holllinghurst's Line of Beauty is a great novel, but it lacks the compassion, and the subtlety of characterisation, of a classic."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Want something that is digests well but requires no Prilosec?

But the central premise of the book is ultimately not credible. Would a rising politician, of any denomination, let alone a Conservative, really take the risk of an openly gay man living in his home? Even the Tories aren't that dumb. And I wasn't convinced either by the very quick demise of several characters from AIDS - 6 months from the peak of health to shambling invalid seems a bit unrealistic for a man in his 20s, but perhaps I'm wrong.So enjoyable but flawed IMO. Hollinghurst seems to leave plenty of room to follow up on Guest later. I sort of hope he does."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"If you manage to get through two-thirds of the book, as I painfully did, you'll be rewarded at the end.

It is about hypocrisy, and greed and classism, but mostly it is about beauty and deception and idealism, and how the three are a dangerous combination.Yes, there is gay sex. But mostly it is longing, desire, love: everything we pine for in romances, but never get because most romances are drivel. Well this is the exact opposite of drivel.

That book with its rich evocation of gay privileged Londoners in a time before Aids was a stunning original. And The Line of Beauty mines some of the same territory. The protagonists are the leisured, cultured classes profiting from Thatcher's liberated economy.He's a brilliant writer. But in this book at least a cold and distant one too. These are not people you can like. Or even want to spend much time with.I wish I could have liked this book more. Holinghurst is certainly a talented author who knows how to keep the story licking along. But his creations lack warmth or likeability. This is probably his intention so you could call it a success. You're not meant to like them. They are set up to be masters of their own misfortune. But its also a relief to leave them behind at the end."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"It's a bit difficult not to think of the Evelyn Waugh classic with Charles Ryder and Sebastian Flyte as one reads this sumptuously written novel by Alan Hollinghurst. You can also throw in some of E.M. Forster's \\"Maurice\\", a touch of John Guare's \\"Six Degrees of Separation\\" and a little post-divorce Princess Diana for good measure. But with its beautiful prose and contemporary sensibilities, you can hardly call Hollinghurst's story derivative. It takes place in the eighties with the central figure of Nick Guest, the son of a middle-class antiques dealer. While attending Oxford, he befriends Toby, the son of rising Tory politician Gerald Fedden, and insinuates himself into the Fedden home in Notting Hill. In his wishful thinking and self-delusion, Nick develops a taste for the privileges of the wealthy, but unlike the people that surround him, he is all preference and no possession, and that barrier remains insurmountable.The story unfolds in three parts, and each extended episode reveals Nick's maturing sexuality from the \\"inner theatre of sexual make-believe\\" at Oxford to the experienced and confident lover he becomes four years later. Along the way, he becomes deeply involved emotionally and sexually with an outrageously wealthy Lebanese lover named Wani, a Dodi-like figure whose father does bear a striking resemblance to Mohammed Al Fayed. Despite the posh, erudite environment, the story's focus is primarily Nick coming to terms with his homosexuality. Be forewarned that Hollinghurst goes into sometimes graphic detail in describing his protagonist's sexual liaisons as a means of defining this rather critical period when the AIDS epidemic was moving into the mainstream consciousness. Concurrently, at odds with the sexual liberation enjoyed by Nick and his friends, the author effectively evokes Britain's growing conservatism in the Thatcher years, even introducing her in a cameo appearance. Wearing a jacket that makes her look like a country and western singer, Thatcher finds herself swept onto the dance floor with a very coked-up Nick, a surreal moment that turns into the book's most amusing scene.I have to admit I was disappointed to hear that Hollinghurst won the 2004 Man Booker Award over David Mitchell, who penned a sprawling and impressively complex masterwork in his \\"Cloud Atlas\\". However, this book does provide its own unique pleasure by adding an intriguing texture to a socially turbulent time in Britain's recent history. I think it would unfairly trivialize the book to call it simply a gay novel, as it is for anyone who is looking for a beautifully observed story full of stylish passages and heart-piercing human insight. Certainly not for everyone but highly recommended for those who are curious."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I was disappointed with \\"The Line of Beauty\\", perhaps because all the praise and prizes made me think of it as of a truly exceptional novel. Well, it isn't exceptional and, in fact, the plot is very weak.The novel is set mainly in London, with a little excursion to France. The time frame is 1983 to 1987. The main protagonist, Nick Guest, is a gay Oxford graduate, writing a dissertation on Henry James, who lives as a house guest with the family of his college friend, Toby Fedden. The Feddens are portraited as the upper-class, conservative family, with Toby's father, Gerald, being a Member of Parliament, the mother, Rachel, coming from old money, and the sister, Catherine, suffering from (imaginative?) bipolar disorder.The depiction of the 80s in London is very interesting and probably accurate, with many sharp insights into the political and social situation of Great Britain. There is a fair amount of humor and the silhouettes of the characters are painted satirically, but this is just about as much as there is to it. The book reads like a gigantic, blown-up background sketch, and while it is true that it can be a good read for the people who are interested in that period (with great comparisons between social classes, examples being the Feddens, Nick family, and Leo's family), there is no real plot. Nothing, except parties and various social or political events, which drag on and on, happens until about 100 pages before the end, and even then it is not much and only what is to be expected. If anyone is interested in the drama of AIDS in the 80s, I would rather recommend \\"Angels in America\\".Nick is a weak, pathetic main character, he is not likeable, rather despicable - he has a lot of potential, is intelligent, imaginative and sensitive, but he tries to achieve his aspirations by being, essentially, a parasite, and this has nothing to do with his being conscious of his sexual orientation, he is just this type of person, gay or not, he would be the same, and while the attitude of the Fedden family and surroundings to homosexualism is hypocritical (vide Gerald and Penny as opposed to Nick and Wani), and I was all the time wondering what else could he expect and why he is not independent - for years staying with people, basically on their charity. All this immediately (even without his Jamesian research) brings to mind the socialites out of Henry James's novels, but the effect is incomparable. The whole novel is summarized very well when Nick and Wani meet the potential producers of their movie, who criticize Nick's script - the remarks are very relevant to the whole of this novel.I liked several characters - Catherine with her sharp tongue, observant eye and unexpected reactions, Penny (her last discussion with Nick is very good), Leo's family, and several minor personas who are rather funny, but I could not wait for the book to end and I wish I'd rather read something else instead."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I didn't like Alan Holinghurst's previous books very much, even though they're classics, but I loved this one. It's got a very fascinating and glamorous setting (high society London, world of politics and movies), and the main character is very appealing even though he's flawed. If you like novels that are smart AND move along quickly with plot AND have beautiful sentences, you cannot do wrong with this one. Well deserved the Booker Prize."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"The effusive press comments quoted on the cover and flyleaf of the paperback edition of Alan Hollinghurst's THE LINE OF BEAUTY are totally correct in everything they actually say; they merely fail to mention one of the most important aspects of the book. Hollinghurst writes brilliantly about life among the movers and shakers of Margaret Thatcher's London in the early 1980s. His ability to portray his characters, as one critic puts it, \\"from just an inch to the left\\" of how they would see themselves is masterly, and the result is something like the portraits of Goya, a flattering likeness with just a hint of satire. Hollinghurst has perfect pitch when it comes to the social sensibilities and small hypocrisies of the well-bred. As a lineal descendant of Trollope, James, and Forster, he is a well-deserved winner of the 2004 Man Booker Prize for Fiction.But none of the reviews quoted in the book mention the gay sex, which is pervasive and often explicitly physical. By portraying the narrator of the book, Nick Guest, as a gay man in an ostensibly straight world, Hollinghurst achieves an oblique angle on the people he observes, moving considerably more than an inch from the axis on which they would ideally see themselves. The glamorous life is glimpsed through a foreground that straight readers might find far from glamorous, especially when it deals with bodily interactions. Ultimately, this becomes essential to the plot, but for a long time it seems merely an authorial device. It is difficult to know whether the author sees these elements as a heightening of the sexual charge, or whether they are deliberately introduced as an antidote to romanticism, and as much an emblem of decadence as the increasingly frequent use of \\"charlie\\" (cocaine) by the narrator and his friends. Certainly, the secrecy practised by other characters in the story who have not come out as Nick has done, does seem to point up the falsity of the world in which they cannot admit their preferences.Not that Nick needs the difference in sexuality to give him detachment. He is presented as a talented boy from a middle-class background who has made some upper-crust friends while at Oxford, so becomes a kind of permanent guest in their lives after college. [This has much in common with my own background, and it was a curious experience to find one of my own Oxbridge friends of this kind, not named but clearly identifiable, appearing as a minor character in the book!] While Nick is clearly thrilled to have been adopted into this world, he remains subtly an outsider, but with an acuteness of perception to compensate for his lack of belonging. His social position is not so very different from that of Kazuo Ichiguro's hero in the first part ofWHEN WE WERE ORPHANS-- a peculiarly English awkwardness which both writers capture very well.The title, THE LINE OF BEAUTY, comes from Hogarth, and refers to the particular elegance of an ogival double-curve. It is emblematic of the genuine aesthetic understanding that is Nick's most appealing quality for this particular reader; the passages talking about art, literature, and music are perceptive and beautifully written. But art is also seen as the province of the rich, who can afford it but don't necessarily appreciate it. As the book goes on, there is increasing emphasis on art objects in a mannerist or rococo phase, seen surely as symbols of decadence, where art is \\"just make-believe for rich people,\\" as one of the characters says. But the phrase also stands for that fatal line of attraction that leads from one love object to another, or towards some ideal of the beautiful life, that comes crashing down on the characters' heads at the end of this social comedy which turns out to have been a tragedy after all."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"LINE OF BEAUTY is a fine piece of writing; I wish I could accomplish something nearly as good. It was also a difficult read for me because Hollinghurst provides so little relief from the hollowness of main character's life -- from everyone's lives, really. I know he intends to represent the era, and I have a high tolerance for bleak (meaning that I often adore it); but nothing works without the benefit of contrast, and this is a one-note symphony. I'm glad I read it, but I didn't learn anything, and it left me feeling uniquely depressed. Perhaps that was the writer's intent."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Hollinghurst is quoted as having said that if you come to this book looking for your normal sort of \\"fall from grace\\" story, you will be disappointed.He's right.Hollinghurst has also said that he is more interested in analyzing characters, in protraying them vividly, than in populating his books with people you are likely to identify with or actually care about.He's right.Many people have described Hollinghurst as a new genius of prose, as a writer of skill that is long missing in novels from any part of the world.They're right.So what's wrong with The Line of Beauty? Not much, but what IS wrong, like a tiny microbe or virus, seems to infect the whole thing.Read with an eye on the craft of the words, this book is absolutely stunning. Hollinghurst's abilities as a novelist are truly astounding. Even the rather lurid and not particularly tasteful sexual escapades of the novel are crafted with a precision and glory that keep them from wallowing in the muck of which they are made. The affairs, the drugs, the betrayals and the promiscuous, anonymous trysts -- at heart they are what they are, but carved out with Hollinghurst's pen, they become more than that.Unfortunately, not MUCH more than that.The deeper meanings, the symbols of the 80s fall from grace, the metaphors woven into the events, these are all admirable evidences of a fine talent, but in the end, the novel seems to stumble over its own style, it clutches at its own class.During a debate over music, Nick muses this about Strauss: \\"What the problem was was this colossal redundancy, the squandering of brilliant technique on cheap material, the sense that the moral nerves had been cut, leaving the great bloated body to a life of valueless excess.\\" This phrase could equally apply to the book in which it is found.At its heart, the book claims to be about a search for beauty in all its forms. Hollinghurst has said that Nick, the timid protagonist, comes to a realization that the outer beauty of the priviledged men and women with whom he lives disguises a deeper moral ugliness. I found it odd that he would mention beauty of a moral nature, since, in this novel, there really is none, either of a conservative, relativistic, religious, or liberal nature. Nick, caught up in his life of drugs and unchecked sexual hunger, doesn't prove himself to be any more or less beautiful than those people whom he analyzes and with whom he is ultimately disillusioned.Even if you were to approach this book from the plane of one looking for a totally intellectual experience -- the realm of the observer observing, not judging or conspiring with the story or characters, but simply taking the events and people as they are presented by the almost flawless prose -- well, even then, the sum total of the events turns out to be rather facile, and even the opposite of what it intends. In spite of the gorgeous writing -- Hollinghurst's ability to describe almost anything with a grandiose and supreme ease of grace -- in spite of that, the book itself borders on being rather ugly.Don't get me wrong. I do not make this assessment because the book is about homosexuality, or political scandals, or the dark deeds of the overpriviledged. I make this assessment because, in the end, Hollinghurst's tale does not rise above its subject matter, even if the writing itself does.For those of you interested in literature, interested in a reawakening of the style of fine writing and pure form, this book will be a treat, but in the end, is more like a fancy, overpriced appetizer that leaves you wanting much much more."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"\\"The Line of Beauty\\" is the first novel I've read by Alan Hollinghurst and having just finished it I'll make a beeline to read his others. Every chapter of this book is a sheer delight.There are few authors who can move a book at such a torturedly slow pace and still manage a success. The key to \\"The Line of Beauty\\" lies in the detail....Hollinghurst unfolds his characters with enormous pathos, keeping their quotes brief and allowing his observations about them to become expanded. Their is a dryness to his writing that seems endemic of British authors but remaining in that style allows the flavor of his characters to come through with great shades of color.As told through the eyes of the protagonist, Nick, Hollinghurst is able to steer him through a feel that combines an Edwardian England with the present. Nick grows up, to be sure, but he does so in a wafting way, sensitive to the world and his growing self-awareness. If Nick wears rose-colored glasses in the beginning, he has neatly discarded them at the end.\\"The Line of Beauty\\" is really a book about connections...connections in a changing world of friends, lovers, family, illness and death. There is a general sadness that accompanies this book, as it should. Alan Hollinghurst reminds us, through the seriousness of Nick's story, how tenuous we all are in each other's care, no matter what our \\"standing\\" is in society... and how far we still have to go."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"When readers finish Alan Hollinghurst's latest novel, The Line of Beauty, they will easily see why it has just won the Booker Prize. Hollinghurst, in his previous novels has made a career out of portraying particular sides of gay life - the incessant partying, the drugs, the selfishness, the bitchiness, and the unremitting need for sex, as his characters search out desire in public toilets, bars, sex clubs, and late night clubs. Many of his characters - while candid and honest - have never been particularly likable, and the author's portrayal of them has often been far from flattering.In the Line of Beauty, Hollinghurst continues with his hedonistic themes, but his scope is also much boarder and his canvas a lot larger. This is an exquisitely executed and scorchingly candid work, where Hollinghurst's characters are eclectic, funny and are a maddening assortment of people who are all restlessly trying to navigate their way through Margaret Thatcher's mid-eighties Britain where capitalism, opulence, and class envy reigned supreme.The story begins in 1983 and centers on the young twenty-year-old Nick Guest as he becomes intertwined with the Fedden family and their luminous world of money and privilege. Gerald Fedden is a Tory Member of Parliament and is basking in the glory of Thatcher's economic policies; he lives with Rachel, his wife, and his two children, Catherine and Toby in a vast garden-filled estate called Kensington Park Gardens in Notting Hill. Nick studied with Toby, and has just come down from Oxford to London to distractingly do a doctorate on Henry James. While coming from a provincial, middle class background - his father is a humble antiques dealer - Nick is welcomed into the Fedden family like a type of surrogate son and over time, he becomes a kind of minder to the neurotic, troubled Catherine.Nick enthusiastically partakes of the family's lavish parties and political dinners, and tries to impress them in their somewhat facile discussions on literature and art. He tries his best to promote civility amongst their affluent boredom, and entrusted with their secrets, he inevitably sketches their upper-class English ghastliness. But Nick's unsure of his footing in this opulent, affluent looking-glass world, and as he gazes hopefully into the gilt arch of the hall mirror, the young, distracted man finds the mirror reluctant to give its approval. Nick constantly has to remind himself that he is doing this all for pleasure.When Nick meets Leo, a black cockney, after secretly answering a personal advertisement, the trusting, blushful, and unworldly virgin, is introduced to lusty sex and gay life. As a young man Nick feels the wrong kind of irony, the wrong knowledge for gay life, but later as he settles into his new family, a sense of security takes hold. A craving deepens in front of him and he discovers the \\"lovely teamwork of drugs and drink.\\" Much of the later part of the novel involves his relationship with Wani, a long-lashed Lebanese millionaire playboy whose family represent the new, well-heeled class. While working as a creative consultant on Wani's new magazine, Ogee - named after the curve that is Hogarth's line of beauty - Nick is introduced to a world of non-stop threesomes, moneyed decadence, and cocaine-fueled days and nights.Nicks life of excess builds to a virtuoso scene when Prime Minister Thatcher - who is referred to as \\"The Lady\\" and is much anticipated throughout the novel - finally attends a party at the Feddens' house. Wearing a bejeweled jacket that makes her look like a \\"country and western singer,\\" she finds herself innocently dancing with a coked-up, out of it Nick. Nicks sumptuous life, however, soon takes a turn for the worst as dark secrets are unveiled and he eventually discovers the ruthlessness of his masters, the viciousness of class loyalty, and the ferocious homophobia of the Thatcherite Tories.With a sly, feline wit, The Line of Beauty is undoubtedly Hollinghurst's finest, not only in the breadth of its ambition but also in its intricacies of observation and expression. He presents subtle interpretations of the world of those who think they are \\"born to rule\\" and his attention to drawing room dialogue is unsurpassed - there are lots of droll scenes where the author shows his flair for describing the tiniest social shenanigans. The novel is a rich, elegant and superb comedy of manners, and while never didactic, it's always ironic. Undoubtedly, The Line of Beauty is destined to become a giant masterpiece of modern literature.

It is quite easy to understand how Mr. Hollinghurst won The Booker Prize with this novel. It is illuminating; the characters are riveting and so definitive in their persona. The time, the homes, the gossip, the age of the Gays is so well set. I loved this book, and the last chapter was the fitting ending. I do want to know more: how is Nick getting on? Will Toby marry and Wani, is he ok?Nick Guest is the central character is this novel. He is invited to live with his college friend Toby and his family in Notting Hill while he completes his graduate degree. Toby's father, Gerald Fedden, has been elected as a Member of Parliament. Rachel, his perfect and lovely wife, is the center of the universe. Catherine, the daughter has a mental disturbance, and it is up to Nick to look after her. This is his job, so to speak.Nick is gay and his several gay friends open up the life of the homosexual in Thatcher's England. The life of the gay man, the sex and the hidden dangers are revealed in ever so sleek a manner. We meet the gay society, the closed events and never spoken words of love of men for men. Women have a place here, but only as the appendage of the man. One of the more interesting characters is Wani, the son of a very rich Lebanese business man. He plays a straight man with a fianc'e, but secretly gay, paying his way through life and having the most beautiful and lovely of men. His secret life comes undone by the media of the day, and in this manner the lives of all come to a conclusion.Alan Hollinghurst is a marvelous writer-he has been able to express the satire of the day in a most eloquent way. We are drawn into the life of the gay man, and the richness of the life of a family who have access to Parliament. We meet the people who are \\"in\\" and the people who never will be. We like most of them, celebrate with them all and share the misery of the masses. This is an extraordinary book in a way. It captures the essence of us all through the lives of people we come to know.Highly recommended. prisrob"},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Call it the British \\"Angels in America\\" minus the angels, but Alan Hollinghurst's \\"The Line of Beauty\\" can stand on its own, even when compared to Tony Kushner's brilliant play. Both works share a lot in common: they are set in the 80s when the world was changing in a strange way, AIDS has just become the issue, and both have its country politcs in the background (USA: Ronald Regan; UK: Margaret Tatcher).The 2004 MAN Booker Prize winner is a novel that takes a little time to grabs one attention -- but once it does so, it is hard to put it down. It covers a couple of years in the lives of a group of people, all related to Nick Guest, young man who has moved to the elegant house in Notting Hill that belongs to the parents of one of his best friends. This family sort of becomes his second family.But Nick is never really connected to the Feddens, for many reasons. One of them is that they are wealthy and futile, whereas he is not. Another one is the fact they never really deal with his homosexuality. They seem to cope that but never accept it. But politics in England in the 80s play such a major role in the narrative the homosexuality has a supporting part sometimes.The book focus on is the climate of giddy success among well-to-do Tories between the electoral victories of 1983 and 1987. The patriarch Gerald Fedden has just entered Parliament and wants to fulfill another political ambition: to host the PM at home for a party. Eventually when it happens Hollinghurst delivers some of the best pages of social and cultural delight and critic of his novel. For pages and pages he teases his reader in the best possible way, announcing that something big will happen -- but one can never be aware of what will happen. One critic has wisely compared the appearance of \\"The Lady\\" to the presence of Kurtz in ''Heart of Darkness,'' who both are invisible until near the end.Hollinghurst has a special obsession for beauty and its forms -- and this is totally explicit in the title of the book. But his prose also has its own beauty. The writer's choose of words is remarkable, as well as the way he builds his sentences. At the same time, Hollighurst gambles with another of his main themes: Henry James. Nick is working on a thesis about this writer, which turns out to be a good excuse to inject some Jamesian comments throughout the narrative.Many readers maybe shocked with the honesty that sexuality is dealt with. This concern only enhances the experience of reading the narrative. Nick's sexually naivety and awakening is believable and never gratuitous. And all the characters have enough personality and humanity to fill a whole book on them.Hollinghurst won a deserved Booker Prize with his novel, which has much more consistence and smartness than last year's \\"Vernon God Little\\". Giving the Prize to \\"The Line of Beauty\\" brings back the hope that it is indeed a literary prize and not just a fashion contest."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I generally have no difficulty writing reviews. With most books, you're leaning toward like/love, or hate/annoyed. But having just finished The Line of Beauty, I'm left feeling fairly neutral, but very satisfied.And that's saying a lot when you've read 400+ very dense pages. It's brilliantly written, but since it's mostly an extended narrative of the daily affairs, affairs of all sorts, private and public, gay and straight, business and social, of the British upper crust, it's not exactly a page turner. It can be truly tedious at times. Reading it in bed WILL put you to sleep. I started this in Japan about a month ago, and I just sat in a coffee shop in Manila for about 5 hours to finish up the last 150 or so pages. In fact, this is definitely a coffee-shop book. You need to be alert and undisturbed to be able to unpack the writing, and to stay in it long enough to get absorbed.Although it's a challenging read, it's usually enjoyable; it definitely deserved the Man Booker Prize. Hollinghurst is one of those writers who makes you stop and reread. You earmark pages and note sections and particular turns of phrase that you know you'll want to revisit. Even when you know you can skip entire pages of details, you don't. You're not reading this book to be taken on a rollercoaster ride, you're reading it for the scenery. And the scenery is often beautiful.This book is, at heart, an analysis and account of the hypocrisy of the rich and political. At least that's what I read from it. Hollinghurst has two main themes: the day-to-day life of those on the moral and typically pompous high ground, and the sordid back-room details of sex, drugs and other excesses. The brilliant point of this book is that these themes run in parallel throughout the development of the story without ever crossing paths. Characters exists in both worlds, a point increasingly revealed as the story progresses, but they are kept apart, as if going through a door that lets through people, but not their secrets. In the end, when the walls come down and these two worlds collide, the realizations brought forth are in no way preachy. And that in itself shows an intelligence and skill that goes beyond \\"good writing.\\"If you're looking for a quick read on the holidays, then this book is probably not the one to choose. But if you are in the mood to be challenged, amused and engaged; if you just feel like reading some incredibly well written prose, I'd highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Hollinghurst is quoted as having said that if you come to this book looking for your normal sort of \\"fall from grace\\" story, you will be disappointed.He's right.Hollinghurst has also said that he is more interested in analyzing characters, in protraying them vividly, than in populating his books with people you are likely to identify with or actually care about.He's right.Many people have described Hollinghurst as a new genius of prose, as a writer of skill that is long missing in novels from any part of the world.They're right.So what's wrong with The Line of Beauty? Not much, but what IS wrong, like a tiny microbe or virus, seems to infect the whole thing.Read with an eye on the craft of the words, this book is absolutely stunning. Hollinghurst's abilities as a novelist are truly astounding. Even the rather lurid and not particularly tasteful sexual escapades of the novel are crafted with a precision and glory that keep them from wallowing in the muck of which they are made. The affairs, the drugs, the betrayals and the promiscuous, anonymous trysts -- at heart they are what they are, but carved out with Hollinghurst's pen, they become more than that.Unfortunately, not MUCH more than that.The deeper meanings, the symbols of the 80s fall from grace, the metaphors woven into the events, these are all admirable evidences of a fine talent, but in the end, the novel seems to stumble over its own style, it clutches at its own class.During a debate over music, Nick muses this about Strauss: \\"What the problem was was this colossal redundancy, the squandering of brilliant technique on cheap material, the sense that the moral nerves had been cut, leaving the great bloated body to a life of valueless excess.\\" This phrase could equally apply to the book in which it is found.At its heart, the book claims to be about a search for beauty in all its forms.

It embodies the grand metaphor of what Thatcher did to Britain in the 80s and also the personal temptation-pulsed journey of Nick Guest. It reminisces the lasting sense of unhappiness and dismay and how awful Maggie's Britain was. In a wider sense, the novel is an oblique look, one that is both imaginative and interesting as it approaches the sense of forlornness through the eyes of someone like Nick who was absorbed by it and thought it was all rather glamorous. The novel slowly unveils through Nick's journey to relationship, with his lovers and that with the MP household. He is rather weak and easily led but morally pliable. He could be wholly corrupted but he knows his limits and is prune to many temptations, which seem to characterize the novel's times. The novel exposes to the full the idea of an absolute instability and frailty when the country seems to lose its common sense.THE LINE OF BEAUTY is a significant novel in its historical and political essence. It is a painstaking, disconcerting, and savage delineation of the Thatcher years as seen through the tale of Nick, who finds himself living in the attic room of the stately mansion of ascendant Tory politician Gerald Fedden and his family. Nick is a just-coming-out Oxford graduate and is secretly in love with Fedden's straight son Toby. An affair with a young black clerk gives Nick his debut romance, but also alerts him with lurking crisis of his gay identity. He feels he might look like a person with no friends. He is extremely sensitive to anything that might be said. He feels he has the wrong kind of irony, the mistaken knowledge, the inappropriate sarcasm for gay life. With a tinge of innocence and careful curiosity that will later whittle away in time, he is faintly shocked, among other emotions and interest and excitement, at the idea of a male couple.It is later secret affair with a millionaire, a film-maker, his college friend Wani that changes Nick's life drastically and rids all his boyish innocence and curiosity on aspects of being gay. A handsome Lebanese and the only son to an old-valued man who owns a supermarket chain, Wani, with an indefeasible family instinct, exacts totally secrecy in his affair with Nick. It is not sure whether he pretends to be straight or chooses to keep a low-profile with his affair. To him, for sure, his family is as natural as sex and as irrefutable in its demands. His \\"fianc&eacute;e\\", a female companion whom he pays, is just a front. Everything Wani and Hick do: the surreal montage of sexual conspiracy and the drug escapade is clandestine that Wani has slipped away into a world his father has never imagined.Though Nick might have entertained the thrill of wandering away from strict truth, tricking people and longing for scandalous acclaim of the secret affair, he finds himself compelled to tell the truth, and to vocalize all the mischievous beauty. The deep connection between them is so surreptitious that at times it is difficult to believe it exists. The cultivation of their love requires indifference. It is an intuition blinked away by its own absurdity, the very element that charms and hypnotizes them. Wani's strict discretion originates from his father casting high hope on him, the only son, after his brother was killed in a car accident in Beirut. Wani has shouldered that burden of family mourning since childhood and seems more touching, more glamorous and more forgivable at the revelation of the mishap. It therefore aggrandizes the affair, which becomes more convincing not to be mistaken for the squeeze of guilt.The novel carefully winds down towards a shocking and forceful denouement in which the entire political decade is expertly drawn as a human sham. Regardless of the lucid elaboration of sex and drugs, which might have raised highbrow of literary elite, the novel has scooped the Booker Prize. The explicit physical content in THE LINE OF BEAUTY is nothing compared to Hollinghurst's 1988 debut THE SWIMMING POOL LIBRARY, which is riddled of even more explicit scenes all the way through it. The gay protagonist in the novel of current interest, however, does not isolate himself in a strange way and whose contact with the world is not entirely sexual. THE LINE OF BEAUTY is clearly about things other than being gay: a social commentary perhaps and it almost becomes somewhat irritating if it is used to imply that that is all there is to the book. Merely looking at it as gay fiction will not do justice of its fine writing and buried meaning."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"In 1753, British artist William Hogarth published The Analysis of Beauty, one of several 18th-century attempts to establish formal rules to standardize aesthetic taste. The title of Hollinghurst's Booker Prize-winning novel The Line of Beauty is taken from Hogarth's famous S-curve, which he declared inherent to all beautiful forms. According to Hogarth, \\"the waving line, or line of beauty, varying still more [than a combination of straight and curved lines], being composed of two curves contrasted, becomes still more ornamental and pleasing, insomuch that the hand takes a lively movement in making it with pen or pencil\\": the principle of beauty is the pleasure of constant variety and motion--of the hand, for the artist, and of the eye, for the viewer--and the play of contrasts of a line winding first this way and then that provides the ideal form of such pleasure. Hollinghurst's novel, which is, in addition to a consideration of Hogarth's aesthetic theory, an homage to Henry James and a portrait of London's uppermost upper class in the mid-1980s, deftly winds through various manifestations of the S-curve, and the effect is indeed one of astounding beauty. The novel's protagonist, Nick Guest, an Oxford-educated \\"aesthete\\" and James devotee who has (unwittingly?) insinuated himself into the glittering lifestyle of Britain's rich and famous, has an eye for form, and describes waving lines everywhere, from the fence that keeps the masses out of the private garden to which he himself possesses a key (as a permanent guest--ha!--of the wealthy and politically powerful Fadden family) to the posts of the bed he secretly shares with one of London's most celebrated young heirs, a kind of modern-day oriental prince. Hollinghurst, too, has an eye for winding lines, and a better sense than his protagonist of the way beauty necessarily curves its way through both dark and light--Nick will have to discover the dark side of each luminescent edge of his fast and furious life in his own time. This is a beautiful novel because all of its lines are under strict control: each sentence is balanced, each scene is minutely plotted, and the narrative unfurls in a continuing series of flights and falls, careening through thrills that plunge into tragedy with a sense of epic inevitability.But the novel's greatest strength, I think, is not its mastery of the line of beauty, but its occasional forays into Hogarth's three-dimensional \\"line of grace,\\" or \\"serpentine line\\": \\"the serpentine line, by its waving and winding at the same time different ways, leads the eye in a pleasing manner along the continuity of its variety, if I may be allowed the expression; and which by its twisting so many different ways, may be said to inclose (tho' but a single line) varied contents; and therefore all its variety cannot be express'd on paper by one continued line, without the assistance of the imagination.\\" While he ruminates obsessively about the line of beauty, Nick never (as far as I recall) considers the line of grace, and the moments when the novel seems to embody this more complex and more sinister line are the moments when the writing appears to have escaped the obsessive control of its \\"master\\"--whether that is Nick, or his imaginary mentor James, or the conscious vision of Hollinghurst himself--and soars forward tracing a path through the world that has itself been set in motion. Appropriately, since Hogarth and even James are best remembered as satirists rather than pious students of beauty, The Line of Beauty's moments of sublimity appear in its graceful but savagely funny sequences of dialogue, when the characters reveal through their own lines the simultaneous heights of comedy and tragedy contained in the relentless progress of human folly. An example: While young Catherine Fadden's manic depression traces out one of the novel's lines of beauty, it is the conversation about her \\"episodes\\" that fleshes this conceit out and propels it forward into the more twisted line of grace:----------\\"Oh, it's pathetic!\\" shouted Catherine, with the rush and stare of someone hurtled along by a strong new mix of emotions. ...she smacked the table hard, but still somehow childishly and comically; there were one or two nervous smiles. She jumped her chair back over the flags and hurried indoors.\\"Um ... should I ...?\\" said Jasper, and sniggered.\\"No, no, I'll go,\\" said Rachel. \\"In a minute or two.\\"\\"Experience suggests to wait a bit,\\" said Gerald, as if explaining some other local customs to his guests.\\"An emotional young lady,\\" said Maurice Tipper with a grin of displeasure.\\"She's a very emotional young lady,\\" said Jasper, in a cowardly mixture of boasting and mockery.\\"She's quite unbalanced,\\" Lady Partridge agreed confidentally.Gerald hesitated, peering over his raised wine glass, but took his daughter's part. \\"I think I'd say she's just very softhearted,\\" he said; which it seemed to Nick was just what she wasn't.-----------I'm not sure Hollinghurst himself would pick out a moment such as this to illustrate his best talents as a writer--the novel is certainly full of more beautiful passages--but this is where the writing seems to me most wise, in a serpentine kind of way, exposing its characters in a heady mix of comic derision and profound insight into the things people don't know about themselves, and which will only appear to the more vigilant observers in retrospect, after the full movement of the narrative line has been completed."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"The Line of Beauty is an extraordinarily well-crafted novel with a nearly flawless story arc (hmmm...perhaps a metaphor in and of itself?) and what could be called a perfectly paced plotline. It is Jamesian more in scope than in tone with a rich, diversity of characters inhabiting a world that is subtly complex. Each conversation is fraught with subtext. Hollinghurst's intricate world of sex, drugs and politics in the 1980's is treated with the same curious blend of compassion and detachment that Henry James used nearly a century earlier. It is a world at once familiar and foreign and, while Hollinghurst's view is deliberately Post-Modern there still remains a Jamesian sympathy toward even the most unlikable of characters. While I can understand how a reader might initially regard the characters as being a bit unsympathetic, after finishing the novel, I completely disagree. Yes, at times, these characters appear to live lives that seemed rather vapid and lacking in meaning and direction, but it is essential to keep in mind that that depiction is a deliberate choice by the author. Like James, Hollinghurst creates a rarified world where moral and ethical values exist in a world entirely apart from the reader. (Well, at least the average, person not hailing from a fabulously rich and politically embedded London family.) Like James, Hollinghurst presents his characters intimately, yet objectively - without judgment or undue color - but this does not mean that they are in any way unsympathetic. By the final pages it became nearly impossible not to feel for Nick and, in fact, nearly all of the characters. Without giving away too much, there is a nearly overwhelming sense of alienation and sorrow that is so beautifully rendered that the reader cannot help but reinterpret the story that precedes it. Oh, and as to what one reviewer referred to as \\"needlessly graphic gay sex\\" and another referred to as \\"sexy\\" the choice is yours. Personally, I found it to be the latter, but if it not your thing, it will only serve to increase the sense of genteel estrangement Hollinghurst's world provides."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Winner of Britain's prestigious Booker Prize, Hollinghurst's elegant, eloquent novel explores the Thatcherite era (in three sections, 1983, 1986 and 1987) and the changing social mores of the \`80s; the London gay scene and the coming of AIDs.Hollinghurst's upper class set live in gorgeous mansions casually graced with C&eacute;zannes over the dining table and Louis Seize commodes in the bathroom and Herbert von Karajan on the radio. His protagonist, Nick Guest, 23 at the start, son of an antiques appraiser, has a room in the attic of an Oxford classmate's parents' London home, while he pursues his graduate work in the literature of Henry James.The house is home to Gerald Fedder, Member of Parliament, his wealthy wife, his unstable, angry daughter, Catherine (who Nick baby-sits when her urge for self-mutilation becomes overwhelming), and Toby, Nick's friend and secret crush. Toby, however, is thoroughly straight. A slightly older man, Leo, a black Jamaican, definitely not upper class, initiates Nick into the lusty mysteries of sex.Immersed in the heady realms of wealth and privilege, Nick is tentative and shy, even cowardly, but soon he has left Leo behind and immersed himself in a dangerous, fast-track, glittering world of drugs and sex and a secret affair with a super-wealthy former classmate, Wani, who is engaged to be married.Hollinghurst explores Thatcherite politics and scandal, and gay life in the dawn and devastating early days of AIDS, as well as issues of class, cowardice, and pleasure. The prose is exquisite, with Jamesian richness, attention to detail and character nuance, and the satire is subtle and sly. Nevertheless, a young man's obsession with sex, no matter how gorgeously and wittily described, grows tedious, and Nick's immersion in the life is his first and foremost preoccupation.Portmouth Herald, March 27, 2005"},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Not only because it won the Booker award but also because of the praise that \`LINE OF BEAUTY' generated from all sources.

I am all for a novel that stretches the mind by using beautiful prose and Alan Holinghurst does indeed have a flare for writing sparklingly beautiful prose; but in \`THE LINE OF BEAUTY' he does so at the expense of the story. In my opinion there was nothing interesting about this book except the writing style until the very last chapters where things began to pick up and the story finally began to take shape. I am very glad that I took the time to actually finish this book because the last sections almost made it a worthwhile read and did evoke some feelings from me for the main character Nick, despite the fact that in my opinion he was a completely unlikable and dense character throughout the entire book.

In the first part of the book, 1983, he has a secret relationship with Leo, a black council worker whose mother is extremely christian. In the second and third parts of the book (1986 and 1987) Nick has a relationship with a Wani, a Lebanese men whose filthy rich parents are not supposed to know either. While Gerald and the Fedden family are having their own problems, ultimately leading to the downfall of the family, Nick has to cope with secret sex, tons of cocaine and the ravage that AIDS causes in the gay community.Alle these are ingredients for a very touching novel, but somehow \\"Line of beauty\\" never gripped me: everything stays at the surface. The only person causing some depth is actually Catherine, the manic-depressive daughter of the family, whose caustic remarks on the life and friends of her parents are hilarious and sad at the same time. Nick is the type of person who always wants to please other people by making non-commital remarks, hardly ever going against the flow or raising an objection to anything and Gerald Fedden is so superficial that he probably invented the word. If Alan Hollinghurst wants how people live and react in a very superficial world, he certainly succeeded in that, but you never get any insight into the feelings of the characters. For example, the AIDS item, which could have added a emotional dimension to the novel because the gay community was very scared in the eighties, was in my opinion not fully exploited. This winner of the Booker Prize 2004 seems to have everything in it to become a classic, but somehow I did not see it."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"There is little redeeming in this unbearably boring and overly drawn out book. The mystery is how it was preferred by the judges over the astonishing Cloud Atlas or even the blackly hilarious I'll Sleep Till Noon for the Booker. Dull and sleep inducing..."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"The Line of Beauty... It's difficult to find words that do it justice. Nick Guest is a young man just out of Oxford, one who doesn't quite belong to that rarified world of his classmates, and who yearns for it in a way only someone who doesn't belong can. At the start of the book he has just moved in with one of his Oxford's classmate's family, the Feddens, in a gorgeous house in a posh part of London. Gerald Fedden, the patriarch, is a rich charismatic MP (though not titled) and his wife Rachel is elegant, serene, the daughter of an Earl, and a wonder to Nick. Their son, Toby, Nick's friend, is the picture of good-natured British privilege - he takes it all for granted and his simplicity is a foil to Nick's complexity. The Fedden's daughter Catherine is emotionally closest to Nick. She is self-destructive, an ex-cutter, and scorns the world her parents and brother so easily move in. Hollinghurst paints a stunning and absolutely exacting portrait of the world these characters inhabit and their interactions with each other. Nick meanwhile is also discovering his own sexuality and falls in love with a young man Leo during these formative years. The book occurs in three parts, skipping forward first 3 years and then 1 year, covering the formative years of Nick's life. This plot device is incredibly moving as it highlights the contrasts of Nick's younger self with how he changes throughout the years. As stated in the book's blurb, The Line of Beauty is a stunning examination of the issues of class, money, and sex, but it's also about beauty, the way beauty manifests itselfs and is heart-breakingly thrilling but ultimately fleeting. Beauty which is pure and shining in a brief moment of time. It is also that rare book that so perfectly captures the human condition - love, yearning, jealousy, self-loathing, fear, uncertainty, envy, lust, heartbreak, and grief."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"One of the biggest challenges of any novelist is to provide a perspective that's accessible to us and helpful in understanding what's being portrayed. Alan Hollinghurst has achieved remarkable results by stationing his narrator, Nick Guest, outside of all the worlds he inhabits. Guest is like a spirit rising amused over the action that can draw us a picture while recording every sound that's created or uttered.Here are the worlds that Guest helps us explore:-Tory MP life during the Thatcher years-Young Oxford graduates looking for a place-A young man exploring his homosexuality-Wealthy British on the make for more-Middle-aged married life-Inner life of a young manic-depressiveThe book's overall theme is about everyday hypocrisy and the large price that has to be paid by those who pretend to be other than what they are and believe.The story evolves in three time periods: 1983, 1986, and 1987. In all three years, Nick Guest resides with the family of an Oxford friend where the father is a rising conservative MP. Nick has an unofficial role as low-cost lodger to keep on eye on the friend's troubled sister. The family knows that Nick is looking for a boy friend and is open about accepting his sexuality. The three years give us a chance to learn more about the characters and to see how their relationships change. The 1987 period brings all that had been known in private into public with large consequences for all.The book is filled with great scenes where nuances of knowledge, awareness, perception, accent, and perspective separate and unite the characters. Often, contrasting scenes occur back-to-back so that the contrasts are even more obvious. You'll gain a deeper insight into British society than you could on your own.Ultimately, I feel that a work of fiction must be judged by how successfully it takes you into a world you have never been in before and allows you to understand that world much better. Any novel that can help me understand what it's like to be gay during the AIDS epidemic while giving me a strong sense of Thatcher's leadership has to be pretty terrific because those dimensions are outside my experience and normal reading.As a person who enjoys art, I was most impressed by the way that the ogee was worked into the story to provide a connecting metaphor for our common humanity.Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"On one level, this exquisitely wrought novel is a social satire -- a wickedly frank view of the monetarily and politically privileged in Thatcher-era England as seen through the eyes of an insider Outsider. On a more personal level, it might be called a tragedy of manners, the first-person account of an all-too-flawed (some might say parasitic) hero whose hubris is his desire to belong. The rather too obviously named narrator, Nick Guest, seeks his place in the world among the sexually active homosexual set, the wealthy movers and shakers crowd, the aestheticist/intellectual exclusivists and the secret coterie of drug culture initiates. Nick's fall from grace stems from his careless disregard of the boundaries that separate them. AIDS, Margaret Thatcher, Henry James (Nick's thesis subject and literary godfather) and Cocaine are the spirits that reign over the proceedings, but they are not spirits who reside comfortably together.Nick's sexual initiation with a lower-class black man takes place in the within the exclusive gated community where his hosts, the wealthy, politically ambitious Feddens, reside. Prophetically, this relationship is consummated in a chilly garden, the participants warmed by the compost heap they use for leverage. Sexual prowess and, later, drug use lead Nick to carelessness, blurring his sense of propriety. And although drugs and sex are the great equalizers that allow Nick entree into the world of his social betters, they ultimately bring about his expulsion from Society. Everything he desires, either betrays him or is betrayed by him. His college mate's family, of which he so desperately wants to be a member, actually regards him as a servant, the sister's keeper (a position at which he finally, catastrophically fails). His first lover casts him aside without explanation and his long-term partner, the stunningly handsome, wealthier-than-is good-for-him Wani, is too drug-addled and promiscuous to be capable of real love and regards their relationship as one of sexual convenience. It is this relationship that will, in the end, prove to be the undoing of Nick and those he most admires.Hollinghurst's themes are appropriately Jamesian: the dilemma of the artist in an artless society (Wani's money-worshipping, boorish father incessantly refers to Nick as \\"the aesthete\\"), and the clash between an independent innocent and a corrupt though attractive feudal establishment. Symbolic details are handled delicately and effectively as in the case of photographic references. Nick is disappointed when a photo of his crowning moment in Society, his dance with the Prime Minister, does not appear in the tabloids. When a photo of him is, in fact, published, it is the scandalous catalyst of his expulsion from that society. And, as he leaves his long-time residence, he comes across a snapshot of his sexually unavailable schoolmate, Toby, for love of whom he came to stay in the Fedden household in the first place. The photo shows a beautiful, sexually alluring Toby as he once appeared in a school play, but whose real-life, indolent subject has subsequently gone to fat.Nothing is what one hopes it will be and all desire is betrayal. The line of beauty is only skin deep, leaving \\"The Line of Beauty\\" a lovely portrait of unlovely, ultimately unlovable people."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Alan Hollinghurst has consistently written intelligent and sensual novels (\\"The Swimming Pool Library\\", \\"The Folding Star\\" and \\"The Spell\\") that have found a readership that crosses over from his initial audience of readers of Gay fiction to the audience of readers who simply appreciate fine literature. And with THE LINE OF BEAUTY his merits have been rewarded not only by the acclaimed Booker Award, but also by a rather phenomenal presale demand. Hollinghurst is simply one of the best of the current writers.THE LINE OF BEAUTY is more than a finely tuned story about class differences, the foibles of the wealthy and ruling class of England, the hypocrisy of the Thatcher era in the 1980s, the recognition of the media watch dogs gobbling rumors about the government and the concurrent homophobia /rise of AIDS/druggie culture as seen through the proscenium arch of London. This book is very much a character study of one Nicholas Guest, a young middle class lad, graduate of Oxford, who (much like Ripley!) yearns for the luxuries of the wealthy and gentried such as Gerald and Rachel Fedden who live in a mansion in Notting Hill with their troubled (read 'speaks her mind') daughter Catherine and son Toby, the object of gay Nicholas' infatuation since their shared years at Oxford.The novel follows Nick's absorption into the Fedden family, being accepted as an aesthete, his first same sex affair with a handsome black clerk whom he encounters through a personal ad in the gay rag, his dalliances with the famous (including Margaret Thatcher herself), with a millionaire closeted playboy Wani who introduces him to drugs and more, and with creating a magazine with Wani which is the pinnacle of glossy aesthetics cum hoity toity. The various characters in this 'rake's progress' remain threaded through this story until all of the misguided judgments and turns of fate crumble Nick's world of fantasy.Yet as if this strong and fascinating story weren't enough, it is Hollinghurst's intelligence and writing style that mesmerize. He has the ability to begin phases of his tale with peripheral information that causes the reader to wonder exactly where he is taking us: he creates a stage setting with scenery and props that must be in place before the first character speaks the lines that define so cogently where the author has arrived. His quality of prose is exquisite both in describing the beauty seen and imagined and the 'squalor' intermittently encountered. He fleshes out each of his characters with such skill that we feel inside their heads even before they speak their lines.If there is a flaw in this tome it is a minor one: unless the reader is a thorough-going anglophile or has lived in some part of the UK, the various aspects of class distinction and governmental abbreviations require a bit of stalling to decipher. But then what is reading all about, if not for pleasure and for edification? THE LINE OF BEAUTY is a brilliant novel by a gifted writer and deserves the attention of everyone who loves great books. Grady Harp, January 07"},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Yes, he writes beautifully. Yes, his portrayals are vivid and often satirical, his mockery of upper-crust individuals is enjoyable. Yes, he is learned, with clever references to Henry James, to music, to antique furniture and to other aspects of culture. Yes, Nick, the central character, ever anxious to fit in and to please and never quite certain whether he is saying the right thing, is especially well drawn. Yes, there are many deft touches in symbolism and in plot. But I found too much in this book that repelled me. I am not homophobic, but I do find it distasteful when an author, however well he writes, revels in describing randy promiscuity, whether homosexual or heterosexual. Yes, Nick comes to have genuine affection for three other men (of whom one is unobtainable), but at the same time he is sordidly promiscuous elsewhere, in lavatories, with a waiter at a country house party, and involved in threesomes. And he is endlessly fantasising, roused by the outlines of other men's genitals and buttocks. It may be argued that Hollinghurst is simply giving a realistic description of this kind of behaviour in a cautionary tale: after all, Nick's two lovers, as promiscuous as he is, die of AIDS and the book ends with Nick himself due for an AIDS test. But I don't buy that: it seems to me that the behaviour, described in gross detail (in one place, for example, Nick caresses his friend's genitals through his trouser pocket), is narrated with the relish of a pornographer. I cannot admire a book like that, however cleverly it is written."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"While I can't go so far as to say that this was Booker Prize-worthy, it's definitely worthy of being called a literary achievement. To be honest, I haven't kept close tabs on Brit-lit over the past year, so I can't truly say what might have been more deserving. But somehow this novel doesn't quite hit the same heights as, say, Ian McEwan's Atonement or Yann Martel's Life of Pi. That being said, it's a wonderful novel. Few writers are able to make both a social and an intellectual statement so acutely, so powerfully, and so holistically with their work. It is clear from the get-go that this novel can't be pidgeon-holed as simply gay literature, though the main characters are gay and homosexuality is a central theme. But it's a lot more than that. There is a piercing social commentary about class, hierarchy, and the materialism of the 1980s. Between the lines of cocaine and the anal sex in the park you'll find a real novel of ideas here, one that captures a not-so-distant period with a great deal of wisdom, perspective, and insight."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I would have given 5*'s if it were a 1st run copy but I knew that from the price. Paid extra for expedited shipping and it arrived as promised in 2 days."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I was disappointed by this book. By the end of the book I still had not developed any real feeling for any of the characters. It's an awful lot of slogging through boring upperclass British nattering, punctuated by somewhat startling little bursts of graphic sex. It was an odd juxtaposition. However, if you're keen on fairly hot gay sex scenes, this book's for you! Nick Guest, the main character, is not terribly interesting and I was sorry to have spent so much time in his company. I'm just glad I read quickly because I'd be mad if I invested any more than a few days' worth of subway rides on this."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"This novel won the 2004 Booker Prize but I'm not sure if it is deserving. For readers who aren't familiar with Britain's history of the 1980s, reading and understanding this novel will prove quite a challenge. For the first 200 pages or so, I find the prose pretentious, verbose, and repetitive. I get the sense that the author, who himself is gay, thinks that homosexual love is unique and far different than heterosexual love that most people feel at some point in our lives. This would explain the author's condescending tone and the need to keep repeating and repeating, all over the first 200 pages, the fears and hopes of the gay protaganist Nick Guest towards his love interests. Anyone, straight or gay, would understand the feelings that come with being in love without having to be expounded repeatedly. The author must think his readers are ignorant Tories of the 1980s.The novel quickens in early part two as we are transported three years since the end of part one, where Nick Guest has apparently found a new love interest and where his 'adoptive' family, the McFeddens, has gotten into some trouble. The most interesting character I find was Catherine who unfortunately disappeared after the first 25 pages of the novel and would only show up again in part two. Catherine suffers from severe depression but this does not prevent her from being the voice of reason and truth in an era where hypocrisy reigns throughout Britain. Other than Catherine, I don't find any other character sympathetic, including Nick, and so when the foreshadowing ends and the end results are revealed, it felt very anti-climatic.Overall, this is a decent novel, not a great one. With better editing, the novel could have been great."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I couldn't finish this book. This book is not for me.

Hollinghurst, as advertised, possesses a wondrous facility for words; even the most mundane acts are described with a fluent accuracy that the reader is inclined, often, to exclaim, \\"yes, that's it. He said it perfectly!\\" Nevertheless, lovely writing does not a compelling novel make, and that, combined with a penchant for a relentless gay-dominated, \\"where's my next man?\\" theme, simply left me at the station. Others may choose to take this ride, especially if first chapter anal male sex is your metier, but even this tolerant reader was looking for more than the constant longing found in Nick's loins.

An example paragraph of the endless descriptions that mar the book (if i'm breaking copyrights laws, let me know):Nick wasn't sure how it started. Sam Zeman was laughing so much he lay back on the floor, but then choked and had to sit up. One of the girls pointed at him mockingly, but it wasn't mockery, she was laughing uncontrollably herself. Nat was red in the face, pinching the tears out of his eyes and pulling down the corners of his mouth to try to stop it. Nick could only stop giggling by glaring at the floor, and as soon as he looked up he was giggling again convulsively, it was like hiccups, it was hiccups, all mixed up together with the whooping, inexplicable funniness of the brandy bottle, the Renoir lady, the gilded plaster crown above the bed, all of them with their ideas and bow ties and plans and objections."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Line of Beauty is one of the most satisfying novels I have ever read. While one is quickly made aware of the beautiful use of language, the book is balanced - with plot and character being equal to the style of writing. Becoming ever more engaged while reading it I kept asking myself, \\"What is it that is so fascinating and unique about this book.\\" Upon reflection I now believe that it is Hollinghurst's ability to create a descriptive phrase that sometimes gives the reader new insight on the dialogue, sometimes on the situation, and most often on the innermost being of the characters in the novel. The real delight is when the descriptive comments sometimes intrude themselves into the mind and life of the reader and produce an epiphany of self-understanding. I found these countless descriptive, often poetic, passages to be the most wonderful part of the novel. The plot is engaging, the social and political satire delightful, and the characters compelling. Some readers have found the book cold and devoid of feeling; I found it able to celebrate the possibility of life in the midst of a \\"surprisingly unconditional\\" world."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Frustrated by his first brush with romance, Nick Guest feels he's been \\"swept to the brink of some new promise.\\" The moment is profoundly poignant.Though \\"The Line of Beauty\\" runs through a period scarcely more than twenty-five years in the past, time already seems to have rendered Margaret Thatcher's England as misty and distant as something out of \\"Brideshead Revisited.\\" Could the world really have changed this much so quickly? The misty quality is deceptive. In this penetrating and mature work, Alan Hollinghurst employs a hard, sharp wit to delineate the sort of moral bankruptcy that attended the early days of the HIV pandemic, and as in \\"The Swimming Pool Library,\\" the contrast between the rather savage tale and his complex and contemplative style proves riveting."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"There are going to be some readers who will hate The Line of Beauty because they hate homosexuals; some who hate it because it's about rich, privileged British people; and some who will hate it because they are just...challenged. I assume most Amazon.com readers aren't any of these things.In which case, treat yourself to this masterpiece. It deserves its place not just as a Booker prize-winner but in the pantheon of great modern novels.The plot is a simple one, inspired as much by Hogarth's drawings for A Rake's Progress as by other novels about the rich and nasty. Nick Guest is a young gay man in love with the (straight) son of Gerald Fedden, a Conservative politician in the 1980s. His sexual adventures are intertwined with Gerald's political rise and moral fall. Both come to a disastrous end, thanks to sex. Nick, predictably, gets AIDS and Gerald, equally predictably, is found to have been having an affair with his secretary. The family reject Nick and accuse him of having betrayed them when in fact he has been the \\"keeper of secrets\\", painfully discreet to the point of compromising even his own aesthetic values. Beauty, drugs, money and sex all combine in a ferocious satire about the recent past.You don't read Hollinghurst for the plot, but for the quality of his observations, and for his writing, which is sublime. The title is appropriate because every line, or sentence in it is perfect - vile as the Thatcher years were, in every sense, they were too coarse to deserve blows from a rapier. There are great set-pieces, such as when Nick is the only man in the room to dare to invite Mrs. Thatcher to dance, a drunken house-party in the country, and a summer holiday in the Feddens' idyllic French house which I am sure Eng lit students of the future will pore over. But above all, it's just such fun to read. You will feel you know these people in all their loathsomeness, whatever country and culture you come from - as long as you feel a bit of an outsider, and as long as you aren't stupid."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I do not hate gay people (I am one) or rich people. I am not a stupid person. Yet, I hated The Line of Beauty. If it hadn't won the Booker Prize, I would not have finished it. I'm happy that I did because the book's best passages are all at the end.While I agree that Hollinghurst has written a thoughtful novel about the crass, class-conscious culture of the '80s, it does not hold a candle to David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas, a great book which will be remembered long after the Booker Prize-talk has died down around this one.Perhaps my trouble is that I also hate Henry James, when it comes to actually reading him. I very much enjoy his short works, such as The Aspern Papers and The Turn of the Screw but, when he had a pile of pages to fill, he couldn't stop churning out the words, no matter how well he'd already driven his point home over and over and over again.That is exactly what Hollinghurst does here. By the end of the first section, his point has been made. Unfortunately, it has been made in almost 200 pages of mostly wordy drivel. The second section exists only to force folks who want to glean some enjoyment out of their literature to suffer a bit more. It worked. The third section is where there is finally some reason to turn the pages. The passion in Hollinghurst's writing is evident here whereas, in the first two sections, he seems as bored as James must have been proof-reading The Golden Bowl. Of course, by this time, sympathy for every character, especially for the oppressively annoying Nick, is gone.I suppose that is Hollinghurst's point but, again, it could have been made much more simply.It seems to me that the Booker Prize Committee has taken up the habit of attempting to shock the literary world with some of their recent choices. The best thing I can say about this book is that it is not as bad as the completely odious Life of Pi. At least David Mitchell has plenty of time to make it to the short list again. The great William Trevor, whose The Story of Lucy Gault lost to Yann Martel's \\"Pi\\", is in his late '70s."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Alan Hollinghurst's fourth novel, The Line of Beauty, follows the story of Nick Guest, a lodger of the wealthy Fedden family, through the landslide years of the Conservative government in the 1980s. A bildungsroman, split into three sections, it observes Nick over four years as he climbs the social ladder, led by his dreams of wealth, status, and beauty, which ultimately lead to his downfall.Nick has engineered his rise by befriending, at university, the son of minor MP Gerald Fedden, Toby, to whom he is attracted. Post-Oxford, he has moved into the home of the Feddens, an invite from Toby. The tale follows Nick's first romance with Leo, a black social worker, and then moves on to his relationship with a beautiful millionaire, before dwelling on his eventual downfall. Throughout these events, which make up the aforementioned sections, the author examines the 1980s socially, politically, and beautifully.First, the language; The Line of Beauty's prose is a homage to Henry James, and Hollinghurst has it perfect, his contemporary take allowing less ambiguity with description. And it's the description that exemplifies this novel; long, sweeping sentences, realistic action, and colourful observations, of the players' thoughts and expressions, all punctuated with enough dialogue to complete, without being indulgent, every scene. With such detail on display, the novel takes its time, but the gradually developing arena Hollinghurst is showing us becomes a world in its own right.Throughout the narrative, running at an unhurried pace, the characters are exemplary. The aesthete Nick Guest, so aptly named, searches for beauty in everything around him while being less than perfect himself. The Fedden patriarch, Gerald, an MP and philistine, chases his ambitions of having the Prime Minister, referred to as \`the Lady', to his house, and having his likeness realised by satirical puppet show, Spitting Image. Nick's lovers (Leo, comic; the millionaire, hedonistic) draw empathy, while all the others in his life, having their positives and negatives traits, walk confidently off the page. Even Toby's sister, Catriona, fittingly nicknamed \`the Cat', being the black sheep of the family, is perfectly realised, from her early neurosis, passing her chemically induced crests and troughs, to her rebellion from the family and unerring desire to tell the truth.And the 1980s, as a setting, provides a reflection on a depressing period in British history: unemployment is on the rise, the rich are getting richer, and AIDS is a grim shadow waiting to kill those who aren't careful. Moving in closer, to the London locations, the novel is rife with upper class dwellings, in which airy rooms are decorated with striking aesthetics despite the ignorance, Nick being the exception, of the occupants. The art, vases, paintings, and furniture, in the Feddens' house serves only to demonstrate status, something Gerald is always striving to improve.When Hollinghurst won the 2004 Booker Prize for The Line of Beauty, it became the first piece of gay fiction to take receipt of the award. There are, as you may expect in such a book, some scenes of homosexual sex, but the author, with great skill, doesn't delve too deeply into being graphic, ensuring a comfortable read, and, in doing so, reveals facets of gay life that, to many readers, may have been unknown before.The Line of Beauty is a triumph for literature; its characters are complex and engaging, its setting real without being nostalgic, and its themes thoroughly explored. It takes no moral stance, allowing the reader to decide as to the motivations of its characters and to their comeuppance. Its set pieces are incredibly wrought, the scene with Nick, high on cocaine, dancing with Margaret Thatcher, when Feddens achieves one of his dreams, being of particular merit. The humour also, for it is incredibly witty, shines out from the events and the dialogue, and it gives that little bit of light to what is, in essence, a tragic novel. At just over five hundred pages, it is a long book, but taking the time to read it proves that each page is worth it; in fact, it's a book of beauty."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I'm not entirely certain that all American readers appreciate how deeply satirical this book is -- a portrait of the top levels of the Thatcher regime, at the height of its power, and simultaneously an indictment of the regime's hedonism and hypocrisy. All this is seen through the eyes of a more than slightly irresponsible young gay man who certainly deserves his own downfall (although not the prospect of HIV infection held out for him at the book's end -- the book spans the mid-1980s and the real onset of the AIDS disaster). But what is astonishing about this narrative is how the Thatcher government's creed of self-responsibility turns out to be utterly hollow when Nick admits the error of his own ways while the Feddon family sails blithely onward, firmly protected by its money and its friends.There are a great many wonderful set pieces scattered throughout, but those toward the end are definitely the most memorable. In particular, the depiction of the Feddons on vacation in Provence (with some most unwelcome houseguests), and the great 25th Anniversary party in London (which the Iron Lady honors with her presence), are classics. I also very much liked the description of Fleet Street hijinks in the last pages.The novel takes a little while to get really started, but it is well worth the wait. One particular recommendation: keep your eye firmly on Wani (or Antoine), who pops up early but is only latterly developed."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I had put this aside to reread, and after some years, came back to read it again slowly.This book really is a masterwork, but an acclaimed literary artist writing at the height of his powers. It has echoes of \\"Brideshead Revisited,\\" in that it is about someone who attaches himself to a household of wealth and political power. It has echoes of Henry James. It is an eloquent snapshot of how AIDS came to affect a cosmopolitan \\"set\\" that, for a while before its appearance, pushed hedonism to an extreme level.Hollinghurst has a new novel coming out (in North America) in the fall. For new fans that he attracts, this book is definitely worth reading, even if the Thatcherite Era is now just a memory."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I just finished Alan Hollinghurst's latest novel, The Line of Beauty. I thoroughly enjoyed it, despite some significant limitations. Most strikingly, it has hardly any plot. Oh yes, there's some sex, boyfriends come and go (in more ways than one), \\"The Lady\\" may or may not visit, there's a scandal, somebody may or may not die of AIDS. But deep down, Hollinghurst could care less. Plot is simply the machinery that moves his characters from moment to moment. For him, and for Nick, it is only the moment that matters. And what moments! Every page captures a subtle perception, in language both richly evocative and breathtakingly concise. This is the \\"line of beauty\\" (in one of several senses) that Hollinghurst and his protagonist live for, and that draws us from page to page.Before Stonewall there was a convention in literature that a book or novel could include a gay character if and only if s/he dies at the end. One would like to imagine that this is ancient history, yet The Line of Beauty pretty much conforms to that convention, and is the first \\"gay\\" novel to win the Man Booker prize. Hollinghurst's first book, The Swimming Pool Library, in some respects even more powerful (much sexier, although the plot is creaky and the language not as sublime), did not conform and did not win. AIDS is never mentioned in Swimming Pool, but the book is dedicated to Nicholas Clark, a close friend of Hollinghurst's from Oxford who was one of its first British victims. Both books can be read as memoirs, and celebrations, of a lost, beloved friend.It must be acknowledged that the characters in Line of Beauty are not terribly likeable. And for the most part they don't seem to much like one another, even when deeply obsessed and arguably \\"in love.\\" Nick is affable and ostensibly sociable but his aesthetic life is at its core self-directed, not other-directed. Paradoxically, this novel of manners is at heart radically individualistic. It is Nick's exquisite sensibility that Hollinghurst celebrates, and mourns."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"As I write this, The Line of Beauty by Alan Hollinghurst is number 5 on W.H. Smith's paperback bestseller list. It won this year's Man Booker prize for best fiction produced in the Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland, and it appears on the \\"Best Books of 2004\\" lists of the New York Times, the Economist, and other publications. What, one may wonder, is all the fuss about?The setting is 1980's London, and our hero is Nick Guest, a recent graduate renting a room from the wealthy Fedden family. As his name implies, Nick is rather out of place in this arrangement and, in fact, in contemporary life in general. At the opening of the novel, Nick has only recently come to terms with his homosexuality. He is timid and cautious, finding himself quite daring when he responds to a classified ad placed by a man only somewhat older than him. Flash forward to 1986. Nick has moved on to another relationship and his confidence has grown to the point that he is picking up strangers in the men's room of local gay hangouts and inviting them back for threesomes. He also has a drug habit, shared and supplied by his rich lover. AIDS has become an issue, but it is still only on the horizon, not directly affecting Nick or his friends for the time being. The story will come together the following year, with Nick never quite fitting in but always striving to find the beauty of the situation or setting. The \\"line of beauty\\" of the title refers to a double curve, much like the letter S. The story seems to curve from innocence to carefree hardness and finally to a sort of defiant regret. Much like the decade itself, the novel meanders at first, picking up steam around 1986 and coming to a crashing conclusion following Black Monday.Nick is a scholar of Henry James, and Hollinghurst uses James repeatedly to shed light on the decade's decadence and on Nick's reluctant willingness to get caught up in it. Nick is asked at one point what James would think of the well-to-do guests at a dinner hosted by the Feddens. \\"Well,\\" he replies, \\"he'd have been very kind to us, he'd have said how wonderful we were and how beautiful we were...and we wouldn't have realized until just before the end that he'd seen right through us.\\"This is not a novel to be read during stolen moments on the morning commute or just before dinner. It should be read with concentration and time, in bed just before falling asleep, say, or on a lazy Sunday afternoon. There is more setting than plot, each chapter a snapshot of the social milieu Nick is caught up in. Here we are at the vacation home of the Feddens in southern France, with the upper class family trying to impress their even wealthier and unimpressible guests. There we are in Nick's home town as Gerald meets Nick's parents and takes part in a regional fair only to show his contempt for and lack of understanding of the local residents. And now we are at a gay swimming hangout, with men flirting with each other openly and swimming suits optional. Early on the slowness of the plot was bothersome. Where was it all going, after all? I misplaced the book and wondered whether it was worth spending the money to replace it. By the time I was two-thirds of the way through, I accidentally left the book at the office. It was all I could do not to run out in the driving rain to retrieve it immediately; waiting until the next day to read the next chapter was torture. Perhaps that, then, is what all the fuss is about."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Hollinghurst has written a thoughtful and entertaining study of a young man coming into himself during the Thatcher years. The novel serves as a backdrop for observations about England's class system and changes in society following World War II, as well as the selfishness of the 80s and the emergence of AIDS. Unlike many gay novels from this period or of it, the AIDS aspect of the story is never heavy handed, mawkish, or over-wrought. Instead the revelations regarding his boyfriends, Leo and Wani, are handled in a sensitive way, although Wani's AIDS becomes sensationalized at the very end. Whether or not Nick is infected with the virus is never made clear, nor is the next step in his life. That ambiguity coupled with the over quick resolution of plot lines (Gerald Fedden's affair, the Wani AIDS \\"scandal\\", and the \\"sex romp\\" at the Fedden summer house get pulled together a little too quickly) keep this from being a five star. Given the ambiguity about HIV and the multi-faceted ending, I suspect there could be a sequel if Hollinghurst is up to it. The rest of the novel, however, was engrossing. A knowldege of the English class system doesn't hurt, but I think most readers will grasp the roles of class and the ways that people at the margins of the system (particularly the upwardly mobile like Nick or Leo) deal with it. The parallels between upward social mobility and leaving the closet also are evident. The satire will probably appeal most to those who appreciate the difficulties of navigating a closed world, especially when they become deluded into thinking it has been opened to them. Otherwise, the observation of manners, furniture, and the like may not be so meaningful. The depiction of gay sex is relatively graphic, though matter of fact. This may be a little challenging for some readers. Hopefully, it won't keep the book from being gehttosized in book stores. I bought my copy in Thailand, a rather closeted country, where it was promoted as a Booker Prize winner."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Those who have read Hollinghurst's previous books know to expect the highest level prose composition. This one will not disappoint, despite some overly long sections of narrative and occasionally unfocussed exposition.The main character (Nick Guest) lives as a guest of a well-connected, rich, political family in London, where he experiences luxuries his own middle class family has not. He also experiences some of the pettiness and moral depravity frequent in this class, in the eyes of the author. He also has the opportunity to savor some of the beautiful things this upper class family has in their possesion, and to work on the publication of a pictorial magazine focusing on beautiful objects.Add to that the main character's exploration of his gayness, and a glimpse into the sexual activities that men in the eighties (the setting of this novel) engaged in, and you have a literary read with some gossipy voyeurism for good measure, complete with an appearance by Margaret Thatcher at a party that occurs near the end of the book.The author has not, I think, forsaken his lofty vision of the value of beauty in including sex and some Upstairs/Downstairs observations. These elements are necessary for us to get a perspective on that class and on gay life in the eighties in England. What these elments do then is give us a tragic end to an era and also to the main character's perception of himself and his role in the world, only slightly and perhaps irrelevantly salvaged by his appreciation and pursuit of beauty, both in men and in all things that surround him."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"The Line of Beauty is certainly not the best book to have won the coveted Booker; but certainly good. The Book is essentially British: it is almost totally free from contemporary American influences. The novel is about Nick Guest, a gay scholar who tries hopelessly, to find love, in a superficial world of sex and drugs. The first half is a bit dragging; but the ending is really poignant. Most importantly, the book is a tribute to Hollinghurst's master,Henry James, and though the whole book is essentially Jamesian, Hollinghurst at times surpasses his master, in style and skill; weaving a world of beauty and grace, flanked by ugly shadows of despair and loneliness."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"This book would have been much better if the author had removed \\"The Love-Chord\\" section, and made the novel shorter by 150 pages. Even in the lengthy version, it is worth reading. It reminded me of \\"Revolutionary Road,\\" although I prefer the latter.Plus Points:- Hollinghurst's control over the language is unbelievable. Every sentence is a joy to read, and has a story in itself. The book is two stories in parallel: the actual events, and the author's commentary and comparisons. It makes you look at everybody life differently.- The second half is dramatic. Nobody does comeuppance like the British, and Hollighurst is one of the best. He does it with full impact: no mitigating circumstances, no drawn out descriptions, no maudlin language. This makes the denouement that much more deadly. I loved it.Challenge:- The novel is too long, and the first part sags terribly. The interminable atmosphere-building was not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Hollinghurst's unparallelled subtlety of observation was almost physically hurting me as I was reading this great novel and that is something I have never experienced before. Apparently, this is literature that reaches places other literature does not reach. I am very much in awe of Mr Hollinghurst's uncanny art and the negative reviews I found here on Amazon prompted me to write this review. Highly recommended for the maybe more experienced reader."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"It's such a relief to read a novel that is serious without being self-conscious and experimental. Hollinghurst is a gifted writer, an his asides are inevitably perfect. For instance, late in the book one of the characters realizes he might lose a son to AIDS. He had lost another child years earlier in a traffic accident. The author starts to mention the line from The Importance of Being Ernest: \\"To lose one parent...may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.\\" But he carefully pulls back, warming the scene, but not disrupting it. For me, the 400 pages of this book flew by in two days. Perhaps it could have been more philosophical than it was. I didn't really have any new insights into the Thatcher years, or AIDS, or Brideshead Revisited-style relationships after reading it, which is too bad. It's a lovely book, though, particularly suited for summer reading."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"While the sex scenes are a little graphic and hard to take, I took it more to mean that the main character is going through some serious changes to adulthood, comging out in the 80s in Britain must not have been easy, and living in a high profile family's house adds to the danger. Of course, in a way, though, the main character feeds off of that.The part that made me think the most though, was how the family who hosted him dealt with the final exposure. Were they right to do what they did? He was living in their house for years, and like his boyfriend, the reader must be thinking \\"let this guy get his own place.\\" I was torn between siding with the high profile family, and siding with the newly out gay boy.One area the author does well is show through the story how that generation had to deal with AIDS; all of his former partners, and their partners, dying off, also struck me as a narrative line beneath the British priggish politics (the love of Thatcher, the preppiness, etc.). Dancing with M. Thatcher while high, while teasing a waiter, who he finds has been seeing his boyfriend regularly, this is all layers of superficiality and deception.I liked the author's use of James to set the context of the artifacts of wealthy life, his aesthetic uselessness to Wani's family, and how he was so obsessed with beauty (thus Wani) ... and therefore superficiality... and how Wani loses that beauty in the end. Is love superficial? Yes, it's annoying that the main character isn't more meaningful. But in a way, the meaningful thing is that he's not meaningful. As he tells the younger sister at one point, isn't finding someone beautiful all love is about anyways?"},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I stayed up late tonight to finally finish this book. Seems like I really didn't care for the characters, but did appreciate their composure. I also by-passed the sex scenes(of course- I'm an Amish author.) Anyway, I thought I was in history class again at moments like the social differences and political influences. It really wasn't a book that I usually purchase, but I gave it a chance when I heard it won the Booker Prize. It didn't let me down! On a scale of 1 to 10, it gets a 10! Lastly, \\"way to go!\\" to Mr. Hollinghurst for receiving the Booker Prize!!"},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Hollinghurst takes the physical line of beauty as found in art and architecture and applies it to the economy of prose and turns the novel on its head. The syntax of the sentences is astonishing and so artful that one doesn't notice the insight sliding in like medicine from an elegantly thin needle. At most, I would have liked a little more cultural references to the time: London in the 80s had so much more than Thatcherism going on: Lady Di, Bryan Ferry, Sade, Band-Aid, Live-Aid, Boy George, Samantha Foxx, etc.But in the end, this novel is as sumptuous as those things that Nick Guest is always coveting.Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Are there really still upper class English twits around with names like Toby who get wear dinner jackets, live in posh parts of London, smoke cigars and drink port after dinner, or have I missed the point and stumbled into an attempt to parody Evelyn Waugh?And do scenes like this still occur at parties: \\"He had pulled off his socks and rolled them into a ball and threw them very hard and accurately at the fat peer's heads\\"?Well, they certainly do in this pitiful attempt which also manages to insert into this bunch of hooray Henries a \\"gay\\" character with a liking for rough trade as its \\"hero\\".Guess what, he falls for a \\"black\\" guy - as well as a waiter called Tristo from Madeira - who leads him on a merry roundabout and comes straight out of cardboard cut-out land.However, as the rest of the \\"characters\\" - including \\"Lady Partridge\\" (I swear I did not invent this) who invites The Tatler to her party - are all caricatures, it's probably unfair to single out one or two.My copy says this book was a New York Times bestseller, a Los Angeles Times bestseller, a Sunday Times bestseller und so weiter.This shows that bestseller does not equal good literature or even a good read"},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I'll pass on giving a synopsis, so........This is a stereotypical light-weight modern English novel. There are the usual suspects: the civil servant, the Oxford graduates, the MP, a few members of the British aristocracy and the City business types. Missing is any description of the gay community.Supposedly set in Thatcher's England there is very little social commentary, with much of the narrative detailing the foolishness of the rich and famous. The author hints at possible avenues to explore--such a mental illness, the rich-poor divide, the impact of AIDS and the role of the media--but quickly skirts around such meaty subjects in favour of endless descriptions of posh houses and their furnishings. He attempts an analysis of the relationships between Nick (the narrator) and those near and dear to him but even they are not taken to any depth.The story is divided into 3 parts. The middle section is way to long. Despite some excellent prose, the real 'writing' doesn't occur till the last section but then that too is diminished by the Forsyth-type thriller aspect of the plot. On his writing, Hollinghurst has the annoying habit of writing dialogue then feeling the need to detail to the reader the tone of the conversation. Not much is left to the reader's intelligence.OK, I'm tough on this, but having read earler work by this author I expected more than an upper class Big Brother narrative."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Line for line, Hollinghurst's novel about London during the 1980s is the most exquisitely written book I've read in years. Witty observations about politics, society, and family open like little revelations on every page.But it's also an explicitly gay novel. Not just a novel with some gay characters, comfortably on the side or reduced to floppy antics, &agrave; la \\"Will and Grace.\\" Hollinghurst rarely strays far from his protagonist's sexual fantasies and exploits. British papers have noted that this is the first gay novel to win the Booker Prize in its 36-year history. (So much for their cosmopolitan sophistication: America's National Book Award went to an equally explicit gay book way back in 1992, an autobiography called \\"Becoming a Man.\\")Some critics have played up the novel's political and social satire, and those elements are certainly there and brilliant, but I wonder if it's squeamishness or political correctness that keeps them from stating that this is primarily a story about gay sexuality and it contains scenes that many readers will find deeply offensive.The novel opens in 1983 when Nick Guest, a graduate student pursuing a PhD on Henry James, moves in with the Feddens, an upper-class family in London's Notting Hill. Nick is an old Oxford chum of the family's oblivious son, and he's become the unofficial caretaker of their dangerously depressed daughter. The parents are wealthy conservatives who want to be perfectly clear that they have no objection to Nick's orientation, particularly if it remains entirely theoretical.Nick, however, is ready to move beyond that, and the first section of the novel details his first date, an assignation with a black man he meets for sex through a personal ad. Their relationship deepens into something more meaningful, drawing Nick into the working-class life of his lover even while he floats into the lavish lifestyle of his host family: As a member of Margaret Thatcher's cabinet, Mr. Fedden gives Nick access to the highest level of British politics, and Mrs. Fedden comes from a family of people who exchange Gauguins as gifts.It's the kind of crowd in which everyone is constantly aware of the flourishes of wealth but determined to treat them with casual disregard. When the piano tuner complains about the state of their instrument, Mrs. Fedden remarks quietly, \\"Oh, I know Liszt enjoyed playing it.\\"Through much of the book, his host family frets about when Mrs. Thatcher will bless them with an appearance. (Their green door must be painted blue, lest The Great Lady assume they're environmentalists.)Hollinghurst can produce inane social banter as well as incisive social analysis. These are parties where \\"after pudding, the ladies withdraw,\\" gatherings with which most readers will not have much personal familiarity. But he describes them with witty precision that captures and satirizes them simultaneously.When the story picks up again in 1986, Nick is still living with his host family, but he's moved on from his first lover to a Lebanese millionaire who's engaged to be married. Ostensibly, they're movie producers, but mostly they watch pornography, pick up young men, and snort cocaine (a different \\"line of beauty\\"). Nick has a vague sense that this isn't a satisfying way to live, but he's mesmerized by the glare of so much money and sensualism and terrified by the prospect of loneliness.He can't shake the sense that he's only playacting, that his ambiguous status in the Feddens' house and in his lover's life is symptomatic of some deeper failure to be an adult. Again and again, he feels outside himself, nervous about how he must look and sound.That cramped self-consciousness complements his obsession with aesthetics, but it also makes him effete and in the end not a very effective friend to himself or those he loves. As AIDS ravages the gay community and scandal rocks the Fedden household, Nick finds himself as abandoned as he ever feared, and the compensation of beauty seems heartbreakingly tragic.Ironically, despite all its graphic sex, a Puritanical piety seems to animate the novel. Rather than challenge any mainstream prejudices about homosexuals, \\"The Line of Beauty\\" confirms them. The most socially conservative reader won't be surprised to see here that gay men are emotionally oversensitive, sexually voracious, desperately lonely, and finally doomed. These are, after all, the stereotypes that homosexuals have labored under for years.All this should produce a complex reception for the Booker winner. In some quarters, the novel's triumph will be a late vindication for gay literature. Others will fret over the shocking sex scenes. But anyone who reads \\"The Line of Beauty\\" will come face to face with one of the most brilliant stylists and perceptive novelists writing today."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I was hesitant to pick up this book, because as a straight woman, I figured that I wasn't really in the target demographic. I just assumed that the book would be driven by[...]themes that wouldn't resonate with me. I was completely wrong. This is an intelligent, tender, brutal, sad, witty, and ultimately heartbreaking book about what it is like to be an \\"outsider\\" on the inside. The first section of the book so convincingly evokes the mood of a Henry James or Edith Wharton novel that when the excesses of the 1980s come crashing into the novel midway through they send a shockwave through the reader that is nothing short of remarkable.In some ways, Nick's closest literary relative is Lily Bart in House of Mirth by Edith Wharton. Like Lily, Nick's essential dilemma is how to live an an authentic life while maintaining a style of living that is dependent on the capricious good will of others. (That dilemma is heightened for both characters by the fact that the aesthetic aspects of the well-heeled lifestyle actually constitute a key component of their authentic selves). Both Lily and Nick seem to walk that fine line with some grace (in Nick's case) and success (in Lily's) at first, but both characters ultimately face a spectacular downfall. But while Lily's downfall is ultimately tied to her manipulativeness and narcissism, Nick's seems to be in part an outcome of his essential sweetness and utter lack of guile. The amazing thing is that Nick's basic decency is often revealed through -- not despite of -- the depraved situations he finds himself in."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I have to respond to the 1-star review because it's so angry and wrongheaded. As an author, I read very widely, but it's the rare book that makes me wish I had writtten it; that is, lived the experience and had the insight that brought this book to fruition. To have emerged from inside rather than approach it as a reader, if that makes sense.Recently I've felt that with Ian McEwan's Atonement, Francine Prose's Blue Star, and Alan Hollinghurst's Line of Beauty. Every line of this book is indeed a line of beauty--the sinuous prose matches the compelling story and I had to force myself to read it slowly, rather than gobble it down. I read many passages aloud to my spouse, who also was blown away.I'm afraid it's been over a year since I read it, so I can't supply more details, but this novel that nods so much at James is actually the kind of book Balzac wrote, blending sex, politics, and money in a knowing commentary on his times, and I can't think of higher praise than that."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"\\"The Line of Beauty\\" is a sharp social critique of British high society set in the 80's during Margaret Thatcher's reign as prime minister. Alan Hollinghurst has a keen eye for the shallow frailties of human nature and how wealth -- particularly the pursuit of it -- can make a fool of someone. The hypocrisy and frigid codes of society's elite are grand topics for a novel, and Hollinghurst clearly knows the ins and outs. His observations are clever and biting, leaving the reader little doubt that he has nailed his subject. This is particularly effective because Hollinghurst has chosen as his narrator an unabashed outsider in the high-class hijinks: Nick Guest, an openly homosexual man in his early twenties living as a guest in the wealthy home of a college friend (whom he harbors a long-standing but seemingly hopeless crush on). As someone who cannot fit in with the world he aspires to because of his family history and sexual orientation Nick can see it for what it truly is.The problem with \\"The Line of Beauty\\" is that for all of its keen observations it is lacking in the wit and humanity that would have made it relatable. There is a cold distance between the reader and Nick Guest; for all of his inherently human mistakes it is difficult to empathize with him or to feel for where he comes from. Indeed, there is only one character that I felt genuinely interested in, and he has a very minor place in the novel (featuring prominently in the first part, but dropping away in the middle). For a true social satire on the snobbery of society's elites I would recommend \\"Snobs\\" by Julian Fellowes, whose affection for the misgivings of his cast of characters is so palpable that it compels the reader to agree (or at least to enjoy the ride). It takes a little too much work to feel for the drab socialites that populate \\"The Line of Beauty\\"."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Holinghurst has written another exquisite book; riviting story line; clear, well-burnished characters populate London's political landscape (as well as the odd park for trist-like encounters). It is no wonder that the book earned the ManBooker for 2004. Although Nicholar Guest, around whom the story circulates, is gay, this is by no means as 'gay' a novel as Hollinghurst's first book, the Swimming Pool Library (1988) written while he was still a deputy editor at the [London] times Literary Supplement. Coming down from Cambridge with a degree, Guest needs gainful employment and he finds some such in the home of a classmate whose father is a high muckimuck in the Tory Party under Thatcher. While the protagonist explores both his sexual and architectural proclivities as a 'line of beauty' leads him to discover some salient 'truths' about life in the big city, certainly about life within the political and aristocratic circles within which he exists. This novel is the latest of Hollinghurst's efforts - The Swimming Pool Library, The Folding Star, and The Spell - to chronicle the coming of age of late 20th century upper class, well educated, well acquained with drugs a la mode, British men who happen to be gay. All of his efforts are well worth the read. As with A Line of Beauty, The Spell, made the short list for ManBoooker in 1994; unfortnately it did not receive the award. Although A Line of Beauty is, in my mind, not his best work - I vote for The Spell - the book is well deserved of the award; and is well deserved to be read.

The one novel which came to my mind while reading this was not written by James, but rather by Edith Wharton - \\"The House of Mirth.\\" Our hero finds himself in the same situation as Wharton's Lily Bart. Living among the rich and powerful is drastically different from being one of them. Simply, one most be careful when swimming with sharks.

Through the post-university life and romantic coming of age of Nick Guest, the potential of Thatcherite London is effectively juxtaposed by the country's lagging views of morality and remnant limitations of class. Exceedingly well-written, each character comes across as uniquely human, with even the most despicable Tory MP avoiding too overt a semblance of caricature. I've been primarily focused on non-fiction for the longest time, but Alan Hollinghurst has rekindled an interest in exploring the world at the human level, stepping down from the dispassionate heights of history and sociology to really learn.The depth of detail seems a little too deep at the start, just right within the piece's second time period, and yet a little too shallow by the third. I watched the BBC miniseries after reading the book, and have to say that I liked its ending much more: a confrontation between Nick and Catherine had seemed inevitable, but was for some reason omitted from the book's weak third period. The series thankfully obliged the reader on this.One comment on the Kindle edition would be that some portions of text have odd indenting, but for me, this didn't detract at all from either the reading experience or my appreciation of the narrative itself."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I was not going to write a review of this novel either, even though I thought it was one of the better written works that has come out in the last few years. But then I read a review by someone who mentioned that it was about people \\"of no consequence\\" and I changed my mind.What exactly is a person of consequence? A king or Queen, Emperor or Scientist? Who gets to decide when a person is of such consequence that they should be written about? Hopefully it will never be you or me. In fact, I have always thought that the power of literature was to transform the commonplace into the spectacular, the ordinary into the mythic. Was Karamazov a person or consequence? Was Captain Ahab? Bartleby? And how exactly would it enrich literature to write of \\"people of consequence?\\" Isn't the whole point to try and find out what it means to be human, to feel pain, to make mistakes, to kill or to die? Has anyone read Richard Ford lately and watched him transform the commonplace into masterpiece?The Line of Beauty was written about people who may not be someone you would want to have a beer with. Or maybe you would. But is that why we read? I hope not. And I tend to think that the sex was too much for most of the reviewers at Amazon. And when they say, \\"it isn't about the sex\\"... it's about the sex. I am not gay and I found that the sexual tilt of this novel was a little more than I bargained for. But it didn't matter to me, because I felt that what I was reading was true and honest and also fantastically written. A tribute to Henry James? I could see that as one facet of the book.I keep coming back to this theme, especially when I see truly bad novels being heaped with praise by the unwary and increasingly uncaring public. There is some real trash out there being tarted up as some kind of cultural phenomena. But The Line of Beauty was not one of them. It is a tightly written and elegant retelling of a family story and of the rise and fall of a young man who breaks their confidence. I thought it was spectacular."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"The Line of Beauty has one simple message: it's about a homosexual who wants to climbs up the social ladder and knowing more powerful and rich people. But finally, he fails and falls all the way down. He has nothing in the end.The novel is built upon this message. Nicholas Guest is portrayed as a simple-minded homosexual who yearns for love a lot. His obsession with Leo, a black, reminds me a lot of the coming-out gay novels in the 80s, such as Edmund White's A Boy's Own Story. Leo, yet, comes from a different class and race. The narrative between them is full of sex. Is gay relationship merely about sex? No. But more.It is also about power, vanity, money, power and social status. The relationship Nick has with Wandi, a millionaire, suggests that Nick is indeed money-driven. He is no longer the simple-minded and pure guy anymore. Wandi yearns for threesome and group sex. This opens up the multitude of gay sex and gay culture. Nick, accepts it. Money, he takes it. Fame, he earns it by living in same house with the Feddens, whose paterfamilia is a Tory leader.The third part of the novel is most fantastic because it wraps up the story very well. While the second part is more like a Jane Austen novel about the upper-class tea parties and gossips (which I think is the most tedious and directionless), the third part about AIDS and the fact the Wandi, Leo and some other gat men mentioned in the novel is dying of AIDS brings the whole story to a climax. AIDS is not only killing Nick Guest's (ex-)lovers, but also brings him down from the social ladder. At the end of the novel, I was a little bit sad as Nick Guest has been left with nothing. He is kicked out of the Feddens family. His loyalty towards each individual member in the family has been denied and discarded, including his 'intimate' buddy Toby. He does not go back to his parents who live in a different world. He has no friends in the novel, except the maniac Catherine Fedden, who reminds me of Claire Fisher in Six Feet Under.The dialogues in the novel are dramatically written. Perhaps someone may adopt it to a movie or a play. The narrative is so rich in details. Alan Hollinghurst has effectively woven homosexuality, class, AIDS and politics together. It reads like a Dickens' novel, but with more up-to-date issues that we should care more about."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"It's the very British-ness of this book that might put some people off. The characters are so reserved they often speak single words and rarely more than a sentence. It's up to the author to describe the nuance and subtlety behind each \\"um\\" or \\"really,\\" and Hollinghurst is a master of nuance, though his language at times seems almost preciously English (do they really talk like this?) At first the novel wanders somewhat aimlessly, yet I found myself drawn into it, as Hollinghurst creates a world as mannered and alien as that of a prior century. The pieces all come together in the end, and while I've had my ups and downs with Hollinghurst, this one is definitely worthy of the praise it has received. A particular time and place are brought to life through a cast of what are, really, rather colorless characters who only reveal themselves at the end. A remarkable achievement."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Alan Hollinghurst has consistently written intelligent and sensual novels (\\"The Swimming Pool Library\\", \\"The Folding Star\\" and \\"The Spell\\") that have found a readership that crosses over from his initial audience of readers of Gay fiction to the audience of readers who simply appreciate fine literature. And with THE LINE OF BEAUTY his merits have been rewarded not only by the acclaimed Booker Award, but also by a rather phenomenal presale demand. Hollinghurst is simply one of the best of the current writers.THE LINE OF BEAUTY is more than a finely tuned story about class differences, the foibles of the wealthy and ruling class of England, the hypocrisy of the Thatcher era in the 1980s, the recognition of the media watch dogs gobbling rumors about the government and the concurrent homophobia /rise of AIDS/druggie culture as seen through the proscenium arch of London. This book is very much a character study of one Nicholas Guest, a young middle class lad, graduate of Oxford, who (much like Ripley!) yearns for the luxuries of the wealthy and gentried such as Gerald and Rachel Fedden who live in a mansion in Notting Hill with their troubled (read 'speaks her mind') daughter Catherine and son Toby, the object of gay Nicholas' infatuation since their shared years at Oxford.The novel follows Nick's absorption into the Fedden family, being accepted as an aesthete, his first same sex affair with a handsome black clerk whom he encounters through a personal ad in the gay rag, his dalliances with the famous (including Margaret Thatcher herself), with a millionaire closeted playboy Wani who introduces him to drugs and more, and with creating a magazine with Wani which is the pinnacle of glossy aesthetics cum hoity toity. The various characters in this 'rake's progress' remain threaded through this story until all of the misguided judgments and turns of fate crumble Nick's world of fantasy.Yet as if this strong and fascinating story weren't enough, it is Hollinghurst's intelligence and writing style that mesmerize. He has the ability to begin phases of his tale with peripheral information that causes the reader to wonder exactly where he is taking us: he creates a stage setting with scenery and props that must be in place before the first character speaks the lines that define so cogently where the author has arrived. His quality of prose is exquisite both in describing the beauty seen and imagined and the 'squalor' intermittently encountered. He fleshes out each of his characters with such skill that we feel inside their heads even before they speak their lines.If there is a flaw in this tome it is a minor one: unless the reader is a thorough-going anglophile or has lived in some part of the UK, the various aspects of class distinction and governmental abbreviations require a bit of stalling to decipher. But then what is reading all about, if not for pleasure and for edification? THE LINE OF BEAUTY is a brilliant novel by a gifted writer and deserves the attention of everyone who loves great books.

Brilliant capture of a time capsule of a place, person, time, and fleeting roar of British life in London during a popular era."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"This book has two major themes: Homosexuality and the author as an observer of the \\"Me Decade\\" of the 1980's.The narrator has been out of the closet since being at Oxford. However, he does not have any homosexual sexual experience until he answers a personal ad. The first year recounted by him (1983) is filled with his first date/sex and his obsession with sex. He cannot go to a dinner party without checking out the \\"equipment\\" of every male there. Sexually he was like a horny 14 year old. It got old pretty fast and would have even if written in a heterosexual voice. During this period he has just started rooming in the house of the family of a rich college friend (with whom, of course, he is enraptured). He begins to observe the family which segways into the following years.The remaining years recounted - later in eighties - surround observing this family and their \\"power\\" contacts as they try to amass greater wealth and influence. The son who tried journalism, gave it up to go after riches. The father is elected to Parliament with virtually no sentiment towards his constituency, only the thirst for power. He hitches his star to M. Thatcher while still not letting go of the pursuit of the almighty pound. The son breaks an engagement with the daughter of a huge mogul who eventually takes the father down financially. Later, the daughter - who is always fighting depression - takes the rest of the family down by publicizing less than savory affairs. The only nearly likeable character is the uncle who got all his wealth the old fashioned way - he inherited it.Throughout the last years, the narrator, who continues graduate studies, has an affair with an enormously rich college friend who supports him and gives him a gift of cash - which, of course, he invests, so he too can get in on the riches of the eighties.In the end, as the family is crumbling in and on the narrator, we learn that his first lover has died of AIDS and his current lover is dying of it as well.This novel is a long indictment of the \\"me only\\" eighties. The narrator is a terrific observer who also gives us a view from the homosexual side of the street. There are a few homosexual sex scenes in the book. They are not overly graphic and would not bear comment were they scenes of heterosexual acts with the same level of graphic content.There is not much uplifting about the book. It takes a stark and dim view of the power and riches seeking of the decade. That was its strongest aspect. It also takes what I would say is a very realistic view of homosexuality. The author/narrator does not glorify nor villify it; he merely accepts it as a matter of fact. The quick view of AIDS condemns loose sexual lifestyles.I found the writing to be a bit overdone at times. I can not say I particularly liked any character nor sympathized with the narrator. Although primarily an observer, he too was rapt in himself.Frankly, I do not know why this book one the Booker prize. I think there could have been some PC voting because of the frank and open observations of the homosexual lifestyle by an openly gay character.Not a great book, not a bad book, but I would not have given it any prizes."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"As a reader, I was overjoyed to hear about Hollinghurst's new book, The Line of Beauty, especially after savoring his last three novels. But from the moment I met Nick Guest (how droll to name him after Nick Carraway), I disliked him, the world the author created, and everything about this book. Okay, so it's a look into an England of old, full of cocaine, fast cars, the superficiality of a world twenty years gone. But who cares? It's been done before and done much better. As satire (which I don't think it is because its tone is far too precious), it fails and as a strict, traditional novel, it's a bore. Come on, people! There are a hundred better books out there written on the subject of beauty and loss: The Great Gatsby, I Look Divine, Dancer From The Dance, Giovanni's Room, Most of us Are Here Against Our Will. Hollinghurst is a terrific writer, his sentences are clean and illuminating, but for me, and just for me, apparently, the novel never ever transcends its intentions. And that's because not one of the characters is interesting in an unusual or unique way. We've met them all, in one form or another, in just about every other purely English-style novel ever written. Compared to Isabel Archer, Nick Guest is ludicriously simplistic and so very transparent in his motives and wants that watching him move through this arch, camp world is painful, not because the character of Nick elicits pain but because of the writing itself. Nick isn't alive, none of the characters are for that matter. They're manipulated through the book by an author who, to his credit, gave us one of the most stunning (gay) books in literature and who, unfortunately, couldn't quite pull this one off. Had The Line of Beauty been his first book, I'm not sure we ever would've heard from Alan Hollinghurst again."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Nick Guest looked for Gerald Fedden's picture among the new Tory MP's. Nick was staying at Kensington Park Gardens. Toby and Catherine Fedden are brother and sister. Toby liked displaying his rower's body. It was Catherine's house, but it was Nick who was in charge while Gerald and his wife Rachel were away. Nick is actually the lodger of the Feddens. There was a burglary. Catherine didn't want Nick to report it. When Gerald and Rachel returned the house seemed crowded. When any homosexual subject came up Nick was embarassed.Nick had not read any Trollope, but he attempted to discuss the author knowlingly with Rachel's brother, Lord Kessler. Nick is a Henry James man. The world of Catherine and Toby's Uncle Lionel (Kessler)is described as a looking glass world, one to which Nick doesn't belong naturally. A number of Nick's schoolmates and a man he knew, Pat Grayson, are present at Hawkswood, Lionel Kessler's stately home. Nick's friend Leo compares Gerald Fedden to someone on the telly.When Toby and his fiancee, Sophie Tipper, are seen by Leo Charles and Nick, Nick makes the introductions. He is hoping to impress Leo with his life at Kensington Park Gardens. Nick is asked how he is getting on at University College London. Three years hence, in the book's next section, Nick's counter party is Wani, a Lebanese businessman. Wani has his own film production company. He, like Toby Fedden, was a schoolmate of Nick's. Nick is discrete about his own interests and the interests of others pursuant, perhaps, to his desire to fit in. The final section of the book takes place in 1987.The theme of the book, loving and longing, is brought out in splendid fashion. This is social history. The story is daring, contemporary, realistic. The writing is clear, precise. There is nothing this author can't do. Is he another Evelyn Waugh, one wonders."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I must admit I've never reviewed a book mid-way before. I just had to pause and relate my experience with this for a moment. I'm finding it quite tedious. Perhaps it's simply over my head, as a wholly American girl, but a lot of the themes and references are British through and through. The same sense of dry humor and caustic wit that is typical of English theater is clearly evident here. There is no doubt that it is well written, but I simply haven't yet fallen in love with the characters. Nor have I any idea what the plot actually IS yet. In the first few chapters, we are treated with an explicit gay sex scene. If this is not your cup of tea, then definitely don't buy this book. Oddly, I found this part to be interesting... maybe it's because it's a world with which I am decidedly unfamiliar. I plan to wade through the rest of it, and I hope that it picks up. I'll update my review at that time."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"Here is what moved me about Hollinghurst's work: The author creates, and sustains, a world of beauty only to lead a reader to abrupt (indeed, brutal) ugliness. For weeks after putting this down, I debated with myself how the main character, Nick, would lead his life after the final page.I still don't have an answer.In many ways, this was a shocking reading experience for me as I was lulled by the author's beautiful prose and craftsmanship (simply put, there are few authors who construct sentences and settings as well as Hollinghurst) before being hit by the final few pages. I left the book pondering questions of how individuals perceive reality, why they choose to surround themselves with certain individuals, and how individuals evaluate the truths and lies about themselves. The book doesn't provide answers -- and I can't either -- however, I have to admire the author for bringing the questions to the surface in such an amazing way."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"This book is exceptional and extraordinary in every regard.

Set in the high-class 80s London world, the novel offers characters you will love to hate. These are very complicated people, filling an even more complicated narrative.Nick Guest has just moved in with the Tippers, the parents of Toby, one of his best college friends. The head of the household, Gerald, holds a job in the Parliament, while his wife, Rachel, seems to be just another unhappy blue-blood wife. Their daughter, Cat, is highly excitable and very tourmented. She doesn't want to be part of the life she's leading, while also loving the chances and opportunities she's been given.Nick is the narrator of the Tipper's life, as well as his own. Never impartial, Nick is the ever-present boy who loves to watch the defeat of others. The fact that nick is always on the prowl, finding romance in different places (like Leonard, his first love, or Wani, the son of a very, very successful and rich businessman) only adds and edge to his character. As the 80s pass him by, he will be faced with one drama after another, whether it be about his own personal life or about the AIDS epidemic that is slowly ravaging London's gay community.Nick is the character you will love to hate and hate to love. You never truly understand him, yet his story always makes you hungry for more. It's very hard to put this one down.Hollinghurst has written a novel that is at times bitingly funny, at times incredibly sad. This dichotomy helps make A Line of Beauty the very exciting read that it is. Never too complicated for the reader's own good, but never too simple to make you want to put this one down. A Line of Beauty is a very rare literary novel that you can truly enjoy."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"i liken this book to fitzgerald's \\"tender is the night.\\" and that is not a good thing. people of no substance plod through hundreds of dull dull pages. are people really this shallow? this empty? probably. but, my god, do i have to read about them? no. i do not. i simply could not finish this book (and that is rare). i wasted valuble reading time for about 300 pages, then had to admit it just wasn't working. because of all the critical acclaim this book recieved, i was very much looking forward to reading it. what a major disappointment! i am truly puzzled by the positive response this thing gets from so many people. great writing? really? i just did not see much of that here. shouldn't a book have at least one interesting character in it? it seems that dullness is making a comback in critical circles these days. too bad."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"the reason that i label this book an interesting read is the fact that as a person of 24 yrs old i cannot directly relate to the time period this book takes place in. also not to mention the fact that i am not english and i have no idea the type atmosphere the thatcher era england blanketed over england. but there was something about this book that kept me reading. although i was very young when this book is going on it is interesting to see the type of goings on in this time period. you have the main character of nick, a young twenty-something fresh out of oxford and living with a class mate and his family. he is a virgin and a person who still holds onto his innocence. he has an ongoing crush on his friend toby and is really good friends with toby's sister catherine. the parents gerald and rachel fedden in a way accept him as one of their own children and expose him to a totally different world than he is accustomed to because he does not come from the same upper class as the feddens. nick comes into contact with his first real love through a relationship add, his name is leo and the two of them really hit it off. through leo's character the subject of aids comes into play through an ex of leo who is introduced to nick. although the word aids is never said at this point anyone in this day and age can put together the affliction affecting the character of pete. then the book jumps ahead a couple of years and nick has started to settle nicely into his homosexuality and has a boyfriend who was also a class mate at oxford, wani. with the character of wani you see the world of the rich and powerful and the \\"luxuries\\" that come along with wealth. by luxury i am referring to the rampant use of cocaine in the 80s. it seems that in every chapter nick and wani are off together doing a \\"line of beauty\\" at some party or an intimate moment. there is a lot more that goes on in the novel at the end but i would not want to ruin anymore of the story. but this book does go into a lot of detail and at times i felt that the detail was a little too much. there is a lot of description of the setting and the buildings and the inside of the buildings almost to the point of personification. the whole setting was a character in itself. and for some parts of the novel it seemed appropriate and then in others it seemed like extra words. every once in a while hollinghurst will sneak in a sex scene and personally i found every one of them quite erotic and well written. i like the fact that all the scenes were not hardcore sex but more about the subtleness of the situation, they were not over powering but they were effective nonetheless. he is also quite the tease especially in one scene between nick and toby. read it for yourself because personally i found myself glued to the page and my mind reeling with all sorts of scenarios. this type of tease is what also makes this nove intersting and drives the reader to continue reading. i really liked this book and found myself just intrigued by how much the world has changed in the last twenty years but also seeing that there are some things that are still the same. like i said this book is intersting and will keep the reader wanting a little more with each chapter."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"After finally finishing this book, I am very surprised that it won a prize. The first several hundred pages have the main character (Nick Guest) doing little more than having sex, fantasizing about having sex with every other male character (major or minor), or wondering if anyone else can guess that he's fantasizing about sex.Perhaps it would be a better read for someone British, because I found it hard to appreciate the depiction of life in the British aristocracy. The character development felt very heavy-handed and repetitive, as one scene after another depicted Nick feeling embarrassed or trying to figure out how to handle a social situation.The end of the book was much more rewarding, as the web of characters unravelled and their pretensions were stripped away. I also enjoyed some clever Henry James references. Still, I don't think the investment it takes to slog through the beginning is worth it overall."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"I didn't buy my copy off amazon but at the Pan bookshop in the Fulham road where I got an autographed first edition. It'll have good re-sale value. That's the best I can say about it. Alan Hollinghurst has already proven that he can write, but I was expecting something with alot more depth to it than this. Especially as the Booker judges had rewarded him for it. If you think the BBC adaptation was just giving you a taste of what you'll find in the novel, then you'll be disappointed as there is not much more to the book than was put on screen.Nick Guest, the novel's central protagonist, moves to London to work at UCL and accepts accomodation from the family of his friend Toby Fedden. Despite Nick and Toby being such good friends Nick has never been to Toby's family home before the novel starts. Nick has a brief relationship with Leo Charles. Leo Charles introduces Nick to a friend of his,Pete, who owned an antique shop and this plot strand ends abruptly as though it was a half thought out idea. I was hoping Leo's family and friends would be drawn more vividly to get us out of the claustrophobia and boredome of the Fedden family home. There's the crux of it. The characters , and what they do here are very boring. It's very dull.There is a narrowness to the London that Alan depicts. Here he rarely leaves the Fedden's place in Notting Hill, and the variety and changing social status of that area during the period is not described. I know from reading 'The Swimming Pool Library's innacurate description of walking from Mile End to St.Anne's Limehouse that Mr.Hollinghurst's knowledge of London is sketchy at best (he'd get lost east of the City without a guide, and he probably doesn't realise that south of the river is inhabited) but it is irksome to read a novel set in a city you know well and finding it so poorly represented. You need to get out more, Alan. Try again."},{"Title":"The Line of Beauty: A Novel","review":"In 1988, British gay novelist Alan Hollinghurst made a striking debut with \\"The Swimming Pool Library.\\" Set in the Darwinian landscape of pre-AIDS homo London, the writing was beautiful and urgent, flaring at times to real poetry, while the characters exerted the pull of infatuation. I reached the end of that book resenting the forced separation and wanting to hang out with the whole lot for a lot longer.Since then, each subsequent Hollinghurst novel has been more disappointing than the last. In the latest, \\"The Line of Beauty,\\" his literary go-cart has come nearly to a halt. The writing is still elegant, studded with memorable turns, but the story is utterly without consequence, ditto the characters. Is Hollinghurst writing or doing his nails?

Good writers know that even if you're creating a shallow character and and even a shallow era he or she should be interesting, have edges, etc. The set-piece: the party near the end is great. The last section felt manipulative. Well, he's still a good writer and I'll surely give his next book a read. As to he Booker's.

Thats all there is. No plot, no suspense, no conflict, no characterization, no development of anything--you could shuffle the chapters and it would make no difference in either the novel's outcome or rampant boredom. It is simply a litany of shallow upper class stereotypes making prissy comments about the insignificant concerns in their lives--i.e. a character's \\"confusingly firm buttocks ... set off by his tight Fred Perry shorts.\\" That's about the depth of character insight one gets in this novel.

I found the 1 chapter on little boys in RAISING CAIN much more useful to understanding what my 4-year-old son is going through than this whole book. She is a strong believer in holdling boys back a year from Kindergarten. If you are looking for arguments for keeping your son back, this book may be what you are looking for.

There's nothing wrong with playing, jumping, running and having fun. Let boys be boys, and let us raise them to be men.

It has so many funny things that happen to Henry, Beezus, and Ramona that you cannot wait to read what happens next. Now I am going to tell you a little about this book. It is about a boy, Henry, who wants a new bicycle. His parents cannot afford to buy him one so he decides to find a way to get the money himself. If you want to know how he gets the money you will have to read the book. But don't think that reading a book about a boy that gets money to get a bike is boring. In this book Beverly Cleary makes it so much more interesting. So if you want a book that you can read that will bring the kid side out of you again, read Henry and Beezus by Beverly Cleary."},{"Title":"Henry and Beezus","review":"Oh how we love Henry Huggins! My daughter (age 8) just adores these books! Our most recent read, Henry and Beezus didn't disappoint. Told in the same chapter style as the previous books, we start out with Henry and is dog getting into more trouble...this time with the neighbors and their roast and where Henry swears to his friends that he'll have a bike as nice as Scooter's. From there we follow Henry on a raccous, fun-filled set of adventures which involve him striking gum gold, untraining Ribsy to fetch the paper (hileraious), a dog and his parking ticket, an awesome and funny bike auction, and finally the boy who ate dog food! In this group of stories, Ramona and her sister are also key players in each adventure and they lend a nice touch to this particular set of stories. Will Henry get that spiffy red bike he's got his eye on? Will he ever save enough money...or will Ribsy and Ramona \\"help\\" him right out of his chance to get it? Since this story, like others in the series, was written in the 1950's, it has a dated \\"leave it to beaver\\" feel...but that's also a great deal of the charm. They are clean cut, the kid's respet their parents and take their problems to them...and whey they get in trouble, even though they somtiems lie...there is always discussion and rational solving of the issues. I like that and apparently so does my daughter. I give it an A+, another classic that is sure to keep right on pleasing kids for years to come!"},{"Title":"Henry and Beezus","review":"Are you bored of mystery books? Well, get Henry and Beezus.

I know, I bought it. Look closely at the photo and you can see that this is true. If you want the book, I recommend the beautiful &quot;library binding&quot; hardcover. Strip off the dustjacket, and find a perfectly faithful reproduction of the 1950s original. Henry and Beezus is my favorite of all the Beverly Cleary books. My three kids love it. It's the kind of children's book they just don't make anymore. Like Encyclopedia Brown, and other traditional American heroes of his ilk, Henry Huggins is great kid, friendly, kind, just, responsible, bright, and forgiving. He's short on cash at the moment, and can't afford a bike like the other kid on the block, but Henry displays a naturally independent spirit and even----hold your breath----entrepreneurial initiative. He persists in all that he endeavors, rolling with the punches, and shrugging off life's little humiliations, even as they sting inside. He's all the things that made America great, but that seem (let's face it) to have gone out of fashion in this whiny New Age of anti-capitalist political correctness.

His proposed cure is very interesting.I would strongly recommend this book to any lawyer--active or retired, prospective lawyer and most of all to anyone who has had the misfortune of being a child, spouse or lover of a lawyer.Mr. Bennett's book should be required reading for pre-law students to give them a chance to rethink their career goals before it is too late to change.GOOD WILL WIN IN THE END"},{"Title":"Steep Ascent","review":"I have read 6 on Ann's books and this one is her first novel.

Kyle's course presents the material, from basic to fairly advanced, in very clear fashion; you watch a movie version of the flash interface, and see the cursor move through it; the quicktime movies let you see exactly what she's doing while you listen to her narrate her moves every step of the way. (You even see her make the odd mistake, which she then shows you how to undo.) Her approach to workflow (which she hardly mentions but nevertheless constantly exemplifies) is a really valuable aspect of the course.I was immediately able to make a couple of my own reasonably complex flash spots and felt very confident doing so; previously I've had to constantly refer to books, and made lots of frustrating mistakes as I went along. I now feel able to actually utilize the various tools and techniques taught by Kyle, and to go beyond the specifics of the course to do my own work. I'm also in a position to understand some of the more complex stuff in other books I own, and put it to use.Two recommendations: I'd suggest copying the entire CD-Rom to your hard drive, and running set-up from there; this avoids having to run the course from your CD-Rom drive, which may slow down the quicktime presentations. Second, I went through the entire course once just watching and listening, and then again while doing all the exercises; I think this made the process more effective.The 140 page workbook described in the publisher's review does not come with the course; the workbook you get is just a brief outline of each lesson with lots of blank space for your notes. But it doesn't matter: Kyle's presentation is very effective, and the online text that is included is a valuable, well-written resource. This was a very worthwhile investment and I'm glad I made it."},{"Title":"Lynn Kyle's Macromedia Flash Training Course: A Digital Seminar on CD-ROM","review":"i had some familiarity with flash b4 purchasing this.. like what can be done with each panel, as well as knowing exactly which menu would contain a certain task option.the strength of this cd-rom training is in the workflow experience you'll get. it may seem slightly complex at first, but eventually you'll learn to grasp the point.the weakness of this cd is that despite the fact that i'm not a flash expert, during many of her executed sequences, even i knew she didn't seem to know what she was doing at times(a sign that when they made this quicktime video recording, it wasn't planned out or practiced).

I felt that the authors were incorrect (at least in their explanations) about some of the key points of taoist philosophy, and one of the authors gives his own translation of the first verse of the Tao Te Ching which I also found to be off-base. The back cover also promises &quot;in-depth&quot; information on tai chi and the I Ching, yet the book actually only gives brief information on these subjects -- in fact, INSIDE the book it says &quot;Here's a brief overview&quot; -- no in-depth information. To make matters worse, the section on the I Ching contrasts the methods of eastern divination versus western divination, but the example it gives of a question in eastern divination is INCOMPATIBLE with the I Ching, suggesting an infamiliarity with it.While the back cover was probably written by the publisher and not the authors (it even mentions &quot;ying-yang&quot; instead of the correct &quot;yin-yang&quot;), the material inside the book is what counts. But because of the faults I mentioned with the material inside, I found myself taking everything else I read in the book with a grain of salt because I was unsure of its accuracy. And while it does provide some information on the history of taoism, chinese dynasties, and taoist religion, I'm concerned that this book would mislead those new to taoism.If you are new to taoism and would like to learn more, I recommend picking up a good translation of the Tao Te Ching and starting there. &quot;Tao Te Ching: The Definitive Translation&quot; by Jonathan Star is my personal favorite translation because it includes a verbatim, word-for-word translation of the text. Also recommended is the translation by Brian Browne Walker."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Taoism","review":"This book was my introduction to Taoism, and I am deeply grateful to the authors for writing such a splendid guide to the Way. /The Complete Idiot's Guide to Taoism/ starts out by working through the difficulties of defining &quot;Tao&quot; and introducing the reader to the works of Lao-Tzu and Chuang-Tzu, the two sages of Taoism. The book moves on to offer an overview of key Taoist concepts like wu-wei, de, the yin-yang polarity, etc. All of this is done in a relaxed, enjoyable manner, making for a quick and fun read.This /Idiot's Guide/ also has chapters on Taoist thoughts on nature, skill, and life and death. These chapters illuminate the Taoist perspective on many aspects of life, and do so a lot more effectively than a list of dry, fixed &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;shall not&quot; items would be able to. The book also includes some thought-provoking overviews of the links between Taoism and Christianity, modern physics, popular culture (i.e. The Matrix), and so forth.This book is not page after page of dogmatic rules on how you should or should not think, or should or should not live. Anyone looking for such things will be disappointed with /The Complete Idiot's Guide to Taoism/, and indeed Taoism itself. The authors went to great lengths to provide a cohesive intro to the history of Taoism, as well as the core ideas that make it a viable philosophy (or religion) to this day. I think the main goal when writing this book was to get the reader to actively *think* about life, and how traditional Taoist perspectives match up with the experiences of daily life.If you're up to the challenge of genuinely thinking about Taoism, and how it can be applied to all aspects of the world, this book will definitely satisfy you. As the authors say in their introduction, &quot;Think of /The Complete Idiot's Guide to Taoism/ as a flashlight; judge its effectiveness by what it helps you see more clearly as you make your own way along the path.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Taoism","review":"I was expecting a complete wishy-washy new-agey mosaic of pseudo-science, pseudo-history, pseudo-scholarship; but actually the scholarship and historical information in this book were pretty darn good.It's a good introduction to ancient Chinese philosophy, the context of Zhuangzi and Laozi. The philosophy isn't watered down too much, and fortunately (thanks no doubt to Chad Hansen's contribution) it's not mixed in with unrelated stuff from the Upanishads or anything like that.There is a misprint on the back, \\"ying-yang\\" which must be slang for the padding surrounding one's gluteus maximus; inside the book the spelling is correct. The explanation of yin-yang is also correct and simple.I would've wanted a lot more information on religious Taoism: information about modern movements and so on. Which deities are most commonly worshipped in Taiwan, which in Hong Kong, which in Beijing? And, how are they worshipped? I'd like information about Taoist pilgrimages, Taoist sacred places, and so on. The book doesn't touch any of that: minus one star.Also, the bit on quantum physics could be greatly, greatly improved. Maybe they could've asked a few grad students at a physics dep't for commentary? It would have greatly helped: minus one star.However, I just couldn't give the book 3 stars; the chapters on politics and ecology were surprisingly good, the internet links are too helpful, and as I said earlier the explanation of ancient Chinese philosophy was too good. So, maybe there's a little grade inflation here.In sum, it's a good introduction to Taoism, and it'll prepare you to move on to deeper stuff, and help you find it.If, like, you're already a Taoist immortal or something, this book isn't for you, and you can't really criticize it for that. I'd expect you to realize that already."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Taoism","review":"What a great book!

One does not need to be a historian to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Pretender (The Chaos Gate Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"This book is one of the few 'middle books' I've ever read that hasn't dropped the pace from the first book or served only as a mildly interesting prelude to the third. Fantasy trilogies tend to have a certain pace, I think, that I've gotten used to: setting the stage in the first book, holding it or slipping a little in the middle, and then bringing it all up fast and furious in the end. So I started _The Pretender_ with fairly high expectations- I'd loved everything else by Louise Cooper that I'd read, and _The Deceiver_, the first book, was very good- but thinking that it would follow the same pattern as most everything else.I've never been so glad to be wrong._The Pretender_ has two main plots- one focused on happenings in the Star Peninsula and the Circle, the other on the Summer Isle in the south. Both have excellent scenes- especially near the end- and both are resolved (as much as plots in a middle book of a trilogy get resolved) beautifully. Without giving too much away, there are scenes where both the main characters in the book are in contact with more-than-mortal powers. Those scenes were the best, played out with awe and reverence as if the author had been there and wanted the audience to feel what she did.The writing maintains a level just below this for the rest of the book, and the character development fits the writing style extraordinarily well. At times- especially, it seems, in middle books of trilogies- I have had the feeling that the style the author uses for one character has influenced the style he or she uses for another, and they don't seem like separate people. In this case, they were. Every character had his or her own means of telling the story, dealing with fears and concerns (even when those concerns were similiar), and growing and building on what they were in _The Deceiver_ to what they must become.I didn't give this book five stars only because it isn't the best book by Louise Cooper that I've read. (That's _Star Ascendant_). But don't let that discourage you from reading it, or the rest of the trilogy. High marks, very much so."},{"Title":"The Pretender (The Chaos Gate Trilogy, Book 2)","review":"I liked this even more than the Time Master Trilogy; the characters have more personality, and the stakes are higher.

I found out about this book as a result of some interesting references to the work in another book, The Blank Slate by Stephen Pinker. After I started the book I began searching out information about the author whereby I was directed to his columns on political topics. Needless to say, I found his columns to be pure garbage. I often couldn't read past the first few paragraphs due to his obvious ability to lie and sham to serve his preordained opinion. Even people with much less intelligence than Mr Sowell could have shot down many of his points in these articles. Reading these articles almost made me put down the book. How could a man writing this much tripe put aside this dishonesty and idiocy on display and write something worth reading?Which brings me to the current work. This is actually an excellent book. While it suffers from repetition, and the writing style is a bit like that of a textbook, this was a good read. This man, who obviously has such a strong bias towards a \\"conservative\\" or \\"constrained\\" vision that his columns would reek of, 'lying for the cause', actually wrote an even-handed assessment of the two visions. While if I paid attention hard enough I could see a bias towards the constrained vision manifested as increased eloquence when his pet vision was discussed, this was quite small or perhaps my imagination.This book really allowed me to understand and even find common ground with people who are conservative or have a \\"constrained\\" vision. Often it appeared to me that these people were living in a completely ficticious reality, while it turns out that they just have a different vision of human nature. When conservatives say that allowing gay marriage would destroy traditional marriage, these words sound like a non-sequiter of the nature of the following, \\"not allowing prayer in schools will cause more mexican immigrants to sneak across the border\\". But this book actually helped me understand these strange comments and many more. Additionally, I found that it strengthened many of my own convictions by understanding the alternative. On some topics, I believe very strongly in the unconstrained vision as described here but in other ways my differences with those of the constrained vision is only a matter of degrees. I am still shocked that such an interesting and fair book could come out of a man like this. It would be like Rush Limbaugh giving a fair assessment of the differences between the presidencies of Clinton and G.W. Bush.The final chapter is the icing on the cake that is missing from our political discourse. He compares knowledge found in natural science to the lack of concrete knowledge found in social science and political discourse. There are answers to some of these political questions that can be deduced empirically, which are too often described as value judgements. Additionally, he describes how some people put up blinders towards changing their vision when new information comes to light. This book has left me open to many ideas and better able to understand the visions of both sides."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Yet another great book from a brilliant mind. Sowell should be required reading for upper high-school and college students."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"This is an insightful look by the renowned conservative historian and economist at George Mason University, Thomas Sowell. It probes the on-going cultural war of ideas between the Left and Right. I also recommend the Vision of the Annointed by Sowell and Intellectuals by Paul Johnson."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"I found this book useful for understanding why some people are Democrats while others are Republicans. I found Sowell descriptions of Republicans a little left of center (negative) for my liking.But, let me put my understanding in my own words...Why do some people vote Democrat while others vote Republican?It has to do with their different world visions...as Sowell points out!Imagine a malleable, clay sculpture of the Mona Lisa rendered with the same propinquity as the original painting by Leonardo da Vinci - except it's in 3D.The Republican would see the clay statue as a masterful expression of exquisite beauty and sheer genius, that has withstood the test of time, an exceptional expression for the ages, a model for the future, and uniquely worthy of preserving. The Republican would carefully and respectfully put the sculpture in an oven to protect and fix it's form.The Democrat (Progressive) would see the clay sculpture as still malleable, and would be foolish enough to think that he, using his (perceived) superior intellect, could render an even more masterful expression than da Vinci himself! Da Vinci would be seen by the Democrat as not in tune with modern times, and would be dismissed as irrelevant to the modern and evolving world.Now, substitute the \\"Constitution\\" for \\"clay sculpture\\" in the above scenario, ignore America's unique history and place in the world, and you have it - what makes some people Republicans and some people Democrats!Democrats (Progressives) ignore the uniqueness of America; believe Big Government is best for solving problems; distrust capitalism (in spite of the fact that it's the only model that's worked and is being emulated by world governments that previously embraced Communism); prefer to transfer power to an all knowing, all powerful central government that manages all aspects of life, commerce, education, taxing, justice, and social engineering...think of placing trust and allegiance in the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain - no transparenty there!!!They seem ignorant that this model has failed every time it was tried - Russia, China, East Berlin vs. West Berlin, Cuba, Eastern Bloc countries under the USSR's thumb, etc.! But, facts like these are dismissed, history is rewritten or ignored, and they are drawn to likeminded outlets that reinforce their prejudices.And their \\"model\\" is blind to its flaw...which I believe was purposefully ignored by its originators, since it didn't fit their theory: The Law of Unintended Consequences! Specifically, the self-interested capitalist creates jobs...that produces income and security for its employees...that enables them to provide for their families...and that all generates tax revenues for government which provides essentials for the town, county, state, and federal government. But, they only see the \\"evil\\", self-interested, risk-taking entrepreneur...not the benefits that pay for everything; yea, everything! And keep voting for the same tried-and-failed ideology.None is so blind as he who will not see.Anyway, the book made me think and crystallize my thinking...which is why the book is worth reading."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Sowell is a true intellectual. He is not afraid to go where his mind takes him. In this work he takes on his common peeve: social engineering. For Sowell nothing is worse than utopian minded do-gooders armed with inadequate knowledge of the subjects they pontificate on.

I enjoy reading his books. He is beyond pale."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Professor Sowell's essays always seem thoughtful, pack full of useful history, but invariably tinged with the gratuitously \\"rank\\" smell of ideological tampering. It is as if as a scholar he is congenitally incapable of being without the normal baggage of his not so well hidden conservative agenda always lurking menacingly in the background. And while this may be okay for pundits and other opinion-makers, even for academic dilettantes, it is decidedly unbecoming. To a sitting scholar in residence, it is a sign of being little more than a paid political hack.Here he is at it again, spewing his social scientific hucksterism, only this time, he covers his path very well indeed. Yet, his \\"constrained\\" Visions in these vignettes are little more than Trojan ideological Hobby Horses for him to ride into Dodge again as the \\"conservative champion on the white horse.\\" And for those who are already his ideological converts, his ride into town must seem like Wyatt Earp riding into Dodge all over again.But for those like myself, it is just a matter of again hunting down the illogic that allows Sowell to \\"sell us more of his conservative snake oil.\\" Once we have found Sowell's inevitable built-in conservative biases, his intellectual paper towers usually crumble with the slightest exposure to critical analysis. The same is true in this case of his \\"Conflict of Visions.\\"As usual, upon only cursory inspection, the framework he establishes seems sound enough to hold water. However, one deeper look at the built-in hidden assumptions, and voila, the conservative Trojan Horse in the background again reveals itself.It seems that the more general Sowell's theories are, the further back into his abstractions one must go to uncover his fatal hidden assumptions. In this case there are a number of them all waiting to be discovered. And as usual they all appear embedded in the framework as unexamined hidden assumptions. Since there are so many and they are embedded so deeply, I will restrict myself to just the three overriding ones.First, Professor Sowell invariably places his most sacred ideas in a fixed Procrustean bed, not to ever be tampered with. They are always constrained by his ideological needs, not by the logic of the social processes in question. The best example of these is his \\"fake dichotomy\\" of \\"constrained\\" versus \\"unconstrained\\" visions. None of his visions are ever seen as being dynamic and as moving over time. They are invariably fixed and immutable, never allowed to breathe, grow or improve, only the \\"unconstrained visions\\" possess this quality.Second, he attributes both a moral innocence to all his ideas even when this is neither warranted nor true, thus allowing him to give an undeserved \\"moral equivalence\\" to good and his (usually) bad ideas. Third, just as he is constantly moving the moral frame around so that the best moral light is always shed on his own \\"pet\\" ideas, he also does the same thing for the cultural frames. Often, as he does in the case of \\"Visions\\" he moves the two frames in tandem so that they are constantly complimenting each other, hiding whatever needs to be hidden. These are sometimes very subtle tricks, but are tricks nonetheless.As but one example that is the leitmotif of this piece is the example that appear in the diagram on page 27. Here he raises the missing cell in the matrix (the unintentional but beneficial) to the moral equivalent of the cell above it: the intentional and beneficial; and in fact denigrates the latter as being impossible to achieve because it is dynamic. His argument is taken from Hobbes: that it is in man's nature to be selfish and thus also self-destructive. What is thus implied is that the Hobbesian worldview is the best we can hope for from nature? Therefore justifying a world that is an orgy of mean-spiritedness, greed and lack of compassion, etc. But this old Ayn Rand canard is to be found everywhere in the Libertarian playbook. It is nothing new and should not be raised to the level of an immutable social process. And even if it were so, who is to say it cannot be changed?Fine, giving him the benefit of the doubt despite the shakiness of his hypothesis, Sowell would not be the first or the last to come to the conclusion that the world is primarily still Hobbesian. However, to place this social fact on the same moral plane with \\"conscious attempts to improve Hobbes' world\\" is to introduce a moral sleight of hand that is a bridge too far. And while it is true that so far man has not proven Sowell to be wrong, Sowell's \\"unconstrained world of visions\\" remains open-ended and morally superior to that of his ideological \\"cut Buddy\\" Ayn Rand's, whose whole rasion d'etre is that mean-spirited, greed and selfishness are the moral equivalent of those who seek the moral and social improvement of man.As usual Sowell and Rand take the moral high ground by intellectual fiat.Arguably, if one takes fully into account, these not so carefully tucked away built-in hidden assumptions Sowell's intellectual musings turn into so much \\"fairy dust.\\" I recognize that the author is a good student of history and a decent economist, but like Ayn Rand, he is a horrible Social Scientist.

That aside, I think some of his books (such as Black Rednecks...) are compelling and useful debate-fuel, this one falls flat. Like anyone adhering to a specific political mindset (and he does - his brilliance is that he can conceal it well, though I would question his objectivity) he believes himself to be right - it's indicated in word usage whenever he touches on the \\"traditional\\" left/right debate, etc. The basic premise is, astoundingly, a reiteration of the title. Ideological Origins of Political Struggles? It sounds like a desperately pretentious college paper written by an undergrad looking for Political Science recognition. Imagine that politics - which, if you believe Hanna Arendt's thesis on the subject as outlined in On Revolution, is the process of human interaction and debate - has ideological origins? Astounding, truly. I could have never put that sort of logic together on my own. You'll have to pardon my sarcasm - the book is well written and thoughtful - but it told me something I already knew.

First, Sowell in this book promises to construct and teach to the reader a simple mental device that allows the reader to reduce a vast, nuanced, complex world of ideas to a single, binary heuristic device that is simple enough that a precocious 12 year old could learn it. This is the academic political theory equivalent of watching Sean Hannity or Glenn Beck on television. This is a book about how to learn to see the world in black and white, us and them, liberal and conservative, utopian and tragic. It gives the reader a set of simple tools that are powerful in that they can be applied to most of history and political and social theory. It is a reductionist dualism that is at the heart of contemporary Republican politics in the United States of America and that defines the zeitgeist of the post-1994 Republican Party in American politics.

I cannot imagine that those who gave low rating made it past the dust jacket, if they even touched the book in the first place. My intent is to give a brief overview without wasting your time by trying to write a condensed version of Sowell's work.This book is a great exposition of theories that have been prominent (at least in the academic world) and clearly articulated and argued over the last couple hundred years. The many references range from Hume and Rousseau to the currently living Dawkins. Sowell sets out to make a rough dichotomy of almost all works on the philosophy of economics and law (admitting that his model, like all models, does not encompass all detail). The paradigm he establishes is a useful tool through which one can distil the political and societal debates of today down to their core components and then group with the more clearly articulated thinkers Sowell references. Being able to get to the heart of the confused and unclear arguments most people make will assist you in being able to recognize the core of what is really being said.This is primarily a sort of very specialized encyclopedia on economic, legal, and political thought. Sure, Sowell does make his judgment on how he groups thinkers, but you read this book as a guide to very abstruse and uncommon works; his considerable knowledge of various works and effort in writing this book are what allow you the shortcut to your own greater understanding. I would be very surprised if those he groups on the side opposite him would object to his classification. Those hoping to cheer or criticize this book for being a polemical hit-job will be more satisfied elsewhere."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"This book requires a little more intellectual focus than most of Sowell's easy-to-read books, but is worth the effort.

HallThe Coming Collapse of the American Republic"},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":". Concerns with Public Unions and entitlement burdens on our nation, Islamic revolution, multicultural political correctness and the national nullism it leads to--these have captured my thoughts of late. However, since reading the book A Conflict of Visions, by Thomas Sowell, my interest in conservative political matters has really been spurred. It really explains why people take a solid conservative or liberal stance.Why do Republican and Democrat find it so difficult to find common ground on social and economic issues? I know it absurd to believe they could play beautiful music together, but why not just a little harmony, a trace of counterpoint, a brief simple tune within a shouting distance. To be sure, not even a simple tune together is possible, and the only sound heard, presently, are the ideological vibes that crescendo in political dissonance. At this moment, the differences between them have grown ever more drastic in clashing political struggle.In Thomas Sowell's A Conflict of Visions, one hits his thesis quickly and the answer to this political struggle: conservative or liberal tendencies depend on one's gut feelings about the nature of human beings and how the human world works. Reality, in all its complexity, makes this gut feeling--this worldview--necessary to help simplify, discard and select. Picture a sieve filtering, straining, and collecting the desired contents from the heavy boiling pot of what we know and understand in the psycho-socio-politico realm. Theory and facts are gathered, interpreted, applied, and built logically from this worldview --referred to as a constrained vision and unconstrained vision by Sowell. Where man wrestles with an unsolvable predicament-- hindered by his nature and moral limitations, we see a constrained vision; where man is seen as changeable, perfectible, and his societal problems solvable, we have the unconstrained vision.Although well known hybrid visions are touched upon in his book, (for instance, Marxian doctrine contains constrain elements in man's early history) the comparison and contrast of the pure constrained and unconstrained is his primary focus, and without giving away bias--he is a well known author and apologist for conservative viewpoints--a balanced, clear comparison is given so the reader can determine which vision is most correct. Heavily referencing the words of William Godwin and Antoine-Nicolas Condorcet for the unconstrained position and Edmund Burke, Adam Smith and Friedrich Hayek for the constrained vision, Thomas Sowell details the beliefs of each.The Constrained Vision Position:* Man is a selfish and violent creature with moral limitations, and this nature has persisted , unchangeable, throughout his existence* Because of human nature--with needs, desires, and evil temptations unchangeable--tradition is important while political and legal laws remain relevant to present and future; so, contracts, written constitutions, and established legal precedent must remain binding and upheld--changes are measured and done within process rules* Man needs complex socio-political and economic systems based on self interest, competition and cooperation (there are non-zero sum games played in an essentially zero-sum world) where incentives assist in making the most out of human limitations* There are no solutions to social ill as social processes are too complex to overcome; there are only acceptable tradeoffs possible* Social benefit is the unintended consequence of self-interest--a product of the evolved competitive social process* No man of genius or group of elite can make changes outside the established system* Efficiency and stableness of the evolved social, political, economic system is more important than the happiness of all (though devoutly wished)* Along with man's self interests goes the centrality of his family. If he and his family are granted self-reliance, freedom and liberty within a stable and well established country, it is reasonable to extend, to a fair degree, the centrality of family to include that country and to cherish and value it. Thus, such words as patriotism and treason are very meaningful, and one can believe that their country is exceptional.The Unconstrained Vision Position:* Man possesses unlimited potential* Man is a naturally good and noble creature only corrupted and spoiled by an evil society: a product of the self-interest incentives within the competitive socio-economic system* Benefiting others is a human virtue that can be more important than the individual's self-interest. This benefiting of others is universal with no national boundaries. (As \\"we are the world\\") Sincerity in benefiting others will lead to human happiness.* Man is capable of intentionally creating social benefit. It can be designed into a social and economic system* Man will eventually want to do the right thing: create a just and equal society for the benefit of all. Incentives are not necessary; they can only spoil and corrupt* Human nature, knowledge and situation changes with the time, and established rules and ways of yesterday cannot be adequate for present or future times* Private Judgment should be unfettered; so loyalty, oaths of fidelity (including marriage) constitutions, and patriotism should have limited importance or ready negotiability. They are constrictions imposed earlier when knowledge and situation differed.* Solution and results are always possible; they should supersede trade offs* Solutions can be engineered by experts or those who approach closer to man's perfected future state. There can be a Great Leader. Presently, there are the elite to whom the malleable masses must depend--self-reliance is down played--they know best* Process costs to achieve ends is of secondary importance, and it can become necessary to make drastic change even if it means the complete crumbling of the social system and revolution(Stability is a distraction to the revolutionary)Again, Thomas Sowell shows no bias while giving the details, but most people reading this book begin with an ideological bent skewed toward one of these two visions; and they, most likely, will remain unmoved at reaching the book's end. One is dealing with cherished beliefs (often sacred) rooted on gut feelings and such are held with stout resistance.Nevertheless--even putting aside the findings of biology and game theory that support the constrained vision without question--the examined positions superimposed on the historical facts of a tumultuous world history, support those holding the constrained vision. What is needed is a comparison over a given swath of time between a country developed under a constrained vision with one designed under the unconstrained vision. As it happens, the United States represents the former case; the socialist world at large, the latter. Since the end of the Articles of Confederation some 224 year ago, the United States has grown and flourished with a history bold and storied, and with distinctive democratic institutions that are presently firm. With the accuracy and worthiness of their work manifestly visible, it is easy giving credit to the founding fathers, the writers of the Federalist Papers, and the framers of the United States Constitution. Surprising to many, however, is that nearly all these individuals were persuaded by the tragic (constrained) worldview.In contrast, over this time, one sees a disastrous track record of Utopian Communities, Marxist-Leninists regimes, National Socialist and other Non-Marxist Socialist nations molded on an unconstrained vision structure. \\"Reign of Terror,\\" \\"The Final Solution,\\" \\"Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolution,\\" \\"The Killing Fields\\"--these phrases are associated with atrocious events and they are products of the unconstrained World view.Sowell's book is a stimulating read, despite the abstract subject, and--with an informative Notes Section--encourages the reader toward further excursions into this interesting topic."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Mr Sowell had produced a masterpiece. He avoids buzz words and changes the words liberal and conservative to neutral terms. He then closely examines the foundational differences between the two opposing philosophies. Mr Sowell manages to do all of this in understandable terms.What makes A Conflict of Visions so good is the author exposes the major unstated assumptions made by each side. He does not criticise either position, he just sets out to explain the deepest roots of each position and trace it to the modern world. The author never makes a judgemental statement. Philosophy doesn't get any better than this.If anyone is trying to understand political philosophy, or modern politics this is a must read. Mr. Sowell tells the reader how the same terms (what is fair for example) are thought of in totally different ways by the differing positions. This is why the opposing sides talk past one another. They both use the same terms but never define them - they just assume the other side means the same thing by fairness (or whatever) as they do, when in fact the meaning of what is fair differ completely from the points of view of the philosophies.One quick example: When side A says something is fair they mean the system was fair and all people had the same basic chance; however, when side B says something is fair they mean the RESULTS were fair. Side A doesn't mind if the results seem unfair as long as the system was fair, but even if side B thinks the system was fair, if the results are unfair (in their mind) then the whole thing is unfair and must be adjusted.Thus, when one group of people are poor and another rich side A is OK with that as long as the system for getting poor or rich was basically fair; however, side B feels that if the finances are unequally distributed then it is unfair because the RESULTS are unfair.So when the A side is arguing with the B side and both are yelling about fairness they see fairness in totally different ways and are arguing past one another.A wonderful book, at a good price.

You have to wonder why people keep arguing over the same facts. It's objective, so it's not threatening to people of either vision to read, though in looking at it my conclusion is that the view opposite mine is a sort of mental disorder, but perhaps someone from the other view would see the opposite as true.Nearly every political position can be boiled down to either a constrained or unconstrained vision. Essentially, whether man is all knowing enough to make decisions to produce the desired results in society or whether man is limited and must rely on the mechanics of processes like the \\"Invisible Hand\\" of the free market. Things go deeper than just how to reach goals like fairness, freedom, and justice, as people with the differing views don't even assign the words the same meaning. Deep stuff, but mostly a very easy read. I'm going to be looking for other books from Sowell in the future. This is seriously my favorite book ever.I have a friend of differing ideology. As Sowell discusses, there times when visions cause someone to ignore or obfuscate fact to avoid it's risk to their psychological investment in a vision.

If we think of global warming, health insurance, military or social welfare spending, the same groups take opposite sides. How do we understand this consistent, systematic difference of outlook about politics and public policy?Sowell points out that the usual terms in which such differences are discussed - conflicting values or interests, fail to capture this more fundamental divide. Behind these patterned differences on policy and politics lies a conflict between \\"constrained\\" and \\"unconstrained\\" visions. A \\"vision\\" in Sowell's sense is a pre-analytic cognitive act, a sense of causation that precedes rational articulation. Visions set the agenda for both thought and action.For Sowell, the constrained vision recognizes the wisdom of the generations and of the many now living, as operating in a way somewhat analogous to language. Language develops best and most richly in its actual usage by the many who speak it daily. For the compilers of dictionaries, usage and not the opinions of experts determines meaning.The constrained vision recognizes the limits of any one person's wisdom, experience, and expertise as well as the intransigence of human nature in face of efforts to \\"improve\\" it. It sees knowledge as the social experience of the many, not the expertise of the intellectuals. So it is skeptical of grand schemes to improve the world, focusing on unintended consequences and trade-offs, as opposed to solutions.The constrained vision is naturally democratic, as Sowell describes it, relying on the decisions of the many over time rather than the brilliance of the elite. It sees utopian schemes as intrinsically authoritarian or totalitarian, in that they arise from the brains of individuals, who then impose their plan on the many, regardless of their own opinion.Those with the constrained vision want to make the best of the possibilities for improvement within the existing constraints and human limitations, alert to the unintended consequences, failures, and tyranny that beset most grand schemes of social engineering. They are inclined to agree with Dr. Johnson (1709-1784):How small of all that human hearts endure,That part which laws or kings can cause or cure.They do not expect or try to change human nature and they rely on systemic processes and results rather than intentions.In the unconstrained vision, which Sowell finds in especially pure form in William Godwin, the philosophical anarchist who wroteEnquiry Concerning Political Justice(1793), intention is the essence of virtue. The unconstrained vision emphasizes the plasticity and perfectibility of man. Where those with the constrained vision see trade-offs, those with the unconstrained see solutions; where the first see results, they see purpose; where systemic processes, intentions. They discount the costs--all too evident in the last century--of attaining utopia. They discount tradition, the implicit knowledge and wisdom of the generations. \\"Nothing must be sustained because it is ancient, because we have been accustomed to regard it as sacred, or because it has been unusual to bring its validity into question,\\" says Godwin.The unconstrained vision makes the sharpest distinction, the profoundest inequality between \\"persons of narrow views\\" (the masses) and the \\"cultivated.\\" Wisdom without reflection is unthinkable and only the cultivated few are capable of either. As Marx argued in different terms, the unconstrained vision divides society into the active few and the passive many, the enlightened and the ignorant, those who are products of heredity and environment and those who (in their own estimation) rise above such determination.With its seemingly inherent elitism, the unconstrained vision readily ascribes a key role to intellectuals, activists, or experts, those who are ahead of the masses and must lead them, through coercion if necessary, to the point of knowledge and understanding at which they have already arrived.Sowell goes beyond identifying the clusters of beliefs and assumptions usually (but not always) associated with one or the other vision. He wants to operationalize the distinction to focus on those differences that define the two visions, the differences that systematically differentiate them.Both visions acknowledge that human life involves inherent limitations (e.g., death, need for food) but these limitations are seen as much more extensive and intractable in the constrained vision.\\"What distinguishes those with the constrained vision is that the inherent constraints of human beings are seen as sufficiently severe to preclude the kind of dependence on individual articulated rationality that is the heart of the unconstrained vision\\" (pp.106-107).Sowell recognizes that his organizing contrast of constrained and unconstrained does not account for all cases. There are hybrids and inconsistencies in the vision of individuals and movements. It is rather a continuum or spectrum. But it does have extraordinary explanatory power, in my view. It enables us to see old dichotomies in social philosophy and social policy in illuminating ways. It helps to explain why, when new issues arise, like national health insurance, global warming, or same-sex marriage, no matter how completely unrelated the topics seem, people divide on them into predicable clusters.In the second part of the book, Sowell applies his dichotomy to particular areas in which opposed visions conflict - equality, power, and justice. He offers illuminating discussions of legal justice, individual rights, and social justice, for example, showing how the two visions differ systematically.Sowell is a prolific polemicist, but this book is not one-sided or polemical in the manner of his opinion columns or even some of his books, like the provocatively titledThe Vision of the Anointed: Self-Congratulation as a Basis for Social PolicyorThe Quest for Cosmic Justice. I have used it in teaching doctoral students, who found it both enlightening and challenging. The challenge comes from the complexity of the argument and the range and depth of scholarship on which it draws, as well as its revealing critique of much received opinion in academia."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Why do liberals berate conservatives as hard-hearted, morally repugnant, selfish caricatures of cartoon fatcats; while conservative will grant the liberals' their good intentions but remind them that road to hell is paved thusly by their wooly-headed, ivory tower schemes? And why are liberals castigated as slick, short-sighted, and interest group-driven, while conservatives are lampooned as dumb, corrupt and morally evil?These are just two of the questions tangentially answered by Thomas Sowell in this important book on the taxonomy and structure of our political debate. This work is sure to stand for the remainder of the century as *the* reference point from which dueling political frameworks are engaged.Sowell's main thesis is that contrasting visions of human capability, knowledge, perfection, and self-interest underlie two very different visions of humanity, and it is on these visions that political ideology, debate, and worldview rest. Sowell's two visions are named, rather unhelpfully, the constrained and the unconstrained vision. No gold star here for Sowell on Marketing. So instead, I'll use Pinker's terminology, as I was introduced to this book via Steven Pinker's Blank Slate.The Tragic (constrained) vision of human nature views man as possessing foibles, incentives, and the desire to act in his own self-interest. The Tragic \\"sees the evils of the world as deriving from the limited and unhappy choices available, given the inherent moral and intellectual limitations of human beings.\\" Thus, the perfection of governance in the Tragic Vision is the American Revolution with its checks and balances. Further, history should guide us, as the unknowable tradeoffs between different policies and procedures have been ironed out through unstated practice. The Utopians are to be scorned for their theoretical leanings that have little to do with the real world: \\"Hobbes regarded universities as places where fashionable but insignificant words flourished and added that \`there is nothing so absurd, but may be found in the books of Philosophers.\\"The Utopian (unconstrained) vision holds that man has not yet achieved his full moral potential, and that that potential is essentially perfectible. It is \\"foolish and immoral choices explain the evils of the world - and that wiser or more moral and humane social policies are the solution.\\" So while there are incentives that actually work in the here and now, this fact is somewhat irrelevant to the achievement of true justice. The Utopian holds that \\"potential is very different from the actual, and that means exist to improve human nature toward its potential, or that such means can be evolved or discovered, so that man will do the right thing for the right reason, rather than for ulterior psychic or economic rewards.\\" So the Utopian \\"promotes pursuit of the highest ideals and the best solution\\" in the hopes of achieving this perfect man. And if the masses are slow in catching on, then it is the role of the intellectual vanguard to lead them there - even if in the short run, the masses are unhappy with the results because they have not yet achieved the ability to see the future. Their thought is that reason should guide us, but reason as determined by the best and brightest: professors, government workers, elected and unelected officials. In this regard, the French Revolution with its lofty ideals and disposal of the past is the perfection of governance.Sowell, who is the Milton Friedman Senior Fellow at Stanford, certainly has his preferences in this debate, but keeps them entirely off-page here and lays out, in a remarkably even-handed portrayal his case.Political visions are uncommonly linked across diverse fields of inquiry, that these two competing political visions have been dominant in the last two centuries (to throw in a bit of materialism here - perhaps due to the Industrial Revolution?), and extending from initial premises, each is a logical, coherent, cogent interpretation of the world that nonetheless conflicts absolutely with its counterpart. The implications are fascinating:\\"While believers in the unconstrained vision seek the special causes of war, poverty, and crime, believers in the constrained vision seek the special causes of peace, wealth, or a law-abiding society.\\"While the constrained vision sees human nature as essentially unchanged across the ages and around the world, the particular cultural expressions of human needs peculiar to specific societies are not seen as being readily and beneficially changeable by forcible intervention. By contrast, those with the unconstrained vision tend to view human nature as beneficially changeable and social customs as expendable holdovers from the past.\\"In sum, this will be the groundwork for philosophical and political discussions for generations to come. Sowell has quite clearly pointed out the different premises. Now it is up to us to understand, argue, and resolve."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Dr. Thomas Sowell's book, \\"A Conflict of Visions\\" is an attempt to explore the primary, if unarticulated, philosophy of historical conservatism and liberalism. His thesis is that conservatism has a tradition of operating by a vision of humans that sees them as 'constrained.' Some characteristics of this view are:(1) Humans have generally selfish natures.(2) Human reason, while valuable, is quite limited.(3) Because of this, society grows by evolution, not central deliberate planning.(4) Social decisions generally involve not 'solutions' but 'trade-offs' (how much good for how much downside?)(5) Procedural fairness, rather than results-based fairness, is the key to a just society.Conversely, Sowell writes that the liberal tradition operates on a vision of humankind that is 'unconstrained.' Features include:(1)Human selfishness is a quality that can be overcome by reason and education.(2) Human reason, when used properly, can trump human impulses, emotions, and feelings.(3)The planned society is best. Non-planned societies = chaos.(4) While policy trade-offs might be a good short term solution, reason can discover true solutions that are equitable to all.(5)Procedural fairness is not fair so long as disperate outcomes result.Sowell backs up his thesis with impressive research, citations, and quotes. This is refreshing becuase it makes sure he is not simply creating strawmen. From the conservative side, his quites tend to come from Edmunde Burke, Adam Smith, Freidrich Hayek, and Oliver Wendell Holmes. From the liberal side, his quotes tend to come from William Godwin, Marquis de Condorcet, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Ronald Dworkin. (As one who has read all of these authors, I can assure the readers that there are no strawmen here.)The only murky part of the book is that Sowell makes this vision sound too simplistic. While he acknowledges that not all thinkers will fall into either one or the other category (and even has a chapter on Marx and Mill - two thinkers that borrow from both sides), some of his choices of people and quotes to exempify each 'side' are less clean-cut than one might like.As a libertarian, it is strange to me to see Edmunde Burke (who valued tradition more than most anything) Friedrich Hayek (who valued the innovation of capitalism more than anything) in the same group. (And Holmes is not necessarily the best jurist to exemplify 'strict construction' of the contitution). [It would have been interesting to see, then, an appendix on the ideological divorce of libertarianism and conservatism.] On the other 'side,' I kept thinking that, although William Godwin might be a good example of someone who believed reason to be virtually omnipotent, he was also a liability to Sowell's case, as Godwin did not believe in a planned society whatever and in fact, was an anarchist who was against planning in any form!While the examples aren't perfect, Sowell didn't intend them to be. All in all, it is a good book and I think Sowell's argument is a good one, and for the most part, true. For some other books in a similar vain - exploring the ideological divide between sides - try George Lakoff's \\"Moral Politics\\" and E.J. Dionne's \\"Why Americans Hate Politics.\\""},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Any thoughtful observer of political and social discourse is forced to note the ironies and disjuncts in specific beliefs from time to time. Conservatives often support restrictions on behavior in order to effect security, while liberals preach freedom but are happy to truncate it in order to marshall the resources to support their favored victim classes. Either side, if honestly introspective, ought to be troubled about why this is. Thomas Sowell, one of America's most thoughtful and intellectually honest commentators explains just why this is and traces the origin of the question to the Enlightenment and post-enlightenment thinkers before and shortly after the French Revolution. He describes the key dichotomy as between the &quot;constrained&quot; and &quot;unconstrained&quot; views of human nature, which view mankind as flawed or perfectable, respectively. Another author describing comparable distinctions in international relations, Robert Kaplan, uses the terms Realist and Idealist to discuss the same cleavage. In setting this out, Sowell manages to produce a genuinely Aristotelian approach to modern thought that is extremely worth reading. What's more, he does all of this in a very readable, approachable prose that it more enjoyable to read than any text on such deep subjects ought to be. It's one of the very few books that improves the reader while giving pleasure in doing so."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"\\"A Conflict of Visions\\" is an historical/philosophical analysis and exposition of the two major views of human nature - called the Unconstrained Vision and the Constrained Vision --that have dominated mainstream Western European and American political debate for the last 350 years or so. Sowell explores the different views, and the consequences of holding those views, on a number of important issues: liberty, equality, freedom, justice, etc., of a number of well-known Western European and American political writers, both historical and current (e.g., Locke, Hobbes, Burke, Condorcet, Godwin, Rousseau, among the historical figures and G.B. Shaw, O.W. Holmes, Ronald Dworkin and Milton Friedman among the more recent). \\"A Conflict of Visions\\" stands on its own and may be read to great benefit without any prior acquaintance with Sowell's work, but it can be most fully understood as one third of a trilogy, the other two parts of which are: \\"Knowledge and Decisions\\" and \\"The Vision of the Anointed\\".The Constrained Vision more or less asserts that (1) human beings (whether individually or in groups (e.g., legislatures)) are incapable of broad knowledge (i.e., at the societal level) about the effects of their actions, that therefore societies are better off relying on structures (e.g., markets, cultural traditions) that in some sense collect (or in the case of traditions, have collected over time) the limited knowledge of many independent actors, (2) that the Law of Unintended Consequences is alive and well, (3) that human nature is basically self-oriented (if not downright selfish) and (4) that, because of these profound limitations, only suboptimal \\"trade-offs\\", not \\"solutions\\", are possible on most important social and political issues. Adherents to The Constrained Vision -- definitely -- do not believe in the \\"perfectibility of man\\". This view has most often been associated with thinkers that most would characterize as \\"conservative\\".Believers in The Unconstrained Vision basically believe the opposite: that humans are so-called \\"blank slates\\" whose human nature is not innate, but is more or less completely determined by their environment, and that large social improvement/political projects are possible because human beings are capable of knowing much about the consequences (at the societal level) of their social actions. People holding this view do believe in the Perfectibility of Man, and this view, not surprisingly, has most often been associated with thinkers that most would characterize as \\"liberal\\".The analysis is very clear (typical for a Sowell book), easy to follow (also typical) and is fairly even-handed, especially for someone like Sowell, who more or less holds the Constrained Vision (as does this writer). While he uses strong versions of each Vision as foils to explicate the analysis, he also is clear that many positions along the Constrained/Unconstrained spectrum are possible and have been held by writers, and that some famous thinkers (e.g., Marx and Mill) have actually held hybrid versions of the Constrained and Unconstrained Visions.None of the writers discussed is a scientist of any kind, much less a scientist in a relevant field; and most of the writers discussed wrote before anyone knew (or certainly understood well) what a gene, a neuron or a hormone was. Because of this, after finishing \\"Conflict of Visions\\" (and, if you're up for it, the rest of the trilogy), one is dying to know the answer to the question: what does \\"science\\" currently say about Human Nature - which Vision does the generally accepted empirical evidence support: Constrained or Unconstrained?Several (conflicting) books (all well-written) that help fill out the debate include: \\"The Blank Slate\\", by Steven Pinker, \\"The Selfish Gene\\", by Richard Dawkins, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\", by Jared Diamond, \\"Human Natures\\", by Paul Ehrlich and \\"Nature via Nurture\\", by Matt Ridley. Ehrlich (famous for making a series of wildly wrong predictions of environmental disasters, and for losing several high-profile bets about the environment to the late economist, Julian Simon) and Pinker (evolutionary biologist/psychologist at MIT who studies the brain and language), for example, strongly disagree about mostly everything, and there is no broad consensus that emerges from these books, read together (Ehrlich and Diamond give more weight to environmental factors - Pinker and Dawkins more to genetic/evolutionary factors. Ridley attempts a modern synthesis of the positions).What does seem to be true, however, is that two (sometimes inconsistent or at least not wholly consistent) views are gaining ground: (1) most basic (and some not so basic) human drives are increasingly believed to be genetically determined (and many, though clearly not all, of these are \\"antisocial\\" or \\"selfish\\"); but that (2) this genetic determination can be very complex, including complicated interactions among genes (or more accurately the proteins they express) and between genes and the environment (broadly conceived - e.g., whether a person is well fed, has access to good medical care, is raised in a stable, loving environment, etc.).Sowell, in \\"A Conflict of Visions\\", helps organize in a sensible analytical structure a great deal of the core thinking (some not even explicit) of the two main camps of traditional Western political thought over the past few hundred years. It provides a lens for a deeper understanding of the original profound thinkers analyzed in the book, and makes one want to return to them for re-reading. In this sense, as well as many others, it is a very good book."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Why do the supposedly &quot;intolerant&quot; seem more tolerant of disagreement than the &quot;tolerant&quot;? From the time I began to think critically about politics, I was puzzled by the different ways in which people of the left and right saw each other. When I argued with a conservative, I was always treated with civility by my opponent; we could agree to disagree about a given topic, and then go on to something else. But when I argued with a liberal, I often would be personally criticized for my lack of compassion. Since my intentions were good regardless of the side of the debate that I was on, I couldn't figure out why one side saw me as misguided, but the other saw me as mean and unfeeling -- or, to put it another way, why those on the left, who preached &quot;tolerance,&quot; seemed so intolerant of disagreement.Dr. Sowell's book was a revelation. It seems that this civility gap, as I like to call it, is quite old. It stems from the &quot;conflict of visions&quot; for which the book is named. People of the &quot;constrained&quot; vision see limits to what human beings -- and particularly government -- can accomplish. Hence they do not try to solve every problem for every person. They see attempts to solve unsolvable problems as idealistic and misguided, but in no way evil. People of the &quot;unconstrained&quot; vision, on the other hand, believe that all problems can be solved if everyone is virtuous enough. So they see people of the &quot;constrained&quot; vision -- who seem to them unwilling even to try -- as lacking in virtue.To show just how old this conflict is and how it has not changed in many generations, Dr. Sowell presents a debate between some leading thinkers of the late 18th century. Dr. Sowell researches and writes like a genuine scholar as opposed to a political pundit, and although from his other books we know where his heart lies, in &quot;A Conflict Of Visions&quot; he is careful to present the debate in a balanced fashion. After you read &quot;A Conflict Of Visions,&quot; what you see on TV and in the newspaper will make more sense than before. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Every college and graduate student should be required to read this book because it so clearly explains the reasons why people hold certain opinions about matters of policy, justice, law, and government. Prof. Sowell does not preach in this book, he shows the relationships between sets of ideas, e.g. why liberals are liberals and why conservatives are conservatives, and why both sides are quite predictable. Other reviewers have said this book is difficult to read; I did not find it difficult, but having some previous knowledge of political ideas, such as found in political science or law or history, certainly helps. Just take your time reading it. For over 10 years I have recommended this book to everyone who showed any interest in what people think and why, because this book gives an education that you don't get in college or law school. What is more, after reading this book you can predict the positions that politicians and activist groups will take on just about any issue. Wonderful reading!"},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Probably the book that best captures the core of Sowell's thought, this will help crystallize the understanding of anyone who has invested a lot of time in observing the back-and-forth, Crossfire-style, argumentation that usually passes for rational political discussion. The underlying assumptions that promulgate the world-views of our pundits and politicians can be seen here, making for a clearer understanding of how political figures, past and present, have arrived at the choices they have made. While reading on the affirmative action debate, say, or the history of Europe between the World Wars, one can see the opposing visions at work. Sowell is careful - as always, but here more than usual - not to take sides, but merely to present the characteristic behaviors and thought processes of the two &quot;visions.&quot; As someone who agrees with Sowell most, but not all of the time, I was pleased with the way he stayed on message. A more opinionated book of his is &quot;The Vision of the Anointed&quot; which I also recommend."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"&quot;A Conflict of Visions&quot; has made a bigger impact on my life than any book I have read in the past 20 years. In this book Thomas Sowell helps explain how two intelligent, well educated people of similar backgrounds can view the world in ways that are completely different from each other. Reading this book can, at times, be very difficult. I found myself stopping, thinking, re-reading, and highlighting important concepts. At times it felt like I was back in college preparing for a final exam. But the understanding I gained was well worth the effort. Since reading this book, I find myself constantly using the basic principles of Sowell to analyze and understand the opinions that people hold on so many different real world situations.

He makes his case by painting two disparate pictures of human nature, the Constrained and the Unconstrained. He presents these two competing worldviews with the aid of readily understandable examples draw from history, such as Adam Smith and J. J. Rousseau. He then goes on to explain the effect these two competing visions of reality have on the individual's conceptions of such topics as Justice, Power, Knowledge, Law, Honesty, and Equality.Although this argument, like any other product of man, is far from perfect, it offers a fascinating structure within which to consider ideological issues. Although it is not a panacea that will explain away all confusion, it does offer intriguing explanations for the often polar differences between liberals and conservatives, and why they so often seem to be \`talking past each other'.I highly recommend this book to the beginner and the expert alike. The beginner is likely to find himself stunned, while the expert will be familiar enough with Dr. Sowell to recognize his expertise and admire his skillful writing."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"In \\"A Conflict of Visions,\\" Thomas Sowell compiles a study of the two dominant socio-political ideologies of the day via the idea of \\"visions\\"--that is, a received, almost precognitive set of assumptions about human nature and humanity's place in the world. Sowell calls these the \\"constrained\\" (i.e. \\"conservative\\") and \\"unconstrained\\" (i.e. \\"liberal\\") visions. The two visions are fundamentally different and, therefore, produce conflicting ideas about such basic concepts as knowledge and reason and conflicting attitudes toward such values as equality, power, and justice. Sowell substantiates his observations of the conflict by quoting often from those authors over the past 250 years who wrote most insightfully and prolifically from the vantage of one or the other of these visions--such writers as Edmund Burke, William Godwin, John Locke, Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat Condorcet, Ronald Dworkin and Milton Friedman.In the conservative vision, human nature is viewed as essentially selfish, and society protects individuals from each other through the various institutions, traditions, religions, and laws that have evolved over the course of history. However, the liberal vision considers human nature as essentially good and hampered only by various power structures and social restrictions (thus progress is made by subverting those institutions and traditions that conservatives prize). As one example of the effect this conflict of visions has on society, Sowell shows that the conservative vision has this view of knowledge: knowledge is as vast as the number of human beings in the world, and thus some form of democracy is the best method of ensuring that that knowledge is well represented in society. The conservative vision sees knowledge as one facet of the human experience, but it does not elevate reason to the highest value in that experience. The liberal vision sees knowledge as the key to solving the world's problems (whereas conservatives believe there are no solutions--rather, there are only \\"better\\" and \\"worse\\" options). In the liberal vision, the lack of knowledge (that is, rational enlightenment) is the cause of the world's problems. The mass of people are not bad, they are just unenlightened and thus subject to the common errors of the ignorant. Therefore, in this vision, what society most needs are enlightened individuals willing to remake the world on behalf of their brothers and sisters who lack their education and their special knowledge.Sowell has produced a brilliant and invaluable book. In this age when comedians masquerade as valid pundits and when the talking heads in the media do not know their history--cannot remember even the details of foreign policy in the previous presidential administration--Thomas Sowell shines through as the rare sort of thinker with the potential to clarify the murky political debate in the United States."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"This book is extremely well organized and the logic of thought is excellent. The issue and the core of the problem are so well defined and the single line of argument is being bulit step by step. People often argue on political issues without knowing what're the counterpart's assumptions, and this book offers a clear explaination of the source of the conflict. The same kind of conflict of visions actually not only exists in the US, as I was thinking about the difference btw. confucianism and Taoism in ancient China and the assumptions used by both sides (constrained and unconstrained visions) is strikingly similar to today's left and right's parties. This book leads me to think of things I've never thought about, and the clarity of thought is the hallmark of Dr. Sowell, whether you agree with him or not."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"For those who will read little more - Great Book! Read it.Thomas Sowell writes newspaper columns that are often characterized as \\"conservative\\" although he would probably characterize himself as a \\"pragmatist\\". This book cannot be characterized as being conservative or liberal. Dr. Sowell goes out of his way to not disclose his personal views. The book is an analysis of Western thought over the last 250 years regarding the proper roll of society, expressed principally through government, in achieving a successful society. I have read several of Dr. Sowell's books and have purchased several more to read. Here he truly achieves an objective restatement of the thoughts of prominent minds over the centuries and not his personal opinions on the same subject.He writes clearly and in a manner that is easy to read and yet he documents his work with so many footnotes that it is like reading a legal brief. The first thirty or forty pages were a slight struggle because he uses terms that were not familiar to me in their context. In particular it takes a while to understand what he means by the \\"constrained vision\\" and the \\"unconstrained vision\\". That is really what the book is about.He quotes Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham, John Stewart Mill, William Blackstone, Edmund Burke, Condorcet, Charles Darwin, Ronald Dworkin, Milton Friedman, John Kenneth Galbraith, William Godwin, Karl Marks, Friedrich Hayek, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Paine, Richard Posner and many other legal, economic and philosophical scholars all in an attempt to dissect their thinking. He explains how they often reach opposite conclusions from many undisputed premises.The philosophical, legal and political answer to the question of when \\"the end justifies the means\\" is a difficult one. It is easy to dogmatically answer the question but a few scenarios will quickly convince most sane people that there is really no universal answer. In describing the \\"constrained vision\\" Dr. Sowell quotes the writers who have emphasized the strict rule of law in achieving social stability. They tend to believe that the same rules should apply equally to all regardless of the outcome.Others have followed \\"an unconstrained vision\\" which he describes with their own words as being that the end result is more important than the route society takes to get there. They believe it is necessary to bend or modify rules to achieve what they view as a desirable outcome.This dichotomy in English and American common law resulted in both \\"Law Courts\\" and \\"Equity Courts\\" which administered law following the \\"constrained\\" vision in \\"Law\\" and \\"unconstrained\\" vision in \\"Equity\\" operating in parallel for hundreds of years although Dr. Sowell does not discuss this portion of our legal history.Although he uses the words of radicals like Karl Marks who clearly believed any means justified the end he sought for the world, Dr. Sowell tries to dwell more with prominent thinkers who were closer to the middle of political and economic thought and why they thought as they did.This book helped me better understand my own ambivalence about certain actions of our government, but it also convinced me that there are no universal answers to all of the problems that face society.It is unfortunate that Dr. Sowell's reputation as a conservative will probably keep many people who consider themselves liberals from reading this book. They would profit by understanding the perspective of those people with whom they are in an eternal debate. Similarly some conservatives will assume that they have little to learn from a book from someone they think they know and who could not surprise them. They might be quite surprised to find that Dr. Sowell is very non-judgmental in this book and does not side with either vision.I read this book after sending an email to Dr. Sowell to complement him on a newspaper article he had written about illegal immigration. His reply was that I had misunderstood his reasoning and that population was not the problem generating the migration of the poor from undeveloped areas. He suggested that I read portions of several of his books where he had elaborated on the issue. I have done so and still disagree with him on the population issue, but have found the writings on political philosophy of a writer whose work is woefully under appreciated. If you read \\"A conflict of Visions\\" or his book on the Economics and Politics of Race you will find it impossible to finish them without your opinions being forever altered in many respects.Jim Fuqua"},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Conflict of Visions reprensents one of the rare books that everyone should read. The premise is simple. There are two major views of the world and which view you follow predisposes you to particular side of various political issues. What makes this topic even more important for Americans is that both visions of man (fallen and perfectable)is part of our national character. Our religous heritage commits us to the fallen nature of man, but our spirit requires giving everyone a &quot;second&quot; chance (perfectablity).Dr Sowell's writing is clear and to the point. He introduces each topic and then develops both sides of each topic according to the logic of each vision. Note that while the following 2 books in the &quot;vision&quot; series espouse the constrained (fallen nature of man)vision this book is apolitical."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"For many years now, I have seen the roots of the modern \\"culture war\\" in terms of a conflict of visions deep enough that one side simply cannot see the views of the other. This principle applies to everything from the role of government, gender roles, sexual behaviour, violence to an appropriate political system. Ever since I began to read on these issues I have been troubled at the difficulty people around me have understanding, for instance, the arguments ofSocialist Workerand on the opposite end of the political spectrumBenjamin WikerorHans Hoppe.What Thomas Sowell has been praised for ever since \\"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles\\" came out in its first edition in 1987 is his ability to understand the roots of these cultural conflicts without being (excessively) biased like, say, Benjamin Wiker must be said to be. In fact, it is true that \\"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles\\" looks evenhandedly at what Sowell calls the \\"constrained\\" and the \\"unconstrained\\" visions of human nature and society. Sowell aims to show that the \\"constrained\\" vision focuses on equality of processes and a strict view of human nature as solid and inflexible, whereas the \\"unconstrained\\" vision believed human nature to be malleable and able to be made so that equality of result is possible for everyone.Sowell does do a very good job of how these different viewpoints of human nature effect a variety of issues, from economics to law to human rights. In each case, Sowell shows very logically how the \\"constrained\\" and \\"unconstrained\\" visions differ from each other in approaching these questions, and the patterns observed recur in a very clear way that makes a lot of sense. He shows that the \\"constrained\\" vision relies on (economic) incentives to avoid such problems as poverty and violence, whereas the unconstrained visions believes that force (though Sowell is too sensitive to use that word) or government power is capable of eliminating war.The problem is that, whilst \\"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles\\" makes clear what the \\"constrained\\" and \\"unconstrained\\" visions are and makes a reasonable list of quotes, Sowell quotes from far too narrow a range of authors to provide serious perspective. From the \\"constrained\\" side, he focuses on Edmund Burke and Friedrich Hayek, and from the \\"unconstrained\\" side William Godwin. Very often, in fact, Sowell shows himself far too uncertain about the nature of certain ideologies, and worse than this, he omits all major twentieth-century thinkers except Hayek. He does not discuss non-economists who could well be seen as more extreme examples of an \\"unconstrained\\" vision than Godwin: none of Friedrich Nietzsche, Wilhelm Reich, Margaret Sanger, Margaret Mead or Peter Singer are in the book at all, and Charles Darwin is barely mentioned. On the other side, such key modern conservative thinkers as G.K. Chesterton, Pope John Paul II, Ludwig von Mises and Murray Newton Rothbard are equally ignored. Nietzsche at least might be seen as a more radical \\"unconstrained\\" vision than any socialist economist, because he believed that humans were driven by an amoral \\"will to power\\". Such a view is totally contradictory to a fragile, fixed human nature because it argues people can transform themselves into whatever they want.Whilst he is right about fascism and utilitarianism as \\"hybrid visions\\", I must say he misunderstands Christianity - which in its most orthodox and conservative forms I think ought to be seen as a more extreme example of the \\"constrained\\" vision than any secular form of classical liberalism. Erik von K&uuml;hnelt-Leddihn is a key thinker here who is not in \\"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles\\" at all. K&uuml;hnelt-Leddihn's writings show that this radically \\"constrained\\" vision is very rigidly opposed to many moved that are taken for granted in even mildly \\"unconstrained\\" cultures, especially concerning gender roles. Even if the related rationale is to a large extent symbolic, I do consider it a missed opportunity that Sowell would not discuss the absolute ban on the ordination of women to the priesthood in the Catholic and Orthodox churches: if he could discuss it well, he might show the difference between the \\"constrained\\" and \\"unconstrained\\" visions more radically than he can via economics. The same is true concerning opponents of women's right to vote (which was significantly driven by the same Churches), and even universal male suffrage. Hans Hoppe shows the opposition to both those changes was driven by the view that humanity's selfish nature would cause the newly enfranchised to demand things they did not own. Indeed, the political manifestations of the \\"constrained\\" and \\"unconstrained\\" visions are a major omission from \\"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles\\".All in all, \\"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles\\" is an easily read book that offers a basic economic look at the ideological origins of our cultural struggle, but lacks the political or ethical depth to be essential."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"In \\"A Conflict of Visions\\" Mr. Sowell sets out to explain why people tend to be on opposite sides of the fence, politically speaking, on so many non related issues. In this he succeeds brilliantly, in a work of elegant, convincing logic, and clearly laid out insights. There is no new information in this book, nor does it take sides in political differences, but it re-arranges what you already know and have seen in your life in a manner that decisively delivers new understanding of the world around you.Mr. Sowell's thesis is that most people fall into two idealized \\"visions\\" of human nature, what he calls the constrained (which also been called the Tragic and is generally linked with conservatives) and the unconstrained (which has also been called the Utopian and is generally linked with liberals) visions. These visions are basically intuitive (to the person who holds them, and usually anathema to the person that holds the opposing), and more or less \\"gut feelings\\" on the nature of humanity and human potential. In reality the visions individuals hold lie on a spectrum of level of constraint and although no one person would hold a 100% constrained or 100% unconstrained vision it is implicitly assumed that there is a double bump distribution of people along this spectrum, with about half holding mostly constrained visions, half holding mostly unconstrained visions, and not too many people holding a middle position. This is because the two visions are opposed and to hold equal belief in both would be logically contradictory. From his characterization of each vision the author clearly explains how the assumptions undergirding each lead to completely different conceptions in how each side even defines such issues as freedom, equality, justice and power, and why both sides argue past each other and have such a difficult time debating / convincing each other.The constrained visions basically sees man's nature as both fixed and as incapable of predicting the results of his actions in the complex world, and thus incapable of controlling those results. As such it relies on systemic measures to promote the general good of society, for example evolutionary developments of such things as free-markets, constitutional government with strict constructionist judicial interpretation, great intelligence inherited in social traditions, etc. The unconstrained vision on the other hand sees man's nature as changeable in response to articulated rationality, and sees man as not only capable of predicting the results of his actions but morally obligated to control the results of his actions for the greater good. Thus the unconstrained vision places emphasis on bodies of \\"surrogate\\" decision makers of the most intelligent to control economic and social policy for the greater good, activist judicial interpretation of law to provide the best outcome for the individual case at hand, social activism like recycling, and great intelligence inherited in the most intellectually and developed individuals of our society.The insights of the book are truly worthwhile and cover far more than I could here in a review. However, the book is not long and not too difficult to read, although it is written in a slightly dense intellectual manner which can take a few pages to get used to and is a bit repetitive. Nonetheless this is a book that will make you smarter, better able to understand where someone from an opposing political viewpoint is coming from as well as better able to understand your own viewpoint and its foundation in how you perceive, consciously or not, the character of human nature. The book is also extremely fair to each side, not trying to prove one or the other correct, but just trying to explain how each thinks and reaches the conclusions they do.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"This book was helpful in seeing other sides of issues. It enforced my belief that most people are attempting to do what is right. They have logically come to their visions of what is right based on differernt premises. One minor detraction is Sowell's altruistic contention that both visions do and should do what is best for society rather than what is best for oneself. He mostly ignores rational individualism as moral."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"I long ago concluded that Thomas Sowell is the most brilliant author in the United States and perhaps the only man in American who truly understands what is happening in this country and why. His analyses are always incisive and his books enlightening. But this book is exceptional. It is a must read for anyone seeking to logically decide whether he (or she) should classify him/herself as a liberal or as a conservative, and why.I first read \\"A conflict of Visions\\" in the mid-1990s as part of a quest to determine what had gone so wrong with America that someone of extremely low character could be elected to any public office, let alone to the office of President of the United States as had happened in 1992. It was the 47th and final book in that quest, for it answered most of my questions.The book essentially traces the parallel history of conservative thought, termed \\"the constrained vision,\\" and liberal thought, termed \\"the unconstrained vision,\\" over the past two hundred and some odd years. In the process, it addresses such topics as how liberal elitists and conservative leaders view themselves in relation to society, who they feel should govern and how, the differing views on how to maintain peace or prevent war, and how societies should evolve or be made to change, just to name a few.Being somewhat of a conservative bent, I always thought that liberals were either naive or simply stupid. But after reading this book, I finally understood liberalism, I understood Bill Clinton, and I began to see what had gone wrong with America. I also came to understand such things as; the subtle differences between Liberalism and Communism; why Ronald Reagan was so beloved by his people but so hated by the liberals; why liberal elitists persist in their belief that the United States is the source of all the world's problems and why they feel that they are above the law; why liberals \\"loath\\" the military and why they push such programs as \\"Affirmative Action;\\" and why conservatives are judged by such high standards and liberals by almost no standards at all.Sadly, I also concluded that liberalism had prevailed in the United States since by the mid-1990s three of their primary criterion had been met: 1) they controlled the administration of Government (the federal bureaucracy), 2) they controlled the dissemination of information (the major print and television news media), and 3) they controlled the education system (academia and a public education system centralized in Washington and controlled by the NEA). I reckoned that the America which had once been the envy of the world was in for a steady decline both morally and economically.Perhaps others reading this book will come to a different conclusion. But everyone should read it. And when they finish this book, they might also try some of Sowell's other works, such as \\"The Vision of the Anointed,\\" \\"Inside American Education,\\" and \\"Ethnic America.\\" They may be surprised by what they find and might even find they have a new favorite author."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"In A Conflict of Visions, Sowell looks at two basic competing visions of humanity: the &quot;constrained,&quot; which views human nature as changeless and basically selfish; and the &quot;unconstrained&quot; view which sees us as perfectable, more malleable beings.

The book does much to iluminate foundations of how our own perspectives are shaped as well as those who see the world differently. Sowell also does a fine job of keeping his own views out of the book.

His thesis is a CONFLICT OF VISIONS. He believes that political thought can be broken into two different camps. With some crossover and a few exceptions, people either subscribe to the constrained vision or the unconstrained vision.The constrained vision believes that people have natural flaws and our resources are better spent designing society with those flaws in mind. The unconstrained vision believes that man can be molded and perfected with the right instruction and society should spend their resources to reach that end.Sowell does an excellent job in explaining that most current ideas have their origins, at least somewhat, in philosophies that are over 100 years old. My favorite bit is Adam Smith's idea that supposes you were told every person in China was killed. Smith argues that you might feel immediate surprise and maybe even some faint remorse, but it would be nothing compared to the worry you'd feel if you'd lost end of your little finger. Smith's idea is that it's neither good nor bad that man is self-interested, but that societies would be much more productive if they recognized that truth, and worked with it, instead of spending their resources trying to change man's nature, which Smith believed was impossible.You won't soon forget this work."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"A perfect introduction on why opposing sides tend to be the way they are and how in their eyes what they think and believe is better then what their competition says.Makes a clear distinction between people who are optimistic to the point of being brash versus those who are realistic to the point of being stagnant.This is a heavy book though. Will require complete concentration and probably re reading a few times before the real value of this great text is clear to the reader."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"This book makes a compelling argument. It claims that there is an underlying systematicity to who lies on which sides of arguments of the last 200-300 years of Western political and social theory. He makes (admittedly fluid) categorizations of &quot;constrained&quot; and &quot;unconstrained&quot; visions, which are views on the nature of man. The argument is tremendously illuminating.However, there are some severe caveats:1. He doesn't consider seriously any social theorists that aren't basically economists (or Marxists, but they don't really accept that there is a social theory independent of an economic theory). For example, he mentions Max Weber only once.2. (and this is related to one). He develops hypothetical positions for each of the polarities of visions that he proposes. Because these are polarities, not instances, the positions are caricatures. His caricatures of the unconstrained vision are substantially more shallow and less generous than those of the constrained (where he puts himself).Examples of questions that I think he would have trouble with: (a) from the point of view of a constrained vision, why do &quot;social scientific&quot; accounts have descriptive force or descriptive adequacy? (b) From the constrained vision, why is behavior patterned culturally?I think that Henry Kissinger hints to a more compelling and complete account of these kinds of phenomena in his Years of Renewal. The fundamental difference is that Kissinger views the contraint as not on human nature but on the human capacity to act. There is only so much that can be achieved, and a person has to establish priorities (which are &quot;trade offs&quot;) so that he can act at all. This is a fundamental shift from an ideational perspective to a pragmatic one based in action. Furthermore, this allows things like culture in the door. This is the classic dilemma of Western thought, and especially the specific traditions that economic analysis has developed out of."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Like some of the other critical reviewers, I personally enjoy reading much of Sowell's writing including his other books and columns and consequently was excited to start reading this book, but \\"A Conflict of Visions\\" is not Sowell's best work. The ideas advanced did not strike me as astoundingly novel and the writing is very repetitive.To be fair, some of the repetition is forced by the topic (comparing and contrasting A vs. B thinking), but the same sentence structure is employed so often that it becomes a significant distraction. An example from page 210: \\"Unlike the constrained vision, which sees individual rights as instrumentalities of the social process--their scope and limits justified by the social processes from which they are derived--the unconstrained visions sees rights as inhering in individuals for their own individual benefit and as fundamental recognitions of their humanity.\\" Also, many sentences begin with very similar clauses such that reading a paragraph is like watching a tennis ball move back and forth across the net. For example, four consecutive sentences on page 56 begin with these clauses: \\"In the unconstrained vision,...In the constrained vision,...By contrast, the unconstrained vision...In the constrained vision...\\" This style of writing will likely aggravate many readers over the course of 263 pages.As for his main argument, Sowell relies heavily on a handful of thinkers to explicate the conflicting visions and to apply them to broad political problems. He quotes liberally from William Godwin to represent the unconstrained vision and from Burke and Smith to represent the constrained vision. Someone who has read from those three thinkers will not encounter many new insights or ideas in \\"A Conflict of Visions.\\" Someone who has not read Godwin, Burke, or Smith would be better off reading those authors directly rather than suffering through Sowell's summary."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"1. AUTHOR BACKGROUND & PROFILEBefore giving my personal perception and opinion about this book, I would like to start with get to know the profile and personality of Thomas Sowell. The reason being is to screen whether the author's use of language and evidence is more tend to reflect his individual's personal background OR is more tend to the fact than personal opinion that consists of no benefit of interpretation, inference, or value judgment (though I am aware that to some degree, bias or personal interpretations could not be avoided). Below is the information about Thomas Sowell's background and activity that taken from Wikipedia.\\"Thomas Sowell was born in North Carolina on 30 June 1930, he is a prominent American economist, political writer, and conservative commentator. He is presently a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.In North Carolina, where he was born, his encounters with white people were so limited that he didn't believe that \\"yellow\\" was a possible color for human hair (A Personal Odyssey), and later moved with his mother and siblings (his father died before he was born) to Harlem, New York City. There he attended the highly selective Stuyvesant High School, but dropped out when he moved out on his own at the age of 17 because of money problems and a deteriorating home environment. He soon after served in the US Marine Corps as a photographer and pistol instructor.After his service, he earned an A.B. in Economics from Harvard College, an A.M. in Economics from Columbia University, and a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Chicago, known for its Chicago school of economics.Sowell is both a popular columnist and an academic economist. Sowell primarily writes on economic subjects, in which he generally advocates a free market approach tocapitalism. In addition to this Sowell opposes Marxism providing a critique that Marx never had a labor theory of value. Sowell also writes on racial topics and is a critic of affirmative action or positive discrimination\\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sowell)From the information given above (see underline), he is more likely dominant on the side of constrained vision. For more detail about constrained and unconstrained vision will be discussed below.2. ISSUES PRESENTED & OVERALL THESIS OF THE BOOK.In overall, Sowell, as a deep thinker, is trying to represent his observations, study, research, and analysis regarding the deeper root cause of why two different big groups with its political opinions happen too often to be coincidence and it is too uncontrolled to be a plot. Explicitly, I would guess that he is talking about the conflict of vision between liberals and conservatives or socialists and libertarians.The main keyword, as the root cause, to explain this fundamental political difference is about vision, that more likely also contains the aspect of fanaticism. The different vision among these two big groups is considered as the main resources of the conflict of logical consistency that Sowell identified in his preface that \\"we sacrifice for our visions and sometimes, if need be, face ruin rather than betray them\\". He also added that \\"Visions are very subjective, but well-constructed theories have clear implications, and facts can test and measure their objective validity\\" in the topic of the role of visions.The discussions regarding vision will be grouped into two broad categories - the constrained vision and the unconstrained vision. Constrained vision based on theory of moral sentiments by Adam Smith that talk about moral limitations of man in general, and his egocentricity that can not be changed as inherent facts of life. This theory still leave any possibility to its extent into making the best moral and social benefits, BUT still within that constraint that unchangeable as Smith mentioned as both vain and pointless. As an economist, Smith's constrained vision is supplemented by Edmund Burke and Alexander Hamilton in political perspective about: \\"an infirmity inherent in the fundamental nature of things\\" or about \\"the imperfection of the institutor, Man\\". Another figures as Sowell's references for constrained vision are: Hayek, Hobbes, Milton Friedman, etc.Unconstrained vision based on theory of Godwin's Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, a work as remarkable for its fate as its contents. He believed that the intention to benefit others as being \\"of the essence of virtue,\\" and virtue in turn as being the road to human happiness. For Godwin, the real goal of incentive was the long-run development of a higher sense of social duty. In the issue of trade-offs VS solutions, in contrast with constrained vision's belief, the unconstrained vision believed that where moral improvement has no fixed limit, prudence is of a lower order of importance. Man is, in short, \\"perfectible\\"- meaning continually improvable rather than capable of actually reaching absolute perfection. In the issue of Social morality and social causation, human actions were dichotomized by Godwin into the beneficial and the harmful, and each of these in turn was dichotomized into the intentional and the unintentional. Another authors citing other than Godwin, are: Rousseau, Veblen, Galbraith, etc3. WHAT IMPRESSED ME AND MADE ME HAPPY* Sowell's statement of facts is more dominant than his own opinion that the accuracy can be verified by objective observation and wide usage of reference from both sides of the group of constrained vision and unconstrained vision* The language style is more denotative than connotative. I like the way Sowell in his honesty respect the difference between this two political group with each of its own strengths and weaknesses. He mentioned that: \\"Virtually no one believes that man is 100 percent unconstrained and virtually no one believes that man is 100 percent constrained\\"* His personality, background, or training or even political preference as a conservative prominently does not affect his intellectual reasoning and statement in this book. I am impressed with Sowell's statement regarding realization about these two fundamentally different assumptions about knowledge and reason with its applications into social process. He does not attack one of them, but instead, suggested on building two things on these two different foundations such as: 1). More awareness of the diversity of visions and their dynamics, and 2). Special attention to visions of equality, visions of justice which are central to the ideological conflicts of the age. (p. 98)* He does not show any excessive critical tone or any bias of his statement to either one of the two different groups through his words. He is basically free of value of judgment, careless comparisons, and of propaganda in his analysis reasoning.4. WHAT MADE ME UPSET* Following Hayek, Sowell maintains that the constrained vision offers little scope for the application of moral theory.* The constrained vision is more likely to give more pessimistic atmosphere regarding man's potentiality. They are rarely guided by morality, usually prejudiced and irrational, even usually takes every opportunity to take advantage of other people for personal gain. But perhaps more fundamentally, the constrained vision views these negative characteristics as nearly unalterable. As Sowell puts it, \\"The constrained vision is a tragic vision of the human condition.\\" Mankind's problems flow necessarily from the irremovable flaws of the human character itself.* I do not really agree about the statement made by Sowell regarding the gap between the actual and the potential is much smaller in constrained vision than in unconstrained vision."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"I enjoyed the book thoroughly and found it very enlightening.

The same scholarly approach as found in his earlier work (Vision of the Annointed, etc.) is found in this book. Sad that those who most need to understand such work won't read it."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"This is one of those books that divides people into two categories. As such, it greatly over-simplifies ideological differences, as Sowell himself admits. The question is whether this bifurcation is useful in explaining a lot of different ideologies. I think it is very useful, and does often explain why people talk past each other.Sowell uses the terms \\"constrained\\" and \\"unconstrained.\\" I don't think those labels explain the thought process very well. I would prefer \\"utopian\\" and \\"conservative.\\" The unconstrained are utopians that believe that we should fix problems by the straight-forward method of simply changing things so they are better. The way to improve the world is for everyone to act in a more ethical fashion, and for people to act to make things better. Laws, traditions, and systems of doing things often simply get in the way of solving problems. I use the term utopian not because all the unconstrained necessarily believe that a utopia is possible. But people with this vision do believe that it is a good idea to have a utopian vision in mind and always move towards it, even if it is ultimately impossible to achieve it. Sowell seems to fixate on the concern that the unconstrained have with equality, but I don't think highlighting this particular ethical problem is necessary for one to be considered unconstrained. It is just that equality has been the great ethical problem of the last few centuries, so those who are unconstrained will often focus on that goal.Those who are constrained believe strongly in the use of laws, traditions, and systems to get to the best society. It is not that the constrained are less ethical; it is that they don't believe the methods of the unconstrained will succeed at improving society. The constrained believe in the saying \\"The perfect is the enemy of the good.\\" Thus if one moves straightforwardly in the direction of simply improving problems, while ignoring laws, traditions, and systems, the result will be to worsen the situation, not improve it. Thus the unconstrained believe that those in power such as judges, business leaders, and politicians should always take the action that brings more justice, regardless of that leader's position in the laws and traditions of their society. The constrained feel that allowing these leaders to act outside their assigned roles will inevitably lead to corruption, favoritism, and prejudice. Sowell emphasizes that the constrained believe in finding the best results based on the trade-offs involved, because they know that perfection cannot be achieved. Whereas the unconstrained are always looking for solutions to problems, and often deny that their preferred solutions include any trade-offs.Sowell is careful not to take sides as to which side of the debate he is on, but I agree with most of the reviewers of this book that he is mostly in the constrained camp, because of how he wrote the book, and because of other books he's written. And I do think that bias comes through in one case, where he insists that one characteristic of the unconstrained vision is that one believes that a rational elite should be in charge of running society. I don't believe that is a necessary facet of being unconstrained, and in fact many of the unconstrained don't believe that. An example of this would be anarchists, both the right-wing and left-wing versions. They don't believe in following the laws and traditions of yesteryear. They do believe that people will act in a better manner if we get rid of these historical artifacts. But they also don't believe that elites are necessary as a substitute to run our society. Instead they believe that people act rationally in the absence of both laws/traditions and elites. I think that an elite running society would likely be the end result of attempting anarchy, but that's because I am mostly in the constrained camp myself. But the anarchistic philosophy itself doesn't require an elite, and in fact disdains one.I do wonder what a book written by an unconstrained person would be like. The unconstrained often believe that objectivity isn't possible, so such a book would likely be a polemic warning fellow travelers of those that are so conservative or negative that they don't believe solutions are possible. Presumably the constrained would be described as incurable pessimists or contemptible amoralists."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Sowell's analysis of the differing viewpoints, practice and results between the liberal progressive anointed vision and the tragic conservative republican vision of life and society.

Its purpose is to delineate the visions which undergird the political impulses of the major political parties. It argues that the disparate visions are traceable to disparate beliefs regarding human nature. The 'constrained' vision can be traced to thinkers such as Hobbes, Burke and Adam Smith, the 'unconstrained' vision to thinkers such as Godwin, Condorcet and Rousseau. The consistency of the respective visions and the degree to which they cover a multiplicity of current issues is striking. It is almost as if some are born with one vision, others with another. Sowell acknowledges that some individuals have changed their visions, but often under 'road to Damascus' circumstances. Some have been persuaded by empirical evidence, though it is a truism (one reinforced here) that the respective visions are often resistant to evidence.The book is scrupulously objective in its goals. The book is analytic and descriptive, not polemical. Sowell goes out of his way to avoid choosing sides or offering compelling evidence for the inconsistency or absurdity of either of the visions. He is not recruiting readers to one side or the other. He is constructing two complex mirrors in which his readers can attempt to see themselves and the degree to which their individual views are part of a large, centuries-old pattern.My own sense is that he's got this right and he's used the best examples, though I might have added a touch more Rousseau to the mix. The objective analysis, however, comes with a price. In resisting the impulse to take sides and adduce evidence justifying the taking of sides he has written a book which is more theoretical/historical than historical/theoretical. In short, the want of copious examples is often felt. Also, the fact that Sowell is such an effective polemicist (when he is writing in that mode) makes one regret that he is here purposely confining and restraining himself. Nevertheless, the book is excellent and does exactly what it sets out to do--fairly, clearly and persuasively.For those with an interest in human nature (or its alleged nonexistence), one can also highly recommend Pinker's The Blank Slate, a nice companion volume to Sowell's and one that is less constrained in its arguments."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"OK, that is an exaggeration, simply because such a beast doesn't exist, but the book is a great tool for understanding much, if not most of today's American political discourse, both high and low.

If we had 100 stars I'd give him 99 for everything I've read by him. This is the fourth book I've consumed by this great master of economics and with every page he becomes more and more of a legend. A Conflict of Visions is a perfect counterpart to The Vision of the Anointed. Conflict is a more philosophical book and I preferred Anointed for that reason (which I'd give a 100 out of 100) as more current examples are fleshed out. Neither one though is really a political book. They are much more psychological and philosophical than anything else. With Sowell, you uncover the way human beings actually are and what greater gift can a writer give than that kind of enlightenment? I cannot think of one. I do agree with another reviewer about the language, however. Unconstrained and constrained are not the best of terms but you'll understand the dichotomy between them clearly by the time you've finished. Incidentally, NR had a five part interview with Sowell concerning this book last week which occasioned my pulling it out and finishing it over the weekend. Basically, with any of the Sowell books you can't go wrong. Race and Culture is next on my list."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Have you ever noticed how it's easy -- after, say, 15 minutes of discussion -- to predict how someone will turn up on a given controversy? So, even though you haven't talked about immigration or taxation or abortion, you find that you can accurately give your new acquaintance's views based on other things they've said.This book helps to explain why that occurs. Sowell seeks -- and it's a tough task -- to give a broad guide to understanding the wide visions that we all carry around, and with which we interpret the world and the controversies that happen around us.Others have complained that Sowell oversimplifies. I would argue instead that Sowell's given task in this book is to make simple what can be an endlessly complex job -- to figure out why we usually end up -- predictably -- on a given side of a subject.What's also good is that Sowell doesn't use the tired, unhelpful categories of \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" which in our time have come to be simplifying without helping. Sowell's simplifying, instead, gives a means of looking at the world that clarifies and in the end helps us think more clearly and -- perhaps -- more reliably when we evaluate problems of our time."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"I have always wondered the psychological reasons why different political views see the same situation so differently yet each so consistently. Why do liberals most often attack conservatives as stupid or mean? Why do conservatives fight less ardently for their political goals? This book explains from several different angles the two main strains of thought that make up the modern political struggle. Are the solutions to all our problems just to revise our system of government and put the smartest people in power? This is essentially the \\"liberal\\"( under the current definition) view. The other side feels that there are no select few people that know best how to run things and that life is a series of trade-offs. The solution is to work a trade-off that best solves the situation. After reading this book the debate makes so much sense. I now know why the liberals think that 600 or so lawyers in Washington should be trusted more that every other American making their own decisions. Just yesterday a government panel was telling us that mammograms before 50 and every year are a waste of money. You see if you crunch the numbers, it's cheaper to treat a few more patients that weren't caught early than to spend on all these extra tests that find nothing. The everyday common person is going to want to over-test to be sure. How stupid! The 600 lawyers came up with the idea of borrowing $4,500 from the Chinese to give to car buyers, if they would buy a new car and completely destroy their old car. Destroy it so that the parts could not even be used. Doesn't a new car have to be created to replace that car? Doesn't it use energy to create that new car?I'm convinced that Thomas Sowell is one of the few smart people that could run this country, but he's smart enough to know it is not the answer."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"I've read several of Dr. Sowell's books now and this one has me feeling a bit disappointed.

Please read his economic books and you will enjoy him a lot more."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"This is a 5 star book solely on the basis of its brilliant thesis. Dr. Sowell argues that the political divide can be attributed to humanity's understanding of how the world works and human nature. This understanding can be categorized by two visions, the unconstrained vision and the constrained vision. Those with the constrained vision see humanity and society as imperfect but with rules, traditions, and policies able to provide as much freedom and equality as possible within those constraints. Those with the unconstrained vision see humanity and society as something that can be continually perfected to achieve a specific result. Basically, the unconstrained vision puts you on the left, the constrained vision mostly puts you on the right. Although Dr. Sowell has his own political views, he treats both sides evenhandedly in this book. Dr. Sowell brings in quotes from Condorcet and Godwin of the unconstrained vision and Burke and Hayek of the constrained vision to help illustrate his points. For those interested in the whys of politics and the philosophy behind it, I highly recommend this book. However, since this is very academic, others may prefer the author's other book, \\"The Vision of the Anointed\\" which is more readable."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"The title pretty much describes the book. It's not an easy read but worth the extra effort required to understand what's being presented."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Thomas Sowell's &quot;A Conflict of Visions&quot; is a remarkable book. The author's objective portrayal of the two conflicting visions, their premises, their history and their wide ranging implications and ramifications is an excellent education for all who have a serious interest in social and economic policies, as well as politics.Like Dr. Sowell's other books, &quot;A Conflict of Visions&quot; was the product of meticulous research, objective analysis and much original thought. In my opinion, few people in the public arena today are as brilliant and as well informed as Dr. Sowell.If you ever wondered why the same two camps of voices combat each other on issue after issue, in politics, in law, in economics and in social policies, if you ever wondered why no unequivocal truth emerged from the conflicting premises through more than 200 years of war and peace, and if you ever wondered (this is the kicker!) why one side's vitriolic portrayal of the other side met with a generally benevolent counter portrayal, you will find the answers in Dr. Sowell's theory of conflicting visions. Reading this book is like discovering Newtonian mechanics.&quot;A Conflict of Visions&quot; is not an easy read. However, you won't soon forget its ideas."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"On reading the entire block of 60-odd reviews, I find that more than half of them, even while admiring Sowell's evenhandedness, misstate the carefulness of the book's positions. In the an attempt to pay tribute to the brilliance of this (rather dense, historical & philosophical ) book, I'll try to correct this.This book presents two visions of the world. However, contrary to most of the reviewers, the difference is not about Liberals vs. Conservatives. It is about the difference between two visions of the world, and each of the visions is found in most parties in the political spectrum.The two visions are metaphysical, pre-scientific points of view regarding how the world works. In one view (Unconstrained), people can drive change, intentions matter, and this could improve the world. In the other view (Constrained), people will always be (somewhat) bad, only results and processes matter, and improvements always involve tradeoffs.Sowell first acknowledges that no vision is purely Constrained or Unconstrained. And then he explicitly does not connect the dots to (modern, US) liberal vs. conservative visions. And he doesn't do so for the basic reason that it really isn't that simple.Instead of attempting to place \\"Conservative\\" vs. \\"Liberal\\" positions on top of Sowell's 2 visions, let us look instead at every issue, and determine whether our own individual intuitions are that (a) it is a problem, and that (b) human beings can solve or meliorate, via coordinated political action, this paricular problem without creating other (potentially worse) problems. This is the issue. And the arguments for or against most actions can come from both positions.Examples from the War in Iraq.Against (Constrained): The military cannot solve a complex social problem.Against (Unconstrained): War is evil. Don't start one.For (Constrained): There will be horrible tradeoffs, but war is better than the (worse) other options of not warring.For (Unconstrained): Saddam is a blight upon Iraq, they will be better without him.I have attempted to point out that not all conservative positions are constrained, and not all liberal positions are unconstrained. Rather, different people have different understandings of the world, and these often lead to different conclusions. Using Sowell's brilliant dichotomy, people may improve their understanding of the issues facing the world, though hopefully not replace entirely any other charitable understandings."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Thomas Sowell begins the book by asking us why the same people seem to be on opposite sides of every issue, even when the issues themselves seem to be unrelated. His thesis is a CONFLICT OF VISIONS. He believes that political thought can be broken into two different camps. With some crossover and a few exceptions, people either subscribe to the constrained vision or the unconstrained vision.The constrained vision believes that people have natural flaws and our resources are better spent designing society with those flaws in mind. The unconstrained vision believes that man can be molded and perfected with the right instruction and society should spend their resources to reach that end.Sowell does an excellent job in explaining that most current ideas have their origins, at least somewhat, in philosophies that are over 100 years old. My favorite bit is Adam Smith's idea that supposes you were told every person in China was killed. Smith argues that you might feel immediate surprise and maybe even some faint remorse, but it would be nothing compared to the worry you'd feel if you'd lost end of your little finger. Smith's idea is that it's neither good nor bad that man is self-interested, but that societies would be much more productive if they recognized that truth, and worked with it, instead of spending their resources trying to change man's nature, which Smith believed was impossible.You won't soon forget this work."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Mr. Sowell seems convinced that a typical person's positions on various political topics are in fact dictated by relatively few basic assumptions which the person holds. That is, three or four basic &quot;truths&quot; which you hold will in turn govern your views on dozens of other policy issures.He makes a very readable and very convincing case, illustrating how this plays out in many of today's &quot;hot&quot; political issues.This concept - that a few basic assumptions, or one's &quot;vision,&quot; drives political views - is one he returns to again and again in his books.In fact, though I enjoyed Vision of the Anointed and Cosmic Justice, I found them somewhat redundant. This book seems to be a more fundamental treatment of the topic; I'm glad I read it first."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"This is the first book I ever read by Sowell. I had always avoided reading him because I thought he was a self-hating black person. I also thought all conservatives were inhuman.

At the same time, it clarified things alot of things, differences I had noticed between people, including people I knew. It explains the core beliefs that conservatives have and liberals have and how these lead to different attitudes in politics and other things. Excellent book that requires close reading. You can't read it and watch TV at the same time."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"This book traces the history of the modern Conservative and Liberal &quot;visions&quot; from their beginnings about 200 years ago to the present day. Both views are treated in an apparently even handed maner, with any conclusions left to the reader. The results, however, may come as a revelation to many readers, since the differences explain many of the reasons for the seeming decline of morals and values in America today, and the apparent corruption of our political system. In particular, the book answers questions such as why are Conservatives judged by higher (or at least different) standards than their Liberal counterparts; why do some politicians feel free to lie to their constituents if it serves their ends; why has our Constitution been ignored by our lawmakers, and why does it continue to be ignored; what is the difference between Communism and Socialism; and why do some politicians consider themselves to be the so-called &quot;elite&quot; who know what is best for their fellow Americans. In short, this book is a MUST READ for anyone desiring to understand today's America and what makes it tick."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Dr. Sowell wrote an amazing book, that deeply impressed me since the first page I read, attaining a level that I only knew previously in Karl Popper, Friederich Hayek and, perhaps, Murray Rothbard.The author depicts the main characteristics of the two antagonic ideological visions that, at least since the 18th century, fight each other in the western world's political arena, not unusually at a very hot level - the constrained vision (or the right / conservative) and the unconstrained vision (or the left / liberal), being himself, as it is widely known, an obvious follower of the constrained vision.Summing up the finely erudite analysis of dr. Sowell, we can conclude that, contrarily to the unconstrained vision, the constrained one prefers common sense to emotion, reality to utopia, the best world possible to the ideal world, the real man of ever to the new man, and reformation to revolution, resulting that differences from the way each one faces that same man: the constrained looks him as an imperfect and decayed creature, with unchangeable vices and tendencies, so, to her, the most effective policy that can be taken is the one that tries to conciliate such a nature with common social good, puting the first working for the profit of the second; inversely, the unconstrained, facing man as a small god, believing blindly in the unlimited capacities of reason and in the complete maleability of man's characther, intends to built, in her most radical version, paradise on earth, but, despising simple truths about human nature, only reachs...hell.This a superb book that I highly recommend to everybody, specially persons from the conservative and non-political correct family."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"I had just finished reading Michael Dyson's \\"Is Bill Cosby Right?\\". Then I read this book of Sowell's. African Americans, including myself, have rejected Sowell out of hand because he does not line up with the orthodoxy of Dyson or the typical civil rights perspective. This is because I did not realize how thoroughly Sowell understands the issues and the philosophies behind it and the opposite views. You just do not realize his grasps on things if you go by what people say or get turned off by one of his articles in the newspaper. Not only does he understand Dyson's position, he opened my eyes to the \\"other side's\\" position in a way that made me a believer. Now I know why he says what he says in his other books and they make real sense. I am buying copies of this book for other African Americans I know and am encouraging my young adult children to read it too. If you have never read Sowell, this is the place to start."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Most of us who regularly engage in political debate are frequently frustrated by the apparent lack of sense in our opponents' responses to our arguments. Whatever the issue,we lay out our case in an orderly manner, but we find that no one on the other side seems capable of grasping it. Instead of vigorous but constructive debate, we end up either screaming at each other or deciding against continuing the exchange. We are convinced that our opponents are either too dense to be worthy of further effort or are motivated by some truly unsavory considerations. We end up discussing controversial issues with only those who already agree with us, and this is hardly a good practice in a nation increasingly susceptible to the consequences of faction.The problem, as Dr. Sowell points out in the first part of this insightful book, is that we and our opponents are usually talking past each other. We and they are starting from different &quot;visions&quot; of how the world (human nature) operates, and the fundamental assumptions upon which each side is basing its arguments are buried several layers beneath the surface issues that are the focus of our attention. Without resolving this underlying disagreement -- this conflict of visions -- the debate on surface issues will continue to prove futile.There are two perspectives that, between them, dominate the modern world: the &quot;constrained&quot; and the &quot;unconstrained&quot; visions of human nature. The constrained vision, the one upon which what is loosely termed &quot;conservative&quot; thinking is based, holds that the civilized demeanor of man is but a thin and fragile barrier against his immoral inclinationsand his amoral animal nature. Successful social and political policy is based, therefore, on proven methods of restraining these undesireable traits to a degree that will engender security and prosperity for society. This view also recognizes human nature as immutable, so that each generation, accepting or rejecting the experiences and traditions (institutionalized experiences) of the past, decides whether or not the veneer of civilization will remain intact.In contrast, the unconstrained vision holds that man is basically good and that it is only the unfavorable circumstances in which he finds himself that cause him to fall short. If we gain enough knowledge on how to improve those circumstances, this view holds, then we can eliminate the disagreeable aspects of human behavior (there is no immutable human nature) and make the world a better place in which to live. It will take a few who are enlightened and good enough to lead the rest of us out of our current predicament, and only our stubborn resistance to these &quot;anointed&quot; few can retard our ascension to the secular heaven that they will create for us. The French Revolution was the first major laboratory for the implementation of this vision, and this century in particular has suffered the bloody consequences of its messianic zeal.After describing the two visions, Dr. Sowell uses the rest of the book to demonstrate how each perspective leads to the positions taken on current issues. It is clear from his explanations that he subscribes to the constrained vision, but he leaves it to a subsequent work, The Vision of the Anointed, to detail the workings of the unconstrained vision and its destructive effects as the predominant vision of our times. Together, these two volumes provide the reader with an understanding of the basis of the prevailing nonsense. This understanding, combined with a deeper understanding our our own philosophical foundations, can be a great aid in turning our nation to the right path."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Some others have already commented on the basic premise of the book: the dichotomy between a constrained and unconstrained view of human nature and the logical conclusions and \\"visions\\" that arise based on that difference, so I will leave that summary aside.This book is a fantastic read for many reasons: the writing style is incredibly clear and simple, and Sowell is adept at conveying his ideas in a manner that should be easily understandable to any reader. Sowell appears to show a commendable level of detachment in that there does not seem to be much of a personal value judgement placed on either of the two schools of vision (i.e. without reading other texts, the reader may not be able to distinguish whether Sowell places himself within the \\"constrained\\" or \\"unconstrained\\" vision).Another reviewer commented that this dichotomy was rather simplistic, and I tend to agree. However, I see this as a strength rather than a weakness. Sowell gives a more general view of the derivation of certain viewpoints and the logical implications of a certain conception without getting distracted by every specific application. He does not explain every thought or viewpoint, but he provides an exceptionally clear framework through which you can view these thoughts and viewpoints on your own.I found the quotes he used to be very illuminating, but I agree that they should be viewed in the proper light. The quotes are interesting as articulations of the \\"constrained\\" or \\"unconstrained\\" views in the particular context in which they are used, and should probably not be carried beyond that. For example, characterizing a particular decision of Holmes as arising from the constrained view is instructive and illustrative, though it could lead to the erroneous assumption that Holmes was a consitent examplar of the constrained vision. That said, the quotes were certainly not misleading if the reader confines them to their context and they tended to clarify and enhance illustrations of the application of these views.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever heard someone espouse a certain viewpoint and thought \\"How can they possibly believe that?\\" It provides a good basis for understanding how these differences arise."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"This is a must read. It is my favorite among the many Thomas Sowell books I've read. Sowell establishes a dichotomy that explains why, for example, a person who favors high public spending would tend to be \\"pro choice\\" and favor gun control and why people who favor less public spending tend to line up on the opposite side of the gun control and social issues debates - even though the issues themselves don't seem to be related on the surface. Sowell provides a very useful framework - the Unconstrained Vision of Man which sees Man as perfectible and tends to emphasize book knowledge over other forms of knowledge like tradition and custom, which the Constrained (Conservative) Vision of Man gives greater importance. Nassim Taleb touches on this in his latest book, but Sowell's treatment of epistemology is much better developed. This book has helped me become more consistent across my views as a member of the Constrained Vision camp, but the book is written from a neutral point of view and Progressives will find it beneficial as well."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Dr. Sowell does a spectacular job examining the opposing visions in our ongoing national debate about governing. Without getting into the \\"conservative\\" or \\"liberal\\" nametags, he examines the progress of society and the effects of what leadership advocates: should our leaders create rules and regulations controlling exactly what society will do based on their insight, intelligence and wisdom (think Mayor Bloomberg) or should leaders set the stage to encourage certain behaviours and let society operate freely with minimal control by government (think the US Constitution). If you want to understand the visions that politicians and the media promote and the effects that those visions have on where we are going, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"I'm still reading this book, one of his I bought after reading many of his articles published on various websites. He is a true scholar, not unlike W.F. Buckley, Jr. in his writings and convincing common sense offerings on various topics of current interest. His intellectual journey through academia didn't start with any conservative-leaning viewpoint to be sure. He was an avowed liberal in his early days, but kept an open mind on all issues, as opposed to those in academia that swallow the \\"progressive\\" dogma obediently if they wish to be \\"in the club\\" of academic know-it-alls that have never been outside their ivy covered halls in their lifetime. Being a black conservative makes him a thorn in the sides of those that surround him but he has always been able to stand his ground using much more solid fundamental footing than his peers with their specious arguments that are void of any honest unadulterated facts. This particular book, \\"A Conflict of Visions\\" sets the agenda for several of his books written after this one, and is recommended as a \\"primer\\" for his subsequent writings. He is thoroughly enjoyable to read on any topic you can think of, and I would highly recommend to the younger generation that wants to escape the nonsensical gibberish coming from their \\"progressive\\" clueless friends and find a wonderful spokesman for the other side of the political aisle. His arguments supporting his viewpoints are extremely difficult for the liberals to deal with and usually leave them groping for answers they just don't have."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"This book explains the two basic philosophies of looking at anything and everything. Read it and understand why people think the way they do about politics, religion, government, finances, etc."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"The most important thing I would say to anyone who reads this book is not to be put off by the terminology. Sowell is brilliant, and he has, I believe, discovered and articulated the key attribute, what he calls the conflicting \\"visions,\\" distinguishing two ideological camps, labeled (inappropriately in my opinion) as the \\"constrained\\" and the \\"unconstrained.\\"The conflicting \\"visions\\" are not merely a set of opinions or points of view. The weakness and vagueness of that label, as well, are misleading and unfortunate. Sowell's \\"vision\\" is like a lens, through which a person with one vision or the other sees some things but is essentially blind to others.The \\"unconstrained\\" are not constrained by the market, human nature, the words in the Constitution, or reality. Instead, the best and the brightest among them, being uniquely smart enough to imagine a better world, decide for the rest of us how we must behave in order to achieve that better world. They are the \\"surrogate decision-makers,\\" as Sowell likes to call them, the Platonic philosopher kings known in the real world as dictators, tyrants, arrogant bureaucrats and activist judges. The result is a libertarian's nightmare, and this is where the terminology seems inappropriate.The most visible attribute of the \\"unconstrained\\" is their obsession with a pernicious form of equality, strained to the point where those who achieve less must be made equal by means of transfers of wealth funding subsidies. The unconstrained reject the notion that such transfers, even when voluntary, constitute charity, believing instead that the beneficiaries are entitled, by notions of \\"social justice,\\" to receive whatever it takes, from anyone possessing it, to make them equal.The rest of us, in this imagined better world designed by the unconstrained, are severely constrained by the decisions made by our surrogates. Those of us who find themselves in Sowell's \\"constrained\\" camp, constrained by their acceptance of human nature for what it is, prefer a world in which individuals are free to make their own decisions, with limited constraints provided by the rule of law and free markets, not surrogates. Such freedom comes much closer to the sense of \\"unconstrained,\\" in my view, than Sowell's version of \\"unconstrained.\\" The terms \\"free\\" and \\"unconstrained\\" are virtually synonymous, in fact, so it seems odd that there would be less freedom in the unconstrained world than in the constrained. (Sowell explains how the unconstrained define \\"freedom\\" differently from the way I would define it, thus illuminating the source of that oddity.)So it is important to keep in mind that Sowell's constrained/unconstrained dichotomy refers to political leaders and the architects of a society and not to its inhabitants.Sowell takes great pains to be even-handed, avoiding advocacy of one vision or the other, and to explain that his labels do not fit well with known political persuasions. It should be clear that I am firmly in the \\"constrained\\" camp, so I am not similarly hobbled by the duty to be neutral. I believe, for example, that libertarians, true libertarians anyway, belong just as firmly in the \\"constrained\\" camp, although Sowell's pains include an effort to show that both visions are represented among libertarians. I would also say that the current (since 2008) political powers in the United States, both presidential and (at least until the 2010 mid-term elections) legislative are firmly in the \\"unconstrained\\" camp. Sowell is, of course, correct (in writing long before 2008) in pointing out the lack of ideological purity (or purity of \\"vision\\") in the political movements of our time. But in doing that, he actually weakens the very point he is making so well -- that his concept of those two conflicting visions goes far in explaining why people of differing political persuasions just don't seem to see the same things.Labeling aside, Sowell's point is well worth the effort to understand and to apply it to the real world. This book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"A Conflict of Visions provides a detailed discussion of the two major political centers in America today.

Worthwhile as an addition to your library, but don't expect to read it in one sitting."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"If you want to know why Republicans believe what they do, and why Democrats believe what they do, read this book. Evenhanded (although Sowell is a conservative market capitalist), this work gives you great insight into the variying politics of freedom, equality, and justice ... regardless which side of an issue you're on. Unlike Sowell's weekly editorial columns, which are pretty easy to read, this work is unnecessarily packed with \\"very large words.\\" Read slow, and keep your dictionary handy, because \\"Conflict Of Visions\\" is truly excellent."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"This is an amazing book. What a great premise. In this book Prof. Sowell argues that the basis of political ideology generally comes from two viewpoints concerning human nature. One, the unrestrained, where man is limitless in his capacity to improve himself and the world, and restrained, where man is forever limited and must rely on reason and caution. Whatever viewpoint one has on human nature naturally is prism for all views on society, issues such as how a government should work, what is real \\"equality\\", what is justice ect.The best part of this book is it generally is unbiased. Thomas Sowell is a conservative economist who works at a conservative institution. However, in his academic works I continue to notice a deep sense of responsibility in not stacking the cards in his position's favor. Sadly in a world where many intellectuals feel far better trumpeting their pesonal agendas, it is good to know there are some in academia who still favor neutrality."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"This is a fascinating book that will change the way you see the world. Like all visions, there is much that is left out or oversimplified by Sowell's analysis. Nevertheless, it is an extremely worthwhile read. Sowell is clearly widely read in economics, political philosophy, and social thought, and the book is remarkable for its ability to convey the essence of complex thinkers like Friedrich Hayek in an easily digestible form. Even if you're read your Smith, Mill, and others, you'll still learn a lot from this book."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Have you ever noticed that people who are conservative differ with peope who are liberal in just about every issue? For example, someone who favors a strong national defense will often be against affirmative action and for cuts in social spending. Sowell attributes this to different visions. The &quot;constrained vision&quot; sees humankind operating under certain constrainst such as Adam Smith's invisible hand. Thus, someone with a constrained vision will be against governmental intervention in economic affairs. Additionally, there are constraints of human nature and therefore, a strong national defense is the best way to prevent war. As to the justice system, the constrained vision sees clear rules, consistently enforced, to be the surest way to justice. In short, the constrained vision seeks just procedures and laws, and does not concern itself with results. The constrained vision seeks a &quot;strict constructionist&quot; interpretation of the Constitution.The &quot;unconstrained vision&quot; sees, in humankind, unlimited possibilities. Usually, the faith in these possibilities is placed in a ruling elite. Therefore, a liberal will support a government deciding what is best for us and seeking just results at the expense of just procedures. If everyone receives equal treatment but the results favor one class over another, the unconstrained vision seeks to substitute the judgment of the ruling elite over the collective wisdom of those who framed our Constitution and other procedures. As to national defense, the unconstrained vision has confidence that reason and good will can prevail and that strong military dterrence is, therefore, unnecessary.Of course, the unconstrained vision is not necessarily restricted to liberalism. Indeed under Nazism there was certainly a strong element of an unconstrained vision. True, there were contstraints of extreme nationalism and rascism but, the dictators under Nazism &amp; fascism had the discretion to ssek the ends they determined to be right and certainly, they had the discretion to control and dictate the means to these ends.Visions can, and sometimes do change. For example, former Communists have recanted and adopted a very different vision. Also, the two visions are not 100 percent pure. There is a degree of hybridism. However,, social theories are not as readily able to be proven scientifically by experiment as are theories in the applied sciences. Therefore, evidence is interpreted and often made to support our own visions. All in all, Sowell's analysis explains why people hold the views they do."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"I must admit I found Thomas Sowell somewhat difficult to understand. However, given the abstract nature of the book, I'm not sure many writers could have written much better. But once you get into the frame of mind and synchronize with Sowell's presentation flow, it becomes readily apparent that this man is a deep thinker with useful insights into the basis for political ideologies. The book is not especially historical with regards to shifts in political attitudes. However, he does present political ideologies in such a way that allows the reader to compare and contrast and to understand the essential basis for the differences in those ideologies. A definite must-read for the political junkie and certainly for any political science student. Just be prepared to concentrate like you never have before and I think you too will appreciate the insights of Thomas Sowell."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"I read this book shortly after reading Moral Politics by George Lakoff and find A Conflict of Vision superior. The contrast in Sowell's book is between the constrained and unconstrained vision of man.The unconstrained vision of man sees man as perfectable, a blank slate to be moulded into a morally superior being. With the proper education and training any person can grow to be what can be termed perfect. Those with this vision strive to create laws and institutions to better man and based on the future potential of man.The constrained vision of man sees man as fundamentally limited in intelligence and capacity, with relatively stable characteristics from person to person. People with this vision seek to create laws and institutions acknowledging these limitations, trying to minimize traits seen as bad, while maximizing traits seen as good.Naturally, these two visions create a vast gulf between people with differing visions of man. Because of this, when a person with an unconstrained vision of man talks with a person with a constrained vision of man, they often talk past each other because the basic assumption each are making are completely different.Sowell, is, as ever, insightful, providing a clear writing style, which is easy to understand. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"In this classic yet relevant book, Thomas Sowell builds his case and lays out his ideas as to why we continually see \\"the same people line up on opposite sides of different issues,\\" even though \\"the issues themselves may have no intrinsic connection with each other.\\" Sowell does an exemplary job of explaining how \\"political struggles\\" are always the result of \\"ideological origins.\\"Sowell asserts that our \\"visions\\" (a.k.a. worldviews) are what shape our thinking both politically and socially. A \\"vision\\" as Sowell puts it is \\"our sense of how the world works [and]...the foundation on which theories are built.\\" Sowell states that our visions are the causation of our ideological positions and that visions \\"set the agenda for both thought and action.\\"With this foundation in place he moves on to defining what he thinks are the two paramount visions undergirding American society (and the rest of the world) today. Sowell outlines what he calls the \\"constrained\\" and \\"unconstrained\\" vision, yet not everyone's ideological viewpoints are completely encompassed in either vision alone. There is room for variance, and as a result moderate versions of each vision naturally exist. Accordingly, Sowell defines the conflicting visions as \\"two broad categories\\" that encapsulate the majority of the world's population.The constrained vision very much follows in the tradition of the classic realist paradigm. In fact, one could say that the constrained vision is actually realism with a different name. Just as the constrained vision fits nicely with the realist paradigm, the unconstrained vision is a representation of the liberal paradigm. As expected, both views create a polarization, which typically draws conservatives to the constrained vision and liberals to the unconstrained.In defining the two visions, Sowell focuses initially on their view of human nature. By establishing the opposing views of human nature as the foundations of the opposing visions, he then builds upon them in the rest of the book. Sowell also does a nice job of crystallizing the differences between the two opposing viewpoints while trying to remain neutral in his assessment. However, the nuances present in the book suggest that Sowell is a proponent of the constrained vision. So it is this central theme, the differing views of human nature, that I will discuss because all things flow from them.In defining the nature of man, Sowell writes that those in the constrained vision view human nature as flawed and corrupt. Echoing the realists, Sowell quotes Edmund Burke as speaking of \\"a radical infirmity in all human contrivances\\", describing how he sees an infirmity (or degeneracy) present in all things. And thus, conflict is inevitable. With a world full of malice, the best that can be sought is a trade-off or compromise when dealing with policies and conflicts. An actual and ultimate solution is not possible because man is malicious and ultimately self-seeking.However the unconstrained vision paints a different picture of man; that he is perfectible (or \\"continually improvable\\"). Advocates of the unconstrained vision assert that man is inherently good and that malevolence is only present in the world because of the limitations placed on mans natural freedoms by \\"wretched social arrangements\\" and institutions. Therefore, when the institutions and policies that hinder man's freedom are removed, a solution can be found or achieved. Man is now free to pursue freedom.Therefore the followers of the unconstrained vision often seek solutions to social problems whereas those in the constrained vision only seek only to help or temporarily be of assistance. Sowell writes that \\"the constrained vision is a tragic vision of the human condition [whereas] ...the unconstrained vision is a moral vision of human intentions, which are viewed as ultimately decisive.\\"As a result of their contrasting view of human nature, the believer in the constrained vision sees human government and institutions as necessary. Human institutions exist to keep peace and safety in society. In essence: depraved mankind needs a strong hand to police him. Historically, we see the constrained vision demonstrated in Thomas Hobbes' seminal work, Leviathan. Hobbes states that without the Leviathan ruling over mankind, life would only be \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\\"In stark contrast, the unconstrained view of government institutions is one of contempt. Institutions are viewed as holding man down and keeping him from his ideal state of being. Sowell masterfully writes, \\"When Rousseau said that man \\"is born free\\" but \\"is everywhere in chains,\\" he expressed the essence of the unconstrained vision, in which the fundamental problem is not nature or man but institutions.\\" The supporter of the unconstrained vision will state that men are not naturally enemies; but that they are made into enemies.Sowell goes on throughout his book to describe the many differences between the constrained and unconstrained visions. Such differences are the use of knowledge and reason, experience, education, equality, power and justice. Yet all of these are built on and flow from ones view of human nature. Consequently, this is why I believe the crux of the Sowell's book is found in his description of differing views of human nature."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"First, let me preface this by saying I am a huge fan of Thomas Sowell. I read his columns religiously and have read many of his other books--the entire second half of my copy of \\"Vision of the Anointed\\" is copiously dog-eared, highlighted and asterisk'd. I am not the partisan opposition.That said, this book was stupefyingly dull. In \\"Vision,\\" I read some passages over and over, amazed at their profundity. Likewise, on 3 or 4 occasions I did the same thing in this book. However, to get to those 3-4 profound paragraphs you have to slog through 250+ pages of the dryest material you'll ever run across. This thing reads like a philosophy textbook (or the \\"ChomskyBot:\\" search for it on Google). It requires an incredible deal of concentration to make sense. It seemed that no one sentence, or collection of two or three sentences, had independent meaning. I had to read an entire paragraph or page just to get a glimpse of the superficial meaning of a concept Sowell was trying to explain. As a whole the thesis and book itself are meaningful, but there are so many paragraphs that could have been left out on account of their mind-numbing redundancy (another reviewer mentioned this) or because the message was so nebulous.As an example, here is a fairly characteristic sentence from the book:Social decisions evolve systematically from the interactions of individual discretion, exercised for individual benefit, in the constrained vision--servicing the common good only as an individually unintended consequence of the characteristics of systemic processes such as a competitive market economy (p. 103).Now this passage has meaning, but if you have the attention span or ability to concentrate of a mere mortal (like myself), this will be VERY difficult reading. It's hard to believe the average person could grasp the meaning of this book after even three reads.In summary, despite a couple of profound passages and overall meaningful message, this book is bogged down by its own redundancy, opacity and length."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"This book is a thorough analysis of the polar differences between \\"conservative\\" and \\"liberal\\" viewpoints. The author's beliefs are clear, but the argument is persuasive. Most issues are neither black nor white, but shades of gray. Most policies are decided as a compromise between the polar extremes. This book brings bright clarity to the analysis of complex social and political issues, and explains with conviction the differences between conservative and liberal ideas of social decision-making."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"An excellent book. I know of nothing else published in the last several decades that sheds more light on the underlying structure of all facets of contemporary discussion on public policy. However, the book's insights also illuminate far more widely than that: just one important example would be how people choose to raise and discipline their children. The book examines, from a scholarly and historical perspective, the two primary sets of underlying assumptions people hold about human nature. Since these assumptions are usually not consciously considered or questioned by an adherent of either camp, and since a person then usually presumes these assumptions are obvious facts describing the world, an adherent of an opposing camp in any debate appears, at best, severely misguided to, at worst, underhandedly malevolent. The two sets of assumptions (called by Sowell: Visions) contradict each other, so both cannot be true (neither might have been, at least, in all of their particulars). However, Dr. Sowell waits until his subsequent book, &quot;The Vision of the Annointed,&quot; to adduce the historical, sociological, and psychological evidence that decides which of the Visions indeed reflects reality. I recommend reading &quot;A Conflict of Visions&quot; first since it prepares the stage and does not take sides. I think a reader would find &quot;Vision of the Annointed&quot; somewhat polemical and tendentious otherwise, especially if he or she subscribed to that Vision whose tenets are in there debunked. (This strategy would help the reader to maintain an open mind; a person unconvincibly reading a book is wasting his time.) I found Sowell's tone very forgiveable since he decries, obviously sincerely, the destructive effects on countless lives spanning centuries (and continuing) of the state policies derived from the mistaken and failed Vision; while salutary courses of action, based on the alternative Vision, were always available, usually discussed, and often ignored."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"This book is superbly written. It's tone has an intellectual bent but not stuffy and dry. The theories postulated jump from the pages as facts we see over and over on a daily basis. Like it or not, we each lean toward a particular school of thought in politics, economics, law, education, etc...indeed in daily life. Mr. Sowell explains why it seems these processes all can be categotized into only two schools of thought, \\"constrained\\" and \\"un-constrained\\". As I read this book, I was completely taken by how absolutely correct his postulations are. This book explains why the \\"other side\\" acts as it does in all facets of life. It has shown to me that the other side ( in my case the other side being the \\"un-constrained\\" side...liberals) doesn't always oppose us out of malice. They always oppose us out of malice, tempered with the fact that that's just the way they think. I re-read the book during Gulf War II and as I watch the shrill screeches of the war protestors on TV the truths stated in this book come through with astounding clarity and relevance. As you watch a political debate, the book's ideas will come to mind. As you hear a legal point debated before the Supreme Court, you will remember passages and quotes from the book.

Bush to be a war criminal. Where do you think he stands on constitutional interpretation? Do you think he is more on the activist constitution side or more on the side of determining the document's original intent? I am not asking for certainty, just what do you think his opinion on the issue is.Let us be honest.

Even for Sowell, one of the top intellectuals of our time, this book stands out as particularly important.As Sowell demonstrates, the answer lies not with the specifics of whatever issue is at hand. Rather, the answer lies in the ideological vision with which one perceives the world. Although Sowell acknowledges that ideological visions span a continuum, he nonetheless isolates two particular visions with very different outlooks. Most of the continuum is really a shading of one of these two.The constrained vision views man as inherently very limited, both in his knowledge and, by implication, in what he is able to accomplish in terms of creating a functioning society. The unconstrained vision, however, views humans as being, if not totally without limits, then far, far more capable of unleashing our human potential to create a better world for us all. It is this difference in outlooks that produces similar opinions among various people even on issues that, on the surface, appear to be very different.Those with the constrained vision and those with the unconstrained have outlooks on social processes and knowledge that are not only very different, but often in direct conflict with each other. As Sowell demonstrates, this leads to very different outlooks on such large topics as equality, power and justice. Those with the unconstrained vision advocate policies far more ambitious based on their vision that we can achieve particular goals in these areas. Those with the constrained vision, by contrast, are more modest, see human imperfection as inherently limiting in these areas and advocate social structures that allow for the best under the circumstances. One of the fundamental differences between the visions is that those with the unconstrained vision focus on goals in the first place, while those with the constrained vision focus on processes, with no particular goal being more desirable, let alone attainable, than another.One interesting aspect of Sowell's analysis is that those with one vision will view those with a competing vision very differently and that this is a result of the actual vision itself. For those with the constrained vision, the unconstrained vision is viewed as nave though perhaps well intentioned. But the view from the other side is quite different. For those with the unconstrained vision, we could achieve a far more just society if it were not for those barriers, both ideological and social, in our way preventing us from doing so. In fact, those with the unconstrained vision are so certain of their ability to achieve certain goals that they do not even ask the more fundamental question of whether such goals are worth achieving in the first place, even if that were possible. Imagine their surprise - and contempt - when they encounter others who not only question the practicability of achieving equality or justice or whatever, but the desire to even do so given the definition that the unconstrained vision brings to the table. Although Friedrich Hayek, an intellectual giant with a very constrained vision, was courteous towards his intellectual adversaries, the courtesy was most certainly not returned. Hayek's opponents trashed him as evil incarnate.A CONFLICT OF VISIONS is probably the single best book of its kind examining the role of ideological visions in shaping various societies' policies. It is not a polemical book like some of Sowell's others and, if one did not know where Sowell himself fell on the ideological spectrum, one probably would not be able to figure it out from this volume. It is highly recommended for those seeking a deeper understanding of the differences we see among the populace not simply with respect to particular issues, but how they view such issues in a larger framework to begin with."},{"Title":"A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles","review":"Why? Because it provides the clearest explanation I've ever read of the primal undercurrent that has driven Western thought along its binary path (collective vs individual) over the past 500 years."},{"Title":"On the Fringe (Severn House Mysteries)","review":"This is the latest in the series of books about young professional golfer Lee and her boyfriend (now fiancee) detective Graham. Until now, the formula has been that a murder happens at a golf tournament in which Lee is involved, which she solves with the help of Graham and her friend Peg. However, this time what is missing from that is the \\"golf tournament\\" part.Lee has been invited as a guest to an exclusive Hawaiian private golf club. There are a few amusing bits where Lee (who grew up poor and playing on public courses) is exposed to the traditions of a private golf club where the \\"club\\" aspect is really more important than the \\"golf\\" aspect.There is a mysterious lost treasure, and then there is a murder. Lee becomes involved, as do Graham and Peg. But without the narrative structure (and implied pressure) of the golf tournament in the background, the story does not have the same intensity that the previous books have had. And Graham seems less and less a character and more and more a convenient plot device.Peg and Lee are more developed characters, but they also are starting to seem a bit stale. The best bits in the novel concern the wacky old codgers who run the club, but they are really only the supporting cast. There should be some central structure for everything else to hang off of, and it seems to be lacking. In short, there is a large, golf tournament shaped hole in the middle of the plot."},{"Title":"On the Fringe (Severn House Mysteries)","review":"I am not at all disappointed there is no tournament. I failed to figure out whodunit, which is good, because if on rare occasion I do, I tend to think the author has not been sufficiently clever.

I am sorry there will be no more of this series, but happy Elkins continues to write, and hopefully will continue to be published. I have been a fan since day one - library books, I'm afraid - and recently have been catching up. I had been hoping more would be in audio, but that's not to be, apparently.

Characters name change (for example, he would be called &#34;Gary&#34; in one chapter and the next chapter it's &#34;Phillip&#34; -- forgotten the actual name, but you understand the problem). If this was a movie the continuity person would be fired. Worse, there were actual areas where you can see the editing process at work -- entire sentences with a line through them.

The benefits are many -- element rather than document-centric processing being a main one -- but come at the cost of a Microsoft-specific XML processing.In any case, to make the best decision as to which to use, it's best to consultPro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C# 2008 (Windows.Net).

She is an absolute tyrant who rules her family with fear and the possibility of losing her financial backing. She does not allow them to have contact with outsiders and even arranges a marriage for her oldest son when he seems inclined to seek out a bride. In a departure from the norm, Mrs. Boynton suggests a trip to Jerusalem and brings her family with her. They are accompanied by a family friend, two physicians, two ladies, and Hercule Poirot. Poirot overhears two of the adult Boynton children plotting to kill their mother and he uses this evidence as a beginning to investigate the eventual murder of the old lady. Everyone has a motive, as Mrs. Boynton was rude and obnoxious to everyone she met, so this case takes all of Poirot's deductive powers to figure out the actual murderer.

Characterizations have a bit more psychological depth here than in her other books; the monstrous mother and the near-psychotic daughter, in particular, stand out as memorable creations.Read the book and the play; Christie adapted the novel for the stage herself, and made two changes: she removed Poirot, and changed the identity of the murderer. Typical of Christie, both versions of the story work equally well."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"Like all of Agatha Christie's books this one is very good. Written to make you think.

In truth, the conversation is being shared in deadly earnestness between two siblings Raymond and Carol Boynton in relation to their sadistic, tyrannical mother. The extended Boynton family, including son Lennox Boynton and his wife, Raymond and Carol, and youngest sister Ginevra, are traveling throughout the Middle-East on a holiday that revolves around their mother/stepmother/mother-in-law's whims and wishes.This attracts the strong dislike of fellow travelers, including Sarah King (who has her eye on Raymond) and Theodore Gerard, both doctors, who train their professional eye on the American family. Psychologically examining them in a way that is quite fascinating, they come to the conclusion that Mrs Boynton is a manipulative, domineering woman who gets sadistic pleasure out of the control she wields over those around her. Together the doctors establish the mindset of the apathetic Lennox, the rebellious Nadine, the despairing Raymond and Carol, and little Ginevra, who escapes her mother by entering an internal fantasy world. Sarah eventually confronts the malignant old woman, and gets a strange threat in reply: \\"I've never forgotten anything - not an action, not a name, not a face.\\"Then, as the traveling party moves from Jerusalem to Petra, the Red Rose City, (beautifully described thanks to Christie's own travels with her archeologist husband), Mrs Boynton uncharacteristically lets her family leave her unattended for an afternoon and evening. When dinner is called, Mrs Boynton is found dead.It would seem somewhat straightforward - Mrs Boynton suffered from heart trouble, and after the exertion of the day, it's unsurprising that she would pass away in the heat. But Doctor Gerard is not entirely convinced, particularly when he realizes that one of his hypodermic needles has gone missing) and calls in none other than Colonel Carbury and Hercule Poirot to look over the situation.Promising a solution in less than twenty-four hours, Poirot interviews the suspects, wades through the mass of contractions, confusions and lies (including an egregious timeline in which several people spoke to Mrs Boynton *after* Sarah King claims she must have died) and - sure enough - knows exactly what happened by the deadline he set for himself.Although this is not one of Poirot's/Christie's best cases, it is still an ingenious mystery with strong characterization in regards to its victims and suspects. \\"Appointment with Death\\" is more of a psychological thriller, in which the personalities, behaviour and motivations of each Boynton family member is carefully diagnosed by Gerard and Sarah. Mrs Boynton in particular is a horror of a character, described as \\"a monstrous swollen female Buddha\\" and whose power and influence extends out even from beyond the grave. She's enough to give you nightmares.There have been two film adaptations of this novel, one starring Peter Ustinov:Appointment With Death [Region 2] (which remains faithful to the storyline), and the other as part of the Hercule Poirot BBC series starring David Suchet (which makes drastic changes and omissions in the story, though is still an entertaining watch)."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"Once again, Christie has written a mystery with an ending I didn't see coming. This time, I can't decide if I think she left enough clues to lead to the culprit, however. Normally, I find myself saying \\"oh, yeah!\\" as I read the outcome, but this time I thought it was a little shaky. But, as usual, Christie does a beautiful job fleshing out the characters of a well-rounded cast, with plenty of doubt cast among almost all of them. I changed my mind a few different times as to the possible outcome, but still didn't get it right!I love that Christie devotes pages and pages of detail leading up to the murder, rather than just starting the book out with the murder then recounting everything that had happened through the various characters' eyes. I find myself always paying close attention to what is happening and storing away possible useful information, just waiting for Poirot to start his investigation. This particular book also had an epilogue that I thought was interesting and I appreciated it for this story. Despite what I think may be a lack of evidence to point towards the culprit, I think that anyone who likes mysteries would enjoy this book. Agatha Christie never fails to please!(Additional Note: My actual rating is 4-1/2 stars but I round up for sites like Amazon.)"},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"I was very surprised at the exceptional condition of the book. It really is wonderful to be able to aquire books from so many different places when, up till now, I've been unable to get them from conventional book stores."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"Agatha Christie is well-known for the twists that are in her mystery stories, but should receive just as much renown for her psychological examinations within certain mysteries. \\"Appointment With Death\\" is much more the psychological study of a family and those involved with them, than it is with the murder at the heart of the story. Therefore, the novel is heavy on character development and motive for murder, and lighter in terms of mystery and crime.Mrs. Boynton was a mental sadist, a woman who loved holding her family captive to her every whim and fancy, allowing them no freedom of thought or action. Enclosed in their own world and oblivious to any difference, a trip to Jerusalem finally makes her children aware of how miserable their lives are. Two of the children come to the conclusion that she must be killed, especially to protect the youngest child, but hardly know how to carry out the deadly act. So when their mother is found dead (and murder is believed) all of the children are immediate suspects to Hercule Poirot, but also among each other.\\"Appointment With Death\\" is as fast-paced as any of Christie's other works. Hercule Poirot is more of a minor character until the latter part of the book when he pieces together all of the evidence to arrive at the truth of who killed Mrs. Boynton. The chapters in which he lays out motive and means for the innocence and guilt of each member of the Boynton family is both exhilarating and frustrating, but it shows the remarkable plotting that Christie had to explain the criminal elements in her books. While not the best Poirot mystery, \\"Appointment With Death\\" is an enjoyable read with plenty of motives to keep the reader guessing the identity of the culprit."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"It is not uncommon for a mystery writer to delve into the psychological study of a character. What makes &quot;Appointment With Death&quot; stand out is that Christie does a psychological study on an entire family. The emotionally unbalanced Boyntons consist of the cruelly sadistic Mrs. Boynton, the near-schizophrenic daughter Ginevra, stepchildren Raymond and Carol who are eager to escape the confines of their stepmother, an older stepson Lennox and his wife Nadine who remains alone in being undisturbed by the influence of the terrible matriarch.The setting for this mystery is exotic Jerusalem where the Boyntons have come on holiday to visit the Holy Land. Christie excels in providing local color and this novel ranks among her best in that area.Perhaps no reader will be shocked that Mrs. Boynton is murdered or that Hercule Poirot just happens to be on holiday in the same area and agrees to assist the local police in solving the crime. What will be intriguing is the long list of suspects, motives, and opportunities. Also, in typical Christie fashion, will be a surprising twist that leaves the reader saying &quot;Now why didn't I see that coming?&quot; A great read filled with red herrings and the type of descriptive writing that Agatha Christie excels in.This book became popular with the release of the 1988 movie starring Peter Ustinov as Poirot and Lauren Bacall as Mrs. Boynton.

Of course the conversation comes back to haunt him as he again crosses paths with the speakers.This is another of Christie's dysfunctional families, this time the problem parent is the mother instead of her usual tyrannical father. The Boynton family consists of Mrs. Boynton, grossly overweight, in poor health and whose chief occupation is to torment her family. She has three adult step children, Lennox (married to Nadine), Raymond and Carol and her own daughter, Ginevra. While on an excursion to Petra Mrs. Boynton dies leaving the question of natural causes or murder as the cause. If it is murder was it committed by one of the family or another member of the group?Poirot is consulted by a local offical to sort out the mess which of course he does but not without suffering the hardships of the desert - so hard on patent leather shoes!This 1937 novel is one of Christie's 'psychological' mysteries where much time is spent on motive and character development. The result is that by the end of the novel the reader feels personally acquainted with many of the characters. Also this is set in the Middle East where Christie spent much time herself and gives the novel an insight on the area and travel in those times. It is an excellent mystery, all clues are fairly laid out for the reader to sort out and still quite enjoyable and challenging nearly 70 years later."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"As in some of her books, Christie explores the issue of moral standards. Is it okay to kill someone if they are truly evil and oppress everyone around them? This is the case in a slightly unusual and intriguing book.Who would be so desperate to kill their mother and grandmother? The question stays at the center of the book as you realize each family member had ample motive. After all, the grandmother that was murdered controlled her relatives while slowly choking the life away...You will find yourself questioning the situation and wondering what you would do if you had to do something...as either the oppressed--or as the law.Christie takes this book beyond frivolous murder and into a perhaps even controversial set of events. It is worth reading as her efforts to produce an above-average mystery are apparent."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"In Petra, Mrs. Boynton, the thoroughly evil mother of several children, dies a mysterious death. Hercule Poirot is visiting and decides to help to locate the murderer. Poirot has inside knowledge, as he heard two of the Boynton children discussing the murder beforehand.One of my favorite Poirots."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"Mrs. Boynton sorrowfully reached her \\"appointment with death\\" sooner than usual in Agatha Christie's enthralling book. The twisting plot and realistic characters keep you on the edge of your seat as you wade deeper into the unpredictable story. Agatha Christie's magic has once again weaved its way into one of her finest stories, Appointment with Death. Everyone is on their feet cheering the Belgian detective, Hercules Poirot, as he uses his \\"little gray cells\\" in order to determine not who would kill Mrs. Boynton, but who would not kill this old, cruel witch.The characters, although not my favorite part of this book, were unlike any I have ever read about before. Mrs. Boynton a cruel, power-hungry, old woman is hated by everyone in this enriching plot. She is a failure with a thirst for power that is fed by bossing around her family. Everyone has a reasonable motive for killing Mrs. Boynton, especially her \\"devoted\\" yet unhappy family. Hercules Poirot is the other main character in this book. He is possibly the most important. He is a Belgian detective who is extremely proud of two things, his mustache and his \\"little gray cells.\\" He sets out to examine the suspicious circumstances and bring the clever murderer into the spotlight.Murderers on the run with a brilliant Belgian detective hot on the trail... plots don't get much more exciting than that. This is the exciting plot expressed in Agatha Christie's Appointment with Death. The captivity faced by Mrs. Boynton's family, and the prospect of one of the family being the horrible murderer is almost too much to bear. One of the great things about the plot is that the emotion displayed pulls you into the story. This plot was so unexpected and complex that I was kept guessing as to the murderer's identity until the very end. The only way to truly express the feeling put into the plot is to say that Agatha Christie's light shines again.The only thing in this book that thoroughly disappointed me was the setting. It did not take away from the rest of the book, however, it did not add \\"wow\\" factor to the story. I felt like it was a normal everyday setting and that is not what I was looking for in Agatha Christie's book. The setting helped make the whole story more believable, but most mystery lovers are not looking for a realistic, believable book. Instead they are looking for an exciting thrilling book. I felt that Agatha Christie did not live up to her name with this setting.Appointment with Death was, overall, a thrilling mystery book. I was thoroughly delighted with Agatha Christie's effort and felt that her feelings showed throughout it. The plot and characters added a breathtaking \\"wow\\" factor that kept me up all night reading this book. The setting, although not bad, did not contribute anything unique to the book. Overall, it was a great book for mystery readers of all ages. Agatha Christie has done it again, creating one of the world's finest mystery stories."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"&quot;You see, don't you, that she's got to be killed?&quot;Hercule Poirot overhears those words as he travels. They are spoken by a young man named Raymond Boynton to his sister Carol. &quot;She&quot; is their stepmother, a hideous old woman with a talent for mental sadism. She keeps her stepchildren (and natural daughter, who is a schizophrenic) dangling like puppets, doing whatever she says. Lennox, the oldest, has retreated into mute uncaring, and his wife is threatening to leave him. Raymond has fallen in love with the beautiful Sarah King, and lovely young Jinny is beginning to go over the edge.Then Mrs. Boynton is killed. And Hercule Poirot must unravel not who would kill her, but who WOULDN'T kill her.This is one of those mysteries where the murdered person is so loathsome that even if you don't approve of the murder, you DO cheer when it happens. The plot is tight and complex, the characters are excellent, and the ending will surprise, shock, and satisfy you."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"This was my first Agatha Christie book, and I got it only after I realised that Hercule Poirot was the hero! Poirot has been the subject of a series of well acted TV programmes, each of which portrays one book. The actor who plays Poirot is superb and inspired me to read the books, hence my choice to buy &quot;Appointment With Death&quot;. My previous preference for Mystery books has been P.D.James, who is also excellent (Her book &quot;A Taste For Death&quot; kept me hooked from start to finish!)The book added to the TV version/image of Poirot but Agatha Christie's writing really makes you feel as though you were there. As I was reading about their trip to Jerusalem, I found myself feeling the heat and the pent up frustrations of the characters. I also came to intensely dislike the murder victim and I am sorry to report that I thought the mother should have been murdered years before!!The end had a good twist, and the epilogue is also great. I recommend this as a good buy, especially for a new Agatha fan."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"Appointment With Death, is probably my personal favourite from all the Poirot mysteries. The atmosphere to the story is claustrophobic and stifling, and the setting of Jerusalem and the red city of Petra is just perfect for a murder mystery. (As are all her books set in the middle east)I first read this book four years ago, and even when i came to re-read it, the vile character of Mrs Boynton was still very much fresh and real in my mind. She is, in my opinion, one of the most memorable characters ever written. (By Agatha Christie or anyone else.)As with all the best Poirot stories (\\"Cat Among the Pigeons\\", for example) the detective does not really appear until later on in the book. This way we get more aquainted the characters, and when Poirot takes centre stage, it is more dramatic. Rather like him beeing the dark stranger who sweeps in, solves the puzzle, catches the killer, and them leaves once more. Much more mysterious and enigmatic.Sarah King is great, wonderful company to lead us into the first 100 pages, until the death.Th puzzle is simple, yet one of Agatha Christie's best. It is tightly constructed, with, as ever, brilliantly accurate psychology. The solution is very unexpected. It may not have an astounding solution like And Then there were None, or Murder On the Orient Express, but it does have one that is very realistic, and that you COULD guess, but never will.One of my very favourite Poirot novels, for the strength of its plot, the brilliance of it's psychology, and its solution."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"&quot;Appointment with Death&quot; definitely was different than any other Poirot mystery I have read but it was definitely a good read. The exotic location and superb developement of the characters made the book enjoyable and engaging. Certainly worth your while, especially if you are a Poirot fanatic."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"The reader for this 5-CD set (six hours total), Hugh Fraser, is terrific. I've listened to other Christie mysteries read by him and no one does a finer job. His performance onThe Mysterious Affair at Styles: Complete & Unabridgedwas nothing short of magnificent.Originally published as a mystery novel in 1938, the story here centers upon a former American prison wardress, Mrs. Boynton, who dominates her adult daughter, three step-children, and a daughter-in-law, in the same manner as she ruthlessly made lives miserable in her prison. In her old age and as a widow, she has become even more malicious and despotic and not one of her unfortunate clan dares to make the slightest move without first gaining her expressed permission to do so.On a trip to the Middle East, accompanied by her acquiescent family, Mrs. Boynton's malevolence achieves a new crescendo and, clearly as a consequence of her tyranny, she is subsequently found dead. While he is sympathetic to the plight of the now-freed family, renowned Belgian detective Hercule Poirot still investigates the incident at the behest of the authorities, especially after a world-famous French physician who was traveling with the Boyntons raises the specter of murder.There is no shortage of suspects in this dark tale and I doubt that most listeners will rightly guess who the killer is before s/he is revealed by the venerable Master Detective. Although Christie employed a few shrewd devices from previous works in this instance, she still did a fine job with this one.As far as I know, this is the only available audiobook of this Christie title. There is a VHS video version starring Peter Ustinov but I have yet to see it:Appointment With Death [VHS]. Unfortunately, I have not been able to locate the DVD format of this same film in Region 1 (United States) format.To summarize my review I can highly recommend this compelling audiobook mystery which springboards from the British \\"Golden Age\\" [of mystery writing]."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"This attempt to extend the formula of the Poirot novel fails because I found it utterly unbelievable on several levels. I will examine just one of these to avoid spoiling the story. The scenario is that a domineering step-mother can totally enslave her children by malevolent strength of will. Yet, the oldest son manages to escape to local dances where he meets and falls in love with a girl who he eventually marries. The couple are enticed back into the family where he gradually sinks into total mental submission to his step-mother but his wife manages to keep her independent spirit whilst staying within the family. Clearly, the two situations are mutually unsustainable over a period of years. Either the new wife would succumb to the dominance of the step-mother like the rest of the family, or, more likely, her presence would act like a hole in a dyke affording an independent focus for the resentment of the family against their step-mother that would eventually destroy the malignant dominance.This, and other characteristic weaknesses in the plot development, are a shame as the repellent figure of the step-mother is excellently drawn at the superficial level. However, she does not stand up to scrutiny in the same way as other mental torturers in literature such as Buchan's Dominic Medina in the decidedly creepy, and highly believable, 'The Three Hostages'.The step-mother is, of course, murdered and the rest of the novel follows the standard Poirot formula with the expected twist at the end. An entertaining read that disappoints because the initial expectations are built-up beyond the ability of the author to deliver. Perhaps Christie deserves 4 stars for trying?"},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"Appointment with Death by Agatha ChristieBlack Dog & Leventhal Publishers, 1937255 pagesMystery; Hercule PoirotSummary: \\"You do see, don't you, that she's got to be killed?\\" is the dramatic first line of this book. This appears to Belgian detective Hercule Poirot like an impassioned writer discussing his work. But shortly after, the terrifying matriarch of the Boynton family is found dead amid suspicious circumstances.Thoughts: It took forever for the woman to be killed. Almost half of the book is setting the scene, showing how each member of the family revolves his or her life around Mrs. Boynton and is terrified of her, excepting her daughter-in-law who is planning to leave her husband due to his cowardice in standing up to the mother. I was particularly interested in the psychology Poirot undertakes in order to understand their frames of minds during the period leading up to her death. I also liked that there are references to some of Poirot's other cases, including two that I have read.I loved Lady Westholme-she was funny and briskly efficient. I would have liked to see more of her. I did not like the romances in this book. Sarah and Raymond were lame, lame, lame, separately and together.SPOILERWhile I didn't expect to figure out the murderer, I hated that it was Lady Westholme, who was awesome. I wanted it to be Raymond (total loser), Sarah King (also a loser as evidenced by her interested in Raymond), or Carol (sister to Raymond and similar in appearance).END SPOILEROverall: 4/5. Gripping but disappointing end.Cover: I keep saying this but I really do love these covers."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"This is a great book!

For &quot;Appointment with Death&quot;, I would recommend renting the video (starring Peter Ustinov as Poirot, featuring Lauren Bacall &amp; Sir John Gielgud, Director: Michael Winner 1988) which, strangely, has more shocks than the book! Not at all bad, but not to be read before the thrills of the Nile river and the Orient Express trip."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"I liked reading Agatha Christie's novels and are of a good time pass. This book definitely is not worth reading, to my taste. I found it very disturbing that she compares the sadistic villain of this book with the Buddha. Just because she is fat ! I mean how would one feel if someone says the fat and monstrous jesus like psychopath ?! I expected some dignity from such a highly regarded author, but there it is."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"This book has two parts. The first part is devoted to character development and to building the characters motives for murder. Poirot is mentioned only incidentally in this part. Not to worry though. The first half of the novel is actually interesting and moves along quickly. This is partly due to the brievity of the chapters. Part one ends with the suspected murder of the expected victim (the person everyone hates). Poirot dominates the second half with his usual confident flair. For the first time ever, I was able to correctly pick out the murderer in a Christie novel. That does not mean that this novel is predictable. It's very good and I couldn't wait to get to the end to find out for certain who the murderer was. My only complaint is that even after he knew who the murderer was, Poirot took three chapters of explaining to reveal that person's identify to a room full of suspects. Good novel. I would recommend it to any lover of mysteries."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"i thought this book was one of christie's best books right along 'and then there were none' and 'murder on the orient express'. it was almost the end before i figured out who was the killer and i can usually figure out who did it. again i say this was a very good book and i recommend it to everyone"},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"Although i agree with the other reviewers that this Christie is different from the others I still found it very enjoyable. For some reason i could not put this one down!"},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"As a reader of many Poirot books this one seems some what dull. Unlike many of Christie book this case had almost no pychological aspects to it. The solution reminds me to much of Encyclopeida Brown. Also the marriage thing at the end was very pathetic. This is not the Agatha Christie I know and love."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"It's one of the most enthusiastic books of Agatha Christie. The facts are clean ( without any false clues ), and after reading it up to the end, you'll say (... as always in this author's great novels) &quot;but sure it is !&quot;. Besides these aspects, it's a good book because the story wraps up us with interesting characters and a terrific drama. Something rare at Agatha Christie's books. Most of time she worries a lot only how to surprise the reader at the end of the story. Fortunatelly this one is a exception. Take a look!"},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"I'm a GREAT fan of Agatha Christie, &amp; this book started off with a wonderful plot. A lady obssessed with power, controls her whole family, in an almost uncanny way. They are unable to do what they want to do. This gives her an almost fiendish glee. Sarah King, a medical student, meets this american family on a trip abroad &amp; is sickened by the power she(the step-mother) holds over them. She falls in love with Raymond Boynton (the young son of the family), but tries in vain to attract his attention. Dr. Gereard, an eminent pshycologist, has his own views about the state of the American family. The other members of the family hate her(their step-mother) with all their heart, but are powerless to do anything. &quot;Why don't they just walk out??&quot; is a question which haunted me, &amp; Sarah King too, but it's impossible. And its even more impossible to believe that they've been so much hypnotised, that they're afraid to go against a single wish of their mothers. But till now, they've been living in seclusion &amp; so were unable to see the unnatural life they were leading. Once they travelled &amp; realised the horrible, prisoners life they were leading, their minds turned to rebel. On the day of Mrs Boynson's death, each one of them informed her that they had had enough, &amp; were moving away to lead their own lives. Then... came the news of her death. A seemingly natural death caused due to heart failure. Or so they think!! 5 people...all with a motive for murder. But who was desperate ( or mad) enough to kill?? Hercule Poirot is at his very best!! The not-modest detective promises the truth within 24 hours... And the truth is what you'll get...but only after reading the book. For my part, I'll say its not a bad book, but I expected the ending to be something sensational, after the way the story was progressing..But well..I think I've said enough. Judge for yourself."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"One of four Poirot classics in exotic locations (the others being Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile, and Evil Under the Sun), Appointment with Death stands out as that with the most memorable plot. Among the Boynton children, everyone is a suspect, everyone lies, and it is up to Poirot to find the innocent. A crime in the rock city of Petra, in broad daylight, raises a most eerie feeling. Logically, the plot is most complex, where the same few events can be shuffled into so many permutations, only one of which can be true.The reason I did not give it 5 stars is the built in racism in some of the statements. I cannot be sure whether that is a reflection of Agatha's on racism towards browner people, or merely an accurate caricature of the British people of her time. Examples are references to Petra as a \\"natural wonder\\", as if the massive stone monuments are carved into precise architectural shapes by the forces of nature, rather than the ingenuity of the \\"natives\\". Other example are the constant annoyance of her characters by the lamentations of the Arab tour guides about Jewish immigration to Palestine, a real problem in 1938, in which the British government has played a central role. By dismissing the opinions of the Arabs in such jest, Agatha missed an opportunity to document what has continued to be, to this day, the root of many problems in the Middle East.Still, Appointment with Death is a masterpiece that is a product of its time."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death","review":"This is a pyschologically probing mystery that centers on a truly horrible old woman and her oppressed family.

It is the first of three volumes of the story of a Boer War injured veteran who buys an estate in the West of England and devotes himself to it. A lot of detail about an estate operated (home farm, tenant farmers, small villages, etc.) in a time of transformation. This time I read the book on my iPad and iPhone in the Kindle app which is highly recommended.Delderfield writes here about a world that no longer exists; the remote countryside before the world was transformed by the First World War. The following volumes go through and past the War and I have no intention of reading them again. It is sad to read of the devastation caused to the estate as its timber and horses depart.The subject of the book is a good man, a determined and steadfast man. He is somewhat old fashioned in many ways; particularly in his devotion to a way of life he is not from but in which he believes. Much of the book is about the building and improving of the estate. He does fall in love with the wrong woman despite the availability of a much more appropriate tenant farmer's daughter. That is about the biggest mistake he makes [stop reading if you hate learning what happens] and he recovers from it fairly quickly."},{"Title":"A Horseman Riding By","review":"Superlative characterization, engaging story which gives a view of the social situation in rural southwest England during the first decade and a half of the 20th century.

Delderfield fan since reading 'To Serve Them All My Days'.However, it's difficult to recommend authors to other people - tastes differ.Importantly, the format of the Kindle edition is excellent with few, if any, mistakes in layout.That may not be important to you but it is to me, hence my 5-star rating."},{"Title":"A Horseman Riding By","review":"I've read a few Delderfield works at this point in life. To Serve Them All My Days, the God is an Englishman trilogy, Napoleon's Marshalls. But it has been a few years.I don't remember if those works had two annoying things I found in this work that I wish to mention and then move on. Long Paragraphs, sometimes 3 pages long. This is hard on the eyes. And something the writer can't address any longer. The other was that a paragraph would start with dialogue from one speaker and end with dialogue from another. Please, break up the dialogue with paragraphs. (Perhaps if ever released again an editor would do their job and edit the work.)Now to the meat of it. The story is good. The character development is good though sometimes a little to pat. We need a character as a plot device and so we have that trait emerge. We see the world of Pre Great War England and the skirmishing of Tory (Conservative) and Unionist (Labour)We see the treatment of Suffragettes. The change of Motor and Phone beginning just as we saw Trains in God is an Englishman. Sometimes we spend unnecessary pages having the same rundown of what is happening to many characters in the book that we had a chapter before. Delderfield uses devices such as a gull flying in search of food all throughout the valley so we can see what each character is up to every few years and realize that we have read that a few dozen pages before.So why read this book. One would think it is dated in the 21st century, but it addresses a time a century ago, and one that the writer is familiar enough with to give us a good insight into. One that has things we should take a peak at.It is a historical, and certainly in some of the characterizations we see an older, male hand trying to write the mind of a teenager, which does not work (Delderfields worldly wise Grace is too worldly wise and her adult assumptions should be changed for simpler emotional and youthful ones IMO.) But as mentioned, worth a read, and perhaps one day worth a reread immediately following a reread of God is an Englishman."},{"Title":"We Love Baseball!

Rather than giving detialed information on the tax consequences for specific actions and deductions, the book just tells you what you should and should not do, and in a few cases the author's opinion is presented too strongly (i.e., rather than explain the potential long-term tax savings that can be attained by incoroprating in business friendly states such as Nevada and Delaware, the author outlines the cost of having your mail forwarded from these states to your own and instructs you not to incorporate out of state becuase of the couple hundred bucks of annual forwarding costs. In the long run, you can save alot of money and time by incoroprating in such states.)Call my sexist if you'd like, but I've noticed that informational books written by women often tend to leave out important factual information and instead contain the female author's opinion states as fact (i.e. \\"Don't keep money offshore.\\" stated without any factual reasoning, when such a decision could definately benefit some taxpayers.)

A dramatic ritual is a ritual performed for an audience, and a ritual drama is a dramatic ritual where the participants play specific roles. In order to play roles a story/plot was needed and this story forms the myth. The myth of the priest-king outlived the ritual and became the many myths and folktales we are familiar with, from Hercules to Robin Hood to Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter (my additions).Raglan argues that at one time kings were more than kings, they were priests, even gods, and replaced on a regular basis. The ritual surrounding this replacement involved sacrificing the old king (in reality or ritually) and raising up a suitable substitute. Raglan says there are at least twenty-two aspects to this mono-myth and the closer the legend fits these aspects the less likely the hero was a historical personage at all.His argument is that all historical persons that we know of from actual evidence have differed greatly from these twenty-two points. However all purely legendary heros curiously share most of them.(1)Born of a royal virgin.(2)His father a King and(3)Often a near relative of mother, but(4)The circumsatnces of his conception are unusual and(5)He is reputed to be the son of a god.(6)An attempt is made to kill him at birth(often by father or father-figure) but(7)He is spirited away and(8)Raised by foster parents in a far country.(9)We are told nothing of his childhood.(10)On reaching manhood he journeys to his future kingdom.(11)Faces trials and tests.(12)Marries a princess and(13)Becomes king.(14)Rules uneventfully(15)Prescribes laws(16)Loses favor with the Gods or his subjects and(17)Is driven away where(18)He meets with a mysterious death(19)Often at the top of a hill.(20)His children, if any, do not succeed him.(21)His body is not buried, however(22)He has one or more holy resting places.Curiously Raglan neglected, while covering several legendary figures who fit this prototype, to mention Jesus Christ. Perhaps it was the time he wrote in (the 1930s).Lord Raglan makes an excellent argument for his thesis.I can't believe I am the first to review this amazing book.Highly reccomended."},{"Title":"The hero;: A study in tradition, myth, and drama (The Thinker's library)","review":"For Jimbo and others who may have wondered why Lord Raglan did not cover Jesus, a natural \\"top scorer,\\" the answer is simple. The original publisher, Methuen, was a publisher mainly of religious books. Fortunately, generations of readers who have read this book have readily reached their own conclusions.Lord Raglan's style is blunt and some of his conventions pedantic (such as the use of quotes at the beginning of each line to indicate continuous quotations). More recent scholarship has challenged some of his conclusions, such as the historical veracity (or lack thereof) of the Icelandic sagas. However, his simple and straightforward presentation of this revolutionary idea remains powerful, and a welcome antidote to Campbell's self-dramatizing quasi-psychobabble about \\"The Hero's Journey.\\" This small volume will be eye-opening for anyone interested in mythology and its evolution from ritual drama. It will also serve as an antidote to the common perception that \\"all legends are based on truth.\\" They are, but it is not the truth of historical facts, but of human development and our love of a good story."},{"Title":"The hero;: A study in tradition, myth, and drama (The Thinker's library)","review":"If you are a fellow admirer of mythical legends and heroic dramas,then you will be captivated by this book.One of the literary questions,i ask from time to time,is whether Merlin or Jesus Christ,was the first true magician.Both performed miracles and feats that amazed watchers.Their accounts rippled outward through bardic narratives and recorded in countless legendary tales.But,this study glosses over the Jesus topic.Whether because of moral sensitivity or whether expurgated due to the mores of the day.This myth theory deals with the major classical epics from the European perspective.However,there are no tales from Afrika,India,the Americas or Asia.All heroic myths may have started from the first campfire rituals of Eastern Afrika.And as human migration spread,so did the retelling of the proto-myths.The myths evolved and the characters evolved.Yet,the root basis of our modern fictional legends derive from a wandering sole folk-teller's tongue on ancient ritual dramas.I think one of the greatest achievements of this complex exposition,is to convey, that all of mythical tales are patterned upon a single basic human desire to idealize the deeds of our heroic figures. I'm surprised that this book is not well-known today.I'm glad to have discovered this work on myth traditions.And would recommend it to anyone else interested in literary pursuits and drama studies."},{"Title":"The hero;: A study in tradition, myth, and drama (The Thinker's library)","review":"The book starts out very strong, and a pleasure to read. His case against oral history, against the assumption that stories about heroes, or indeed any information (myth, pedigree, tradition) which is ultimately founded on tradition and oral transmission, is based on some kernel of historic truth, is very convincing. The book is worth buying and reading for that part alone. Unfortunately, when he comes to present and defend his own theory, that mythsand heroic stories are based on ancient religious ceremonies, he gets much weaker; the evidence he presents against other theories is stronger than the positive evidence he can present in favor of his own. I wonder if he ever considered that stories might be told for entertainment, because they are good stories; his discussion gives me the impression he considered that irrelevant."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"This is by far one of the best spiritual books that I have ever read.

The book is about the author's journey to Mount Athos (a large Greek Orthodox Christian monastic community in Northern Greece) where he spends time with a profound, charismatic monk, and documents the received wisdom for us to partake in. I was raised in the Greek Orthodox church, which from the outside, can be as dogmatic, political, and hypocritical as any organized religion. Thankfully, the deep spiritual experience that many seekers leave to go find in the Eastern faiths, is still preserved in the monasteries, where it is practiced as a way of life. From the all-night vigils and endless chants, to the fruits of contemplative prayer, to the incredible stories of the living saints of Mount Athos, this book captivates the reader in a very accessible style."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"The Mountain of Silence is Mt.

For spiritual seekers of any shade, this book reveals the great depths of the Orthodox tradition, demonstrating that Orthodox Christianity has everything seekers often look for in Far Eastern mystical traditions... and more, in my opinion. It demonstrates to Christians that they need not abandon Christianity altogether, if they deem much of it empty or superficial, but may turn to Orthodoxy for a deep, experiential, practical Christianity. For the merely curious, or the armchair traveler, it tells a good story and takes one to an exotic landscape every bit as interesting and other-worldly as Tibet or India. For the Orthodox Christian, it is packed with wisdom, insights, and in a way that is approachable - not dry and academic - clarifies much about various aspects of the Orthodox spiritual life. For the Orthodox Christian, this book will become, after its first read, more a much-visited reference book than a mere story.I hope to share this book with people who think that practical, mystical and transpersonal spirituality belongs only to the Orient, or to those who think that Christianity has been emptied of mystery, transformative ascetic practice, and intelligence. This book makes Orthodoxy accessible to non-Orthodox people because of its engaging, narrative style.

Is it truly possible to hear His voice? How do I personally encounter Him? The Mountain of Silence answers these and other questions of the heart.In a profound yet direct way, Fr. Maximos reveals a time tested method of communing with God, not as a vain theoretician, but as one who regularly communes with God himself. The method he describes is a proven one as demonstrated by the countless Saints it has produced, in ancient and modern times (including the present day). I dare say, Fr. Maximos, a practitioner of the method himself, is on the road to Sainthood, as was his spiritual father (Fr. Paisios) and many of Fr. Maximos' other contemporary practitioners, including Fr. Sophrony and Saint Nikolai Velimirovic (both of blessed memory).This book is a must read for people who are tired of accumulating head knowledge about God and want to experience Him for themselves. The Mountain of Silence is likely to become a spiritual classic; may it be a blessing to all true seekers who read it."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"Kyriacos Markides, a Cyprus-born sociology professor at an American university, is a former skeptic who sought spiritual truths in the South and East Asian religions, but then came to realize the Orthodox Christian faith of his youth is also an \\"Eastern\\" religion with roots in mystical practice. Markides begins studying Orthodox mystical traditions among monks at Mount Athos in Greece - \\"the Christian Tibet\\" - but most of the book is a recounting of dialogs on Christian spiritual and theological beliefs with a former Mount Athos monk, Father Maximos, who is abbot of a monastery on Cyprus.The theme of the book is that Western Christianity, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, is hopelessly entwined in a philosophical, scientific, rational approach to trying to know God. By relying on human reason to \\"prove\\" God's existence and rejecting the spiritual knowledge and practices of the early Church \\"fathers and mothers\\" - \\"the holy elders have taught throughout the ages that God speaks to human beings only through the heart\\" - Western Christians have rejected the core of Christianity. Only a few Christians can be monks and nuns totally devoting themselves to using ancient techniques for spiritual growth to move as close as possible to God as is humanly possible. But the existence of monastic communities provides a environment to both preserve the ancient knowledge and make it accessible to lay seekers.The most important thing in moving beyond slavery to worldly concerns and toward Theosis (union with God) is the sublimation of our egos and a commitment to Metanoia (transformation of the mind and heart). This is accomplished by adhering to Ecclesia (comprehensive set of Christian practices, e.g., prayer, fasting, ritual, study). Now, Evangelicals, don't cover your ears and run away screaming \\"works righteousness\\". These practices aren't about \\"getting saved\\". They are about moving to a higher spiritual plane, something Evangelicals pay lip service to but, in fact, DON'T HAVE A CLUE how to accomplish.The conversational, dialog approach to complex subjects makes this a good introduction to Orthodox ideas. The footnotes and bibliography provide guidance for further pursuing Orthodox beliefs and practices and a three-page glossary provides reference definitions for Greek theological terms that, for this beginner, need to consulted on a regular basis.I recommend this book highly, especially to non-Orthodox Christians who, even though they choose not to \\"convert\\", will find Father Maximos' explanations of the Beatitudes, hell, etc., provide a thought provoking contrast with Protestant and Roman Catholic interpretations."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"There is real value in this book for anyone interested in Orthodox Christian spirituality, maily due to the fact that so much of the text consists of extensive dialog with an actual monastic of the Athonite tradition.However, Markides' own commentary falls short of the mark and follows a synchretistic line at times. His presentation of Orthodox mysticism as a sort of \\"Christian yogic system\\" that can be of value to the modern, rationalistc West seems to overlook the Orthodox Church's stance on the dangers of practising spiritual disciplines outside of their context. Markides seems to seek an avenue for bringing Orthodox mysticism to the modern world without necessarily bringing Orthodoxy.Also, Markides should have stayed away from writing history as much as possible. His historical synopses in his final chapters are terribly oversimplistic and would have the reader believe that the Orthodox Church never engaged in politics; that Byzantium was a sort of ecstatic, peace-loving city on a hill; that Eastern monastics stayed locked in their cells and never made trouble. His best moments as an historian are his accounts of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.Good correctives to some of Markides' shortcomings are Schmemann's Historical Road of Eastern Orthodoxy and Meyendorff's Orthodox Church. Ware's Orthodox Church and Orthodox Way are also invaluable resources for anyone who wants to make further study of Orthodox history and spirituality.Shortcomings aside, this book is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"I think the power of this book is that since it is written mostly as a conversation all of the information presented seems much more real than in most books. One really feels invited to step into the fullness of the Orthodox faith. It is true that the author interjects his own opinions in places and that more of a theological framework is needed to fully understand Orthodoxy. But I still give the book five stars because no other book has moved me so deeply towards longing to live in the presence of God. If you want to understand more Orthodox theology I recommend \\"The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church\\" by Vladimir Lossky. For a more in depth and scholarly introduction to Orthodox Spirituality I recommend \\"The Spirituality of the Christian East\\" by Tom Spidlik."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"As one currently exploring the Orthodox Church, this is perhaps the best book on Orthodox spirituality that I have read so far, and I and my wife have read several in the past few months. If this book is faithful and accurate in terms of setting forth the spiritual exercises and theology of Orthodox monks and what Orthodox Christianity is all about, then this book is must reading for all Christians - Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox. (I must leave it to persons well-versed on Orthodox Christianity to judge the book's accuracy and faithfulness, but my 5 stars are based on the assumption that it is faithful and accurate.) Even if one disagrees with the Orthodox goal of Theosis = divinization = union with God, this book will nourish one spiritually because of the many truths it teaches about Christianity and spiritual growth."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"An excellent book showing the only way for someone to find the Truth,which is only found through Christ...Jesus can not be found from any book even the bible but only by experience,through the mysteries of the Orthodox church.I met Father Maximos personaly and I can say that I was amazed by his spirituality.All of his sayings are based on the teachings from all the Saints and Elders Fathers from the first years of Christ until now.He doesn't say anything new but what has been said and written centuries ago...Logic can not hold the idea of a miracle or the existance of God...there is a big contrast...these two things can't exist together...Experience is the only answer...Touch and feel....I wish and pray to God, this book to help all readers to find the Truth and of course to feel It and touch It......\\" I am the Way and the Truth\\"(Jesus Christ)"},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"University of Maine sociologist Kyriacos Markides spent some time on Mount Athos in Cyprus interviewing a monk named Father Maximos, and compiled the results along with own observations on his journey back to faith.Markides was raised in the Greek Orthodox Church but cast his faith aside in his youth. After a period of agnosticism he regained his faith. His spiritual journey has taken him back to the Orthodox church of his youth, an Eastern branch of Christianity that has followed its own path, largely untouched by developments in Roman Catholicism and the churches of the Reformation.Father Maximos follows ancient practices of prayer and meditation and criticizes the churches of the West for trying to rationalize the Faith. I believe that he is right that we can never prove the reality of Christ through rational argument; faith and assurance come from following Christ, from obeying Him and through seeking Him in devotional practices.I also like the way that the Orthodox Church has managed to keep a respect for mystery and for the otherness of God that seems lacking in the Christianity of the West. At the same time, I have to admit that there are parts of this book that I have trouble believing. Markides describes visits from angels and demons, teleportations, mindreading, and miraculous healings as an everyday part of life on Mount Athos. The exotic locale helps to mute skepticism: if these occurrences sound Medieval it is fitting, as Father Maximos and the other monks are for all intents and purposes living in the Middle Ages. It also helps that Markides comes off as a fairly rational guy, who is dealing with his own incredulity. Still, if I heard of some of the same events happening at a church around the corner I wouldn't take it seriously for a moment. Maybe I am just too rational. I'll meditate on it awhile and get back to you."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"I started to read just the introduction and I started to sense that something was wrong, very wrong. Besides the assumption of eco-feminism as compatible with Orthodoxy, he discusses the occult he was deeply involved with in terms that made me more than uncomfortable: admiration, an ambassador's tone in describing occult matters, almost reminiscent of patriotism. This is the sort of thing one should speak of out of deep humility spurred by repentance from serious sin.This is the first time I have purchased a book that I thought was Orthodox theology and didn't get past the introduction before regretting I'd made the purchase.If you wonder, \\"Does this critic have anything better to say?\\" then &lt;a href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/author/cjshayward\\">I invite you to visit my own author's section.&lt;/a>"},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"It could be said that if I had even a little bit of humility and a touch of charity I would not have written a review on this book; but I am writing it from my sense of truth and I feel that it can be said!Having read the reviews and the back cover with Bishop Kallistos Ware saying \\"I have learned many things from it\\" - frankly: I was disappointed; I learned hardly anything from the book. This is mainly due to the 'phony' questioning by the writer and this makes the book boring.I found it odd that a book called \\"The Mountain of Silence\\", although it starts and finishes on Mount Athos, takes place on Cyprus!The book is inspired by a former \\"elder\\" of the Holy Mountain. I have come across young \\"elders\\" before, like Igumen Panteleimon of the Valamo monastery in Finland, and found little to learn from his books; somehow Father Maximos falls into this category.The tales of 'real elders' that he tells, like his own stories, seem to be referring to the pure and childlike faith that can often be found in the religious circles. However, that road is and was not open for me, as at the time I 'converted' from Lutheran to Orthodox I was already 'not so pure'; this may also be the case of some other sinners, be they young or old.Elders like Father Paisius are difficult to find and there are not many of them. This has been and is to-day the biggest problem of the Orthodox Church (or any other religious society, not only Christian). Where are they? In Monasteries?What are the possibilites for the lay brothers and sisters? First of all it should be noted that within the Orthodox all members of the church are priests; the difference is that some make priesthood a way of earning money and some become monks to be able to concentrate in finding Union with God, Theosis as Markides writes.The finest single idea for me in the book is that whatever happens in life can be used as 'a wake-up call'. It points to the fact that here in 'the world' there are a wealth of possiblities!"},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"This book is not a total loss, but lacks in search for orthodox spirituality.

Ever since this author is flapping around in the wind, trying to recapture his original momentum with the Magus. He has flipped from researcher into an idiot in my eyes.

But as a conservative Evangelical I found Markides' quest for spiritual meaning to be strangely compelling.Perhaps in part because I felt it was genuinely more story-telling than sermonizing.

An awesome constrution of the path of deification. How the thought process can have a great impact on how we can estrange from God or grow close to God. Salvation is for all but the heart has to become open. I recommend this to all!!! CHRIST IS IN OUR MIDST! HE IS AND EVER SHALL BE!"},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"A beautiful book that ends too soon. Hiding genially underneath a New England scholar's personal spiritual adventure to Mount Athos is a vibrant, penetrating, all-encompassing examination of religion and spirituality. Yet, the book never tires, and only refreshes. Author Markides' sparkling writing is taut and clean, with a seriousness and intelligence palpable on every page. It's a startling journal of a seeker, and offers a surprisingly rare insight into Orthodox mysticism, through the teaching of Father Maximos, lovingly supplanted by the author's genuine experience of discovery. I'm struck again by the fascinating parallels of approach and understanding between mystical Orthodoxy and Buddhism, also apparent in studying the Philokalia. Not to overstate it, although it's touted as an Orthodox book, the depth of understanding that permeates Mountain of Silence gives it a broad appeal across religions, towards the Infinite. It's interesting that the distinct mystical traditions of Judaism, Orthodoxy, and Catholicism forge a spiritual synthesis that mostly escapes finding in church and synagogue, when it's a deeper understanding we most seek; this book goes a long way towards bridging that curious disconnect. Every important element of the author's experience is plumbed and vividly conveyed, riveting, in fact. There seems no superficial way of reading this book, and that indicates an authentic attainment. Mountain of Silence is unexpected and deep, and wisely expressive. Best of all, it's wholly compelling. Radical recommendation, no hesitation."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"I heard about Mount Athos in Beirut, from a lebanese friend who's discerning to be a novice there. This book opened up a tangible mystery, not only of orthodox spirituality, but the full flowering of Christian mysticism, which, in my opinion, crosses over boundaries into Roman Catholicism and some Protestantism brilliantly as well. As the book itself hints repeatedly, the logo is not enough for one to grasp the depth and the height of such beauty; one must come fully into the presence of the Divine Liturgy, and the action of God Himself in every aspect of life, in order to fully comprehend Sacred Mysteries.Readers who enjoy this book may also like &quot;Cloistered Walk&quot; by Kathleen Norris."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"I really enjoyed this book and heartily recommend it. The book provides much insight into Orthodox spirituality in a way that is easily digestible and enjoyable.I do take exception to some of the charges against Roman Catholicism. Another reviewer cites: &quot;The theme of the book is that Western Christianity, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, is hopelessly entwined in a philosophical, scientific, rational approach to trying to know God.&quot; I am tired of hearing these kind of negative half-truths about Roman Catholicism. If we are talking about medieval scholasticism and the legalistic tendencies of the R.C. Church, fine. There is some merit to the accusation. But, let's be balanced. This is also the Church that brought you Theresa of Avila, John of the Cross, Padre Pio, Francis of Assisi, John Vianney and the list could go on and on. These were mystical saints who had a very real, deep relationship with God. They weren't into a rationalistic, scientific approach to God at all.I am an Orthodox Christian and I love Orthodox Church but I don't have any sympathy for biased, erroneous, ignorant attitudes towards other churches."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"Only wish my mom had not left the planet before this book came out. I've given away copies like Bible tracks to yoga teachers and the like, New Age friends who think they've taken a look at Christianity. The author will grate on some churchy types, I think, as he is a college prof on the east coast. It's refreshing that more lay people are writing about the ancient church, not just monks or clergy or polished theologians.The author signs up to be a taxi driver for a local bishop, deciding that having gone to India and the like, he should perhaps be fair to himself and take another look at the guru folk of the faith of his youth, Eastern Orthodoxy. And where to go but to the Holy Mountain.I've since been introduced to Elder Porphyrios in all five of the books written about him, but heard of him first in Mountain of Silence. Stories about him and little things like God talking through lizards will make your New Age friends heads spin toward heaven. That's my guess.I've a couple copies on my shelf, ready to be given away. This is a must book for converts to Eastern Orthodoxy, those who want to explain why they've made the trip back to the ancient faith.I plan to go to the Holy Mountain next year...and I'll make a trip to the bones of \\"the saint of love\\", Elder Porphyrios.

The vocabulary section at the back is especially helpful, as are the constant real-life examples from Father Maximos, the book's focal personality. Markides' sidebar comments get on my nerves from time to time, such as his constant use of \\"Christianity today\\" or \\"modern Christianity\\" (when speaking about certain negative stereotypes, such as disregard for logic and a fire-and-brimstone version of hell) when the word really should be \\"Western Christianity.\\" He also makes a few historical mistakes (like supporting the \\"millions of women\\" claim regarding the Inquisition's victims). But all of these are VERY MINOR and I only mention them because they're personal pet peeves."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"THE MOUNTAIN OF SILENCE I found to be a wonderful and engaging introduction to the world of Eastern Orthodox Spirituality. For the author himself, a sociology professor in Maine who had grown up in Cyprus, the journey he describes in such a winsome and colorful manner, is a journey of rediscovering his own roots and heritage in the Orthodox Christian Tradition and the Middle-Eastern part of the world. Thus, it is a kind of travelogue with the author visiting Cyprus and Mt. Athos and telling us as he learns himself of the history of the region, the history of Eastern and Western Christianity, and the wisdom of the Orthodox spiritual tradition as expressed by some of its finest contemporary practioners. All of this is done from the self-aknowledged perspective of a Western academic, influenced by the Englightment. Thus he is able to present both the Eastern critique of the shortcomings of the Western Enlightenment tradition and his own critical reflections and questions concerning both East and West and the existential issues that are raised for him in all this. The author, after all, aknowledges himself to be just another pilgrim on a journey of discovery and hope.Don Moore,Charlottesville, Virginia"},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"I purchased this book at a time when the spiritual encouragement this book contains had special meaning to me.

The author, having been educated in the United States, had followed the path of many of his contemporaries and participated in zen meditation and other new-age spiritual movements in the West. On a whim he decides to re-examine Christianity, traveling to a remote corner of Greece and discovering an ancient Christian tradition unknown to the western Christians of today.

For the average CHRISTian who really seeks the Devine this book will be a revelation and it will make clear to him that CHRISTianity made in the USA - Mormons, Jehovah-witnesses, Pentecostals, and all the other hysterical and super superficial self-proclaimed churches there are in the USA - are simply a blasphemy!"},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"A great read and introduction to the flip side of Christianity.

To further make my point, one needs only to read who recommends the book on the back cover- Bishop Kallistos Ware, the preeminent spokesman for Eastern Orthodoxy in the West and the retired professor of Eastern Orthodox studies at Oxford University!I can positively remark that this book accurately depicts the practical outcome of anyone who follows the guidance of the Christian East. Holiness and wisdom are not reserved only for the monks, but for all those who seek Christ with a pure heart. The wisdom of Father Maximos, a main figure in the book, is simply a distillation of the wisdom of 2000 years of prayer and worship as found in the East. If it happens to reflect in some ways current New Age mentalities, it is not, believe me, a sign that the Eastern Church has somehow taken their advice! I have the suspicion that those who understand Christianity through Western Protestant eyes would find this work a bit odd to say the least. Monks who are clairvoyant, can change someone else's perception of time, etc are not common in Protestant Christianity. But then again, they have not had the benefit of a 2000-year-old tradition of spirituality and prayer. This is not to put the Protestants down, it is only the observation that there is no need to reinvent the wheel when the East already has a very succinct and proven method of spiritual development that goes much beyond the non-accountable, individualistic spirit of much of the Christian West.IF you have an interest in the underpinnings of the Eastern approach to Jesus Christ and the Trinity and the Church etc, then you would do well to read &quot;The Orthodox Way&quot; by Kallistos Ware, or, if you want to dig into some deeper theology, &quot;The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church&quot; by Vladimir Lossky is a classic, as is the difficult but rewarding masterpiece &quot;Being As Communion&quot; by Zizioulas. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"Rarely have I underlined the text of a book as much as I recently did with &quot;The Mountain of Silence,&quot; by Kyriacos C. Markides.Markides, a sociology professor at the University of Maine, was born on Cyprus into an Eastern Orthodox family, but became secularized while coming of age during the Sixties in the United States. The sociological research for his earliest books brought him into contact with the mystical traditions, shamanism and Occultism of the Orient. A serendipitous experience in 1991 caused him to begin investigating the mystical traditions of the Orthodox Christian faith of his youth, which is covered in his previous book, &quot;Riding with the Lion.&quot;For this book, Markides had intended to spend a sabbatical on Mount Athos, the &quot;Holy Mountain&quot; on a remote peninsula in Greece set aside for over a thousand years as the home to a number of Eastern Orthodox monasteries. Upon learning that his main contact had returned to Cyprus to become the abbot of Panagia Monastery, he changed his plans to spend several months there with Father Maximos and the other monastics under his supervision.While this book is an amazing travelogue, which also contains some engrossing history lessons about Cyprus, monasticism and the Christian faith, it is primarily a series of personal conversations between Professor Markides and Father Maximos. It was the many enlightening comments by the abbot that I found myself voraciously underlining in my copy of the book.While &quot;The Mountain of Silence&quot; has appendices for chapter endnotes and a helpful glossary of Greek terms used throughout the book, it unfortunately does not contain an index.Among the many topics covered in these insightful conversations are: asceticism, addictions, animals, angels, apathia [liberation from egotistical passions], Athonite tradition, the Beatitudes, the Bible, Byzantium, ceaseless prayer, Christ, the Cross, demons, Divine Liturgy, the Ecclesia, equality, faith, fasting, fear of God, freedom, God, grace, the heart, heaven, the Holy Spirit, Hesychast tradition (silence), humility, icons, idolatry, illness (of the soul), illusion, the Jesus Prayer, justice, komboschini (prayer ropes), love, magicians, miracles, monasteries, monks, nationalism, the nous, obedience, passions, Pentecost, perfection, prayer, Providence, radio and television, repentance, repression, saints (living and dead), salvation, sanctification, Satan, sin, spiritual guides/confessors, spiritual struggle, temptations, thoughts (positive and negative), the Threefold way (catharsis or purification of the soul, fotisis or enlightenment of the soul, and theosis or union with God), the Theotokos (Mother of God/Virgin Mary), transfiguration, trials, Turks, Uncreated Light, Western philosophy and theology, and worship.While some readers may be disturbed by some of Professor Markides' sociological and secular questions and comments, it made me feel like I was right there, observing genuine conversations with a modern holy man. Most readers will never have the opportunity to spend hours, much less months, with the renowned abbot of an Orthodox monastery. And many of the questions and comments would be those of anyone raised in the secular (and skeptical) West.This book is highly recommended to anyone desiring to learn more about Orthodox spirituality, monasticism, or even about life on Cyprus and on Mount Athos. Although it's written by a professor, it's not too technical and should be accessible to anyone with a high school education or above."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"I regard this book as very good... as far as it goes. Its main problem is that, overall, it offers an examination of spirituality without Christ. Mind you, I don't know whether the author (and certainly not the main subject of the book, \\"Fr. Maximos\\"!) had this intention, but it came across to me as a serious blindspot in the book's presentation of Orthodox spirituality.Much is made of the Threefold Way and the mystical-ascetical tradition of the Orthodox Church, and that is good. Generally, this is the stuff that many Christians are missing and need. But there is a decided lack of integration of this presentation of Orthodox tradition with the central reality of the Christian life, namely, Jesus Christ the God-man. Certainly, the reader can come away with some mind-blowing revelations regarding the supra-rationality of Orthodox mystical tradition and the application of that tradition to the life of every Christian, but I think the author rather assumes that the reader already knows Jesus in some sense and doesn't bother to bring Him into the picture. Or perhaps he doesn't see Christ's centrality to the Church.I very much doubt that the relative absence of Christ is something that \\"Fr. Maximos\\" (a pseudonym for Fr. Athanasius, now Metropolitan of Limassol in Cyprus) communicated to Markides. Anyone who has had any contact with authentic Athonite monasticism knows that such monks are \\"all about Jesus,\\" to put it colloquially. There certainly is much discussion of God, the Holy Spirit and grace in the book, but Christ, Who is the Door to Paradise, is hardly mentioned. One would have a hard time getting the impression from The Mountain of Silence that the very object and purpose of all this spirituality is Christ.I did like the book, but in thinking about the manner in which it was recommended to me, i.e., as a sort of catechism, I would have to disagree with such a recommendation. As a priest, I would not present this book to any catechumen, because I would be concerned that he would become enamored of discussing the Ecclesia, plani, and logismoi, without any sense of where these realities fit into the life in Christ.A lesser criticism I have of the book is focused on chapter 11, Escape From Hell. In it, Markides all but endorses the apokatastasis theories of certain writers in Church history. That is, he seems to put forward a belief that eventually everyone will be saved, basing it on what is a decidedly minority stream of theological opinion of some Orthodox Christians. I much more prefer Metr. Kallistos Ware's \\"Dare we hope for the salvation of all?\\" approach, such as is found in the last chapter of The Inner Kingdom. Markides doesn't quite claim that apokatastasis is Orthodox doctrine, but he also doesn't make it clear enough that this is simply his opinion.All in all, the book is useful in that it presents a fairly easily digestible picture of some of the more difficult concepts in Orthodox Christian spirituality, but because of its defects as noted above, I would only recommend it to someone already catechized, while giving them the caveats I've elucidated here.I have a friend who says that she came to Orthodoxy by falling in love with the Church, but now she finds that she hadn't yet fallen in love with Christ. This book could easily enable just that sort of phenomenon. But for someone who is in love with Christ and keeps that in mind, this book might help bring them closer to Him. The first step, the path, and the destination are all Christ.After writing this, I find through some Googling that Kh. Frederica Mathewes-Green feels similarly: \\"By the way, a good book that gives an 'inside view' of what this spirituality is like in practice, with all its 'spirit-filled' elements, is 'Mountain of Silence' by Kyriacos Markides. I should warn that the author is coming from a very idiosyncratic place; he is a sociology professor who has come to fervent belief in miracles, evil spirits, theosis, and he is profoundly in awe of the wisdom of the Orthodox Church. What he doesn't get so much is Jesus. In his subsequent book he makes it even more clear that he thinks we need a version of Orthodox spirituality that acknowledges that it is divisive to insist on the necessity of Jesus Christ, and recognizes the universality of the path to enlightenment. Strange, isn't it? Lots of people say, 'I like Jesus but I have no use for the church'--he's the opposite.\\""},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"THE MOUNTAIN OF SILENCE is a rare treat, an insight into Orthodox spirituality and theology that also delights as a narrative and travelogue!The author is an ethnic Greek professor of socilology in Maine. He had lost his faith until he started investigating spirituality and healing, including a long visit to Mount Athos, the legendary Orthodox monastery. There he met Father Maximos, a devout, eloquent, and intellectual monk.The Mountain of Silence picks up this story as Father Maximos is called to Cyprus to help revive monasticism on the divided island. Markides gets to spend a summer with the holy man, serving as his driver and foil for theological discourse. It's a fabulous story full of insights into topics as diverse as Theosis (the Orthodox idea that God became man that man might become God), uncreated light (think St. Gregory Palomas), drug treatment, magicians, and iconography.The book is fascinating and intriguing. It becomes obvious that the author has had his faith renewed and reinforced, although he does not make a major issue of this; instead, he concentrates on the importance of a Christian life in the modern world.The volume is not a fast read but it is accessible and clear. The author's follow-on book, Gifts of the Desert, will satisfy those who want to know more.By all means, Orthodox or not, if you are looking for spirituality or plumbing its nature, this book is a key to the portals of the All-Holy Trinity!"},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"As a Roman Catholic graduate student in philosophy of religion/theology, I rarely find books on spirituality/religion that are written for non-academic audiences to be much good. This book, however, is a notable exception. Its exposition of Eastern Orthodox spirituality (especially hesychasm and the Jesus Prayer) is moving and clearly written. Usually, Western Christendom has spoken condemningly (if at all) of hesychasm. This book opens up the deep, Christocentric, ancient practices of Eastern Orthodox monasticism for anyone to see and understand. I found much in this book to challenge me and surprise me. I cannot recommend it strongly enough for anyone who is interested in taking a good, long look at practices of prayer and Easter Orthodoxy. A must-read for Christians."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"I have never, to the best of my knowledge, ever declared a book to be an \\"instant classic\\"; this book is no exception. However, I do think that the contents of this book are utterly classic: pristine, vintage and eternal. Although The Mountain of Silence may not be The Way of the Pilgrim for the 21st century, for those that are seeking to further their knowledge and experience - those seeking to continue the marriage of their heart with their mind - I think that this book is not merely accessible: it is also authoritative.In short, Markides is a sociologist at the University of Maine. He was raised Greek Orthodox but wandered away during his secular training and, like many, sought greater spiritual wisdom in the Far East. It does not seem that Markides ever quite found all that he was looking for, but the \\"supernatural\\" things that he witnessed in his travels opened him up to thinking that there was something more than the reduction to socio-cultural being that his sociological training gave to him.Enter Fr. Maximos, a now-exiled monk from Mt. Athos who is in Cyprus to bring about spiritual renewal. He was forced to leave Mt. Athos by his spiritual guide, the Elder Paisios and ordered to return to Cyprus; such is the wisdom of God, it seems. Markides, then, spends time with Fr. Maximos and records his wisdom and spiritual insights, and not always without a little doubt. Markides has not exactly returned to the Orthodox church, but remains something of a prodigal, with and without a home. Yet, Markides is open. His doubts are honest, but they are not solely doubts about Orthodox faith - they are also doubts about the shortcomings of Western science, something that he seems to share with many, particularly of the baby boomer generation. One of the most enjoyable elements of the book is reading Markides as he bares his soul and openly wrestles with his questions. It takes a good bit of humility to do so, and humility, according to Fr. Maximos is the first step on the spiritual path.Get ready for something that is going to come completely out of left field, though. Fr. Maximos is a part of a living tradition that is open to the workings of God in sometimes strange ways: prophecy and words of knowledge, visionary experiences and embodied appearances of saints and even Christ! Although for some of the more charismatic/Pentecostal churches much of this may seem typical, what is different from those movements/s/s/s/s/... is that all of this happens within the liturgical and theological framework of the Orthodox tradition. In Orthodoxy there is no anti-authoritative \\"spirituality\\" devoid of meaningful content so as to be incommunicable (other than through supposed \\"feeling\\"): the linguistic (tradition) and the spiritual (God) dance, quite literally, an *incarnate* dance.So, in order to understand the Orthodox spiritual/ascetic/mystical-theological tradition, one must be a part of the tradition - or at least willing to accept its legitimacy and the *reality* of its expression. There is here a sense of authority: spiritual masters (elders) have expertise in spiritual things and these have also been passed down. Hence, the elder-disciple relationship is fundamental to the Orthodox monastic vocation. This is no individualistic spirituality and those who think that spirituality is for the individual - and therefore purely subjective and therefore without any real content - are likely to be turned off by this book. Fr. Maximos claims that there are real spiritual truths that one must orient one's self to and that there are real stages in spiritual development and real ways in dealing with demonic attack, etc. - hardly the run-of-the-mill liberal discourse that one is too used to hearing. Yet, for those that are humble enough to recieve from the tradition of the Elders, there will be much benefit here.So, for those on the way, this is a book that I highly recommend. Although I fault Markides' caricatures of the West and Western spirituality towards the end of the book, he is right to point out that the West and the East really need each other: the rational without the mystical (and vice versa) is dead. Markides' doubts open up questions and these questions open up Fr. Maximos to share what he has both learned and experienced. Get ready, though, for a ride through the spiritual traditions of Eastern Orthodoxy that might be as foreign as they are fascinating. Yet, this exotica might be more than some mere eros: it might be the very life of God."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"Although the author seems to be somewhat confused about his own orientation (vis a vis religion), the main character of the book, Father Maximos, is not.

The author records his conversations and experiences as he visits with an abbot of a monastery in his country of origin, Cyprus. It's written in a readable style, wonderfully paced with frequent humorous touches, and has several very insightful sections on basic spiritual truths. The author writes with a slightly skeptical approach, which keeps the book from getting too sentimental or saccharine. Although the author was raised Greek Orthodox, it appears he's spent much of his adulthood wandering through academic study of other religions, so we get several comparison comments that add to the depth of the book for someone who isn't a committed Orthodox Christian. I am so glad I ran across this book...along with being a fun read, it had several fresh perspectives on living the spiritual life among mundane realities."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"This is one of the all-time great books on the Orthodox Spiritual life. Frankly, I cannot recommend a better book for any layperson to read on the subject.If you're interested in Orthodoxy, this is also an excellent book.What makes this book great is that the author himself was a seeker and did not understand these issues. He documents his own exploration beautifully!"},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"While I did not find this book as entertaining as Markides' three books on Daskalos (AKA The Magus of Strovolos)- Mountain of Silence is an excellent read! The book gives inside knowledge as to the workings behind what some call the vatican of Russian and Greek Orthodox religions &lt;the monastaries of Mount Altus in central Macedonia.> The author seems to give an unbiased approach to his observations. Markides tapes his conversations before typing them in his books; therefore, his accuracy in recounting the knowledge is perfect.Throughout the book the reader will learn that there are no \\"real\\" short-cuts to enlightenment. This book outlines what is necessary for us to allow God to work through us via the road of Mystical Christianity. It also elaborates on the pitfalls that others have experienced along the way. Most importantly, the book also illustrates how to overcome the obstacles that others have overcome in order to be a receiver of the Providence and Grace of God.This is an excellent book for all spiritual seekers."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"It touches all the aspects needed in our Spiritual Journey. It enhances our journey from &quot;knowledge of God&quot; to &quot;Icons&quot;, &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; and &quot;hell&quot;. The book is wonderful and a must have if you sincerely are looking for the TRUTH that lurks behind Orthodox Spirituality in order to incorporate it into your own life. Markides did a fantastic job. Although I was surprised about quite a bit of his skepticism after all the knowledge he has acquired through the years. That is probably one of the qualities of why it is so appealing."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"The book is informative, historically correct, and keeps the reader wanting to read more.

I really enjoy his interactions and narrative reporting from Fr. Maximos. This book and his other works are helpful additions to those who seek to expand and grow their spiritual life."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"This is a truly inspirational book, but in a different way than a person overcoming struggle or something like that. The author asks questions of the monks that any lay person would ask, and he can be quite persistent! So, the structure of the book helped me feel invested in it from the beginning. And then what the monks (particularly Fr. Maximos) say is just amazing, inspiring, and life changing. I am so glad I read this book, and so glad I purchased it because I want to read it again."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"This book is a gem for those of any faith or tradition. The author, a Northeastern liberal academic, shines a wonderful light on the beauty of Orthodox spirituality through conversations with a very learned monk and bishop, Maximos. Because he brings a Western academic perspective to his conversations with Fr. Maximos, he asks the direct questions that many a skeptical believer would want to ask. The wisdom and patience of Fr. Maximos pours from this book and for me was life changing. In particular, his discussion on negative logismi (evil thoughts that bombard us all) and how to deal with them is wonderful.In this book and in the perhaps even better sequel, Fr. Maximos explains the role the Church has played for close to 2000 years as a spiritual hospital. Using this metaphor, the monasteries serve as the ICU for that hospital. Eastern Christianity is a hidden gem in this world and this book is a very good introduction to those who have little knowledge of Orthodox spirituality. I guarantee it will leave you wanting to learn more."},{"Title":"The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality","review":"To me this is the new definitive book on ancient Eastern Orthodox Christian spirituality written for a lay audience. It has a lot of the same content as Kallistos Ware's &quot;The Orthodox Church&quot; but it's a much easier and more interesting read. The author diverts frequently to what the LA Times calls &quot;travelogue&quot; which keeps the theological content from becoming too heavy at any given point. Additionally it offers a lot of helpful remedies for spiritual challenges encountered by people of all walks. I liked how the book addressed the significance of thoughts (logismoi) and their effects on our emotional and mental well being. Markides gives the reader the benefit of many invaluable spiritual discussions minus the difficulty he went through to harvest and disseminate such truths. This book was a spiritual &quot;pick-me-up&quot; and I am grateful for the inspiration it provided me for my own spiritual journey."},{"Title":"Queen of France;: A biography of Marie Antoinette","review":"&quot;For all its careful scholarship and judicious balance of judgment,&quot; says The Listener, &quot;it has the readability and grip of a good novel. It deserves the wide public that it is likely to attract.&quot;She was Marie Antoinette, a lovely Austrian princess. She was fourteen when she first met her fifteen-year-old husband, the Dauphin of France. He was a shy, heavy young man, overshadowed by his grandfather, Louis XV.The girl had many problems to cope with at the French court, among them her husband's lack of interest, the King's spinster daughters (almost her only companions at first) and Madame du Barry, the King's favorite. Yet she soon won everyone's heart and had all of Paris at her charming feet.But as time went by, not only the court but the country as a whole and Marie Antoinette's mother (Maria Theresa of Austria, four hundred leagues away, and constantly advising her daughter by mail) were alarmed by the fantastic parties, wild extravagances, and excessive pleasures of the Dauphin's bride.Then Louis XV died, and the courtiers coming to salute the new nineteen-year-old king found him and his queen on their knees weeping bitterly. &quot;Oh, God,&quot; they cried, embracing each other, &quot;protect us, we are too young to reign.&quot;Andre Castelot, a distinguished French scholar and historian, has in this book written one of the most brilliant of recent biographies, which makes Marie Antoinette, from her arrival in France to the day she rode to her death in a cart, amazingly alive for the reader. We are carried from the intimate chambers of the young queen, through the incredible splendor and shocking discomfort of life at Court, to the awesome sounds of the rising mob, the last desperate flights, and the ultimate imprisonment and execution.The author has had a mass of decuments at his disposal while writing this book, many of them newly discovered in Viennese and Parisian archives, and never before presented to the public.Robert Pick says, &quot;I admire this book immensely. Familiar with the Marie Antoinette story and its grim climax, I yet found myself in suspense to the last.&quot;"},{"Title":"Queen of France;: A biography of Marie Antoinette","review":"Great! Not only the negative side of the Marie Antoinette was mentioned but also a good analysis"},{"Title":"The Rise of David Levinsky (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"\\"The Rise of David Levinsky\\" is a great business novel. Cahan describes how Mr. L becomes a successful maker of men's coats, and how L's ex-partner's wife become a very successful real estate entrepreneur. Actual description of how business success has been achieved is rarely shown in novels: it's available here."},{"Title":"The Rise of David Levinsky (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"Jewish bildungsroman has little to recommend it besides its ethnic angle. Unremarkable prose (that has the feel of Dickens, two generations later). Some interesting homoerotic undertones, and the narrator's lack of of self-consciousness may give critics something to consider. But I am not certain that there is any authorial control behind these hiccups. Too long. Probably best left forgotten."},{"Title":"The Rise of David Levinsky (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"I first read this book in the mid-70s when it was assigned as part of an undergrad history course. I devoured it then, rediscovered it ten years later and found I enjoyed it even more on a second reading. Subsequent readings have not diminished my admiration for the novel.&quot;Levinsky&quot; is a rare example of the novel that works both as history and as literature. Cahan's firsthand observations of late 19th century industrial America and of the immigrants' struggles to adapt to life in a new land are compelling in their own right. But this is no mere slice of life realism. Cahan created complex characters who face conflicts beyond the struggle to survive.Cahan's main character, Levinsky, spends the first part of the book struggling to master the Talmud in his village in Russia. Here Cahan introduces us to Levinsky's incisive mind, one that will serve him well when he goes to America and begins to serve a new master: business. In the opening section, Cahan also develops one of several beautifully drawn supporting characters: Levinsky's mother.By novel's end, we realize the irony of the novel's title. On one level, Levinsky's story is a classic tale of rags-to-riches, American-style success. On the other, his story is one of failure to achieve the rich, personal, intellectually stimulating connection with others that he has craved since childhood.This great novel deserves to be on the short list of indispensable American fiction. One seeking to understand the roots of our country would be hard pressed to do better than to read it."},{"Title":"The Rise of David Levinsky (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"I was prompted to buy and read this book by a bookclub-type event, and I am very glad to recommend this novel. Written in 1917 about an era even earlier than that, it is a classic tale of the immigrant experience, the American experience, and the Jewish experience, in the USA. The various pulls of culture, assimilation, poverty, wealth, sex, solitude, religion, secularism, education, and commerce are each subtly examined, so subtly that one doesn't realize until afterwards how much has been packed into a relatively simple story.This Penguin version is the one to buy, it is compact, in readable type, and with a useful preface. Amazon is selling another version in an oversized paperback format--skip that one, it is awkward in size, and with many typos in the text. I actually disposed of that one and repurchased it in the Penguin paperback version."},{"Title":"The Rise of David Levinsky (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"The realism in this novel is astounding. In a true-to-life rags-to-riches story, young David Levinsky grows up poor, yet motivated, in the heart of a small Russian town. A Hasidic Jew with visions beyond the Torah, Talmud, and a studious life, he takes a ship to America to seek his fortune. His rise in corporate America has the power to inspire, to invoke fear, reminiscence, tears. Do not be surprised to find yourself looking within after a particularly well-written, astute paragraph by Cahan, and feeling as if he has written about your own emotions or state of mind -- decades before you were even born! Some of his metaphors, I have found, even describe the way I have thought about the world, and the feeling that you could be there alongside David in his search for wealth, power, women, and ultimately himself (Who am I?) add to the fantasitic realism with which Cahan weaves his story. It is a masterpiece, a novel that deserves to be read worldwide. I am twenty years old, but read the novel when I was 16. I have not read it since, yet recall vivid details and even entire paragraphs which struck me then even as they do now; reconciling parts of the novel to my life comes easily as I experience new things and understand and appreciate even better what the fictional David Levinsky went through. It is classic, a novel for all time. I recommend, in the strongest possible terms, to read it, love it, and enjoy it. I did... and I am a science person."},{"Title":"The Rise of David Levinsky (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"I read this novel the first time in college and am re-reading it now. The social realism dazzled me then, but it's the incisive characterization that strikes me more now. You get a sense of objective social conditions, but a deeper and deeper sense of the main characters' souls as you read further along. Some of the sketches of human emotion sound familiar as something that happened to me yesterday.I believe this helps Cahan make his point, of Levinsky's material accomplishment and spiritual impoverishment. He gradually becomes emptied out, so to speak. He has lost his traditional religion and rejected the socialist substitute for religion. At the beginning, he has little but knows who he is - at the end, he has much but seems a stranger to himself."},{"Title":"The Rise of David Levinsky (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is interested in the history of the Jewish Lower East Side in the late 19th century and early 20th century. It is written by an author with intimate knowledge of the time and place. Written in 1917, it is a very captivating and compelling story of an Eastern European Jewish immigrant's plight on The Lower East Side. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Rise of David Levinsky (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"This book gives a solid sense of what it must have felt like to be a Jewish immigrant to New York around the turn of the century. I enjoyed the fact that the book was not only a very interesting adventure, but also a fascinating account of changing class consciousness and socialization to a new society. Kahan's account of what is gained and what is given up in this process allowed me to understand my own ancestors at a deeper level. He writes well in a journalistic style and is constantly providing details about his present that help me to understand the meaning of what was going on."},{"Title":"The Rise of David Levinsky (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"There is an irony in the title. Cahan has a hero rise in wealth and position in the society only to be empty inside. There is a price to his Americanization in the loss in some deep sense of his past source of meaning in life.This is a pioneering tale of American- Jewish Literature. It gives a picture of a world no longer with us.It is clearly and well - written, and if it is not in the category of great Literature, still it is a valuable social document. It is well worth reading especially for those interested in ' immigrant literature'."},{"Title":"The Rise of David Levinsky (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"This is a review meant solely for the audio version of the book. the book itself is very good and i was looking forward to hearing a reading of it as i am a big fan of audio books. i was disappointed to hear that it was just a simple text to speech made by a computer. this was not worth the money and i feel as though i have been taken advantage of. it sounds like a robot reading it and for the price if someone was going to be lazy and use a program they could have spent what i paid for one copy and gotten a realistic sounding program. WARNING LOW QUALITY READING"},{"Title":"The Rise of David Levinsky (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"That basically summarizes this book. Success, in the eyes of the world, can result in personal tragedy.The author, Ab. Cahan, was a fervent socialist and ardent trade-unionist. He wrote this novel in English for a major American magazine, McClure's. At the same time he was the editor of the world's largest Yiddish newspaper, The Jewish Daily Forward. The collected stories were published in book form in 1917.David Levinsky, who is orphaned when his mother is killed by anti-Semitic peasants in his hometown in Russia, makes his way to America. This book is his story, the tale of a man who by hook and crook, makes his way in the world, alone.He learns English, he becomes an American and he also becomes a very wealthy businessman, a factory-owner and big shot. However, he cannot shake his loneliness and desire for a wife and family.Actually, what he really needed was a good psychotherapist but, unfortunately, he was at least thirty years too early for that.I found the book fascinating with its vivid descriptions of life among the Eastern European Jewish New York immigrant population. It reminded me of the work of Horatio Alger, the great American juvenile author who described the trip from rags to riches.Unlike Alger's heroes, however, David Levinsky is hopelessly neurotic.He finds the opportunity for misery in the most fruitful situations. This is a man who, while being a talented businessman, really screws up interpersonal relationships, especially with women to whom he is attracted.If you read the book, which I do recommend, get the Penguin paperback edition as another reviewer suggests. You will be glad that you did. I got mine used since it doesn't seem to be offered new at this time.Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Rise of David Levinsky (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"I know this is something of a \\"classic,\\" but readers should be forwarned that in this book, the hero frequents prostitutes and seduces a married woman (actually he tries to seduce three of them). The affair takes up about 50-100 pages with references to it later in the book as well.There are good parts to this book. The very beginning is interesting, and one can find interesting material throughout the book. But at a certain point, the main character starts visiting women of ill repute and starts seducing married women. It was at this point that I started wondering, \\"What kind of person was Abe Cahan if he could write about such matters in such detail? And what kind of morals did Cahan have if he makes this affair seem somewhat wonderful, rather than dastardly?\\"Be forewarned!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"New Rule: nobody needs to read James Joyce. He was not a good writer. He was all show-off and gimmick. There is no substance to his writing. It is a waste of time. It is pompous. It is boring. Accept reality people."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can sum this book up in two words: \\"Ass Beating\\". It was the most painful reading experience of my life.Like many readers I was sucked in by the \\"Modern Library Top 100\\" list of which Ulysses is number 1. After getting about half way through this book, I realized that many of the so called \\"Top 100\\" were probably more important than they were, well, good. Ulysses has several passages of graphic sexual description and discussion of infidelity during a few of the author's more lucid moments which surely made it edgy for 1922. The Modern Library must have overlooked the long and frequent passages of rambling lists and nonsence that makes one seriously question if the author was getting paid by the word and needed to pay his rent. I was not surprised to find out that Ulysses was initially a serialization and Joyce was actually getting paid by the word!You can read some of this online, but I don't recommend reading it in any form. Life is too short for bullisht like this novel.http://www.online-literature.com/james_joyce/ulysses/"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To smash your skull against a maddening, beautiful brick.Let me just begin by stating how much I loathe Ulysses. I hate Stephen Dedalus. I hate Leopold Bloom. I hate Molly Bloom. I even hate their cat. They're all fatuous and arrogant and dull and dishonest and insecure and insincere and superficial and greedy, and they all take part in a story that's a boring, tedious, frustrating, incoherent, big fat waste of my time and energy. Anyone who claims otherwise is either a massive liar or a sick masochist who deserves to have a bag slipped over their head and be taken away from society. As such it remains one of the most astoundingly honest and ambitious works in modern literature. There is not a book currently existing which is simultaneously as repelling and compelling. Is there a more divisive stirrer of passionate debate in the field of art? Normally a very relaxed, some may say apathetic and pacifistic, individual, I once heard my English teacher saying that Ulysses was nothing but complete garbage. I calmly stood up and punched him in the throat, and I received polite applause as I was escorted from the classroom. Later on, when I reread a section of Ulysses near the middle, I discovered that he was completely right. But you know what? That's life. And that sense of living pours off Joyce's pages and through his eccentric mouldings of the English language like a waterfall. It's almost too much to bear at times. We eat, we drink, we urinate, we defecate, we sneeze, we fart, we stink and we have sex, and after a few decades we die. No hidden wisdom. No great awakening. No grand nobility. No spiritual nirvana. That's LIFE. And the sooner you come to terms with that, the more depressed you'll be. Wonderfully, wonderfully depressed."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To understand something of &quot;Ulysses,&quot; one must firstlook at its publication in a historical perspective. Brought out inprint in a time when the banning of books was common practice in the war against &quot;obscenity,&quot; Mr. Joyce's work was championed by all liberals everywhere--not so much on its artistic merits, but, rather, due to what it symbolized for them: The struggle of the artist against the State. As for the book itself,the writing was almost secondary. In fact, it was not just derided by philistines; many noteworthy authors--among whom number Virginia Woolf and Gertrude Stein--questioned its originality and its effectiveness. (For certainly, most of its now-thought &quot;original techniques&quot; had been used before by other writers to far better effect!) That is to say, &quot;Ulysses&quot; became more important for what it was SUPPOSED to represent than for what it actually was. As time passed and young people of a more liberal turn acceded to positions of social authority, &quot;Ulysses&quot; began to be, almost defiantly, hyped as a modernist masterpiece. This, of course, to tweek the nose of the older generation more than to herald a legitimate work of Art. As a result, whole generations of subsequent Americans have had imposed on them the the ready-made opinion that &quot;Ulysses&quot; holds an unassaible position in the Letters of the World; for, certainly, they fear to have attached to themselves the tag &quot;Vulgarian&quot; if they dare to express their own thoughts on this grossly over-rated book. No, truly, &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a triumph of propoganda that, when taken out of its historical context and judged squarely, falls flat, resuming its true proportions on an artistic level given it by great writers of the time: A dry, pedantic and boring farrago."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you're like me and you like a good brain raping now and then, you'll want to pick up this book.

You have to be pretty well read to approach this novel. Most of the book is inner monologue style, and it is 99% full of obscure references. It helps to have at least some background in the Odyssey and the Bible to understand this novel. I personally do not like a \\"talking heads\\" novel, so I find that I am simply skimming the pages out of boredom. Most of the book's references are very dated so you'll find that most of the text goes \\"over your head.\\" I salute those who \\"get\\" this novel, because you must be quite a worldly individual to not need help with it. For the \\"joe everyman\\" like myself, there's no need to read this book unless it is being assigned to you. I love to read, but this book is honestly making me tiresome of it. You really need alot of patience, a huge dicitonary, a small library of other classic novels, and an understanding of Ireland's history to get through it. I will finish this book, but I will not have taken in a single word at the end. If you MUST read this book, I highly recommend the SPARKnotes to go with to even get an idea of what you just read. Without it, you will just give up.

I'm an older guy who never got around to reading Joyce back in my college days, and have always figured I should.I love complex books--books that require some effort on my part to get through and appreciate. Joyce plowed ground for such novels. But there are a lot of good ones by more modern authors such as Thomas Pynchon, David Foster-Wallace, Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Barbara Kingsolver, etc. etc. etc. All of those books have a lot more action--Ulysses spends too much time with thought and reflection, without enough happening. Part of the challenge of reading Joyce is that he constantly refers to facts and customs and ideas from his time and place, so understanding requires some historical research, which is a diversion from the enjoyment of the literature. It's much more fun to read Pynchon (for example) because the challenges are ones that are supposed to be challenging. In short, I think it's great to catch up on historically important literature, but don't let it divert you from the many great works of more contemporary authors."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Tough to be critical of a classic, but this book will not be finished!

I really enjoyed the simultaneous casting of the characters as social constructions and as owners of free will.

This tale of the adventures of advertising salesman Leopold Bloom on June 16, 1904, in Dublin is a remarkable conflation of mythology, symbolism, philosophy, social realism, and humanity. Bloom's relationships with wife Molly and surrogate son Stephan Dedalus reflect the simple decency of the common man. There is no doubt that reading Ulysses places great demands on the intellect of the reader. Joyce's intentions in writing Ulysses, to present a totally realistic view of one day in the life of ordinary Dublin citizens, yet at the same time to weave into this a grand parallel with Homer's Odyssey and on a smaller scale to deal with issues as complicated as those of Irish politics and religion, mean that before they come upon the novel, it is necessary for the reader to have a wide base of knowledge. The act of interpretation becomes not a burden but an essential part of the act of reading Ulysses for without it the reader might not gain the sense that they are one of the people that the novel is addressed to, rather than just an observer of a finite experience..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I reviewed this book about a week ago.

Perhaps this is the first book to transcend the ability of what it has parodied. To those who have denied recommending it to someone of sixteen or seventeen, I had been upon this earth for a decade and a half when I came upon it, and just reread it one year later. Granted, you need a Latin dictionary and a good book of annotations to thoroughly understand it, but this book has made me realize just what a waste my public rural high school education was--Ulysses is literary heaven and hell and propagator of autodidacticism and eschews all principles of what has ever been said to create this century's magnum opus. I am exactly one-hundred years younger than James Joyce (and Stephen Daedalus), and on the sixteenth of June in 2004 I plan to! take the route of Leopold Bloom to vicariously relive it. One thing to be forewarned about: it is highly addictive. I have developed Ulysses codependency, as will anyone who gets through it. My head aches after reading it, for it is the best kind of masterpiece, the kind that attacks physically and intellectually at once. It is vulgar, carnal, and base (for its time, that is) and at once completely holy and pure because it has allowed the world to start over. Joyce is the avant-garde. He is our master philosopher and psychiatrist, who wrote the book that will never be shredded."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When read by those looking for prose, they go away disappointed. When read by those seeking poetry, they can't put it down. I gave up trying to figure out what was going on about four hours into the marathon reading I went to at the Irish Times in DC on Bloomsday 1991. The words, though. The words kept me there for many, many more hours (and just a few pints). Imagery started leaping out at me, I felt as if I was hallucinating. Not for the timid, weak, or close-minded, but worth the effort if you want to give yourself up to a good book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many have said that Ulysses is the greatest novel written in English in the 20th century. Technically speaking, it's certainly unimagineable that any author could have put more into a book in this or any other century. But it's not for all tastes. You should read Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist before attempting Ulysses, as the former are more accessible and will let you know whether you like Joyce. Read the World's Classics edition of Ulysses, the notes are very helpful. Be prepared to work at this book. It takes some getting used to. Having read it, I think the effort was worth it. Joyce is a genius (evident from his earlier works). His writing is almost lyrical at times and every word is chosen deliberately to achieve the overall impression he seeks to make. He was one of the Protean Modernists, though, and in Ulysses he takes Modernism, the novel and literature itself to their outer limits. At times, thoughts and actions, reality and imagination all get mixed up in this book and sometimes the narrative line just seems to disappear - but isn't this the way of the human psyche? Don't expect Dickens or a plot in its normal sense. Do expect, after all the hard work is done, to marvel at the author's abilities and to have a warm feeling for Leopold Bloom, to wonder at his humanity and to do this despite the character's weaker traits."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Apparently there are 2 species of people who have read &quot;Ulysses&quot;: those who understand it's a great piece of work, and those who are idiots."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A very complex narrative! I think it must be the most difficult reading I ever made. Joyce built an entire new language of literature to write this remarkable novel, an original work in all aspects from tale to structure and language. People talk in many codes, from old rude Irish to Latin, Italian and common english. The description of inarticulate sounds like the cat's &quot;Mrkgnao&quot; was quite new to literature. The tale grasps to describe the everyday action of early century Dublin, a single day of the common life of some Irish villagers - every action, every thought and discussion, every joke, memory and dream! The story is about a man that represents the classic hero inside of the common man. Heroic deeds aren't done only in the bloody fields of senseless wars; the common man does great deeds every day without bloodshed. Remember that Ulysses was a a hero that hated war. Joyce believed that modern literature was empty within its meaningless structures and tales; only the profound significance of the classics could inject human soul back to literature. Joyce believed that people were always unconsciously reliving the classics models in their lifes, like a circle that never ends. Finally, the structure is made of many styles in order to create an entire new genre of modern literature. Think of something and you find it in &quot;Ulysses&quot;: popular songs, discussions, theatre, oniric events, medieval tales, monologues, mind narrative... &quot;Ulysses&quot; has what it takes to stand among the greatest works of mankind's literature. Scholars say that Joyce wrote &quot;Ulysses&quot; as the book that would end with all books, the final stone of modern literature in its way to regain the soul of the classics. They may be right! &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a small world written into book. It's an unique piece of work!Carlos Madeira Portugal, 16th of August of 1999"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"One thousand years from now, when the acid will have long since dissolved the remembrance's from our tombstones and even the internet will have been forgotten, Joyce's works will still be read and loved. His works will outlive our language as Homer's have their greek.I sympathize with those of you who are puzzled, angered and allow yourselves to be defeated by the text. It is much easier to read an accessible classic like The Lord of the Rings (the peoples choice for novel of the century) or The Catcher in the Rye, though they are unrewarding and juvenile works in comparison with Ulysses.As to those of you who pretend to be intellectually superior to Ulysses or the Wake, stop kidding yourselves. Among writers in the english tongue, Joyce ties for second place with Chaucer, just ahead of Milton, a stride behind Shakepeare."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Dear Amazon:How could it be that you publish a review submitted by someone who at the same time admits not having read the book while he rates it with 5 stars?

Why Joyce would set out to purposefully confuse and mislead critics and readers can only be explained by his overbearing, self-absorbed, pretentious nature. A thorough study of Homer's Odyssey and Joyce's Portrait of the Artist - two foundations upon which Ulysses was constructed - will assist the reader in navigating Joyce's murky waters - but not nearly enough to make the effort enjoyable and worthwhile. Stuart Gilbert's famous study will bring the reader further into Joyce's stream of consciousness - but Gilbert chooses to be pretentious and occasionally obscure as well (no surprise since Gilbert and Joyce were collaborators). Joyce was a first rate literary artist - no mistake. Ulysses stands as a milestone in the art form - in many respects the first true &quot;modern&quot; novel (for better or worse). However, for the clerisy of readers, Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist are the limits for appreciating Joyce. Ulysses steps over the line, leading to Finnegan's Wake, which is completely out-of-bounds. Those who do make the effort necessary to understand Joyce's work in Ulysses will come to realize that, rather than celebrate and memorialize the Dublin he knew - as Homer did for the Hellenic world in The Odyssey (creating a lasting vision of the Greek world as the Greeks saw it) - Joyce lays his world in waste and ruin, leaving the landscape in desolation. Joyce's bottom line message can only be interpreted one of two ways: first, that the Heroic Age is so far removed (keeping in mind that Joyce considered the Irish to be Greek descendants) as to be unrelated (if not in opposition) to modern events; or second, that man is incapable of heroism in any form. An interesting interpretation of Joyce's Ulysses is its relationship to the science of chaos, in its complex formation. However, chaos (or more strictly speaking, non-linear dynamic systems) that exists in reality produces incredible complexity from surprisingly simple, non-linear feedback systems. Joyce constructed his work by merging too many source motifs with the intention of creating complexity. In the end, it is the overwhelming negativism that wins out in Joyce's Ulysses, without redemption. Ulysses is one of the great over-praised works. Over-praised because it is inherently flawed, as most great experiments are bound to be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The novel of the century! &quot;Time&quot; Magazine got it right!

The issues of missing text are fixed at least in a spot-check of the opening chapter. I just checked with a new download via the PG website of a 1.72 mb file. But, as of today, you have to do it yourself, not via the instant function here. (Amazon's site is not aligned to do this as of this date of writing. I note as I write this Amazon posted a note that the Kindle free [aka Project Gutenberg] text is not available and that they are looking into reported problems as an \\"item under review.\\")I had first downloaded the free file a few weeks ago (pg4300.mobi @ 1.7 mb) to my Touch. I found that in the the Martello scene, for instance, \\"The Ballad of Joking Jesus\\" sung memorably by Malachi was missing. Other ditties, such as \\"I am the boy...invisibility\\") indicated by indentation in standard form (even in the e-book online via Gutenberg-dot-org) were missing as well from the Kindle version of the free text. In other places, if not surprisingly, spacing was off. I assume later chapters may have lacked the graphic designs that the novel relied upon as to punctuation and page presentation. The spacing looks a little better in the updated download. Let's hope these matters have been corrected, thanks to Gutenberg's team of volunteers for a valuable service after so many decades of copyright control beyond reasonable limits exerted by the author's estate against creative uses.One challenge, if not to be blamed on any version of Joyce's text as published originally. The e-books come in parts I (Stephen), II (Bloom) and III (Molly). So, the chapters attributed later on are not included, but they may be on electronic resources that are not the public domain one, as added value. I cannot figure out on a Kindle how to make bookmarks and label them as to chapters--I did this on an Aldiko version on my phone.Finding gratis a public domain (finally!) version despite its drawbacks is wonderful. I cannot fault those who prepared a difficult text for an e-book for free. There are other versions for sale that are nicer, and they merit their own reviews by others, but Amazon heaps all media for many texts in the public domain together, so rating the medium is jumbled with the content itself, no easy solution.Making e-books off of a notoriously unstable ur-text that's long tested the patience of any Joycean editor already isn't easy. So, the bulk of the novel's intact for reference, concordance work, and looking up passages or phrases nearly instantly. It can always be compared to the Gabler or Random House eds., of course. It's great to have my favorite novel even in its rawer form, to look up or dip into on a Kindle."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Enough good things have been said about Ulysses, and most of them are true. You should benefit greatly from reading such a wondrous masterpiece. But if you are serious you should shy away from the Gabler Edition. It is widely considered among Joyce scholars, and even some of Gabler's original advisers, that he took way too many liberties when producing this edition. He made many noted blunders and errors. In essense, Gabler damaged the script with his misguided sense of editing.I have read the Gabler Edition, and really didn't know better at the time. It was still brilliant and I loved it, but I defer to the experts. I now own the Random House edition, and have skipped around to reread parts of it. Supposedly the Penguin and Everyman's Library editions are worthy reprints of the 1960 edit. There is a forthcoming edit from Norton that is anticipated as becoming the new definitive edit, but they have been delayed in getting it out. Be careful about which edition you get. Some are reprints of the original edition, which contains many errors. Go with Penguin, Everyman's or Random House for now.Also, this Vintage edition is horribly made. The book binding frayed and the book fell apart after a year; the pages all fell out (some individually, but mostly in clumps of 10 to 100 pages)and I was desperately and pathetically trying to keep them together and in order (I was only trying to hold on to the book because of my extensive margin notes). After, a while I just gave up and vowed never to buy Vintage again.I plan on rereading Ulysses, but in a different edition than Vintage. I read it along with The New Bloomsday Book by Harry Blamires. It is an extremely helpful and well regarded commentary/guide."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Don't read \\"Ulysses\\" because of what other people say about it or how highly it's usually ranked among great 20th-c. novels; if you don't like it, move on to something else. But if Joyce intrigues you, well, you've got a lifetime to sort it all out. I've read the book several times and it's never the same experience--Joyce is always many steps ahead of me. When I first read \\"Ulysses\\" as an insufferable young man of 19, I kept thinking, \\"Why does he write this way?\\" (Along with, \\"Why am I not 'getting' it?\\") (Because I was only 19, I guess, and I tried to plow through it quickly so I could tell everyone that I \\"read 'Ulysses'!\\". Ouch.) And talk about slow reading! Let your eyes melt into a paragraph or a sentence. Let it sink in! Perhaps the ideal reader of Joyce is the one who memorizes the entire thing. Let me explain: Everything in \\"Ulysses\\" is interrelated. I'll bet there aren't 20 facts in the book that don't relate somehow to other aspects of the book. He'll mention something in chapter 3, and by chapter 10 he'll mention something else about it. \\"Oh, right; chapter 3.\\" You know, sort of like in real life. Joyce could have written the book normally, but I'm glad he didn't. Like asking Bach to make his fugues simpler. What's the point? and who has the right. Joyce is not deliberately obscure; to me, he's one of the least obscure writers ever. Paging Aristotle! To me, he had the most control over his words of any author who ever lived. (Again, it's all interrelated.) So yes, the book is not going to come alive on the first reading. Poor baby. Takes more than that to peel this onion. If you were to look up all of the allusions etc. in this book, you'd have a solid liberal-arts education. But you don't have to, of course. It's just that the more you know, the more you'll get out of this book. Would that I were raised in Dublin. Oh well; we don't fault Homer for being Greek now do we. And I'm taken aback by some of the Woolf-ian critiques here. Like Voltaire on that \\"barbarian\\" Shakespeare. Like Shaw, Wyndham Lewis weren't jealous; they just hated him because he was so darn good. And even Jung was puzzled; what, hadn't he been studying myth his whole life? Maybe the book seemed more radical in the 1920s. But Joyce wasn't trying to be \\"modern\\" or \\"avant-garde.\\" He couldn't care less about that surreal stuff either. So, \\"Ulysses\\" is perhaps the final book of a long tradition, the fullstop of the West. (Scan the Internet for some articles and join some chat-groups if you don't believe me.) Now, wait; what about \\"Finnegans Wake\\"? Arrrrrrrghhhh!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is without question the most difficult book I have ever read. It is also the most interesting, descriptive, imaginative, funny, poignant, life-affirming, and learned book I have ever read. As someone nearing 50 who has read broadly, I consider the experience of reading Joyce's masterpiece an achievement that was well worth the effort. And it was an effort.The Naxos audiobook was essential for me (I have the CD version, which I downloaded to my Ipod; I have seen comments suggesting that the Kindle version has technical glitches). I am not a particular fan of audiobooks, but the Naxos version is very well put together, and Jim Norton - who reads 98% of the book, does a phenomenal job covering the countless voices that enter and exit (and often reenter) the text. Then Marcella Riordan reads the final monologue of Molly Bloom and her delivery is equally impressive. My approach was to follow along with the text while listening to the audiobook, and then refer to Don Gifford's annoted notes (a separate volume) that provides very helpful background to the often obscure references. For difficult chapters I would also relisten/read the chapter, which always provided added value. It sounds like a slog, and I guess it was, but I repeat: I do not regret a minute of it.

But, after having read it twice, a nagging doubt remains: is it a life-enhancing achievement ? Like the best of Shakespeare or Tolstoy. Does it achieve universality beyond obvious plodder-type references harking back to Homer ? Which are pros and cons ? Among pros, I'd say that most important are exuberant playfulness of language and gorgeously hilarious stampedo of comic banal incidents. Joyce is truly great comic writer. As for his status of the progenitor of experimental prose, I'm more sceptical. The stream of consciousness technique remained confined mostly to English-language literatures; what's more objectionable, it doesn't seem to possess potency of meditative-reflective approach of a Conrad or Proust, nor direct prophetic insight of a Dostoevsky or Lawrence. There is something arid and self-defeating in the very nature of Joyce's endeavor. Among cons two come to mind immediately: a scholastic network of cross-references that serves as the underpinning of the entire structure-something that impresses a naive innocent reader as an erudition beyond, beyond...but, actually is an exercise in a dated and dead world view ( and even this is far from being impeccable-Joyce's reading in philosophy is superficial; he confuses Duns Scotus and Johanes Scotus Erigena ); the other con is the all-pervading banality of virtually everything. As if a double perspective is achieved simultaneously: Joyce's work is as detached as possible, yet, its all-devouring meaninglessness betrays the author's mindset. And this mindset I would call as subjective and life defeating as any imaginable. Conclusion: Joyce's inventiveness and humor produced a great book. At the same time, his aesthetic pseudoreligion and something I could call only a soulless Weltanschauung prevented him to create a summit like &quot;A la recherche&quot;, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; or &quot;The Devils&quot;.

They find it difficult and confusing and without purpose. Some say it is an exercise in intellectually masturbatory narrative, some say it is just a terrible work completely without merit. To those I say, look at Picasso, van gogh or any other artist for that matter and you will gain an appreciation for the work. Let me explain myself.Joyce was quoted as saying something to the effect of \\"If Dublin disappeared off the face of the earth, this book would be able to recreate it down to the last detail\\" now while that is a tad hyperbolic, he illustrates the main point of the novel. To paint a picture of dublin. Imagine a landscape painting be it an urban, idyll, or what have you. You don't necessarily approach it with a plot in mind, you simply enjoy the sites as they are. That is what this book is. Joyce's methods of achieving it are what separate this from the other works of any literary genre.It is a painting in the truest sense of the word. Each chapter forms a kaleidoscope of narrative, point of view and immersive yet alienating sensory details. This hodgepodge of narrative styles can infuriate or delight as it paints with immense detail a single day in the life of one Leopold Bloom.To be sure there are chapters that are extremely opaque and less sensory based than others, but this is a way of enhancing the narrative differences of each chapter. Every chapter is a microcosm of narrative which ultimately creates the macrocosm of the work as a whole. Take for example chapter 15: Circe, this is written as a script. Chapter 17: Ithaca a catechism, Chapter 18: penelope is the purest stream of consciousness ever written.And to those detractors who argue that plot is important, keep in mind not all literature has the intention of telling a story.So I leave you with this. This book is difficult, I'm not going to lie, the first read will be infuriating as almost a guarantee, but with a mindset of Painting over story you may perhaps enjoy it as such and find this review at least somewhat helpful"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This review is specifically for the Naxos AudioBooks production of Ulysses.

So much so that, everything being said and done in the book is at once, posessed of a disturbing clarity and a strong undercurrent of confusion and chaso.Just in case you donot understand the book even after the 1000 odd pages, you still come out a winner. for without having understood anything you have understood the primary characteristic of life, which itself at times is like the book. Chaotic.And in case u have understood it, you have succesfully unravelled the mystery called life."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce flaunts and celebrates style in this book. There's a chapter written in the form of a play, a chapter imitating the development of English, a chapter written in question-and-answer form, a chapter without punctuation (the closing monologue, probably the most beautiful, life-affirming thing ever written), and a chapter written in the sentimental style of a girl's novel. There are countless other stylistic tricks, some of which an impatient reader will miss. Yes, &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a difficult book to read...but just stick with it, pay close attention, and you'll do fine - and in the end, the rewards of having read it will be worth the struggle. Other more recent novels I recommend are P by Conn, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Okay, so we know already that this book has been deemed 'The Greatest Book Ever Written' which is why, I must confess, I endeavoured upon it. I took no literature class concerning it, nor do I plan to. My only other experience with literature that is vaguely similar to this is 'Gravity's Rainbow' by Thomas Pynchon, which I read about a year ago. And although I found the esotericism in GR interesting and comparably relevant to my personal work, I actually found U to be a slightly more entertaining read. However, if it's 'entertainment' your looking for, don't read this. Go read a Stephen King book, or something. In fact, don't read anything, just go see the new Tomb Raider movie....I didn't give this book 5 stars, because, as it's been mentioned in other reviews, there were too many points in the book that I was wanting more. More wordy experiments, more originality. Too often, some sort of brilliant style will surface and then go away and drone on for another 50 pages until some other new and interesting element occurs again. Some may say that I'm simply saying that the book wasn't 'entertaining' enough, contradicting my argument in the previous P. Well, to those I say, whatever. I can deal with being a hypocrit. I mean, when you really think about it, there are two conflicting elements of human nature at work here, 1. the sort-of Americanization of a culture to need constant entertainment, and 2. the instinctive craving to learn. Which is more powerful in you?I will say that if you just want an interesting snippet of this book to read, I'd read the last chapter. This really made the book worth reading IMO. It's done without hardly any punctuation and it's left to the reader to cipher where sentences begin and end, really the definitive stream of conscious technique, but more than that, it's the most emotionally powerful section of the book, right up to the last few words."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As I read Ulysses, I asked myself, what is the point of putting all these words next to each other? When I got to the end, (and not until then) I realized that this book is Joyce's search for God amid everyday life in Dublin. This God(the father) is one who is caring, concerned, shows consideration, and is also a cuckold. One of the greatest moments of my reading career was the question and answer session at the end of part 2, and it is very much worth the journey through the streets of Dublin of June 16, 1904."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Another reviewer complained about &quot;Ulysses, the Corrected Text&quot; as a rewrite by Danis Rose; it is NOT. The Bodley Head (London, 1984) edition of this name was edited by Hans Walter Gabler and has a preface and recommendation by Richard Ellmann, the foremost biographer of James Joyce. This edition is a significant contribution to Joycian publishing and a &quot;must&quot; addition to any complete library of Joyce's works, alongside any of the &quot;original&quot; text works. Joyce's manuscript as sent to the printers was difficult to read (it had many handwritten corrections of corrections and border notes which the original publisher could not decide whether he was supposed to use), and Gabler merely did a highly-regarded job of reconsidering original manuscript materials and other sources. The first- or second-time reader of Ulysses likely would not notice the differences in the text, but Joyce scholars and Ulysses fans regard this as an important reconsideration and an essential work. Most editions of Ulysses use an identical numbering system for sections and paragraphs so that comparisons between editions are easy to make."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How can anybody short of a literary genius review this book?

I just finished it (it's June). Phew!! Yes, it's a hard nut to crack -- you can see why so many people give up in rage and frustration (and unfairly express their resentment at being unable to understand by writing vitriolic reviews). And yes, if you're going to climb Mount Everest (or maybe K2 -- _Finnegans Wake_ appears to be Everest) you need an oxygen mask and a team -- get _The Bloomsday Book_ and _Ulysses Annotated_. But to say it was well worth it would be a giant understatement.I'll try to say in a nutshell what's so great (for me) about it: _Ulysses_ is the incredibly poignant story of one ordinary man's attempts to reconcile himself to his failures as a father, a husband and a human being. At the same time, through its rich description of Dublin (which comes to stand for every human community, everywhere); through a staggeringly complex web of historical, metaphorical and philosophical associations; and through Joyce's use of words, in which the English language _itself_ becomes a character in the novel, _Ulysses_ becomes about much, much more than a day in the life of one man -- it becomes a hugely cosmic-comic and very personal oddyssey through the readers' soul, in which every pretension or fantasy one could possibly have is brought to light and then smashed. Does this sound dismal? It isn't -- it's hilarious; and for those who've made it through, the ending words of Molly Bloom's soliloquy and her final &quot;yes&quot; are the sparkling, intoxicating wine of possibility -- heartbreakingly bittersweet, moving and transcendent."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Let me first start off by saying I love the book. Its language is of the likes I have never before seen. And, let me also say, that while people who hate this book will try to totally disparage it and, in my opinion, try to burn it, if they had the chance, you, the prospective reader of this book, should cast aside all preconceived notions, whether yours or others', about this book. Just as well: throw my comments about the book away, and decide for yourself (because that is just what I said). But keep the idea of deciding for yourself, and disregard all the ploys that people will try to get you to not read this book, and go read this book, you just might enjoy it.Besides, how do other people know what you will like?

Just good all around product.

We have been through Faulkner stream-of-consciousness in high school and college English classes, and we can turn on the computer for live webcams all over the world, and we have been treated to the minutae of the Osbournes and other reality TV series. All of these - whether you consider them high art or dubious social experiments - are attempts to understand the human condition and the interaction among individuals in the most mundane of settings: daily life and relationships and the wandering life of the mind. Just as modern dramatists all stand on the shoulders of Shakespeare, so do modern literary writers stand on the shoulders of James Joyce. It is quite a hoot, however, to read what was deemed so &quot;obscene&quot; - we have sure come a long way (or fallen a long way, however you choose to look at it) - but the sheer craft of this book cannot be denied. Literature turned a sharp corner with this work. Yes, some of the passages can become tedious - and the references obscure (but even if you don't look them up, the overall effect is not lost) - it is best to read those long musing rambles almost with soft-focus eyes and let your mind flow with the words as if they were your own interior monologue. Another useful approach is to read them like poetry. Some of the phrases are just delicious and could stand on their own, perhaps like free verse or haiku. On first try, I didn't make it through Ulysses - a couple of years later, I tried again and took the pressure off myself to understand every sentence or to follow the &quot;story.&quot; I just read, and became completely engrossed."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It seems, in this new century of total instant access to everything, that the accepted way of persuading people to read \\"Ulysses\\" is to say that it's a damn fine book but you need to be an experienced reader with a lot of time on your hands and plenty of patience...etc. Let's get a few things clear. This is not the \\"Critique of Pure Reason\\". There is not some algorithm you have to work out in advance in order to enjoy this book. It's a novel. It's a good read. The other stuff, the background stuff, the structural cunning and the wide-ranging allusiveness, is there in case you want to read it again. Basically, this is an unusually intelligent novel, in a basically comic mode, that plays a few games with the ways that we (sometimes lazily) tend to read. The rest is just a bonus. Joyce is just so generous in his joking and his desire to give us more than we normally expect from a book that we can get a bit overwhelmed by the cornucopia of stuff that he lays at our feet.I first read Ulysses when I was about 17 - I was still in what Americans would call high school, I wasn't reading it because I had to, but because I had heard it was supposed to be one of the best books around and it was set in the city around which I had grown up. I found the first three chapters a bit tricky but I kept going, because it seemed to me that the guy knew what he was doing. Then I got to the fourth chapter, and it suddenly became much easier. It seemed to me that this was the kind of thing that most of the writers I liked were trying to do, but most often failed at, because they just weren't this good. Joyce is supremely good at conveying the physical sensations of being alive - what it's like to be hungry, sad, lustful, worrisome, tired, hopeful, nervous. As the book went on, I knew I wanted to trust this guy. In the later sections, Joyce seemed to be expecting what I wanted to happen, and seemed determined to persuade me that how I wanted the book to develop wasn't necessarily the best way for the book to go - and I believed him. Since I hadn't read many \\"great\\" novels, his changes in style seemed to me to be exactly the sort of thing that an adventurous writer should be doing. I thought then, and still think, that he can be a bit garrulous, but he's such a skilful writer that I don't wish he'd made the book any shorter than it is.By the end, Ulysses had come to represent my basic idea of a really great novel. I had no notion that most novels aren't anything like as daring or as enjoyable. The only other novels I've read since which are both as courageous and as entertaining as this one are Pynchon's \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\", Sterne's \\"Tristram Shandy\\" and Melville's \\"Moby-Dick\\". Which, I know now, will tell you a lot about my taste in fiction.You really don't need to be an expert reader to appreciate \\"Ulysses\\". If anything, it's better if you have either read everything, or next to nothing. The notes are handy, if you want to know all that's going on - and I don't see why that should hurt. But even without them, Joyce - as they used to say of a certain brand of beer - can reach parts that other writers (or for that matter, beers) can't reach. He is a truly wonderful writer, and I'm (foolishly) proud that the greatest of novelists in the English language was an Irishman.People are still writing great novels - Pynchon's last was a lovely late masterpiece, and Don DeLillo is as vigorous as ever. But my personal opinion is that Joyce kicked a flagging Victorian form into new life, and the impact of his scuffed tennis shoe is still raw and smarting. \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is still awaiting the readers it deserves. In the meantime, there's no reason why any curious reader shouldn't get something out of \\"Ulysses\\". It's my favourite novel. It's also the best Irish book so far. Mind you, I can't wait till Mairtin O Cadhain's \\"Cre na Cille\\" gets translated into English..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"&quot;Ulysses&quot; is perhaps the most challenging and rewarding book that I have ever read. Its slow pacing and density frustrated me the first time through, although the book provided enough snippets of briliance that I kept reading. However, after putting it on the shelf for a year, I picked up a copy of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; by Homer and read the two side by side. This made the events in &quot;Ulysses&quot; much more understandable, as Joyce borrowed the structure of his book from &quot;The Odyssey.&quot; It also helped me glimpse the true brilliance of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. By taking one of history's most epic tales and overlaying it onto a single day in the life of an average, unremarkable man, both books furthered my understanding of the common aims and desires of all people. If you buy &quot;Ulysses&quot;, pick up &quot;The Odyssey&quot; as well; this, more than any &quot;Joyce 101&quot; guides, will help you understand thiss fascinating and multilayered book. If you give it time and don't concern yourself with how long it takes to read, this book will grow on you and you will realize how many insights it provides on the human condition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses (1922) breaks traditional conventions of fiction: like Finnegans Wake (1939) it can hardly be appreciated completely unless passages are read aloud; like Homer's Odyssey it chronicles a plot of epic proportions, with details so rich and colourful they virtually epitomize realism and the stream-of-consciousness technique; and like the short stories in Joyce's Dubliners (1914) or Classical Greek drama, it focuses on a very specific, particular situation: a day in the life of a Dublin canvasser, Leopold Bloom.Ulysses gained a favourable reputation among Modernist contemporaries like Ezra Pound. Its inclusion of the vulgar language of Dublin's people was offensive to many, leading to public book-burnings and prohibitions against its publication. By the 1960s, when such concerns over language had dissipated, Ulysses still remained the esoteric interest of a limited number of readers. This is due partly to the text's numerous obscure passages and its reputation for being a &quot;difficult&quot; text. However, a basic knowledge of the Odyssey and an acceptance of the stream-of-consciousness technique -- which had, we should note, been employed in limited measure by writers like Dickens -- allows the patient reader to revel in decoding the text's plot, its puns, and its symbolic levels of meaning. Indeed, many editions of the work feature outlines listing some of the main features of each passage -- the equivalent of the pithy chapter titles that usually accompany the text of more traditional novels.Ulysses chronicles a place and time (Edwardian Dublin) but also a site and an age (the city and the 20th century). It does so with language that reflects the irony and fragmentation associated with the Modern era and its problems, as related in the novel. It took many laborious years to write (arguably, only Finnegans Wake would be more challenging to its author). Nonetheless, both of Joyce's long works have been immense influences on fiction and poetry in this century: they have re-asserted and re-emphasized the non-linear, non-written aspects of language (e.g. the Wake begins by ending its last sentence); they have (in Derrida's estimation) overturned Western society's privileging of speech (logocentrism) over writing (since many of the words and puns can only be understood via reading them on the page); and yet they retain a simple, straightforward backbone of human experience, connectedness, and imagination as their primary themes."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is an episode of the British TV series \\"Black Books\\" (a surreal comedy set in a second hand bookshop) where Manny says to his cruel employer Bernard: \\"I just sold that customer a copy of \\"Ulysses\\", \\"The Guide to Ulysses\\" and \\"A Handbook to the Ulysses Guide\\". Now surely that deserves a star.\\" This episode is even funnier now that I've read \\"Ulysses\\" for myself. Any reader who actually manages to get through \\"Ulysses\\" probably deserves a star as well.I read this book because it was reported to be controversial and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I knew Anthony Burgess (the author of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\") was an expert on James Joyce and I've read other books that are written in strange versions of English (\\"The Night Land\\" by William Hope Hodgson, \\"Riddley Walker\\" by Russell Hoban and the aforementioned \\"A Clockwork Orange\\"). It was interesting to learn that James Joyce was the writer who invented the lingual style known as \\"stream of consciousness\\".Having already read a Penguin Classics edition of \\"A Portrait of the Artist As A Young Man\\", I thought I'd give \\"Ulysses\\" a shot. The copy of \\"Ulysses\\" that I read was a hardcover 1966 edition, published by Bodley Head. At 933 pages, the book posed an additional challenge by having no introduction at the front and no explanatory notes at the back. The plain green cover had no illustration and no blurb. Nevertheless I persevered.So what is \\"Ulysses\\" actually about? The only way a reader can appreciate this book is to have a knowledge of Homer's \\"Odyssey\\". That's what \\"Ulysses\\" is - a modern retelling of the Odyssey, taking place in Dublin on June 16 1904. There's no doubt that \\"Ulysses\\" caused a stir when it was first published (1922). People would have been more easily shocked back then. Even when the film adaptation was shown in New Zealand in the more liberated 1960s the audience was segregated by gender.If I have piqued a prospective reader's curiosity, all well and good. Although the book weighs 1 kilogram on the scales, \\"Ulysses\\" is definitely not light reading. As an experimental work, I would say that \\"Ulysses\\" does for literature what \\"Eraserhead\\" does for cinema. That's the best comparison I can think of. Read it if you can."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The greatest achievement in western literature is now available in a bound version heretofore reserved for second rate \\"How to\\" books from the remainder bin. This publisher offers no preface, foreword, notes, or so much as an illustrator's credit for the apt cover; the sole redeeming feature of this tawdry effort. Usually clocking in at 740 pages plus, this version manages to squeeze every word of the masterwork into a nimble 554 pages, thanks to a total lack of margin space or chapter breaks. Laughably, the book's spine does not allow even for this squeezed assembly, so that it arrives splayed and bow-legged, in unintentional tribute to the willowy author perhaps. Under-inked to the point of appearing mimeographed, with serifs giving way on almost every page, this is hardly the version one needs of a book to be cherished and re-visited often."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This edition is the best and most readable edition of Ulysses available. As far as tackling the book goes... well, you get out of it what you put into it, but be prepared to put a lot into it. Simply: Don't read Ulysses because you feel like you have to or you should, read it because you want to and don't be too proud or afraid to seek out help.I was lucky enough to tackle this book in a classroom setting but it is not so utterly incomprehensible as to make that the only way to understand it. There are many guides (Stuart Gilbert's was the one we used but I suspect there are better. I even found sparknotes useful just for a chapter summary after reading.) to help people through the text and its deeper workings.The real question is, why choose this version of Ulysses over another, cheaper version? The text has been thoroughly reworked and many publishing mistakes directly interfering, misinterpreting, or outright disregarding Joyce's plan for his book have been fixed. The editors have nothing but the utmost respect for Joyce and for Ulysses and that care is evident throughout the book as the hands of the editors remain invisible behind Joyce's words.So rant and rave and rant and rave but I nearly gave this 4 stars just because of the product. The book itself, the binding and the cover, are absolutely terrible. My book was brand new and my cover fell off before I was halfway through it. By the end of the course more than half the books in our class were damaged and many of them had pages falling out as well. There's no excuse for any book, let alone the most important book of the 20th century, to fall apart while reading it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have never heard anything like this before. It is sure fire to increase one's aesthetic sensibility and broaden one's sense of being alive."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce describes the ways that Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus follow, from dawn 'til night, on June 16, 1904. What's special about this day? Nothing, absolutely nothing. Bloom fixes breakfast, goes to the bathroom, does business, attends his friend Paddy Dignam's funeral, goes back to work, strolls on the beach, gets drunk with some friends, follows the party at a brothel, gets Dedalus out of a problem, and then invites him home for more drinks. Then he goes to sleep. Dedalus wakes up in Buck Mulligan's place (a tower), goes to teach at a school, wanders around the beach after visiting some relatives, goes to the library, in the evening he goes to a bar with some friends, and finally he meets Bloom at the brothel.This immeasurable book is a desperate attempt at capturing the present, which is constantly escaping: the present on the inside and the outside of people. It is an absolute witness of what the characters see, hear, fell, smell, and speak to themselves. It is looking for utter simultaneousness, trying to be an absolut record of everything that goes thorugh the bodies and minds of the main characters. Meanings? Symbols? Interpretations? Infinite. This book leaves, among many others, the sensation that it has passed and left us blank; that we didn't retain anything, that we hold nothing of it: exactly the same sensation that the present leaves on us.Every chapter parallels a chapter from Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and each is written in a different style. As a literary work of art, it is incomparable: it uses language, symbols, syntaxis, pronouns, time, everything, in a unique way, in order to depict for us what happens to a person in a normal day.A separate mention is deserved by the final chapter, the monologue of Molly Bloom. 50 pages without a period, a true masterpiece of stream-of-consciousness. A most faithful portrait of what goes through a woman's mind half awaken, half asleep, a summary of her life and her relationship with Leopold. It is necessary to read this passage in one single effort.When reading &quot;Ulysses&quot;, it is useful to keep in mind Marcel Proust's work. Proust seeks to recover the past long gone, while Joyce seeks to capture the present before it becomes past. This is an overwhelming book, irritating and, above all, admirable. It reaches unsuspected levels of creativity, experimentation and literary depth.Some people don't like it: that's their prerrogative. But to say this is a phony or bad book, is to acknowledge one's laziness as reader. They're losing a tour-de-force in literature. Be sure you don't suffer the same fate."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It took me more than 4 weeks to finish this book. Most parts of the book were difficult to understand. That means I didn't understand them.I started out thinking it would be a great journey to read the whole 700+ pages of great writing. As I went along, I found that I couldn't understand one-tenth of what was going on. Well, I had to finish the book because I wanted to experience what many people say is the greatest novel ever written.One thing I learned from reading this book is that when you are faced with something you don't understand, it is okay to get the hell out.

Still, this has the internal poetry, doggerel, etc. that the the free edition has excised.Update: This is now listed as Ulysses (Annotated Edition) for $1.99."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"In this book, Joyce continually reminds his readers that this 265,000-word epic utilizing over 30,000 different words is more about his prowess, and sometimes less about your pleasure.As athletic feat is derived from hours of repetitive drills, so too may this novel's conquest only be enjoyed after years of reading ever improving literature. This is not a book for the amateur. Precisely the opposite, this is a book continually referring to other novels, uses language of greater expanse than most others, and is written in styles which make the complexities vastly increased.More puzzle maker than novelist, Joyce's decision to write in paradox, paradigm, pun, parody, contrarian, contradiction and more makes the reading experience as complete as one could ask in the English language. The array of writing styles is mesmerizing: simple novel; over 30 pages of newspaper column; a 180-page play; over 70 pages of questions followed by answers; and one final chapter made up of seemingly 30-40 pages in ONE sentence of rambling autobiographical sexual revelation by Molly Bloom - the protagonist's cavorting wife.The interplay of the styles is extremely brave and enlightening. As they touch upon the same topic, but in different voices and different styles, the reader can further delve into what transpired hundreds of pages before, when the writer intentionally did not reveal it all, and definitely did not reveal it in easily decipherable verse. The interrelation between the texts would allow one to probably read the chapters in different orders and end in the same frame of mind. Nabokov asserted one could do such to his \\"Lolita.\\" And, Nabokov, creator of \\"Pale Fire\\", reminds me so much of Joyce as each toys with and teases the reader with puns, parodies and sometimes outdated jokes.The main characters, Leopold Bloom and Molly Bloom, are known to even those who have not read the novel. Their mutual philandering is the focus of much of the novel. The exploits of each are relatively revealed. But, not in black and white English. The point is taken, and from this came one great pornography trial which culminated with a 1933 United States District Court decision proclaiming, \\". . . the effect of \`Ulysses' on the reader undoubtedly is somewhat emetic, nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac.\\"Such words would not be clearer. \\"An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollification suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.\\" University level English is a prerequisite to understand this alleged smut - or to use Joyce's words: concupiscence delivering induration.And, most of the book, believe it or not, is not about sexual issues. Much touches upon other topics: philosophy, anti-Semitism, socialism . . . . But it is not always condescending; and it is much more than a 700-800-pages of dialectic prose. Because some of those topics are extremely poignant in 2009, those portions of the book apply to today's themes and can be easily (?) read today. Other topics are not for today's discussion. And, that makes reading those portions very difficult for today's reader.In all honesty there were times when I read the novel and asked, \\"what am I missing?\\" I had to stop and reflect, \\"Do others really see something that I cannot?\\" For instance the following passage really lost me: \\"What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Green gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too.\\" Do I need recite more? This caught my interest as much as a \\"White on White\\" painting at the museum of modern art. \\"I just don't get it.\\"And then, later I read the question-answer portion (second to last chapter), and the efficiency and beauty of the writing is both unique and unparalleled. A master of accidence and syntax, the writing is clear and artistic and most importantly - understandable. At the end of that chapter, I could only close the book, lean back and reflect on what I just read, and say one word, \\"Shazam.\\"Like climbing a mountain, the trek may be difficult - but at the journey's end, the party who endured the hardship will be rewarded with a lifetime of memories. Because of some bizarre passages of experimental prose and style, I cannot assert this is my favorite book. Not even the top ten for me. But, it is a great book. And, so well worth the read.Few tips: Read \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" and maybe the \\"Dubliners\\" before this. I would also recommend reading the last two chapters before reading from the beginning. And have a dictionary nearby. You will use it. Trust me."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I started reading Ulysses at the end of my junior year in high school with absolutely no knowledge of how difficult or \`great' it was reputed to be. I just bought a used copy and started reading after an essay about it struck my fancy on the SATs. There will be people who tell you that Ulysses is a work of art that can be appreciated only by someone of great intelligence and a high level of education. There will be people who tell you that the book is comprised of pretentious dribble that no one actually understands; designed to make \`intellectuals' feel good about themselves for pretending to \`get' it. Both are wrong. Ulysses is just a book. There will be people who love it and people who hate it, regardless of their intelligence. If you hate it, it doesn't mean that you're stupid or that you don't \`get' it; it just means that it's not your cup o' tea. So why not give it a chance?Personally, I'm no genius, and I adored Ulysses. I didn't have to read it with a map, a dictionary, and a book of Irish proverbs at my side, either. Yes, to get every possible thing that you can get out of it, you'll need these things, but you don't need them to fall in love with the characters, laugh at their awkward conversations, or marvel at Joyce's use of language. Chances are, if you can make it through the book out of liking it- and not just out of a sense of duty- then you'll want to go back and read it again anyways (well, perhaps after a short break) so you don't need to understand every little detail your first time through.Because of its reputation, Ulysses does tend to attract either the snobs who quote the most difficult parts of the book as the \`greatest,' or the snobs who can't get over the fact that they don't enjoy one of the most famous books of all time and quote the most difficult parts of the book as a reason not to read it. This makes it seem more dense than it really is. If you're patient and willing to pay attention, Ulysses isn't nearly as difficult as it's reputed to be. Just use the \\"Search Inside\\" feature on this site and take a look at the first chapter. The language itself isn't too difficult, it's the fact that the language and technique do take some time to get used to- so by the time you get into the rhythm, a new chapter starts and the style of the prose changes altogether. You just need to read slowly and patiently- and for the love of God don't skip passages. Yes, there are maybe one or two chapters that are pretty tough (Oxen of the Sun, probably, is the most notable) but the vast majority of the book is perfectly easy to understand to the patient reader.If you do opt out of Ulysses, you'll miss out on some of the most awesome, well-developed, and loveable characters in all of literature. Because Joyce chronicles the stream of consiousness of the main characters in a few of the chapters, we not only get to see what they think, but how they think it. It's hard to explain but very cool. The brilliant, modest, and socially awkward Leopold Bloom takes the role of the 'hero' or 'Odysseus' of the story. There is no possible way for me to describe how deep, hilarious, tragic, and downright likeable he is. Sadly, no one in the book really enjoys his presence, and a cloud of awkward silence seems to follow him wherever he goes. Pretentious, moody, and selfish, Stephen Dedalus takes the role of Telemachus. He's angsty, introverted, sarcastic and incredibly funny. The more minor characters are just as important, notably Buck Mulligan, Stephen's obnoxious, smug, life-of-the-party type roommate (think of your typical frat-boy) is very funny (if incredibly annoying to Stephen,) as is Molly, Leopold's (somewhat understandably) unfaithful wife, whose inner thoughts make up the entirety of the book's completely unpunctuated final chapter. The jingoistic anti-Semite \\"The Citizen\\" and Stephen's clueless, annoying boss are also both amazing.The book doesn't follow The Odyssey religiously, but I did find myself thankful that I had read the Greek epic before approaching Ulysses. This edition doesn't have the names of the chapters, (I don't know if any edition does) and I would suggest finding out what they are and writing them in. They give a good idea of the general theme of each chapter, and the contrast between the ancient heroes (Odysseus and Telemachus) and the modern day heroes (Leopold and Stephen) is a huge point of interest. It's also good to have a decent knowledge of the history of Ireland. I did find myself wishing that I knew more about Shakespeare (Stephen's obsessed with Shakespeare and prattles on about him constantly), other famous authors and philosophers, different languages, and Irish culture and history, but the book taught me more than it stumped me.I am only eighteen, and even though I could talk about Ulysses all day, I know that I don't yet have the ability to even scratch the surface of its' complexity and depth. I certainly plan on reading and re-reading it as I become more educated, but the reason that I want to is because it is, in essence, a good, funny, dramatic, and thoroughly entertaining read unto itself. Please, try not to pass up on it just because of its reputation."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Typical straight-from-Project-Gutenberg textfile conversion: no ToC, no italics, no chapter breaks. See comparative review here:Ulysses"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you haven't read Ulysses yet, and feel daunted by the wildly different, extremely strident reviews of it, read on and I'll try to explain why this novel is worth your while.First, a brief summary. Ulysses attempts to capture what life was like in Dublin, Ireland, at the start of the twentieth century. It doesn't do this like a history book, solely in terms of political events and noteworthy individuals; rather, it attempts to convey the nature of the day-to-day lives of ordinary people by following its protagonist, an inoffensive fellow named Leopold Bloom, around the city. (It occasionally switches to following a young man named Stephen Dedalus, whom Bloom meets eventually, but Bloom is the main character.) It describes the things that transpire in the world around Bloom, as well as the thoughts that go on inside his head.Ulysses contains many disparate literary styles, but none are gratuitous; all are used in the service of the novel's themes. Joyce wanted to show how poetry, history, heroism, romanticism, and indeed all of human civilization, can be found slumbering in each individual, no matter how mundane his life might be. This comes to the fore in chapter 14, in which Bloom goes to a maternity ward to convey his best wishes to a woman in labour. When he arrives, he meets a bunch of drunk medical students who make callous remarks that make him uncomfortable; after some time, the nurse comes in and announces that the woman successfully gave birth, which relieves Bloom's anxiety. In addition to these simple events, the chapter tells the entire history of England. That is, the first paragraph is written in monosyllabic Druidic calls, the second approximates the style of ancient Latin historians, the third glides into early Anglo-Saxon poetry (\\"before born babe bliss had\\"), then it switches to Chaucer and medieval prose, and so on, the style of each paragraph moving a little bit forward in history, until it collapses into a mix of modern slang in the end.Thus, in numerous prose styles, the chapter recreates the birth and life of the English language itself, without warning the reader that it's doing this. In essence, it shows the history of a whole civilization in an original way. But the important part is, it never stops making sense; the plot and the dialogue keep progressing along with the style. Thus, the birth of a child is shown alongside the birth of the whole English language, indicating that civilization is born anew with every new human being. An ordinary birth is made to look like the culmination of all of English history, thanks entirely to this method of describing it. You don't have to have read Chaucer and Shakespeare and Gibbon to appreciate this chapter; Joyce read them for you, so all you have to do is watch the language change.This happens all the time throughout the book. For instance, chapter 13 finds Bloom wandering around on a beach, where some teenage girls are hanging out and talking. Without further ado, the book inserts itself into the mind of one of these girls. Her thoughts aren't anything amazing: basically, she just wants to fall in love with a handsome man, be loved in return, and be happy. However, in describing these thoughts, Joyce adopts the style of a dime-store romantic novel of the sort that are marketed to teenage girls: it's rife with sentimental, flowery prose like \\"the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.\\" The thing is, this style accurately reflects what folks go through during their teenage years: it's got the same heightened emotion, the same vague yearning, the same feeling one gets when falling in love for the first time, that this has never before happened to anyone else and will never happen again, the same romanticism and idealism. Thus, it's remarkably easy to sympathize with the girl, again solely due to Joyce's technique.That's probably the biggest reason to read Ulysses: all these styles and epic analogies are founded on a powerful emotional centre. Some folks like to say that this book is a \\"celebration of life,\\" or something to that effect. Well, in my opinion, it's a book about loneliness more than anything else. A large part of the book consists of Bloom's internal monologues, creating the impression that he's constantly hounded by unwelcome thoughts. When he's not running into hostile nationalists or petty gossips, he thinks about his adulterous wife. Then, in chapter 14, he meets Stephen Dedalus, decides to follow him out of the maternity ward and into the red light district, and then brings him home. Bloom, whose own son died eleven days after being born, feels fatherly affection toward Stephen; yet, Bloom and Stephen have nothing to say to each other. They engage in some small talk, but Stephen clearly doesn't take Bloom seriously, and Bloom doesn't really know how to approach Stephen. Then, Stephen, who is the closest thing to a friend that Bloom has met all day, leaves. Bloom goes upstairs and goes to sleep next to his wife; the final chapter is told from his wife's point of view, and it becomes abundantly obvious that her perception of her own husband is often wrong, and always strangely detached, as if he's not close to her at all despite living under the same roof. The style is breathtaking, rhythmic stream-of-consciousness, highlighting the sadness of this emotional distance between the characters.So, don't feel threatened by the style. Ulysses is very readable; true, each chapter has its own style, but most of the styles are perfectly accessible, and make the plot more engaging. All the \\"difficult\\" parts don't happen until the second half, giving you time to get accustomed to Joyce's idiosyncrasies (he doesn't tell you when he's moving from objective description to internal monologue, but after a while, you can usually tell). Just you try it on."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I bought this to supplement the 1961 Random House edition (balance of textual corrections and respect for the original, matches most annotations), Modern Library edition (most portable, attractive package as all ML editions, typography a tad hard on my 40-something eyes) and '80s \\"Gabler edition\\" (hotly contested, worth keeping as a collector's item as it's been largely withdrawn).The original Shakespeare & Co. printings are out of my league, although I've seen several. Until I hit the lottery, this is the closest I'll own. A quick Google will find you first edition, first printing copies selling for up to 100k. I doubt my stimulus check is that big.This is a textual facsimile - a photo reproduction of the original, 1000-copy first edition - copy #784, to be exact. It also reproduces the cover typography and the Shakespeare and Co. title page, with an added, Orchises title page to keep the record clear. It contains the original colophon. It doesn't contain the forward, letter from Joyce to Bennett Cerf or Judge Woolsey opinion you're probably used to seeing in American editions.In a physical sense, it's hard to say how this is a facsimile, other than Orchises has reproduced the full size of the original. Of course, the paper and binding material are different.Most S. & Co. editions came unbound in blue-green wrappers, and could be bound as desired. This is why you see original printings in such disparate bindings. Orchises has reproduced the color of the original wrappers, although their binding looks a little more green than the original wrappers (maybe the color has shifted on those?). In any case, it's a solid cloth binding, comparable to, say, a better-than-average library binding. Bound size given as 9.6 x 7.5 x 1.7 inches, I measure it a hair taller. I daresay it will hold up to extended use.In addition to giving the slight tingle of pleasure that comes from knowing you're reading the text as originally sold at 12, Rue de l'Odeon, this edition is much more comfortable on my eyes than the others. I like the typeface used by original printer Maurice Darantiere for readability, but haven't gotten a definitive answer as to what it is - does anyone know? Somehow, it just feels right.Orchises says the paper is 50-pound, ph-balanced (aka acid-free) paper, and that seems about right. It's really good paper, with a slight, almost visually undetectable textured finish that feels good to the fingers. Excellent paper-to-ink contrast. I can, and will, read this all day.For the average reader, there's no earthly reason to spend this amount on a novel, and the ML edition will be both more convenient and, with its front material, more informative. For someone who rereads Ulysses for pleasure, it's a joy. The 1922 text has been analyzed to death, and is not without errors (2,000? 3,000? 5,000? the number gets larger each time it's mentioned). It was perhaps inevitable in a book with no clear reference manuscript - even the extant manuscripts were to some degree created by Joyce after the fact for sale. Part of one manuscript was burned by the angry husband of a typist, who found its content objectionable. An appreciable percentage of the text was written as corrections on the original proofs.Hence the charming apology from Sylvia Beach reproduced in this facsimile: \\"The publisher asks the reader's indulgence for typographical errors unavoidable in the exceptional circumstances. S.B.\\"But each effort to correct the errors added more errors, as well as layers of contention. See the well-documented battle over the Gabler edition. Or the disastrous 1998 \\"Reader's edition\\" by Danis Rose. The original is as good as any for reading, and if you care enough to buy a facsimile, you will have other editions for comparison anyway.For scholarly use, this isn't the best edition, since most standard annotations match the Random House or Modern Library editions. Unless you're beyond Ulysses 101 and want to compare editions.This is one of three first-edition facsimiles that have been published. I can't speak to the others, but I can recommend this one. Kudos to Orchises, and I hope they keep it in print. Or not, so my copy will become a minor-league collector's item.Ulysses has become an obsession and and a world in and of itself for its partisans, of whom I am one. The Ulysses obsession is much like the Higher Criticism surrounding the Sherlock Holmes canon. Many people find it bizarre, and I can hardly disagree. If, like me, you've got the bug, I don't have to explain it to you. This is an edition for you.If you don't, I paraphrase Louis Armstrong: \\"If you have to ask, you'll never know.\\""},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Let's not mince words: Ulysses is one of the highest achievements of literary modernism. But it is also a book that must be read again and again (and again) if it is to be understood and enjoyed. Why buy a pulpy and cheaply made edition that falls to pieces on the second read? The Orchises edition, as a physical artefact, is not only aesthetically worthy of the text it presents (including the generous white space framing the text itself)--it also has the durability and weight you'd normally expect from a Bible.Other reviewers have detailed how this book is a faithful facsimile of the 1922 editions. The only other thing I would add is that this is the edition whose colour scheme Joyce himself oversaw: The white text and blue background of the cover symbolise the pentelic marble of Greece and the greenblue of the Mediterranean respectively (which are also the colours of the Greek flag).I thoroughly recommend this beautiful book for anyone who is serious about Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"June 16th, 1904 in Dublin - a city under British rule and starting to try and shrug off the weight of the colonial oppression. On this day Joyce sets his &quot;heroes&quot; (heroes that only Joyce could create), Leopold Bloom (Ulysses) and Stephen Dedalus (Telemachus), on their own odysseys through Dublin's streets. Along the way we get a catalog of minor disappointments and victories, major literary experiments and a reading experience to truly last a lifeline.Stephen Dedalus, the hero from Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man, is the young student, the educated, literary and artistic individual somewhat based on Joyce himself. Leopold Bloom is the older, cynical 20th century everyman, in search of a son (where Stephen is, to some extents, missing a father). They make their individual journeys around Dublin that day, finally coming together in a chance meeting and then becoming friends.If you are after a riveting story, you won't find it here - the previous paragraph somes it up! What we get is to walk in these (and other people's) shoes for a day. We experience their small successes - an idle flirtation perhaps; we are with them as they realize some minor disappointment. Joyce termed these experiences ephiphanies and, to some extent, that's what Ulysses is - many, many iter-related and multi-layered ephiphanies.We also feel part of Dublin the city and Ireland the country. It's difficult looking back now after 80 years of home rule, with its successes and failures, what it must have looked like then unsure of what the future would bring. Joyce gives us a divided picture - we see the &quot;citizen&quot;, the nationalistic and stubborn individual who desires freedom at any cost; we see those who are staunchly royalist and who support (flirt with in the case of some of the women) the British soldiers. Joyce's picture is no one-dimensioned protestant-Catholic division either. This element of the book has great interest in it's own right.Ulysses has parallels from Homer's &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. The correspondence from chapter to chapter is highly selective. Some chapters use purely literary techniques to make a parallel (in particular &quot;The Sirens&quot;) where others have more pointed comparisons. You do not need to be familiar with The Odyssey to get something out of this book. Familiarity with Joyce's earlier works - Dubliners and Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man - is very useful, as is an understanding of Shakespeare's Hamlet. References to all of these abound.What you will probably also need is a guide. I used Harry Blamires's &quot;The New Bloomsday Book&quot; and I would seriously recommend using it or something similar on a first reading. Joyce's writing in this book is wonderful but it can be very very difficult. Having someone hold your hand on the journey helps you get much more out of it.The style of writing changes throughout the book; Joyce was experimenting with literary techniques to help tell the tale and give us insight into his character. Some of these are very successful - some are rather inpenetrable. In particular the &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot; chapter is very hard-going in parts!However, unlike some other literary works, Ulysses is always fun. You might find you get the most out of some of it if you read it aloud (or imagine yourself doing so) because much of the work is highly poetical. For the final chapter - the only one told from a female perspective - the heavy stream of consciousness deserves to be read in a gallop, letting the words flow over you.Joyce wrote this seminal work over a period of seven years and, at times, it felt it would take me that long to finish it. It's certainly not something to embark upon if you won't be able to devote considerable time to it. With so many great books to be read, you may wonder why you should devote this amount of time and energy on a single book. In this case the answer is because it is a unique, wonderful and life-enhancing experience."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Easily the most exciting book ever written. I'd give it 6 stars (or 10) if i could. Yes, i needed the Cliff notes to help me through it, and yes, i was on disability at the time, recovering from 4 knee surgeries, and it took more than 6 weeks, but it was all worth it. It's an amazing thing, a polyglotting amalgamation of languages (i counted more than 30, and am sure i missed a lot more), internal and external dialogue, brilliantly rendered characters and even dirty jokes.Perhaps i was ignorant beforehand, but i'd always thought that &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; referred to only the WRITER'S mental wanderings, the way beats like William Burroughs (e.g., Naked Lunch) and Allen Ginsburg (Howl, America, etc.) would later do it, or Marcel Proust (a\` la recherche du temps perdu--let's face it, the translations just don't cut it) during Joyce's time. But Joyce, progenitor of the beats and contemporary of Proust, did it for DIFFERENT PEOPLES' CONSCIOUSNESSES, moving from spoken word to internal thought states of several of his vividly drawn characters, and back again. It's almost impossible to convey the wonder of discovering this beauty, the way Joyce represented such a quantum leap in literature from Dostoyevsky, Dickens and Kafka before him, as Einstein did from 19th century physics.And to those who say &quot;anyone who says they've [sic] read this book is a liar,&quot; i promise you i read EVERY WORD, from &quot;Stately, plump Buck Mulligan&quot; to &quot;Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, Lacus Mortis. Ominous, revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun&quot; to &quot;and his heart was going like mad and yes i said yes I will Yes,&quot; the final words of Molly Bloom's soliloquy. And &quot;Frisco Beach&quot; too. (I'm NOT an English literature professor, just a physician--please don't hold that against me!)Challenging? yes. Worth it? oh my, yes. Your eyes (and &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;) will be opened forever, never to approach writing the same way. WOW!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"In this book, Joyce continually reminds his readers that this 265,000-word epic utilizing over 30,000 different words is more about his prowess, and sometimes less about your pleasure.As athletic feat is derived from hours of repetitive drills, so too may this novel's conquest only be enjoyed after years of reading ever improving literature. This is not a book for the amateur. Precisely the opposite, this is a book continually referring to other novels, uses language of greater expanse than most others, and is written in styles which make the complexities vastly increased.More puzzle maker than novelist, Joyce's decision to write in paradox, paradigm, pun, parody, contrarian, contradiction and more makes the reading experience as complete as one could ask in the English language. The array of writing styles is mesmerizing: simple novel; over 30 pages of newspaper column; a 180-page play; over 70 pages of questions followed by answers; and one final chapter made up of seemingly 30-40 pages in ONE sentence of rambling autobiographical sexual revelation by Molly Bloom - the protagonist's cavorting wife.The interplay of the styles is extremely brave and enlightening. As they touch upon the same topic, but in different voices and different styles, the reader can further delve into what transpired hundreds of pages before, when the writer intentionally did not reveal it all, and definitely did not reveal it in easily decipherable verse. The interrelation between the texts would allow one to probably read the chapters in different orders and end in the same frame of mind. Nabokov asserted one could do such to his \\"Lolita.\\" And, Nabokov, creator of \\"Pale Fire\\", reminds me so much of Joyce as each toys with and teases the reader with puns, parodies and sometimes outdated jokes.The main characters, Leopold Bloom and Molly Bloom, are known to even those who have not read the novel. Their mutual philandering is the focus of much of the novel. The exploits of each are relatively revealed. But, not in black and white English. The point is taken, and from this came one great pornography trial which culminated with a 1933 United States District Court decision proclaiming, \\". . . the effect of \`Ulysses' on the reader undoubtedly is somewhat emetic, nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac.\\"Such words would not be clearer. \\"An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollification suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.\\" University level English is a prerequisite to understand this alleged smut - or to use Joyce's words: concupiscence delivering induration.And, most of the book, believe it or not, is not about sexual issues. Much touches upon other topics: philosophy, anti-Semitism, socialism . . . . But it is not always condescending; and it is much more than a 700-800-pages of dialectic prose. Because some of those topics are extremely poignant in 2009, those portions of the book apply to today's themes and can be easily (?) read today. Other topics are not for today's discussion. And, that makes reading those portions very difficult for today's reader.In all honesty there were times when I read the novel and asked, \\"what am I missing?\\" I had to stop and reflect, \\"Do others really see something that I cannot?\\" For instance the following passage really lost me: \\"What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Green gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too.\\" Do I need recite more? This caught my interest as much as a \\"White on White\\" painting at the museum of modern art. \\"I just don't get it.\\"And then, later I read the question-answer portion (second to last chapter), and the efficiency and beauty of the writing is both unique and unparalleled. A master of accidence and syntax, the writing is clear and artistic and most importantly - understandable. At the end of that chapter, I could only close the book, lean back and reflect on what I just read, and say one word, \\"Shazam.\\"Like climbing a mountain, the trek may be difficult - but at the journey's end, the party who endured the hardship will be rewarded with a lifetime of memories. Because of some bizarre passages of experimental prose and style, I cannot assert this is my favorite book. Not even the top ten for me. But, it is a great book. And, so well worth the read.Few tips: Read \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man \\" and maybe the \\"Dubliners\\" before this. I would also recommend reading the last two chapters before reading from the beginning. And have a dictionary nearby. You will use it.

To those who have denied recommending it to someone of sixteen or seventeen, I had been upon this earth for a decade and a half when I came upon it, and just reread it one year later. Granted, you need a Latin dictionary and a good book of annotations to thoroughly understand it, but this book has made me realize just what a waste my public rural high school education was--Ulysses is literary heaven and hell and propagator of autodidacticism and eschews all principles of what has ever been said to create this century's magnum opus. I am exactly one-hundred years younger than James Joyce (and Stephen Daedalus), and on the sixteenth of June in 2004 I plan to! take the route of Leopold Bloom to vicariously relive it. One thing to be forewarned about: it is highly addictive. I have developed Ulysses codependency, as will anyone who gets through it. My head aches after reading it, for it is the best kind of masterpiece, the kind that attacks physically and intellectually at once.

After all, I have taken the trouble to read the thing. Also, I have a bachelor's degree, and have taught High School English. I've also read an exegesis of Ulysses, and am currently reading Finnegans Wake, so I do have something in the way of qualifications. At heart, I account my opposing opinion to the fact that I believe that the standards that I use to judge the merits of a novel are different than those employed by the fellows at Random House. Further, I think that my criteria aren't necessarily all that bad.Indeed, I like to believe that my criteria are probably closer to what most people look for in a novel.The things that I look for in a novel include: an exciting plot; memorable, interesting characters; clean, crisp writing.The things that I believe the Random House voters look for in a novel include: intricate word play; obscure literary allusion/allegory; originality in form and syntax, even to the point of obfuscation.Ulysses certainly is a winner in the second category, as all eight hundred pages of it concern one man on one day in his life. Most of those pages are devoted to word play, literary allusions, experiments in literary form, etc. What Ulysses does not spend a lot of time on, however, is developing plot and character--the things I love in a good book. There is almost no clean, crisp writing to be found--Joyce's primary consideration was not to be understood; he wanted to be *clever*.For instance, take the \\"word overture.\\" At the beginning of the \\"Siren section,\\" (Ulysses is modeled after The Odyssey), Joyce mirrors the overture of a musical by running together out-of-context fragments and snatches of words from the chapter to come. He does this without preamble or explanation and reading it is a very confusing experience. But Joyce didn't write it with the intention of being clear--he had something artistic to say, or something experimental to try, or something like that. Please understand that this makes Joyce very, very different from most of the masters who preceeded him, such as Thomas Hardy, Leo Tolstoy, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, etc. They wrote in an effort to communicate themselves very clearly; Joyce wants to be difficult. They wanted to write interesting stories, Joyce wants something altogether different.For myself, I neither like Joyce's style nor his intentions. I honestly cannot figure out the point, other than cleverness for cleverness' sake. Further, I believe that his method, which has become the main literary aesthetic in schools (which is why they all concentrate so much on literary devices such as metaphor and allegory), has been detrimental to education. By turning literature from entertaining stories into puzzle solving, I believe he has turned many children away from reading. I think this helps to account for, say, J.K. Rowling's success. It's not that kids don't like to read, it's that they don't like to read things like Ulysses or similar efforts by Joyce's admirers.Many people reading this will likely disagree with me. They think that Joyce was a \\"genius.\\" That's fine--they're entitled to their opinions. But, I'm entitled to mine as well, and, in my opinion, Ulysses does not say nearly enough of importance to be worth all the trouble it is to decode, and in the end it is simply not a lot of fun. In my opinion, there are tons of other books that have just as much of value (if not more), and *also* have exciting plots, interesting characters and clear writing. Joyce was, perhaps, a genius at puzzle-writing and encoding, but Ulysses is a poor novel."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Clearly a great book, and not just my opinion. Having been born in Dublin, lived there for 25+ years, I knew the city well. The speech sounds and vocabulary are so familiar and recall specially my father, who knew 'Buck Mulligan' very well.Apart from this, the writing and the structure are amazing. If a reader does not really know Ireland, some work of commentary would be a wise accompaniment. Otherwise one can miss a great deal of the implications and innuendos, and, in particular, some of the classic Irish humor."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"\\"Purchased\\" because I've never read it, and felt that at the age of 58, it was time. A freebee on Kindle for the computer, I'm finding it tough going, but plow ahead I shall."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"For many years I wanted to read Joyce's Ulysses not only pure literary reason but for the \\"aura\\" the book has.

Not an easy reading experience but I'm learning..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"What do you open and close scores of times and do nothing else? Answer: James Joyce's Ulysses. For years this, for some, intimidating book was always close at hand...Until a friend suggested simultaneously reading and listening to the book being read by Irish actors. The experience gives nuance and voice to the characters you will never get from simply reading the book. And probably never finish reading it at that."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Good copy, although for me I needed something with largerprint ( to accomodate my \\"over sixty\\" eyeballs.)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It is a mistake to try to read this book along side the Gilbert &quot;skeleton key.&quot; It would be like simultaneously looking at a painting and reading a book on the details of the painting and why we should like the painting.It is not the easiest book to get through. It is not Mike Mulligan and the Steam Shovel or any of the Lord of the Rings books. This is heavy stuff because this book pushes the written word to where it becomes art. The uncreated conscience of someone's race, perhaps.I have read it a few times. I have read certain favorite chapters (like Lestrygonians) at least a dozen. I pick it up from time to time and it is a joy. Aeolus read aloud by someone who knows what they're doing is quite funny.Read the first chapter. Read the Burgess book. Relax. This isn't a book to be consumed like a can of Busch. It is meant to be sipped and appreciated.I can't think of what other book could top the century's greatest works. Some other people prefer Busch. Nothing against Busch, but this book is like none other."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a question that has come up many times. First of all, let me make it clear that I haven't finished Ulysses. I'm in the middle of it, but I feel that I can give a fair review with the amount of it I have read, and I want to review it with it fresh on my mind. Ulysses is not the best novel ever made. Since there is nothing else like it, you can't compare it to anything. It isn't revolutionary, and it doesn't teach the reader any valuable lessons in life, like the Lord of the Rings, Catcher in the Rye, or to Kill a Mockingbird. However, it is insanely enjoyable. The monologues of thought and conversations, as well as descriptions, are beautiful. I can't recommend Ulysses to anyone, however, because I'm sure alot of people hate it. It's difficult to understand (at parts), and contains many cultural references (to Ireland), which confuses the reader even more. Something similar to Cliff's Notes might help. If you have read books challenging on the philosophical level before, I can't imagine a better choice for your next novel than Ulysses. (unless, of course, you haven't read the Lord of the Rings or the Catcher in the Rye :oP)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I will admit that I dont understand every little word of ulysses but the lyricsm of the novel of enough to warrant five stars. The way the novel goes back and forth between joyce reality and the stream of thoughts are simply increable. Increable in both how he conviced it and who effect it is. There are also just prse of pure emtion that anyone can instanitly understand . As for the charaters, all are intresting and distinct. Each word has to be read very carefully to understand what is happening but the end resut is both and intresting and intensen novel.Any one who truly enjoys ulysses should also check out Berlin Alexanderplatz by Alfred Doblin, which is also a large urban story useing the stream of concessness"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Strange as it may seem, many people do read and re-read this novel simply because they love it!It would be impossible to summarize a work such as this in a few lines, but what I love most about this work is its humanity. Joyce is not satirizing Homer: in invoking \\"The Odyssey\\", he is not so much deflating the heroic as elevating the everyday. The mundane day-to-day events which constitute life for the vast majority of us are given a heroic dimension - and, indeed, why should they not? A good, decent man like Bloom is as worthy of praise as was Ulysses.This is one of the great affirmative novels in a century where literature has, by and large, been dominated by darkness."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"One cannot stress the importance of Ulysses. As a book, it almost defies explanation, such is it's achievement, in that it seems to be a story a story of so very little, yet with the importance of Odyssean epic. It's hard to explain. The thing about Ulysses is that it's sheer inventiveness will capture you. Joyce not only places you in the scene via description, the very words he uses become the description themselves, in the shape and texture of them. The book is also a library of allusions, but they can be taken as they are, or decoded within the book itself. There has never been a book quite like it before or since, and it is absolutely essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the twentieth century's malaise. It addresses not only the development of Ireland, but the development of man, and predicts the trends of the next hundred years effectively."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"it is hard to imagine exactly what i think of this except for the fact that maybe precisely once more you forget but forget no forgivance that once around is more for twice but you grow with twice"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I must say, Ulysses is perhaps the most difficult to understand book ever written (aside from Finnegan's wake) yet it is pure genius. I decided to read it as my independent book for a highschool english course. I stumbled through it, with lots of assistance from my teacher and found it to be the most rewarding literary experience. Joyce's characters are so complex and three dimensional that one can hardly believe they are not actual humans. It is the most enlightening experience to feel that you are in someone else's mind. Although this book is very challenging, it is something every person should experience before they die. Make a point to read this book sometime in your life."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having read Ulysses, as well as dissecting it's labrynthe and numerous metaphorical qualities, far too many to go into in a maximum of a thousand words, I can say with all confidence and utmost rightousness that Joyces masterpiece belongs in the league of reverence given to Shakespeare, Dante and Homer. It is without a doubt the single most awesome display of genius in the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Enough! To those unmanned by the maze: you are not stupid by default if you despise every scrabble Joyce scribbled. Many intelligent people, including Virginia Woolf, saw nothing in Ulysses and less in the Wake. To others Ulysses is the liveliest and funniest book ever. To the academics who comb Ulysses--agile horse--for the nits of criticism (thereby insuring Joyce's immoraltality), please leave alone we who would enjoy without inheriting the immense debtorship of things better left undone. To those who would deny that Ulysses is the most important (not necessarily the best) novel ever written, the very fact that so many are compelled to constantly trash it is the ultimate tribute to its place. Finally, let it be known that Joyce swore on Ulysses, on the honor of a gentleman, which admittedly he was not: --There is not one serious word in it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"After finally summoning the courage to attempt a reading of Ulysses, I am profoundly greatful that I did. While the novel is intricately layered and multi-referenced, reading it is really not as challenging as its reputation would have one believe. Moreover, it is a page-turner in the truest sense; never before have I been so absorbed by a piece of literature. Joyce's relentless and masterful descriptions of characters' thoughts, both important inner monologues and equally flippant patter, offer an insight into the human condition which is unparalled in English literature. I am utterly convinced that Ulysses is the most important novel of the twentieth century; it is a true masterpiece of literary art, one that simply makes the reader proud to be human."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am very satisfied and I like it, i think....the shipping cost is a little expensive for me...( because i do not live in USA^^)anyway ..thank you & Mary Christmas!!!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A classic by James Joyce. Enjoy it on your e-reader. Probably adults will be more inclined to enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses can be a tough read, but is very rewarding for those who plough through it. James Joyce writes, in this book in particular, in what I would call the literary equivalent of the impressionist style of painting. By this I mean he sometimes he uses words as if they're broad brush strokes meant to give you an impression of the events taking place as opposed to describing them in a literal sense. Once you get the hang of his writing style the book really takes off, describing, in a surreal way, the world that the main character lives in. There were some portions of the book where I was lost and didn't know what was going on, but I persevered and this ended up being a good read.If you're ready for a challenge, pick this up. If you're just looking for some casual reading you might want to find something more straightforward."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Read it a long time ago, bult now I love having at hand, wherever I go, it takes a lifetime to really appreciate this classic"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Overall, better written than Portrait of an Artist, but nowhere near as entertaining. Basically, consider this as a brilliantly conceived book but with the most wholly unimaginative of plots. It's as intelligent as anything produced since Shakespeare, in other words -- but without all the life-giving drama. What it is is magnificent, in my opinion; but what it contains is insipid. Few people will actually enjoy reading this book, although it does have its moments. But mostly it's an impressive tower that in reality contains nothing much of importance. The most amazing construction possible in the center of which resides a pot of total rot.The narrative mainly follows two protagonists: Stephen Dedalus (from Portrait of the Artist, loosely based on Joyce himself) and \\"Leopold Bloom,\\" presented as Stephen's somewhat more reasonable counterpart, as they meander throughout the course of a single day in Dublin, Ireland, shortly after the first World War, although that fact has almost no bearing on the story.The \\"plot\\" (which is also much beside the point) centers around death: the recent death of Stephen's mother and the not-so-recent death of Bloom's infant son, Rudy. In the end, the two personalities come together in Bloom's home and a kind of a reconciliation is formed -- but again, this is all beside the point.The book appears to be James Joyce's attempt to completely reconstruct what the novelistic form can accomplish, and it reads as such. Terribly thin on plot, but thick on construction, like a house whose rooms are empty. The writing is interesting, particularly to individuals interested in the art of writing -- but the story of the day is quite simply boring as hell.The few good moments include Stephen's theories about what many consider to be Shakespeare's finest play -- Hamlet -- and Bloom's somewhat psycho-sexual encounter with a young girl later on in the evening.Distasteful passages frequently occur, where Joyce appears to take great pains toportray man as a whole as a sick, sadistic, filthy, and secretive animal; again, not really a joy to read through.The real problem here is story, not form. The form is magnificent. It can't be improved upon. But where is the story? What is particularly interesting here? That ultimately Stephen and Bloom forge a kind of friendship? That ultimately provided meaning, but I did not care. Will you?Portrait of the Artist has a developing character changing over time; Ulysses just has a single day, no matter how well written about it is. And so one is drama and the other exercise, and so one worth your time and the other not."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Well, Ernest Hemingway thought that Ulysses was a \\"Goddam wonderful book\\" so who am I to disagree. And I don't. Thie is a very nice edition, well produced and has Odyssean titles to chapters in the Table of Contents, if not on the chapter headings. Yeah, well OK but I do like the definite chapter beginnings. As a reference text to Ulysses this is it - clear line numbers and pagination make for a universal communication device between devotees. I wish that mine was a hardback so I really could have a DEFINITIVE volume."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I read this book twice, and it still stands out in my mind as the most creative use of English in the history of the language. Taking the plot of a classic work is not unique, the way it was executed in this book was. Ulysses doesn't explore any of the great secrets of life. It doesn't seek to take on some great social issue. It is just a great work of art. It is difficult to understand, but with such an ambitious work this is no surprise. Any fan of English literature needs to read this."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I could not finish it. I made several attempts, but I could not. A few times I began in the beginning of it, finished several episodes, and then gave up. Then I began anywhere, once or twice near the end, and read again and again what I just read. One of the most difficult books ever written, Ulysses remains on the list of the books that I must read before I die. It presents a dream that I must dream before I dream no more."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is possibly the greatest fictional work of the 20th century. I have no intention of enlarging on that. This particular edition is of the 1961 text, and contains the judgement of the U.S. obscenity trial.

I've been doing that for more than 50 years."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I purchased this book from DuBray Books as,having attempted to read Ulysses on 2 previous occasions, wanted to get to grips with this masterpiece. Robert Gogan has treated the original with all the respect it deserves and by placing the speech in quotes, thoughts in italics and story in normal print, has made the reading a much easier endeavour than my previous attempts.So I finished the book....Now to read it again!Thank you for making Ulysses an achievable task. I am very content!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a book designed to make some people hate it, and make some people love it. That's what we all want to write - the seeds of a good debate.Does one need to understand something to appreciate it? I first approached this book like any other - steam through the pages, and try to remember what the story was all about. I found a book which didn't make sense, a book that was near incomprehensible, and I felt frustrated that I could not see what the fuss was all about.I could not hate a book I could not understand, however, except for the fact that it seriously dented my ego. A book I couldn't understand? Never! How dare it??But certain fragments stayed in my mind, and I returned to it again, six months after my first read through.Picked through the text, fell through the lyricism, and replaced the book back on the shelf, where it resided more as a symbol, a badge of courage than a book.And I returned. Again and again. Snippets, fragments, open the book at random, extract. Replace. Repeat.Bit by bit it began to fall into place, the characters and the ambition of the book began to emerge. Bit by bit I began to like it more. I had to stop judging it on its reputation, difficulty or intellectualism. There are sections I love, sections I find a chore to read, and sections I discover all the time. Bizarrely, previously tedious chapters began to come to life, and I began to appreciate them. Equally so, I began to dislike some I previously liked, and the whole balance is always changing. So, I can say that although I've read all the words at least thrice, I have not finished reading the book. And at my rate of a few pages a month, I never will. I hope I never will.Most will either focus on the ambition or the difficulty of the book. There is no need to justify, I think, just read it. There is no need to judge it against any criteria other than yourself; you are the only yardstick any book needs (unless you're an academic, in which case something else is needed). There is no need to redefine &quot;good&quot; over and over again, and justify it.Multifaceted, multilayered, and most of all, strangely human, this is a book I'm not done with yet, and I don't intend ever to be so.That's why I'm giving it 5 stars. It never has ceased to uncover something new each time. The only other book that I can look at time and time again and discover something new all the time is a very good atlas! Well, that's why I think I'll give it 5 stars today. Tomorrow, maybe 4. It changes all the time.Joyce won, didn't he? Everyone wants to write something which is near immortal, and by writing a book which would prompt endless debate, he achieved that goal."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Jim gets a little carried away like Pacino chewing carpets. If you like that kind of thing, well, it wears thin with repeated listening. For instance in chapter one he really gets into a Vincent Price reading Poe mode at \\"let me be and let me live\\". and the intrusive intro music, fahggetabowdidinstead get the excellent and very listenable DOnal Donnelly recording, very well done with the corrected text. I listen to it repeatedly and constantly, and meanings emerge very gratifyingly. JOyce is to be heard rather than seen (the ineluctable modality of the visible), and often and forever. As for the the Dubliner stories, again pass by Norton and go for Setlock on Commuter's Library audiobooks. UNfortunately is still only on tape, but the subtley of his tempered readings bear repeated and gratifying listening. Save Norton for the stage. Joyce is forever and ever."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I would simply like to verify what previous reviewers have written about the missing text in the free Kindle edition. All the bits of doggerel and poetry that are in the text seem to be missing. I made it through 16% of the free edition, and just felt like something was not right. Not having a hard copy where I am, I checked out another Kindle edition that costs about $3.00. It in fact feels complete, at least so far. The poetry is in there, which really adds to the text. An example of what is missing: early in the book Stephen Dedalus is talking to his class, and they ask for a riddle. He gives them a riddle, which is missing in the free text. The ANSWER to the riddle is there, but the riddle itself is missing. Now some have argued here that this type of text is not necessarily integral to the book. However, let's be blunt. You are preparing to tackle one of the most challenging books in the English language. Don't you want the whole thing? To do less is to not do justice to your efforts as a reader.Unlike some here, I don't disparage Amazon's efforts to put these free books out there. I have read several on an extended tour outside the country, where my kindle is my constant companion, filled largely with free books. Some have had typos, some have had formatting issues. The common denominator is that they have all been free. BUT, to read Tarzan of the Apes for free, with some typos, is one thing; to tackle Ulysses without the benefit of the full text seems somewhat pointless, particularly when there is a low cost text available on Amazon which appears to be complete. One last note, though. The edition I am mentioning here is the Unabridged and Illustrated. When it first showed up on Amazon it said Unabridged (annotated). There were no annotations, and I have yet to see any illustrations. Still, this is the text you want, not the free version here.Update: Amazon keeps changing the name of this more complete edition. It is now listed as Ulysses (Annotated Edition) for $1.99."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I suppose I shouldn't complain much at 95 cents, but the text has a disconcertingly high error rate. There are no italics, verse is not offset, there are scattered typographical errors, and I've found a few instances where stray numbers appear in the text. Also, I'm only three chapters in.If you are unfamiliar with this book and care about these things, you might want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"For people who know of Ulysses but have never read it, calling it a \\"blast\\" may seem ludicrous. Maybe it is, but I know there are more than a few of us who found this book to be a thrilling adventure without quite knowing why. On the surface, it appears to be the story of 18 uneventful hours in the lives of two Dubliners. We see them snark, teach, defecate, work (half-heartedly), worry, lust, and drink. Exciting right? Yes.Admittedly, this book can be exciting only to a lover of language and literature. The book is subdivided into 18 sections, each roughly an hour. Each section acts as its own writing experiment, some more obvious than others. Contrary to popular belief, the book is not written in stream-of-consciousness. It employs this technique, as it employs many others. True, the last section of the book consists of a 40-page stream-of-consciousness sentence, but another section presents itself as a play where the stage directions help move the reader into the subconscious desires/fears of the characters. I doubt Joyce was ignorant of Freud. And I can't forget to mention that the layers of symbolism and metaphor are absolutely dazzlying.But if Ulysses was nothing more than a writing experiment, it would be dull even to the most erudite of readers. Its true strength lies in its surprising humanity. By poking at the heads of the two protagonists, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, Joyce offers up one of the most complete portraits of the human experience ever put into words. The sylistic experiments are not simply indulgent, but are woven into the fabric of this portrait.Everthing ties together in a phantasmagoric representation of the mundane, complete with a brilliant and frightening climax that seems to fuse every primal symbol of the universe into a single sentence....But I had help with this one. If I hadn't had the professor I had and a whole month to study the book, I may never have had the literary adventure I did. To anyone who wants to tackle this beast, I recomend picking up the EXCELLENT guide, The New Bloomsday Book: A Guide Through Ulysses, by Harry Blamires. I can't say enough about how accessible and thorough this guide is. Anyway, enjoy!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you are at all familiar with Joyces' \\"Ulysses\\" then you will be more than pleased with this presentation. The explanation concerning the difficulty in preparing it for this oral reading is an excellent aid for the \\"listener\\" in further understanding this masterpiece.If you are not familiar with this literary classic, then the clarity, intonation,and dramatic oral presentation will certainly help both those familiar and those not familiar with this work to understand both the literal and implied \\"meanings\\" throughout the entire work."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"These are the things you will probably hear the most about James Joyce's great epic: ULYSSES is hard to read. ULYSSES is a masterpiece of 20th Century literature. ULYSSES requires a deep knowledge of Western Civilization. ULYSSES is the expression of modern man's heroic quest for meaning in a world without heroes or meaning. ULYSSES has to be read along with a dozen other books on how to read ULYSSES.Much of this is true.But what is omitted by reviewers, time after time, is the warm humor, born of Joyce's compassion for people, that surfaces on every page. From the obvious riddles told to and by the protagonist, Leopold Bloom, to the scholarly puns and tropes uttered by the narrators, ULYSSES can be seen as one great comic book. Listen closely to the words of the one-eyed Citizen in the &quot;Cyclops&quot; chapter. Pay attention to what the soldier screams just before he decks Stephen Dedalus. The dark humor surrounding Paddy Dignam's funeral is hysterical.No, this doesn't mean ULYSSES is light reading--don't bring it along on your trip to the beach or the ski lodge. The novel makes many demands on the reader, as do many of the other works we consider milestones of literature. This doesn't mean you have to read it in a dusty library and takes notes on every page. The book is filled with lightness and life. The fact that it ends with the word &quot;Yes&quot; is the most obvious expression of ULYSSES' life-affirming attitude.Certainly there are devestating moments that wrench your heart: Stephen's run-in with his pathetic father and Bloom's vision of the ghost of his son immediately come to mind. But for the most part, ULYSSES is a raunchy, rowdy, ride that makes the difficult parts easier to bear."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I'm 14 years old and I am halfway through the book. I took people's advice and am taking it one chapter at a time, and then discussing it with a friend of mine. I'm not really into books, but I love to push myself. After every chapter I need to research a little, and look words up in the dictionary. I would recommend this book to a dedicated reader who is prepared to work hard and use their head constantly."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses does not throw out the welcome mat. Indeed, the book hardly seems to notice you as you trudge its Dublin streets with Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. James Joyce spent seven years in composition (1914-1921), and a really thorough and thoughtful first reading (consulting numerous references meanwhile) can easily take more than a year. The entire book chronicles just one day (June 16, 1904).In Ulysses, Joyce further refines his stream-of-consciousness narrative technique already mastered in the Portrait. Ulysses also is written in Joyce's signature \\"dramatic style\\" (ie, fiction that has no author's comments to help orient you). These two traits - stream-of-consciousness narrative and dramatic style - make Joyce hard to read at least at first for some people. And the occasional savage wordplay of Ulysses (wholly tame by the standard of Finnegans Wake) can quickly disorient - \\"con-trans-magnificand-jew-bang-tantiality\\". Nevertheless, once you've grasped Joyce's style it's a pleasure that's always fresh.As do the Portrait and Wake, Ulysses redefines the concept of \\"reading\\" a book. Joyce develops hyper-realistic atmospheres in each chapter through stream-of-consciousness narrative and/or drastic changes in style. For example, in the \\"Cyclops\\" chapter, the style crescendoes with biblical intensity up to a hilarious apocalyptic finale, followed at once by the \\"Nausicaa\\" chapter, which is written in the sentimental style of a Victorian girl's magazine. (Imagine the bone-jarring bathos of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony instantly followed by the theme song to the children's program Barney.) This goes on non-stop till the final chapter of Molly Bloom falling asleep - a chapter of dark earthiness composed of seven immense sentences. The novel's overall effect is Plato's \\"intelligible sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere\\". Big claim but Joyce makes it happen.Mark Twain remarked \\"a great book is a book everyone wants *to have* read and no one wants *to* read\\". Initially unwelcoming, Ulysses is \\"a book to be enjoyed over and over again\\", as Joseph Campbell stated. Helpful references are Joseph Campbell's six audiocassette lectures, Wings of Art, and Stuart Gilbert's book, James Joyce's Ulysses.(Perhaps) the twentieth century's greatest work of English fiction."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As an avid reader, I've often thought, &quot;Which book would I want to take with me to a desert island if I could only pick one book.&quot; Others like the Bible, or Dante's Inferno, or the Odyssey have crossed my mind, but in terms of revealing almost infinite possibilities, Ulysses is my pick, hands down. Recently I've reread some of it, but I read the book in a full in graduate school. For first time readers, my advice is, don't be intimidated! Unlike Finnegan's Wake which is not really &quot;readable&quot; by a normal person (okay, if you happen to be able to understand word puns in 27 different languages -- I don't mean to insult anyone...), I find that with some background preparation, Ulysses is very readable. As background, you should reread the Odyssey since each book is based on a corresponding book of the Odyssey. Then, you should get one or two guides to reading Ulysses (Gilbert has an easy to follow one) and try reading one chapter of Ulysses while keeping open the pages in the commentary (may remind some readers of biblical study). In fact, reading this book is the closest I think a non-rabbinical student will come to an exercise like reading Talmud (which comments on the Bible). The experience is infinitely rewarding and will teach you more about reading than any course you could take. The basic plot of the book is not at all hard to follow and there is an abundance of ribald humor. Lest you think Ulysses is &quot;upscale&quot; think again!Let me be clear: this is THE masterwork of the 20th century. It holds up well as one of the greatest of all time. No serious writer has escaped its influence. When you tackle it, you will understand what a great literary achievement is. After reading it for the first time, I become a Joyce fanatic. I'd also recommend both the Ellman biography of Joyce and the even better (in my opinion) biography of his wife Nora. You'll learn lots about Ulysses by reading both of these books as well. Don't be intimidated -- jump in head first. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This edition omits most everything that appears in the print edition centered in the page, i.e. the poetry and songs like \\"The Ballad of Joking Jesus,\\" noted by other reviewers. Utterly unacceptable for a book written with care to every word."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"While free, the Kindle edition is very poor. Poor or non-existent headings combine with frequent appearances of \\"?\\" in place of various letters to make this a frustrating read. Fortunately, I read the Modern Library edition years ago and was able to muddle through. Definitely not recommended for first time readers."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Pretty amazing, but such a bloody ordeal at times that it's hard to justify the time and effort required. How many other great books could you read in the time it takes to get thru Ulysses (assuming a serious effort)? It's a huge chunk of your reading life. Still glad I got thru it and can now enjoy some familiarity with one of the legendary works of western fiction.I do think Joyce went overboard structurally. Some of the episodes struck me as too cryptic and obscure in their form, their structural basis too removed from anyything meaningful for me. Such a large portion of the book is entirely unconventional in form and it's so overwhelming and confusing. Of course, there is some spectacular writing, and a ton of great wit and laughs. And some of the stream of consciousness and interior monologue sections are so remarkable and compelling that you just have to read it.Some advise no reference materials on first reading.

It provided just the necessary final incentive needed to throw all the \\"wait 'til a good time\\" aside and actually just read it, which of course is ultimately how it needs to be read.\\"Ulysses\\" is famous for being \\"impenetrable\\" and \\"unreadable\\", but is far from either. Just like other formal experiments in writing, like Beat era writing, Thomas Pynchon novels, and more recently novels by such authors as David Foster Wallace (may he rest in peace) and Mark Z. Danielewsky, it's not a matter so much of understanding everything and getting the plot as it is of letting the book take you along on its own terms. In the case of \\"Ulysses\\" specifically, each chapter is it's own new formal experiment, and it is of my humble opinion that you are allowed to like some parts better than others. Those who have a problem with it are those who go into the reading with their own expectations or demands informing their analysis. \\"Ulysses\\" is an experience, and one that I think most people should at least try to have to see if it's for them or not (just like skydiving or eating unfamiliar food in a foreign country).And like most media, the things that make it controversial are quite often beyond the point, and anybody who actually read the text finds that out quickly. This novel is about a lot of things, love, language, intertextuality, Shakespeare, Greek myth, Dublin (it does, after all, fall between the proto-neorealistic writing of \\"Dubliners\\" and the intense brooding of \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\"), humour, and life, and there are other repeated themes, allusions, motifs, and forms to give any critical reader much to play with and brood over, but it certainly is not difficult reading and it definitely isn't smut. Go figure.In conclusion, this was a great way to start actually following Amazon's recommendation system, and I'm very proud of myself for finally getting around to doing something I really wanted to do after putting it off needlessly for so long.--PolarisDiB"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many others have written in more words than I care to think about concerning the tremendous effort that it takes to read Ulysses, the worth of this expenditure of your time, and of their almost universal admiration for it. There are a few detractors to be sure and Joyce would be ecstatic that his artfulness has indeed led to his \\"immortality\\" since he is quoted as saying as much.I wish to add what seems to be left out almost universally in the many reviews and recommendations. Everywhere you are told to accompany Ulysses by annotations, discussion/interpretation books but almost nowhere are you told to accompany Ulysses by the words Joyce wrote himself. One of the protagonists, Stephen Dedalus, as well as his father Simon, are not first introduced to us in Ulysses. They are introduced in great detail in \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\". Simon's fall from prosperity to poverty and the impact it has on Stephen/Joyce is crucial background. Understanding that \\"A Portrait ...\\" is autobiographical in nature, reveals much about both Joyce and the characters. You are better prepared to meet Stephen with his superior intellect, education, and his feeling of separation from his countrymen and his behavior if you first read \\"A Portrait ...\\".Many of the characters in Ulysses are introduced to us first in the collection of short stories \\"Dubliners\\". Easily two dozen characters from the Ulysses, some mentioned only in passing, are much better developed in short stories in Dubliners.The milieu of Ulysses, as well as the many characters (all meanings intended) Bloom and Dedalus interact with in their meanderings, are better taken in with these two wonderful works helping to embolden you to tackle Ulysses. Both of them are wonderfully approachable, easily read, and are extremely entertaining, full of the wit and wisdom of Joyce. You are certainly more intimately involved with the evolution of Joyce as he proceeds towards Ulysses with these arrows in your quiver.The structure and basic timeline of the book are dictated by Homer's Odyssey. It is certainly easier to understand why Stephen is Telemachus, Bloom is Odysseus, and Molly is Penelope if you have actually read the Odyssey!The reviewer goes to Symphony Space on Broadway almost every year for Bloomsday (June 16). Find a similar event near you. Ulysses is a monster \\"play\\". It is meant to be enjoyed with others and is much more accessible when experienced aloud. Take the time to understand why people believe this to be the best novel of the 20th century. It will be my favorite forever I am sure.Lastly, I do not recommend Gabler. It is clearly marked by Amazon and other booksellers as by Joyce and Gabler. Be forewarned that there is much scholarship which seriously detracts from Gabler's additions, subtractions, and modifications as not intended by Joyce. That said, I am absolutely certain that Joyce would have enjoyed the controversy tremendously. Read Ulysses in whatever form you can get it but prepare yourself first with the words and experiences Joyce wanted you to have first."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I don't think its helpful to read Ulysses as a novel. If you expect a plot, or a tale or character arcs, or realism, or accessible prose, you will be frustrated. Would you read the Bible with those expectations? Or the Odyssey? And those books along with Hamlet are touchstones for Ulysses but also the caliber of the company Joyce's great book keeps. So how is Ulysses a novel? It has characters that we follow and whose psychology is revealed to us. It uses narrative to move along story elements through the eighteen episodes (though clearly not chapters so more evidence of it not being a novel). There is Bloom's letter to Martha, Boylan's date with Molly and Stephen's homeless fate. Ulysses uses the novel to both explode that form and to honor it as an artistic expression. This aspect of the book; its subverted novelistic qualities is what gives Ulysses its forbidding reputation as unreadable or as pointlessly obscure.The pleasure in reading Ulysses is not novelistic, it is humanistic, it is to ruminate on the existence of Western Civilization. It is to experience connections to our mythic past and our primal present. It is to ponder where our flawed, suffering, imaginative, humanity will take us as we move through the century beyond the Joyce's creation. More than that it's a chance to contemplate our own capacity for contradiction, ambiguity, creativity, perversity, cleverness and fantasy.Joyce isn't just showing off his genius. He is displaying the full range of it so that we can participate in it and take of it what we can, if we can and be not afraid of not making sense. There are deeper truths than simple comprehension and Joyce tantalizes us with glimpses of what they could be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The Vintage Classics is a great version to get because it includes the Supreme Court ruling from Judge Woolsey lifting the ban on \\"Ulysses\\" which allowed it back into the United States. Besides, it also contains the corrected text.It's true that this book revolutionized and refined stream-of-conciousness and it's almost too easy to get caught up on that fact. Really, though, Joyce is doing nothing more in his writing than what people do every day in their lives. When I first started reading this book I re-read over passages but later realized it was better to go on, to follow the certain thought process the character had, just to help realize how complex and subtle some things really were. The book is dense but mimicks how a person thinks and feels within the context of every day life. With that said, the plot is only there as something running in the background so that there can be various thoughts provoked by the action. What makes it a difficult read (this is what the writer of preface to \\"Finnegans Wake\\" said as well) is the readers wanting to piece things together systematically so that it makes sense. Have you ever been having a discussion or been walking down the street when something random seems to remind you of something else completely unrelated? Often times a path may be traced to how or why something reminded you of something else and the same goes with this book. But I think the hardest part is accepting that everything fits together even though we don't understand it.As others have said, the last chapter is worth reading the book alone. The inward struggle Molly has with herself, along with her reconciliation at the end, is absolutely wonderful. Without the initial 740 (!) pages written in his difficult style I don't think I would have gotten as much out of this final chapter. I have to say, I was literally breathing heavily after I read this and felt as though I were feeling exactly as Molly. It's certainly a lot of pages to wade through but worth every minute and gives perfect reason for enjoying a second reading.This is by far the most enjoyable and rewarding book I've ever read. When I put it down I thought to myself, \\"What the hell just happened?!\\" and I wish every book could do the same."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It seems Ulysses touches on every theme experienced in human life. But it doesn't dwell on any of these subjects (or literary style) for long enough to pass judgement.Bloom is criticized for being a jew, but his critics are drunken commoners who are also simultaneously ridiculed and praised. Stephen mourns for his mother but dislikes and avoids his father. Bloom's wife truly loves her husband but she cheats on him.This novel is purposely vague because there are several ways of looking at any one thing and Joyce demonstrates this truth in the various narrators. Almost every character and line of dialogue is considered and reconsidered through the minds of the characters or other unnamed narrators. Joyce is telling us there is no one truth accesible to everyone, all we can do is appreciate the endlessly interactive and timeless quality of an ordinary day and strive to love our enemies."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"OK. It doesn't take a genius to realize that unless you're name is James Joyce you're not going to fully understand this book. There are too many obscure allusions and not even the very well read will get it all. So here's how I tackled the book. Skip the allusions. Yes, skip them. There's no point trying to figure them out because you won't. Just read the narrative, follow the story, trace the themes, and 'try' to appreciate Joyce's style. Then, if you really like the book that much go back and re-read it, only this time use one of the 'guides' to Ulysses that are out there to figure out the allusions.If you approach the book this way it become much easier to read. You'll still get the story, the structure, and the enough of the style."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Mr. Joyce should be commended for writing a book which obviously needs careful interpretation to be understood. Simple things are not always best.The most important questions which the novel raises, for this reader, is: To what extent is literary criticism a rigorous discipline? I'm sure one can place interpretaions on the way Joyce uses language, and what he alludes to: but how many other, competing, interpretations can one put upon it and can one credibly say that one interpretation is (in any sense) better than another?And if the answer to the first question is &quot;a great many&quot; and the answer to the second is &quot;no&quot;, then is not literary criticism as much a fiction as that which it surveys?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Man, this was a long book! No, really I mean really long. I swear this was longer than any book I have ever even looked at. You know, all of us have jobs, kids, TV shows and sports - who the hell has time to read something like this. I swear this would take me forever to read, AND that's if I gave up watching Pro-Wrestling. No kidding it's really that long.They say when the millenium comes we may need to stock up on necessities like toilet paper, well if you run out, I would recommend this book - not cause it's bad or anything (I wouldn't know I didn't read it) - but you would definitely not run out of paper for a real long time. I hear that it's supposed to be a classic or something, I guess that's cause it takes about 50 years to read. Take my word for it - IT'S LONG!!!!!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Every author who has either used the stream of consciousness style or been labeled anything near &quot;postmodern&quot; is probably just following in the footsteps of this novel and very few have ever come close. Joyce shows here that to get the technique down right you need more than technique, even more than a command of the English language, you need a good viewpoint. And Ulysses has many, from Bloom to his wife Molly to Dedalus, every person is detailed through their thoughts and words with enough dimension to make you wonder if this is a novel or a true account. Is it difficult to read? Yup. Most parts you can at least figure out what's going on but some, like the play section toward the middle, at times makes absolutely no sense (and what is up with that, is it a dream or something), but some parts that you think would be impossible, like the massive sequence at the end with Molly not only is nearly compulsively readable but quite beautiful at the same time. It's weird to say this but at times I wanted the book to be longer. Simply put, one of, if not THE greatest novel ever to come out of the English language (though I'm a Pynchon fan first . . . sorry), one of those few novels that everyone should at least attempt, if only to immerse yourself in the complexity of the language."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I first read Ulysses as an Eng.Lit. student in the 1960's, I knew I had to become a creative writer. Ulysses is my vade-mecum. When I am having problems writing a novel, or am dissatisfied with reviews, I turn to Joyce's masterpiece and gain fresh hope and inspiration. This is the book to beat all books - the Book of books. I never work on Bloomsday: I go down to Davy Byrnes public house in the centre of Dublin and order what Leopold had. Ulysses is not a difficult work, but it's very funny and very,very human."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce is the leading literary light of the 20th century. His command of the language is masterful and like the truly great writers, the English language is better for his use of it. His experimentation with stream of consciousness in the opening of the century profoundly shaped the literature that followed. Joyce will be remembered as one of the greatest writers ever to have lived: his writing is true virtuosity in both form and substance. He ranks with Homer, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton and Tolstoy. It may help to read this work with guidance by a teacher or professor. If that's not possible, after reading it in college and more recently, I recommend that you read it chapter for chapter with Homer's Odyssey or with a guidebook like Stuart Gilbert's James Joyce's Ulysses: otherwise, the intricate structure of the work may be lost. Bloom is 20th century man: to understand him is to peer into the inner depths of one's own being. Ulysses is magnificent. I stand in awe of this work. I am humbled by it. A more gifted literary genius may never have walked the planet and may never inhabit it, again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This novel was OK, but I didn't feel like it was speaking to me.

I understood about 30% of it. Was it worth it?Yes:1. The inner-monologue technique really opened up for me on a second reading, and you realise how close to reality Joyce's representation of inner thought is.2. The main character is kind of interesting. A bumbling middle-aged man with lots of curiosity for life and sensitivity to others who is subjected to a range of humiliations throughout the day, from the small (being ignored as he says hello) to the highly disturbing (his wife sleeping with another man in their bed). The interesting part is how Bloom deals with these humiliations. Not angry, and not self-consciously depressed - he just continues on with his day and his thoughts, but you sense that these experiences have changed him in some way.3. There is plenty of interesting commentary on Catholic theology, literary theory, and some of Ireland's history around 1900. If you don't find those subjects interesting, much of this book will bore you.No:1. There is no \\"story\\". No drama, no build up of suspense, no climax, no resolution. The focus is not on a plot, it is directly on the characters, and to a less interesting extent on the language. Entertainment is hard to come by, unless you are satisfied by faintly humourous banter.2. Quite a few of the episodes are very self-indulgent. Joyce was a Modernist, so he was trying to play with forms of representation. One of the episodes is written entirely in the form of a song. Good luck making sense of it.Overall:The book is not worth reading in toto. But parts of it are. If you want to read the best of the novel, just read the Calypso, Hades, Cyclops, Nausicaa and Penelope episodes. That's about 300 pages, and quite worth the effort. You can read summaries of the rest of the novel from one of the many sites on the net.P.S. I leave out the episodes featuring Stephen Dedalus because his character is just a regurgitation of all the philosophers he has read.

The major obscenity, which should never have been permitted by the USA legal system, the marketplace for literature, or the fawning academic community, was the publication of this duplicitous enigma. Many scholars have devoted their careers to explaining its content, but its raison d'tre and current status are still a complete mystery to me.Psychological Profiling: Joyce/BloomFrom \\"stately, plump\\" Buck Mulligan's entrance on the first page to Molly Bloom's memories of her first lover 20+ hours and 600+ pages later, the unifying constancy is: This is not a \\"reader-friendly\\" work. For example, check out Wikipedia's content descriptors for major sections:* (Episode 3, Proteus) \\"Stephen reminisces and ponders ... This chapter is characterized by a stream of consciousness narrative style that changes focus wildly. Stephen's education is reflected in the many obscure references and foreign phrases employed in this episode.\\" [NB: When Stephen thinks or talks, it is often in Latin, French, or Italian - with no translation for the reader.]* (Episode 7, Aeolus) \\"This episode ... is characterized by an abundance of rhetorical figures and devices.\\"* (Episode 12, Cycolops) \\"This chapter is marked by extended tangents made outside the voice of the unnamed narrator: hyperboles of legal jargon, Biblical passages, Irish mythology, etc.\\"* (Episode 14, Oxen of the Sun) \\"This chapter is remarkable for Joyce's wordplay, which seems to recapitulate the entire history of the English language. After a short incantation, the episode starts with latinate prose, Anglo-Saxon alliteration, and moves on through parodies of, among others, Malory, the King James Bible, Bunyan, Defoe, Sterne, Walpole, Gibbon, Dickens, and Carlyle, before concluding in a haze of nearly incomprehensible slang.\\"* (Episode 15, Circe) \\"The plot is frequently interrupted by \`hallucinations' experienced by Stephen and Bloom - fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters.\\"* (Episode 16, Eumaeus) \\"The rambling and labored style of the narrative in this episode reflects the nervous exhaustion and confusion of the two protagonists.)* (Episode 17, Ithaca) \\"The style is that of a scientific inquiry ... The deep descriptions range from questions of astronomy to the trajectory of urination.\\"* Episode 18, Penelope) \\"The final episode ... also uses the stream of consciousness technique ... consists of Molly Bloom's Soliloquy: ... she recalls ... wishes ... imagines ... wonders ... senses ... fantasizes ... remembers ...\\"So what's the take-away from this painful experience? For me it was the state of James Joyce's mental health as he wrote Ulysses.ConsubstantialityHere I treat James Joyce and Leopold (Poly) Bloom as one. I will let Stephen Dedalus, a central character, make the argument for me. Early on Stephen makes the argument that Christ and God the Father are one:* \\"... the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father ... Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.\\" (p. 22)* \\"... the son consubstantial with the father. ... He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and Others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and the dead when all the quick shall be dead already.\\" (pp. 179-180)Having made the spiritual argument, Stephen then extrapolates to the relationship between Shakespeare (\\"After God Shakespeare has created most.\\" p. 193) and Hamlet contending that (a) Shakespeare begot Hamlet, and (b) Shakespeare and Hamlet are one.So here I accept the Joyce/Dedalus argument that the Father and Son are one and that Shakespeare and Hamlet are one and conclude that he is telling us that he and Bloom are one.Psychological Profile: Bloom/JoyceGiven the manner in which Ulysses is written, it is difficult to identify passages representing bona fide hallucinations. I do not accept the \\"fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters\\" (Wikipedia, Episode 15) as hallucinations primarily due to their transient nature. Bloom easily discards his hallucinatory behavior when Stephen is in need of protection, guidance, and mentoring. True hallucinations are not easily discarded when reality dictates the need for lucidity. Rather than hallucinations, Bloom's expressed fears and passions appear to be dream content. I suspect James Joyce kept a dream diary and used the material from it many places in Ulysses. I also suspect many of his dreams were in the form of nightmares, perhaps induced by excessive use of absinthe, a highly alcoholic beverage quite popular at the time.Let's use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) to label Bloom's behavior:* Primary Diagnosis: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder characterized by recurrent pornographic sexual images, repeated doubts, the need to have things in a particular order, excessive counting, and word repetition.The entire book is a testimony to Bloom's OCD but two favorite examples come to mind here:* Bloom is asked by an unseen inquisitor what he admires about water. His extensive listing starts with its \\"universality\\" and ends with its \\"stagnant pools in the waning moon\\". (p. 528)* Later, he is asked to describe the content of two drawers which he goes through each evening seeking relaxation before attempting to go to sleep. The detailed listing (pp. 566-568) is apparently revisited each night before going to bed.He even presents a detailed list of men he believes have been his wife's lovers over the years and does so in the order in which she has been involved with them. (p. 575)And by his own declarations of consubstantiality, we have reason to think of Bloom and Joyce as one.In summary, if OCD is your thing, you will enjoy reading Ulysses over and over again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a book that I have thought about almost all my life.

I have long questioned Joyce's status as a great writer. Not that he failed to display a knack for the pen - indeed, his _Dubliners_ contains work of substantial depth and real stylistic artistry (particularly &quot;The Dead&quot;). My qualm is with his later works, especially the much-praised _Ulysses_. Here Joyce lapsed into experimentation for the sake of experimentation. The final result was a muddled mess, the underlying meaning of which can only be _constructed_ by general readers of exceptional creativity or professional critics with advanced degrees and an excess of spare time.And even if we give Joyce the benefit of the doubt, even if we believe that he was (like Thomas Wolfe, who had, after all, a very patient editor) writing to capture each and every moment of our lives, we must admit the difficulty of the task. Literature must follow some logical construct; it must sort our daily chaos with art. If we follow Joyce's example by stuffing a day's garbled thoughts into a book, we have created only a mirror - something that apes our futility. True literature, on the other hand, attacks our existence piecemeal. And though such literature may never reveal the meaning of each breath or cry &quot;fiat lux&quot; before God or the Void or whatever lies at the root of the universe, it is a symbol of our unquenchable willingness to kick against the pricks, to grasp at unknowable truth. The artist, in carefully crafting - in reaching for that elusive order and higher truth - breathes new and continual life into those words of William Faulkner:&quot;[Man] is immortal not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things. It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past.

If you took this book into a publisher nowadays, he or she would probably throw it at you and then laugh in your face. I had to have been published on a dare, then banned as a publicity stunt. If you want to read it, I would suggest going to the library. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is a book that must be held, not battery powered. I doubt James Joyce would like his books as ebooks. Any more than Shakespeare, Ovid, Milton, Boethius, Sartre, Shelley, Kazantzakis or Tobias would. It's not an appropriate fit. These authors transcended the instantaneous, the inelegance of electricity. They wrote by candle-light, just as Nureyev danced by candlelight."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was tempted to write this review after reading the other reviews. It seems that most readers had to struggle through it or use Cliff Notes. In short, it seems many succumbed to the peer pressure that it was a \\"great\\" book and that they just \\"had\\" to read it. It puts me in mind of someone going to an art gallery full of atrocious modern art and faking that they liked it to show how sophisticated they are. The truth is this book stinks.For one thing it is vulgar, which, I hate to disappoint anyone, requires no talent at all. This is a talent any six year-old boy possesses. Is the wordplay clever? Yes, too clever. James Joyce must have been incredibly pleased with himself.(...)himself."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"First off, let me say that I did not complete this book. One of my English teachers once told me that if a book did not capture your imagination within the first 50 pages, it would be wise to put the book down. Well, I gave this book 225 pages, and I thought that it was once of the most boring and esoteric books I have ever come across. I first read -A Portriat of the Artist as a Young Man-, which I thought was quite good. I came in with high hopes for -Ulysses-, but was very let down. I found myself not only getting lost with the pages and pages of thoughts Joyce presents us with, but also with some of the dialogue, when all the characters rample on about someone speaking Irish. I have no doubt that Joyce was a genious, his books are filled with game show like trivia. However, I think for a book to be considered a \\"Classic,\\" or, \\"one that should be read by everyone,\\" then that book should not have to be refered to as a \\"Project,\\" nor should it take people a year to read, as some of the other on-line reviewers have said it took them. So to summarize, if you want to take a hefty load of your reading schedule just so you can say you've read -Ulysses- be my guest, your a better reader than I am, but for the time being, give me Steinbeck or Faulkner anyday."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Despite its reputation, this book seems to be totally pretensious, written to impress, rather than to communicate.

I have read some great books and I have read some bad books. The worst of these books being Ulysses. Now, I know that the Modern Library has chosen it as the #1 book of the 20th century, but as a common man and not a smarter-than-thou literature expert, I recommend that unless you just want to say you read it, forget it. Read an entertaining author. No wonder Americans don't read more often, the trash that people &quot;in the know&quot; tell them is a classic is as boring as driving across Kansas at 10 mph!This book was deemed to obscene for the US when it was first written. The obscenity seems mild today but maybe they were just placating Joyce's ego by telling him it was too obscene instead of allowing unknowing Americans to waste many hours that they can never have back reading his rambling and self-glorifying pile of dung he considered his crowning achievement.Pass on this one! Read Fitzgerald or Hemingway. Enjoy reading. Life is too short to waste your time on this crap!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It only decries Joyce's Ulysses to know it is so overated as it is. The book is not so good, it is boring, it is a colection of words and a continuous experimentation of styles that, unhappily, do not mean anything to the meaning of the story; that is, the book's language is snobbish and useless. Those who say that &quot;love&quot; such a writing are to be thought about as non-readers or as victims of a literary abnormality."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If I never read any of his other books, this one alone would make Joyce my favorite author. It isn't a book for everyone, but if you're patient with it, it's a very rewarding read. This book is one of a handful that gets consistently better with each reading. The first go is the hardest, but I encourage you to finish it. Joyce said that he wanted to paint a portrait of Dublin so complete that if it were to disappear, it could be recreated from what was described in his book. I don't know how true that statement is, but I have never read a more complete description of human nature as that presented in this book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a great edition for your first time through Ulysses. The notes and introduction are immensely helpful. Schemata, Odyssey parallels, a decent amount (for a novel edition) of allusions are all glossed.Buy from overseas. Really worth it. If you've already read Ulysses, this is a good edition for reference, but you may want a better quality paperback, so look at the Gabler for that. No notes there so be warned!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses symbolizes the height of modernist writing, and in many ways, was the first to address post-modern issues- in it's fragmentation and pastiche of form.Each chapter, which accounts for a particular time of day in chronological order (perhaps the only linear aspect of the book), appropriates a certain 'style', which addresses the 'consciousness' that Leopold Bloom, our hero, is undergoing.For example, when Bloom is worried about his job at the newspaper, the chapter breaks into journalistic form, adapting headlines and soundbites, however comical and absurd.Another example, when Bloom enters a brothel, and is pensive about being recognized, the chapter becomes a play, where all the characters are faceless and have taken on roles.There is a tremendously humane and sad scene at the pub, where all of Bloom's friends talk and banter over him, not hearing the profound things he has to say. Bloom is a poet that doesn't know it, to borrow from Dylan's rhyme. He is a modest man, navigating his way through his banal day. He goes to a burial and daydreams the corpse rolling down the hill. A bar of soap melts in his pocket. He goes to the beach and looks at a girl. In the bath-tub, he notices his penis, floating like a water-lily. And that is why this book is so kind and rare: His day becomes beautiful through his eyes. Each banality and prosaic task becomes macro-cosmic and mythical in the way that it is written. Bloom's Odessey is to return home.With each transition, Joyce continues to astonish the reader with how agile his writing is. The most genius part of the book is the penultimate chapter, in which Bloom and Stephan (the narrator in \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" and Joyce's alter-ego), enter the former's home, both drunk and lonely. Here, the chapter becomes Q & A form, a series of questions that are answered. Perhaps Bloom, eager to sustain Stephan's company, so late in the night, adopts the role as an interviewer, the way we ask meaningless questions to allude the awkward silence.In the end, Bloom crawls into bed, and his stream of consciousness blends into that of his wife's, Molly. Here, readers enter her mind, and we discover what has been bothering poor and gentle and lovely Bloom all day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Not nearly as difficult as it is proclaimed to be, this book seems to have taken Nietzsche's advice to heart: A great writerwrites at such an elevated level that most people cannot understand him. This is absolutely true of Ulysses, as the convoluted meditations of the characters and abrupt jumps from reveries and memories to actual events do a marvellous job to perplex the reader.Content: Countless riddles, allusions, metaphors, even intended misspells complicate the reader's life but hardly make this philosphical novel unreadable. Yes, philosphical novel, something you can meditate on after reading. Also, it seems that James Joyce has decided to intertwine modernism, Homer, Irish history, human ethics, and his view on religion and life alltogether, in parts creating a pulp of dense bombast. The modernist techniques are somewhat amusing at first, but after advancing deeply into the book they seem nothing more than ostentatious display by Joyce of his masterful writing ability. There are some faint references to sex and bodily functions, but so subtle as to leave me in mystery of the reason for its ban. Disseminated over a variety of subject, Ulysses does not fail to include relgion and allocate to it a share of the onus. However absurd the concept of religion is, it does serve a purpose in a few of the chapters. Also, Ulysses is famous for its blatant Homeric parallel: each chapter of Ulysses modeled on a Homeric adventure or character. It is truly amazing how the two are combined. To understand the content of this literary behemoth with more insight, one might consult either Pinkmonkey.com (free) or Cliffnotes, both equally helpful.Characters: The characters could have used a lot more dimensionality. Frugal on polishing their facets, James Joyce seems to be using them as puppets to mouth his philosophy and not much more. Usually a protagonist attracts empathy of the reader, but Joyce did a poor job with his characters as they seem very distant in their meditative drivel. In other words, there wasn't a single way I could relate to them. Even Joyce's flaccid attempt at adding flaws to their character by assigning obscenities, made them no more human or real. Perhaps simplifying the embellished bombast would have helped in understanding them.Overall: Despite its many flaws (e.g. length, verbosity, etc...) there is no other book that deserves your attention as much as this particular one. If you will just find perseverance to bear through Joyce's daunting baffling narration, you will be delected to have found it (perseverance) to finished such a marvellous literary accomplishment. Having said that, I favor \\"The Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man\\" by Joyce over Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"... The critics rave about Ulysses. Many readers who've slogged all the way through proclaim it to be the greatest book of the 20th Century. Put me in the camp of those who thinks it's a pile of gibberish.It's the only book I've ever read that still had me scratching my head after three chapters. Is it a novel? A series of unrelated short stories? A poem? Apparently, only intellectuals can tell.I was taught that writing is the process of communicating with readers. This book fails miserably at that. I honestly can't summarize the plot. I didn't understand it. Maybe I'm stupid, but I think the fact that Joyce repeatedly breaks into long stretches of French and Latin and his own made-up words--none of which I understand--has something to do with it.I give the book two stars because of Joyce's obvious mastery of vocabulary, and because maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm too ignorant to comprehend the genius. But I doubt it. To me, reading enjoyment shouldn't be this hard. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The book is simply wonderful, and there is nothing I can say that is more eloquent or unusual than the other many reviews before me.The only thing I would like to mention, is my thoughts on the end. That one, long, run-on sentence. To my mind at least, it felt like he understood perfectly the way a woman can think.Of course I'm generalizing, but I read a review written by a man who'd read the first 50 pages, then skipped to the end to find that flow of thought, and thought it was perfectly weird.I felt sorry when I read that, because the way the thoughts swirl in and out and round about and seem to build with 'fervorency'(is that a word? did I spell it right?), is exactly the way my thoughts wander on occasion, and I marvelled at the way Joyce seemed to be privy to that sort of, what I consider to be, 'female' thought.It was beautiful. I enjoyed it more than I can say. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A couple things: First off, everyone's heard of Ulysses, and everyone has their own notions of what they expect from a book, what they expect from Ulysses in particular, and how they feel about experimental literature in general (though by today's standards Ulysses appears vastly less experimental than, say, Finnegan's Wake). So basically, if you don't think you'll like Ulysses, you probably won't. And no, it's not a casual read. If you're willing to do some homework, though, which in my case included some Homer, Shakespeare, Freud, and Irish history (though I could go on), it just might be worth your time (lots of time) to slog through all 900+ pages of the thing. But that's just my two cents.The real reason I'm writing this review is to steer people away from the 'reader's edition' of Ulysses--that's the reason for the two stars. This is not the novel as Joyce intended--it is an adaptation by Danis Rose, and reflects what he (Rose) thought was 'accurate.' Though the changes he makes are minor--and, in all fairness, may correct oversights made by Joyce--I am offended by the idea that an editor has the ability to take an important and influential work and make changes as he sees fit. The fact that this edition was ever put to print debases the role of the artist (any artist), and reflects the increasing trend toward commercialization and dumbing-down of art in favor of turning a profit.So--is Ulysses the greatest artistic achievement in any medium, ever? I don't know, and whether I think so is irrelevant anyway. But if you want to find out for yourself, please, PLEASE, at least read Joyce's words, not Rose's."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a wonderfully crafted book -- the physical object, that is, and not just the text. (Because if you're willing to pay this much for a copy of &quot;Ulysses&quot; you obviously take that for granted.) The volume is larger in size than typical hardcover books today, meaning that the type is a decent readable size and the margins are generous (for the note jotting fiends among us). Great care has clearly been taken in the choice of paper and the sewn binding, which allows the book to lay flat during reading and insures years of re-reading. Although there is no dustjacket the cover is made of very durable material; various cover protectors can be found to stand in or, for the really paranoid, a slipcase can be made or found. It should be added that the text is presented as originally published, so there are no notes or glosses to help the first-time or casual reader; neither are the episodes keyed to any of the line numberings found in other editions. However, those wishing to refer to notes would be best off buying one of the helpful readers' companions by Gifford or Blamires anyway. In relation to other available editions, this one occupies a vast middle ground between the throwaway mass-market paperbacks on the one hand and the out-of-reach collectors' editions on the other. The book's durability and elegant though understated presentation should prove most attractive to those readers who intend to read the text again and again, whether for pleasure or for study. In short, this volume is a keeper."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How can this book be compared to others when it is so different? It has very little exciting plot. From what I have read of Joyce he has little imagination for pulling the reader to the edge of his or her seat, and keeping the reader up for hours past his or her bed time waiting to see what happens next. He does, however, have great knowledge of english language among other things, and uses it well. I LOVED reading this book, but not because of how much better it is than all other books (because it isn't), but because I couldnt wait to see what all of the fuss was about! You should definately get it for the same reason. By the way, Random House, the company that rated it number one has sole publishing rights to Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There are a few things you need to understand Joyce. A willingness to set aside race hatred is one. The ability to follow a poet even though he uses a number of different writing styles and narrative techniques. The capacity to explore religious ideas which may not rigidly conform to your own fundamentalist views. And most of all a heart which can feel compassion for all humanity, not just your own myopic tribe, sect, or church. If you have just one of these qualities you will find an unforgettable, life-altering adventure in between the covers of this book. If there is any book out there that has the power to restore one's love for the human race it is Ulyssess."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Book was delivered on the scheduled.

While this text has many errors, many noted by the author himself, it is still one of the best representations we have of Joyce's intentions.

Then read the book about it by Stuart Gilbert, and reread it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It has been said that the title should arrest the casual onlooker as if it was read: The Bible. Ulysses is James Joyce's Bible. What does one gain from reading this novel? Joyce has such a command of our language that it becomes putty in the hands of an artist. Each chapter has its own technique. Joyce wears a different mask for each section so that the reader sees the history of the English language unfold before him. Joyce remains the super-artist however, peering down from his overworld of the ulimate artist. Reading Ulysses will make all modern fiction seem to be the ineluctable flotsam in the path of the Joycean mothership. So who is Ulysses the character? What is Ulysses? Odysseus? Odysseus is the beloved Greek figure who appears in the form of Leopold Bloom. Ulysses was the despised, bloodthirsty, Roman rabblerowser who ended up in one of Dante's jivin' circles. Bloom is not Ulysses. Ulysses is something else. Everything else. A three in one of Bloom, Stephen, Molly; Father, son, mother(holy ghost); Scientist, artist, lover; the meeting place of lust and compassion: Word known to man: Love.

It is the Bible of Modernism. or something like that."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"An independent discovery of self and matter rarely comes in such obtuse and atmospheric prose as Ulysses does. The most spinalcrushingly dense text this side of the Marquis De Sade and Rabelais, Joyce evolves the subconscious greatness of Bloom by using thousands of references from 20th Century Industrial Europe and weaving them into million mile high levels of plot and thought. Joyce carries subtlety and grace with each poetic sentence and each step of character development; you don't just read, you experience, you live within this world. Immerse yourself in the essence that is Ulysses, whether your teacher assigns it to you or not"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is the story of one day in the life of Leopold Bloom, an Irish jew. The novel follows his travels and ends with his meeting of Stephen Dedaulus. By reading the novel, the reader is able to see Bloom's character fleshed out before his eyes, as well as to tap into the personalities of the numerous other characters on the busy Dublin street. Symbolically, the novel parallels Homer's Odyssey, depicting the great &quot;journey&quot; that Bloom travels in one day.Although Ulysses is difficult to read, it is not impossible to complete. However, before even attempting to read this novel, it is best to have previously read several other pieces of literature to aid in the comprehension of the story. You should first already be familiar with Joyce's writings; read both Dubliners to get a feel of Joyce's style, and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young to fully understand the maturation of Stephan Dedaulus' character. Next, read the Odyssey, preferrable a verse translation. I'd recommend Robert Fagles version. Finally, it is also helpful to have read Hamlet, be familiar with both the Old and New Testament of The Bible, and know a little about early 19th century Irish history.Even if you are a literary scholar, you will probably still find some parts--probably even whole chapters--confusing or even incomprehensible. One unique characteristic of Ulysses is its style. Contrary to popular belief, the book is not completely written in the stream of consciousness style. Instead, each of the novel's chapters has a characteristic style, ranging from straigt narration to an almost 200 page long play. This can be a bit aggravating for the reader. Another confusion of the chapters is there exact parrallel to the Odyssey. Each chapter does have a parrallel chapter in the Odyssey but while some similiarities can easily be distinguished in the plot, other parrallels are only apparent in symbolism and style. Because of these difficulties it is best to read the CliffsNotes on this book while reading the novel.Overall, I can tell you that Ulysses is quite interesting in some parts and very very dull in others. If you are a fan of literature, I would recomend reading it sometime. Truefully, Ulysses was good but not as great as it thought it would be. My favorite parts of the book were simply the ones that helped to reveal Bloom's character. I got annoyed by the fact that too many other characters appeared and were characterized but actually had very little to do with the story's plot. The plot itself is a bit weak and Joyce is a bit too over-indulgent and is purposefully confusing in describing some of the action of the story (its 783 pages!). Also, in order to understand all of the novel's symbols you would have to read several literary references and this would take forever. I also think that Joyce sort of went a bit too far with literary styles. Some were good but others not so much. I liked the narrative and stream of consciousness chapters, but personally thought that the play chapter failed to convey its message and was meandering. And why wasn't there a chapter in epic format (as was the Odyssey) or other form of poem (Stephen was supposed to be a poet). Finally, I do not believe that Ulysses was universal enough to be considered a masterpiece. One of the great aspects of world literature is that it is supposed to let reader from other countries understand what it is like to live in the country in which the novel takes place. Joyce did try to achieve this goal, but he presented many viewpoints about Irish politics and facts about political figures (Parnell) with even trying to allow the non-Irish reader to understand these people or concepts.Dispite its problems, I would recommend reading Ulysses but if there is any other book you would like to read, read it first because Ulysess does seem to drag on forever. Don't expect to understand all of Ulysses or be excited about unraveling its symbolism. In order to understand most of the symbolism you have to read the CliffsNotes and this kind of ruins the fun of self discovery. The book is not as contreversial as I thought it would be--really the only parts that would warrant censorship are contained in the last chapter (Molly's monologue) but these are rather provactive. Overall, the plot of Ulysses does not neccesarily always make the best story nor could I actually call it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but the book is interesting if you are a fan of Joyce and have the time to spend on it. It took me just short of three weeks to finish it. If you are just reading the book for fun (not for a class) I'd recommend reading it over summer or a holiday because it is definately not a light or short read by any means."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"For someone to revolutionize an artform is unique. But James Joyce did it with every book that he wrote. It is too bad he only wrote four but i guess between Ulysses and Finaganns Wake, a reader could spend his life decifereing them. On to Ulysses: this book is incredible. It is like a puzzle that is too large and complex to ever be finished, but at the odd moment that two pieces fit together, it is a revelation that sparks the mind and soul. Probibly the greatest peice of art that i have ever absorbed but to readers beware; it is more an art than a typical novel. Poetry, prose and passage all in one with spiritual interpretation to be discovered and shakspeare to be dissected. if you love the english language than read this book with an open mind and a hopeful heart.

Reading it takes more effort than most novels require, but every ounce of effort (snd sweat) is well worth it. If you ar e avoiding this book because of its difficulty, don't. It's attainable. If you are having problems I highly recommend buying a copy of the audio version and reading along with it. This is probably the only book for which I would recommend the audio edition, Ulysses was meant to be read aloud. Other usefull books to have handy are Gilbert's book and Gifford's book. Gilbert is the standard, basic interpretation of Ulysses, and Gifford's Annotated lets you in on all of the obscure references in the novel. Gifford elucidates references to other literature and the more obscure references to Irish &quot;current events&quot; and such. Finally, I would stay away from the Gabler edition of Ulysses. The general consensus is that for every 4 errors Gabler fixed, he introduced 6 more. The 1961 edition (published by Vintage) is more standard."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having tried and read many sections of this one, but never from beginning to end, plus having read innumerable reviews, and browsed thru all kinds of analyses of it, I can only conclude that it is generally way over-rated..Think of all the near-unknown great books by authors who are hardly recognized, who have written mythological, historical \\"Days in the Life\\" Novels..OK, so Molly gets excited at the end, and we witness a shaving scene in the beginning, with everything in between. Even as a fairly knowledgable literacy person, it is about impossible to read this without a reference guide. All in all simply very over-rated..However, PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST is a beautifully done book, truly worthy of its lofty reputation, so my suggestion is to read PORTRAIT , plus the stories first, and if frustrated by this one, simply move to something else!

Yet, I firmly believe that Ulysses should be accompanied by several texts explaining page by page what you just read. It was so disjointed and difficult to comprehend that I was beginning to question my sanity in even attempting to sift through it and find a plot. I would not recommend it to anyone and I feel sorry for English majors who are forced to read it.

That being said, the magnum opus of scholarly works this book has (and will continue to have) added is such that much of it constitutes a forever living and growing part of Ulysses itself. As such, some consistency in pagination is crucial as there is a long established convention of referring to specific lines, words etc ... that is employed by any and every Joyce scholar on the planet. Past reprints and revisions of Ulysses have either maintained the original pagination or indicated in marginalia a mapping to the original. Why Penguin would completely obliterate this (and by extension make the cannon of Joyce scholarship almost unusable) is beyond me. If you want to read Ulysses and have no opportunity to benefit from the insight of others (including those that Joyce worked with on this) then get this book and try to enjoy it in a bubble. Otherwise, it would behoove you to get a printing that respects this book and the reader for what they are."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Perhaps the British were right to repress the Irish: give them a little freedom, and this is what they do. Every redblooded fellow, of course, has appreciated an analogous phenomenon in Catholic coeds, but here, we had hoped, the subject might be literature, and more than rampant effusiveness might be expected.Don't get me wrong; I don't despise length or density. My favorite book as a kid was _Moby Dick_. I have read _Anatomy of Melancholy_ cover to cover (once: phew). My favorite novel now is _Magic Mountain_. And every several years I reread Boswell. Neither do I mind a little murk: my favorite McCarthy is _Sutree_ in preference to the one about the pretty ponies. I don't mind a degree of exigetical tussle in my reading either. I have been a English teacher for thirty years, so I have ruined more literature by careful analysis than any other cowpoke in the saloon, I reckon.Some here - preening with professorial preciosity, I think - have opined that those who do not appreciate this work, crippled by an unsophisticated need for plot, cling and suckle, eyes closed, to silly old books telling tales suited to their larval sensibilities. Well, plot or not, dull is dull, I say. Plot may be many things - a string for beads, and armature for papier-mache, a rational basis for irrational digression - or it may be absent; but the notion that playing around with plot is so terribly nouveau, and therefore so incumbent on those who would be literarily hip, is preposterous. Think of Sterne, Rabelais, Melville.Some fool even asserted that it is brilliant for a book to be tedious, for life is so, and thus a book as militantly tedious as this is true to life in a way that an interesting book could never be. What desperate rationalization is this?The first time - age 19 - that I tried to read this book, I failed to finish it. I made the attempt because it is a book \\"one\\" reads. I was \\"one\\" back then, had not yet become myself. In the end, such motivation did not sustain me. I slipped beneath the waves, drowning in a welter of Anglo-Saxon phonemes.The second time, I was a teacher, and was thinking of teaching it. I had just finished reading Will and Ariel Durant's _Story of Civilization_, so my reading muscles were unusually fit, and so I prevailed.This book is clever, sure, but that is just not enough. I love games with words, but such delightful shenanigans work best in shorter forms - in poems - or as divertissements or instruments of nuance in longer works, in the service of some literary enterprise worthy unto itself, such as telling a story. That's my view, and I'm sticking to it, since there is so very much else to read, and life is so very short."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I adore James Joyce, but I must report that in this free Kindle version, the chants / songs / quotations are missing! For example - in the beginning, every time Buck Mulligan starts to chant, the chant is missing! Somehow the people who created this free version did not put them in! So, there are odd gaps in the text. Stick to another version of the classic that is Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I really wasn't expecting this edition to be as impressive as it is. I own several editions of ULYSSES includingother first edition facsimile editions but this one is by far the most comfortable and readable. While it isn't as visually impressive as the Easton Press edition of the 1922 Paris text, which retained the design and Mattise illustrations of the 1935 Limited Editions Club version, it is rather more practical. The binding is incredible. This book will open flat and stay open on any page, making it an absolute pleasure to read effortlessly. The page size is the same as the first edition and retains the wonderful generous margin size. This edition is remarkable for the understated elegance of its appearance. The cover is bound in beautiful blue buckram that reproduces the look of the original paper wraps of the Shakespeare and Company edition. It contains the original title page/colophon as well as the charming message from Sylvia Beech. Signiture numbers are also present. All of the wonderful and odd typos (including a few upside down letters, a result of the original typesetting process) are present and the feeling is like going back in time and experiencing the greatest novel ever written just as those first readers in 1922 did. When I first took the book out of the box my initial reaction was that it was overpriced but once I started reading it, the magnificent, exceptional quality of the book became quickly apparent. I started reading and finished it in three days, the quickest I've ever gotten through ULYSSES. Reading this edition is such a pleasure that I really didn't want to put it down. The price of the book may seem a little high but I assure you, if you love ULYSSES then you are certain to treasure this spectacular edition. I will never need to buy another reading copy of ULYSSES again. The book is so strong and sturdy that it shows virtually NO sign of wear after the first reading. The binding is strong and tight and superior to just about anything else I have seen in this price range. I am so grateful to Orchisis Press for producing this incredible edition. I love it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you loved what you heard from Norton and Riordan but want to know more about the literary bones and puzzles in Joyce's Ulysses, I highly recommend the course \\"Joyce's Ulysses\\" taught by James A.W. Heffernan of Dartmouth. It is only available from The Teaching Company and it goes on sale once a year. Listen to the book several times before you listen to Professor Heffernan. The Heffernan lectures will greatly increase your understanding of the work."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Unfortunate that the reviewers listed seem to be reviewing the book rather than this particular edition. The reviews apply to Ulysses rather than the 1922 edition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce's Ulysses closely parallels the events of Homer's The Odyssey, but this journey is far more surreal than Homer could have ever dreamt. The story is set in one day, and mostly follows the principal character Leopold Bloom going through the day.Ulysses does not follow typical conventions of literature, and therein lies its beauty and its freedom. The text is littered with puns and seemingly nonsensical and comical language, one of the highlights being the section written as a play in which all manner of chaos takes place. This text may at first appear to be senseless but perseverence will reward those who would spend time examining its language, which is often made up of multiple words, each constituent part of which relates to a wider topic. This is, in a sense, a scholalry text, as it is so much more than a story, and you need to have the willingness to at least attempt to understand the broader referential context, much of which I am also working on. If that seems like too much hard work, then I doubt Ulysses would provide much enjoyment to you, although that's not to say it can't be read without additional knowledge. It does help to know some of the things going on in Joyce's mind and the history/culture of his beloved Ireland.The version being reviewed here is by Orchises Press, which is a fantastic reproduction of the very first edition of Ulysses printed by Shakespeare and Company. The binding is quite tight and the print quality superb. There is also plenty of space for literary scholars to scribble notes. As it is a sturdy edition, this is built to last. There is no introduction to the text or any essays, and some may prefer this. For first time readers, it can be better to read the text without any preconceptions, just like people who would have read it when it was first published. The cloth cover on this edition, as others have commented, appears a little greener than the original, but most surviving originals have aged to appear exactly like this anyway. As it so closely resembles a vintage copy, it is a very exciting prospect to read Ulysses in the same way its principal adoptors did in the early 1920s. As it is not a vintage copy, you do not need to worry about being ever so careful. Of course, it is still expensive and it is best to treat it with care, but if you had a 1922 copy, you would probably keep it in a cabinet, trying not to disturb its delicate state. For owners of the original who would love to read their vintage copy, but too afraid to, this may be a great solution. Ordering this from the UK from Amazon, it took about three weeks to arrive here from the US, and it was a really terrific moment when it arrived, removing the clingfilm and starting reading it. It is, as a side note, quite a shame that UK readers do not favour hardback editions of books. It is quite difficult to buy new editions of classic books on hardback, unless of course, you turn to the second hand market. It is just a shame that the UK does not seem to appreciate premeire hardback editions of classic texts. oh well...In many ways the Orchises Press version suits both collectors and serious readers. Of course, it is more expensive than the paperback version, and recommended only to real enthusiasts. For me, this is a definitive edition because literary essays, introductions and annotations mean very little to me, as I like to derive my own impressions by reading and do my own research on specific things. As an MA Comparative Literature student interested in Joyce, I feel this edition can be used for serious research without the supplementary scholarly material because it leaves you free to have just the text and your impressions.If this edition proves too dear, I believe the Modern Library (or was it Everyman's Luibrary) have an edition currently in print and should be available to order from most retail bookstores. I saw a copy in my local Borders for 13.99, and if you are considering getting a decent hardback edition, perhaps you could go for that edition, as the Modern Library has an excellent range of titles and deserves to be supported.To conclude, Joyce had an extraordinary imagination and wonderful command of the English language. He is a master of the English language and this is one of his most captivating work. Personally I prefer Finnegans Wake because if you persevere with it, past the first 100 pages, you find some side-splittingly humourous puns. In any case, I will leave my fondness for Finnegans Wake for another review. For now, grab a copy of Ulysses and enter the bizarre world of Joyce where the ordinary mundane things become surreal adventures, and language becomes so unfamiliar that it begins to start making sense again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Jorge Luis Borges once thanked Joyce and Picasso in the introduction of one of his books. It was a joke. Borges obviously felt both names had been evoked so many times as to make the mere mention of either of them seem ponderous. I kind of agree with that assessment.Joyce certainly has received top billing by the academy and if your impression of him is, well, reverent, you are in good company. I read Ulysses first because I wanted to know this huge book which everyone talked about with such admiration and then I read it again in college in a Joyce seminar. I have to say the seminar was enjoyable but not altogether because of the author chosen. I think we students and teacher felt like we were conquering a mountain and were proud of ourselves every step of the way. In memory the actual book does not loom very large in the way other great works do nor do I feel much affection for it. The characters and plot are implanted in my brain but rarely do they move about nor do scenes get replayed in my imagination. Perhaps Joyce's work was so complete that it didn't leave much room for any other imagination to go to work on it so Ulysses never became one of my favorites. I don't suppose I can wholeheartedly recommend the book given my less than enthusiastic feeling about it. In fact I think I learned a lot more from other books by less revered authors. Joyce had talent to spare but I think for me he just loads Ulysses with too many apparently ordinary though symbolic so very literary things and the result is that I am not inspired by his art but rather put off by the excessive weight and meaning the work aquires as one works ones way through. So much has been said about the work that it almost comes to the reader with a feeling of having been pre-interpreted for you. Joyce I think contributes to this reaction because he left little room for &quot;interpretations&quot; of his work, its all layed out for you and there really is no latitude for an individual encounter with it. You either submit to its spell or you don't. Perhaps the net result is that in this case more turns out to be less. It can't be penalized for being too much of a good thing so five stars despite all just said.Some have mentioned that this book benefits from being read out loud. Perhaps that is the Catholic interpretation of this very Catholic author. Ulysses as incantation. That approach does have its advantages with this book. There is available a recording of Joyce himself reading excerpts from Ulysses and Finnegans Wake(Anna Plurabelle). I've heard it and it is like hearing a fairy tale written by the unconscious for adults. His voice is musical and he reads like he is summoning the spirit."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Few booka are as gripping, confounding, and ultimately satisfying as this vast novel. A true MUST READ for anyone serious about English literature or looking to grow a few new brain cells. Easily one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you didn't read Ulysses, you would never know what the English language is capable of expressing. Ulysses is like no other novel I have ever read. There is no plot to speak of, but you come out loving Mr.Bloom at the end of it. It's very hard to read at first, but helper books such as Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated and Stuart Gilbert's book point out what techniques Joyce is using. I think Ulysses is like a cult classic - you either get hooked on to it, or you get turned off by the abstruseness. So don't give up easy, and you will enjoy it once you start realizing the intricacies of of Joyce's Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses, James Joyce's seminal work,has had a profound effect on millions of readers.

Well, a great pioneering work such as this would probably have to take chances or it wouldn't be the work that it is. But suffice to say, when it all comes together properly it can blow you away. My favorite sections, \\"Scylla and Charybdis\\" and \\"Penelope,\\" seem to me to be unequalled in their raw intellectual and psychic power. Like the epic upon which it is based, \\"Ulysses\\" spends an inordinate amount of time and emotional energy on the nature of the marital relationship. The great tension of \\"The Odyssey,\\" the question of whether Odysseus can get home in time to keep his wife faithful, is turned on its head in \\"Ulysses,\\" where the wanderer makes a conscious decision to stay away from his unfaithful wife but is doomed to continue to wonder resignedly how he can resolve their sad situation. Don't be afraid to consult Cliff's Notes your first time through, but don't try to catch every nuance either, or you'll go crazy.

I think the people who gave it one star should forgive the book it's difficulty and direct their hostility away from it's five-star constituency. Personally, I find the difficulty of the work to be one of its many rewards. But its difficulty really starts to fade after a couple hundred pages as you get used to Joyce's protean style, and settle into Leopold Bloom's head. For those who deride the book's fans as pseudo-intellectual sycophants, I just want to say that most of the pleasures I derived from the book were not intellectual at all. I found it a very moving and uplifting story of the heroism inherent in the simple affirmation of going through an ordinary day. That Joyce implements the whole cultural arsenal of Western Civilization to conduct such a simple story is the evidence of his genius, and if that is too intellectual, I still feel richer for wading in the depths of his book. For it really contains all, or at least it seems to--the epic scope of the book dwarfs the reader coming into it. I certainly wouldn't read this book in order to feel intellectually superior to anyone. I imagine those who enjoy it rather feel humbled from the process. At any rate, I loved it. It is a treasure, the most amazing and titanic example of literature moving forward ever written."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am on the last 100 pages of - what is in all liklihood - the hardest book I have ever read. How I feel about the book is still in question. Some parts I have found very poetic, lyrical, truthful, and yes! even slightly titillating; but, I must say, the vast majority of the book I think is not so much as boring as it is protracted and useless. However, with all due credit to Joyce, it's always honest. Very honest! I found Joyce's other work &quot;Portrait of the Artist...&quot; far more readable and inspiring. So, I don't thinks it's being unfair to Joyce when one says that Ulysses is extremely over-rated. Furthermore the novel seems to have a sort of literary snob appeal for those pseudo intellectuals (and/or Joyce-devotees) who feign some sort of intellectual epiphany from the experience of reading it. For them, yet perhaps another way to separate themselves from the &quot;unappreciative, uninitiated, unenlightened reading masses.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"ulises, es un libro maravillosamente disenado, esta bien de que el autor sea tildado de pedante por haber puesto en el libro cada cosa que se le viniera a la cabeza y hacerlo un poco duro de seguir, pero el libro tiene su valor y no en vano ha siso alabado desde que salio. su complicada estructura se presta a analisis de diferentes esferas de la mente humana. se puede ver como una asociacion de ideas y se necesita de una gran memoria o de una libreta para poder encontrar las referencias o leitmotiv del libro que estan donde menos las pienses. cada capitulo de ulises representa un estilo de narracion y cada uno es una pequena obra en si independiente de las demas. que no encontremos el significado inmediato no significa que sea malo, sino que el autor no estaba pensando en dar a su obra un significado,ese surge mientras lees la obra. los capitulos parecen no tener secuencia logica y los personajes parece que hablan disparates pero si miras bien y lees con calma puedes ver que hay un hilo conductor de la historia, linda parodia de un clasico. cada capitulo es una referencia a la odisea, aunque en algunos de ellos no esta claro a que se refiere hasta el final. es una obra para gente que quiera aprender que las mejores obras estan escritas para satisfacer no a un publico sino a uno mismo y cuando el escribia quien mas disfrutaba era JOYCE LUIS MENDEZ"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"....against making different printings of the same book with different page numbers.

This can be terribly annoying if you are in an English / literature class and everyone has a different edition of the book. Someone says &quot;turn to page 37&quot;, and every page 37 is different.

Well, the critics have such overblown &amp; grandiose interpretations of the book's meaning &amp; Joyce's importance that they were alternately making me laugh or become violent.But last night I had an epiphany. It occurred to me that Ulysses is the greatest hoax of the century, ranking with Conan Doyle's Piltdown Man. Surely, Joyce must have realized that Ulysses was the inevitable &amp; fitting conclusion to the Romantic Age. Art, cut loose from the mooring of God, had steadily drifted away from the universal &amp; towards the personal. Ulysses is the culmination of this trend--a novel that could only be read, understood or enjoyed by its author.

Hardly. A babbling, senseless tome upheld by &quot;literary luminaries&quot; who fear being cast into the tasteless bourgeois darkness for dissent? Yes, that's the gist. Joyce rambles and, moreover, Joyce doesn't say a blessed thing (save what literary critics assign him -- but that's what literary critics do: They find profundity -- not to mention the occasional phallic symbol -- in the midst of absolutely nothing.) The poor trees who gave their lives that _Ulysses_ might gather dust on countless shelves would have been put to nobler use as toothpicks. As for L. Renner, who claims that Joyce's dull (if bedlam) world parallels our own - that &quot;we are all Leopold Bloom&quot;: I deny that I am so uncouth that I would exhibit such behavior on a public beach - in the midst of a fireworks display, to beat all!

Most of these remarks are high praises for the quality of his work and particularly for his originality.Before buying the book, I went on-line to check Amazon's review about it. At the time, the comment seemed helpful. It clearly explained the structure of the novel, the personality of the characters - Leopold Bloom ans Stephen Dedalus -, as well as the outline of the plot - a day in the life of these people.The review is very positive. It mentions that it is a &quot;modern masterpiece&quot; and that it is the greatest expression of realism in literature. Furthermore, it is said that the novel tells a &quot;funny, sorrowful and suspenseful&quot; story where &quot;everything happens&quot;.Since I am not an expert in literature I wonder what a masterpiece is? I cannot convince myself this is the best literature can get.Nevertheless, other characteristics mentioned are impossible to grasp. It is obvious that I wrongly assumed that Amazon and I shared the definition of basic concepts such as &quot;funny&quot;.Therefore, I discovered that the novel was not what I though it would be. I like thoughtful and dynamic story telling books.

I can't say I don't remember what I read, but I can say I had no idea where the &quot;action&quot; took place, no idea of who was talking, and absolutely clueless to what any of the characters thought. The experience was completely mind-numbing. I then turned to the last chapter, and turned page after page looking for the period at the end of that chapter's opening sentence. I don't know how thorough my scanning was but I believe the whole last chapter, several pages, is one very long sentence.Joyce is an aesthetic bother of Marcel Duchamp (known for The Fountain, a urinal, now a museum piece) and John Cage (the composer of pieces for prepared piano, where the piano's strings are mangled with trash. He also is the &quot;composer&quot; of violin piece where the performer goes through the motions of playing without making a sound.

In this &quot;club&quot; we have a composer who writes noise or silence, an artist who exhibits a toilet, and a writer who is incomprehensible...long may they rest in peace.Two positive things I can say about James Joyce is that he has a great sounding name and he gives wonderful titles to his works."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I spent months to read this crappy novel, hailed by modern pseudo-intellectuals as 20th century best (maybe because they are so close to its flimsy thoughtless characters and broken up narration -typical to Post-Modernist 'masterpieces'-).

The thoroughly unreadable ramblings found inside are under no circumstance manifestations of artistic rebellion, being in fact just excuses coming from extraordinarily self-indulgent authors.Of course, some non-indoctrinated people could object and say: this book portrays well Dubliner &quot;middle&quot; society from ITS OWN perspective (not from a critical eye). However, I don't think this was author's intent. His intent was just &quot;getting rebelious&quot;: being &quot;new&quot;, unbounded by (older) rules and responsibility.Why two stars, then? Because I LOVED the chapter where Bloom's wife events perspective is provided. Everything had no organization whatsoever: no sentences, no punctuations, just one phrase that ends with the chapter.

Only James Joyce, I believe, could adequately review himself."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The Modern Library (Random House) has ranked Ulysses by James Joyce to be the #1 fiction of the 20th century.Now the question is does it deserve to be called the best fiction of the century?The answer will depend on your background and tastes. If you enjoy philosophy, heavy symbolic imagery, psychology, analysis of religious corruption, drawing parallels between Greek Myths and everyday life, and learning new english words then you will undoubtedly get the most out of Ulysses.I personally think that Ulysses is a great choice as the best fiction of the century because it covers almost *all aspects* of life from romance to racism. And it is one of the first books that lets you really see how the mind works (i.e. &quot;stream of conciousness&quot; technique). But it is probably this psychological aspect of the novel that turns people off. If one can get past this barrier than it can be seen that Ulysses is truly worthy of its #1 ranking.Homer's Odyssey (from which &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the main character) is considered to be one of the greatest books of western literature of all time. It is only fitting that Ulysses fills this role in the 20th century."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is one of those classic novels that gives classic novels a bad name. Modern readers equate the word \\"classic\\" with \\"boring and hard to read.\\" But most classics have risen to that status because they are timeless, powerful and entertaining - Heart of Darkness, War and Peace, and Red Badge of Courage come to mind (all highly readable, by the way). Then there are the novels that have been made famous because of the academic community's inability to distinguish between obscure genius and obscure pretentious pap. Ulysses falls into the latter category.This work has its moments, no question. I actually enjoyed the final hundred pages. Too bad I had to read 900 pages (hardcover version) of intellectual onanism to get to them. Joyce was a talented writer, but trying so stridently to prove that to his readers is just plain arrogant. His prose makes Faulkner look like Crichton. I was able to follow the narrative less than half of the time. Lest you think that has more to do with my intellect (or lack thereof) than bad writing, you should know that I am a well-read, educated person who makes his living as a professional editor. The point is, if a literate audience can't make (any) sense of your work without referring to a 500 page reference book every two minutes, your novel is a failure.Ulysses is a book for people who think a blank white canvas hanging in an art gallery is genius. Fans of Joyce need to read Tom Wolfe's Painted Word before they can have any credibility defending Joyce's &quot;masterpiece.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a great book, it is masterfully written and there is not a word that cannot be explained. The negative reviews for this book are written by people who lack the patience or education to understand it. There are stacks of books written just for these people; The New Bloomsday Book being the best one. This is not an Oprah's Book Club book, it is Serious Literature, and it is unapologetic about it. It's fine to say that you didn't get it or you don't understand it; but to make these silly \\"Emperor's new clothes\\" remarks is a display of ugly ignorance.Ulysses demands something of its reader. You need a real education--not a job-training college degree, but the experience of having engaged the works of history's greatest writers for your own benefit and on your own terms. You need to have read a great breadth of authors in real depth, and you need to have understood them. You need to know what happened in the Odyssey, you need to know a fair bit of history, and you need to have read a wide variety of authors from Chaucer to Shakespeare to Dickens. You need to be well-read enough that you can understand what's going on without flipping back and forth to Cliff Notes.It blows me away that one of the negative reviews mentioned that someone was made to read this book in high school: I don't think you can possibly be well-read enough for it in high school. If you're not a voracious reader, someone who reads quality classic literature for the fun of it, you are not in Joyce's target audience. There's nothing here to entertain you if you can't keep up; Joyce isn't Mark Twain, giving you an entertaining adventure story to divert you if his larger social points go over your head. He wants to push literature into new directions, and he is very demanding.But if you are capable of approaching this book, the rewards are astounding. This book is incredibly great; the language will floor you, the characters are interesting and engaging (to whoever said that the characters aren't developed, what more could you ask for than Leopold Bloom?), and the book is very funny in parts. If you can read it, you'll be glad you read it.And if you can't read it, don't sweat it. Most people can't. There's nothing wrong with that--plenty of great authors are very approachable to less well-read people, and it's just that Joyce isn't one of them. Joyce wasn't trying to be mean, he was just trying to use ALL of his education to try some things that hadn't been done before. Try Dubliners, which is much more straightforward and readable, or even Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Joyce and his readers are not \\"overeducated\\"--and what a silly, ignorant, impossible concept that is anyway!Just don't take this attitude that Ulysses is for boring intellectuals. With this attitude, you are the one being snotty, not the Ulysses readers. This book is capable of getting some people really excited and engaged; respect it for what it is, don't deride it for what it isn't. This is a great book for people who have read most of the other great books; it may not be the great book for you. There's nothing wrong with that."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A good version of Ulysses, no doubt, but it is still better to go with the Gabler edition. The first edition of Joyce's text and many subsequent editions averaged about 7 errors a page. In a book this long, those add up rather quickly. The Gabler edition was researched by a team of literary analysts, and pulled together from the various printed versions of the text as well as Joyce's notes. It is the most accurate version of the text, and I highly recommend reading it over any other version:Ulysses (Gabler Edition)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I see that the Euros love to trash modernism.

I have never had this happen with a Recorded Books audio book. Inexcusable.Also they put in some singing/opera clips. Hey, I came to hear the book not some other stuff the producer decided to put in."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This \\"Reader's Edition\\" of Ulysses cannot be defended on any grounds, not even those of the editor. Mr. Rose claims to have brought the beauty of Joyce's most famous work closer to being appreciated en masse. He strips the work of many techniques that Joyce is admired for, that set him apart as an artist and that he surely intended. Gone are many (there are thousands of revisions) of Joyce's omissions of puctuation, capitalization and other conventions of grammar. There are documented mistakes that Joyce attempted to correct during his lifetime, and three existing editions are far truer to Ulysses as it was intended. There is no reason to subjugate the techniques of James Joyce so people with short attention spans and speciously pedantic (why correct Joyce's purposeful misuse of grammar) leanings can appreciate. If you simply want to know the story buy the Cliff's notes or ask someone who read the book. If you want to find out all the reason's for Joyce's renown read the true \\"reader's editions\\" from the 20's and thirties or ,of course, the 1961 text. I am obviously very angry.

I actually did manage to more or less read it all the way through, in one long twelve hour night, which I can never have back now. And I don't know about all the nuances and subtleties that it supposedly contains, but the basic thrust of it was clear enough.Ulysses is basically an unbridled attack on the very ideas of heroism, romantic love and sexual fulfillment, and objective literary expression. This is made especially clear by the title's reference to The Odyssey of Homer (Ulysses being the Latin name for the Greek Odysseus)---and the unmistakably unbridgeable contrast between the two books, both in terms of the content of the stories, and their modes of expression.Odysseus is a great man, King of Ithaca, husband of Penelope, father of Telemachus, and a hero of the Trojan war. The Odyssey chronicles his heroic ten-year voyage to return home from the war to his wife and son. Ulysses, on the other hand, is about an ordinary day in the life of Leopold Bloom, a bumbling buffoon, impotent both in life and in bed. In Homer's view, man is a heroic, even God-like, being---and woman is more than a match for him. In Joyce's, man is metaphysically ridiculous, especially in matters of sex, and woman is his equal in patheticalness.And then there is the literary style Joyce employs to spew forth this sewage. While Homer's epic poem takes the form of strictly-metered verse, Joyce switches literary mode, from straight prose to dialogue to stream of consciousness (among other things), almost at random throughout the work, though it seems to degenerate more and more toward the end.If the point of Ulysses were to break free of outmoded and arbitrary restrictions of classicism, it would be admirable. But that's not what Joyce is doing. He doesn't offer a positive alternative to replace the Homeric values (which I think are genuine values) upon which he's pissing. He's pissing on them just to piss on them. It's pure nihilism, and it's disgusting.Ulysses is obscene, not because of any language it uses or its obsession with sex, but because of its thematic content---the ideas it conveys. The book expresses nothing less than an all-consuming hatred of man and any positive values to which he aspires. And that is why I think Ulysses is one of the most vile and evil books ever written."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce had sometimes been called a writers writer. One reviewer even suggested we should give Ulysses the benefit of a doubt, for the same reason we uneducated lay-folk use to accept on sight modern physics or Einsteins Relativity theory. Now I can think of all sorts of definitions for the meaning and purpose of imaginative literature -- to serve as the arcane Cabala for the initiates of a secretive cult is not one of them. If a novel lacks what it takes to reach every conceivable kind of reader, regardless whether it is to be received as a pleasure or a nuisance, than it is a failure, plain and simple. I may detest what I read -- even successful novels dont come with a gun held to your head -- but Ulysses is simply an empty shell, nothing left to form an opinion or taste either way. A bad writer is just bad, because he cant cope adequately with his task. But there is also a possibility that I may detest a good writer for the waste of skill and talent on something I deem to be an unworthy or badly misguided effort. So even if I may not like what he has to say, I can still be impressed by the beauty and cogency of his delivery. I dont like it, but the man has something to say, and he says it well. But this here is different: can anybody tell me what else it possibly could be than the vain demonstration of stylistic skills from the portfolio of a great talent -- with absolutely nothing to say? God knows, I am all for a reader who pays to a good authors work the respect it deserves and pitches in a bit of his own effort. This should entitle a good reader to carry home something worthwhile. However it is not just the Ulysses, I got the same impression from the entire work of James Joyce, even from his early poems. Except for a precious few luminous moments (the travel of young Steven in the train compartment, the damp and creeping cold atmosphere on the rugby pitch in the Portrait) it really amounts to little more than an exercise in the rhetorics of imaginative writing. It must be me, but I cant help feeling something amateurish in all this contrived effort. Call Joyce a genius, if you like, we all know he was determined to be remembered as the outstanding writer of the 20th century. And we do! We remember his legend the same way we remember Cervantes or Kafka before we open their books. An aura surrounds Ulysses, and this awe may even carry us through a few passages and purple patches, but thats where the comparison ends. Take away the halo from Cervantes and Kafka and you still enjoy a robust read -- I doubt the same can be said of Joyce. He had the gift, and he knew it, but even his consummate admiration for Ibsen didnt help him to find for himself a story worth telling, that is a story which would make his talent shine and captivate the reader. Technically, Ulysses is a superb piece of narrative engineering. A myriad of leitmotifs and themes entwine, separate and meet again each delivered in a variety of different voices and styles. So, ok, a letter torn to tiny shreds into the river carries to a corresponding theme five chapters later, a piece of soap bought in the morning becomes an important item in late afternoon, a galaxy of town-folks revolve around each other and do their daily chores, though mostly in pubs, hospital-canteens and hostelries -- a tat one-sided should it ever become necessary to reconstruct Dublin from scratch. So our Mr. Bloom masturbates over the sight of a crippled girl -- the joke to write parts of this particular passage in the pseudo-elegant journalese of a turn of the century fashion magazine is lost on me: is it supposed to poke fun on the clich beset thoughts in the poor girls mind? In fact Joyce ventriloquizes a lot; all over the book the English language is taken through her paces like a dressage horse, nobody can deny the authors brilliance, and sometimes he even presents a superb artistic flash, like the gold coins the principle is handing out to Stephen. Yet even here I see the author glancing sideways under his eyelids: are we really looking? Do we catch the moment? (Kafka did such things in his sleep.) So what does all this amount to, on some 800 pages, except to small change? Yes, Ulysses has style, a whole museum of styles to be exact, and nothing but style. After you finish it, if you make it through, you will leave it behind like a confused dream, and forget it just as soon."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Required reading in my senior or junior year I must confess I ran an purchased (No Amazon in 77') the cliffnotes but could always wanted to actually read James Joyce's classic and much more.

Naturally."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The basis of Joyce's work is the invigoration of Irish popular speech,the influence of music and song,English not being his native language,explains its unparalled virtuousity,also Joyce's near-blindness,his imagination becomes more auditory than visual as in Homer and Milton.Joyce must be read aloud for full appreciation.His poems are like songs.Also the great use of interior monologue for all 3 main characters.For Joyce the lapsed Catholic,words held magic sway over things: transubtantiaition. Disintegration of experience,integration of form.The theme and structure borrowed from Homer's Odyssey are a metaphor for Joyce's dream of Ireland's journey from a 'priest-ridden' backwater to a country taking its rightful place in the European intellectual and philosophical tradition.Joyce is the most cosmopolitan modern writer. Joyce's poetry is minor if charming,his drama doesn't work,his poetry works best in the comic framework of the prose novel.Style ceases to be a relationship between author and reader,instead becoming a relationship of a magical kind between author and object.Experience is replaced by prose.Joyce was a Flaubertian realist infected by the bacillus of modernism, following The Dubliners,he wrote Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, calling his hero Stephen Dedalus,connecting the contemporary character with the mythical artificer:there are two movements,one outward from Ireland the other downward into myth. Superficially Stephen is dissociating himself,on a deeper level achieving an association with myth.This led onto the systematization of Ulysses,with the mystification that followed in its wake.Too systematized Joyce asked?All Joyce's works have a strong autobiographical element.Ulysses was preceded by the play Exiles.An Irish writer,Richard Rowan believes his wife is playing him false with a former friend/disciple.Rowan finds himself in a tragic position regarding his mother,a pious Catholic.The theme is autobiographical.A onetime friend in 1909 claimed that when Joyce was courting Nora,she had shared her favours with himself.Rowan reveals that he himself longs for his own deception,deliberately making himself a party to it.Rowan identifies with Christ and looks for Judases amongst his friends.Very Joycean.Nora thought he encouraged her to go with other men.This play is the real basis for Ulysses,with the part of Richard Rowan divided between Stephen Dedalus,haunted by his dead mother,and Bloom,haunted by the idea of his wife's infidelity.They are the same person and may be regarded as a man young and old or two aspects of the same man.The subject of the book is the attempt to reconcile them.They pass,they skirt one another all day,but it is only at night that they meet.Each chapter is written in a different style,the names given to these styles is metaphorical,each metaphor sustained by puns.For Joyce all thought arises from the unconscious and returns to it.We need to read Ulysses by a process of free association.The opening chapters of Ulysses are the highest development of Joyce's peculiar genius, for this lay with the habitual,the normal,the everyday,and his interest and observation were sustained by an elaborate system of analogy.But analogy will not permit of growth and development,these have to be foisted artificially onto the book,and as it approaches a crisis,it becomes bogged in tortuous technical devices,like the chapter of the lying -in hospital where the development of the embryo is illustrated by the development of English prose.The problem is it reduces man to dissociated metaphor.Humanity explodes like an atom bomb."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ordered the Ulysses book by James Joyce based on original 1922 version.

A person may imagine that writings of this sort confer a measure of immortality. The measure of immortality gleaned by such articles, however, is rather small. What do people learn about us other than that we have some small part in sorting out a minor detail of the workings of the universe? We are no more than a couple initials followed by a family name that appear above the abstract. In contrast, the degree of immortality gained by an author such as James Joyce in the writing of Ulysses is immeasurably greater. Infused into his character Leopold Bloom are the important details of a day of a life. From his morning ablutions to his final repose, marked by the famous soliloquy of his wayward wife Molly, Leopold reveals to us the broad spectrum of what every rich life might be expected to encompass. From birth to death, from the stirrings of love to betrayals both great and small, Joyce's protagonist experiences them all as his moves through the day--and through reflections on his life from the vantage point afforded by middle age.To help bring this book to life I urge the reader to look up Molly Bloom's soliloquy as performed by Angeline Ball."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This edition is a great facsimile of the first edition.
