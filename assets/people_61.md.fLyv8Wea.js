I checked this book out of the library and found it so useful that I'm planning to buy it. It has lots of drills on verbs and grammar, but you may need a dictionary to look up words you don't know as many instrustions are in Spanish and there is no glossary in the back. It's definately not for beginners; it assumes you have basic vocabulary and goes into more detail than a beginner would be able to absorb."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"I took Spanish in high school and did not have to take it all through college, so I am pretty rusty. I picked up this book and it has really brought alot of what I learned back to my rememberance while reviewing concepts. Even when relating basic concepts, this book does not insult the skill level of a more advanced learner. It is very challenging and great for someone who wants to get back into speaking Spanish again."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"i am learning spanish as an adult. i have seen a lot of spanish books that are marginally useful. this one is packed with grammar and is presented in a useful and interesting way. it is too advanced for a complete beginner, but once you have mastered the basics this book will take you to the next few levels.i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"Fantastic buy! Avoid this book if you have had NO experience in Spanish. However, if you've even had a little experience (through classes,etc.) then this is a MUST buy. While so many Spanish books try to make you &quot;get by&quot; in Spanish (teaching you how to reserve a room at a hotel, or order from a restaurant), this type of book is great for people who really want to LEARN the language. I wish they had one for Catalan!"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"If like me, you're studying Spanish for the enjoyment of learning a new language, or if you're studying for credit, this book is a terrific companion to your textbook.

Brief grammar descriptions are followed by challenging activities that help the learner to master the material. I have purchased way too much learning software and books in the last two years but this is one of those buys that I would highly recommend. After completing this book I felt very confident with verb tenses and vocabulary.

It has clear examples and lessons. However, one caveat is: one must have at the very least a basic knowledge of Spanish. This is an advanced text that assumes one has taken at least a semester or two of college level Spanish language courses. With that said, I highly recommend it. Make sure to get the CD-ROM version as when I purchased this book a while back, the first version only came in book form. Would be nice to have the CD-ROM with practice drills."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"The book is a great value with loads of information and exercises for a fair price. My main issue with the book is the concept of \\"intermediate.\\" A true intermediate wouldn't be going over the basics of conjugating simple verbs as is done in Chapter 1. However, at the same time, if I am really going over these basics, shouldn't the instructions (and contextual setup) given for the exercises be given in English? The exercises are clearly designed for a beginner, but the instructions are written in intermediate level Spanish that includes unique words and Spanish idioms that don't translate easily into English. This is not consistent. It's easy to do the exercises without reading the instructions, but I like to translate what I am working on to build vocabulary and understanding. So, as a learner I spend more time translating the instructions than the exercises. In lesson 1, I already had to give up on my pocket dictionary and switch to the full dictionary since multiple words were not in the pocket one of 30,000 words and I needed a dictionary with idioms in it. Obviously, if I can easily translate the instructions which are full of regular and irregular verbs and verb tenses not even covered in the book yet, I can handle the super easy versions in the exercises.Sorry for the ramble, but it just doesn't line up for me. Keep the instructions in English in the early stages when the student/learner are working on the basics. Or make it truly an \\"intermediate\\" book and skip all the basics and go straight to a true intermediate level.Anyway, I would still recommend the product since it is good material and a good value, but I think they could have probably been more consistent at what level the material being presented is at."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"Although this book is 'cheap and cheerful' and covers all the grammatical issues that intermediate students of Spanish need to absorb it falls down in it's presentation: no photos, no color, no illustrations hardly.

Neither of us spoke much Spanish so we decided to take lessons. Our instructor mentioned that \\"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice\\" was the best instructional book in Spanish that we could get..but it was not available in Mexico. He had one copy that he shared with the 6 people in our class and I could probably say, with his other classes. My wife and I wondered if Amazon would have this book...and they did. Now, our class has two books to share...and probably soon, a couple more. With Hector's instructions and using the \\"Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice\\", my wife and I can converse much better with our neighbors (who speak no English) and fit in to our new invironment. The book clarifies many of the questions that we students ask in our class and clarifies many of the non asked questions people learning a new language fight their way through. I recommend the book...and recommend the service we received from Amazon (Mail does not move quickly in Mexico...so we were very pleasantly surprised when the book arrived almost a week ahead of the time estimated by Amazaon).Thank you Amazon.comCarlos y Sharon Garrison, Mazatlan, Mexico"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"Just about one year ago I wrote a review of The Big Red Book of Spanish Verbs with CD-ROM (see my review, July 26, 2006). I was a long-time user of The Big Red reference and when it came out with an interactive CD-ROM I had to let everyone know how fantastic it was!Well, here I am again this time letting people know that The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice, another incredible book that I've been using successfully for six years, is now accompanied by a user-friendly, easy to navigate interactive CD-ROM. The CD-ROM has hundreds of new, varied, and challenging exercises that allow me to practice all the grammar points in the book. What's great is that if I'm in doubt about an answer or grammatical topic I can check the reference to the chapter in the book.The Diagnostic and Review Tests are excellent gauges of what I know and need to brush up on.I'm really excited by the listening comprehension program. Each Audio Module consists of a dialogue or narration spoken by native Spanish speakers. The Ten Key Words and Expressions are a great introduction to the passages. I listen to them and repeat them after the speaker. Hearing them first and knowing what to listen for make understanding the passage easier. The passage has neat pop-up definitions for highlighted words and if I don't know any word or expression I can activate the Glossary.I love the audio passages I've worked through so far and I'm amazed how much useful everyday Spanish I've added to my vocabulary. It really helps to listen to Spanish speakers in real situations. I'm a marketing director and often have to speak Spanish with our Latin American clients. \\"Una conversaci&oacute;n telef&oacute;nica\\" has proved enormously helpful to me.The characters are so real, I feel I get to know them. Some scenarios remind me of my own experiences with my husband and children buying and fixing up our house, or talking about a wedding and relationships with my friends, or going through security at the airport in Madrid.I'm having a fun time learning and practicing Spanish and feeling much more confident using the language in all kinds of situations thanks to The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice with CD-ROM."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"This was a well versed book, more advanced than I had thought it would be.

All the various verb tenses are explained succinctly; and clear examples of each are provided with counterpart English translations.

Surprisingly, not all books I've seen do as good or comprehensive a job.As this book delves right into the details, I would recommend this book to someone who has already taken some Spanish courses and is looking for an excellent reference guide.This book is definitely more than just a grammar book but it has best served me as one."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"This is a great book for an intermediate student to review verb tenses and other grammar points.

I am also a native Spanish speaker and a professional Spanish instructor. Here's my review of The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice.This is one of my favorite books on the topic of Spanish grammar. I have recommended it to so many of my personal students as well as my newsletter readers. What do I find so interesting about this book? Quite a few things. For example, the \\"Nota Cultural\\" (cultural notes) selections.The \\"Nota Cultural\\" (cultural notes) selections are entirely in Spanish without any English translation to give the student a real challenge in reading Spanish. Some of the other sections which the authors did an excellent job with were the Prepositions section where the authors covere the following:* basic prepositions such as a, de, en, con* \\"por\\" and \\"para\\"* Other simple prepositions* Sets of prepositions and compound prepositionsThe authors also did an outstanding job with the section that any native English speaker learning Spanish needs to study very thoroughly: Common Errors and PitfallsIn this section the authors cover the following among other common errors and pitfalls:Dejar vs. SalirSaber vs. ConocerOreja vs. O&iacute;doMeanings of Quedar\\"To break\\" and \\"to Tear\\"\\"To miss\\"I strongly recommend that you add this book to your collection of learning Spanish books if you want to improve your proficiency in this language."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"I am convinced that this book helped me pass the Praxis II Spanish Content Knowledge Exam. I highly recommend prospective Spanish teachers to buy this book. I also liked that this book is affordable."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"This is James from James Spanish (the learning Spanish blog). This comprehensive book offers a well thought out series of lessons and exercises to help you strengthen your Spanish language abilities.The chapters are organized and follow a logical order, each one dealing with a single concept. The book begins with the present tense and moves through other tenses, but never at a pace that is too difficult. Each step is carefully designed so that there are no sudden leaps that you might struggle with.Whether you are just starting out on your journey through Spanish grammar, or are in need of a good book to help you better understand a particular element that you have studied, this product is a valuable resource.The exercises are clear and easy to understand but challenging enough for you to gain real knowledge about the topic. An answer key at the back of the book lets you grade your own exercises to discover just how well you understood a particular lesson.As well as the lessons, verb tables, vocabulary and exercises, there are also many anecdotes and snippets of cultural information peppered throughout the book which provide humor and entertainment, stopping the text from being too dry and boring.Verbs and their conjugation are dealt with in enough detail for you to master these important subjects. Being able to speak in different tenses is a key element to becoming fluent, so it is worthwhile putting in the effort to get to know these subjects.As a practice tool, the book has plenty of exercises for you to test your knowledge, but is also laid out in a way that makes it an easy to use reference manual for when you are struggling with a particular grammatical concept such as the passive voice or prepositions.The interactive CD-ROM contains plenty of exercises and drills for you to practice your knowledge, with the advantage that you can check your answers straight away to monitor your progress. There are also audio passages which let you listen to real conversations between native Spanish speakers, so you can practice your understanding of the concepts in the book as they are used in everyday situations.Altogether the Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice package is a great value resource for you to practice and reinforce your Spanish knowledge.In closing my review of this product, I'd like to share with you the three Amazon products that I have found most helpful in my pursuit to learn Spanish. If you are truly serious about achieving fluency, I'd recommend getting all 3 of them if you can afford it.1.Lights, Camera, Spanish (Book + DVD): Learn Conversational Spanish by Watching a Romantic AdventureThis is actually a 90 minute movie for Spanish-language learners. It gives the option to watch the movie with subtitles but I'd recommend not using them to improve your Spanish. This \\"movie\\" also includes a workbook so that you can reinforce the Spanish vocabulary words and phrases from the film. The workbook also has lots of exercises to keep you engaged in the film. But be prepared to hear Chilean accents. Although pleasent to the ear, the accents from Chile are very different from most Latin American accents.2.Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)This software replaces the traditional verb conjugation books and makes learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an interactive and fun activity. This should be a required resource for anyone who wants to improve their ability to conjugate Spanish verbs. Especially anyone who is challenged by the drudgery of learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs and who is looking for a new way to make learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an easy and fun activity3.Diccionario esencial de la lengua espanola de la Real Academia Espanola (Spanish Edition)If you are really serious about speaking the language fluently, then at some point you will need to replace your Spanish-English dictionary and get a pure Spanish dictionary with both the vocabulary words and the definitions entirely in Spanish. I use this one only because it was highly-recommended by a friend from Spain who teaches Spanish."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"This is one book that no Spanish student should be without.

I say that because it is definitely the most comprehensive Spanish book that you'll find. It covers every topic imaginable."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"I consider myself as a beginner in Spanish. But I found this book really great. I learned Spanish as a self learner from Pimsleur and Learning Spanish like crazy. They are audio based only which is great, but after I completed those courses I felt I needed to work little bit more on my grammar. Especially the tenses and verbs. This book provides clear explanations and interesting exercises. By interesting I mean they are not boring I especially like short texts rather than individual sentences, the book uses both. It uses challenging vocabulary not very difficult not very easy it just fits my level, so that I learn something new, but I am not stucked because I have to search for each word. What I don't like is the CD ROM. It really sucks. From some reason, the whole McGraw Hill CD ROM concept just does not work for me. I had other books from them with the CD ROM and it was the same. However this does not degrade the book itself. I am happy with my purchase."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"This book is a concise and well-organized review of the Spanish language. You should definitely have some prior knowledge of Spanish before using this book. From the get-go, the book assumes that you either know a good chunk of Spanish vocabulary or that you are willing to research the vocabulary as you go. It guides you along but does not hold you hand, which is exactly what I wanted.The practice exercises are a nice way to drill the lessons into your head. I did not even try to use the CD-ROM included, so I can't comment on it. It looks old anyway and I think it's just there to help sell the book.Definitely recommended highly for intermediate and advanced Spanish students who need a little boost!"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice is a great book for not only reviewing Spanish but also learning it, if you already have some exposure to the language.My family lived in Spain for 3 years in the late 70s while was a teenager. During that time I was close to fluent but we left before I could really get to be. Coming back to the states I did not bother keeping up with my Spanish so I quickly forgot what I learned.Now however being in my mid 40s I decided to take up Spanish and learn it again.Most of the beginning grammars were just to short and simple so I avoided them. I wanted one comprehensive book that I could use that had all the grammar I would need to gain fluency and this is the book.Its chapters are short with excellent organization and explanation. You will not be bothered with tons of funny but useless pictures and diagrams. They authors use bullet points, tables and lists very well, so the info in presented in a way that is easy to learn. The test questions are also very good: challenging but not impossible.Like the other reviewers said beware if you are a beginning Spanish user. The book assumes you know some Spanish. The directions for the exercises are written in Spanish and the exercises are not progressive. For example the first chapter deals with the present tense and does a great job of showing how normal and irregular verbs are conjugated and how the present tense is used. However, to do the exercises you will need to know other areas of grammar like definite and indefinite articles, adjectives and adverbs as well have a working vocabulary. With out these you be running to a dictionary all the time or just be stumped. Even with my Spanish background I had a hard time reading the directions and had an online dictionary open all the time while I did the exercises. I did not mind this but some may get frustrated if you have not been previously exposed to the grammar and vocabulary. Beginners will most likely be totally lost.A great book, just wish the version I had came with a CD.Jeff Sulman"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"I am using Rosetta Stone version 3 and taking a Spanish conversation class. This book is an invaluable reference and provides good excercises on each aspect of grammar. The CD ROM does not work well on Vista. You have to click through numerous error messages to start the program. Once through the error messages, the CD exercises are very useful as drills and give immediate feedback on the correct and incorrect answers. I recommend using the book alone. The CD isn't worth the time to set up and deal with error messages, which occur every time you use the program."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"Excellent resource to review or learn Spanish grammar.

The exercises are comprehensive and the lessons move at a good pace-- not too fast or too slow."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"I have studied Spanish at the college level before, but since then have not had the opportunity to practice speaking or writing except in informal settings with friends, while traveling, etc. So when I needed to speak with a Spanish client for business, I found my conversation and writing skills somewhat lacking. I turned to &quot;The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice&quot; after having it recommended to me by a few business associates. After one month of working intensively through the book, I feel much more confident in my formal Spanish skills. The book is well thought out, organized into 28 chapters, each focusing on a different topic. Starting with the present tense of verbs and other basic language topics and progressing through the subjunctive and other advanced forms, it provides a comprehensive text to learn and perfect both oral and written Spanish. The explanations and examples of each topic are very clear, and the exercises provide a challenging test of the subject matter presented in each chapter. The short and lively cultural notes add an authentic touch to the language, and provide interesting observations of Spanish and Latin American culture. I found Part IV particularly helpful as it included chapters on common idioms and frequently found errors that have helped my conversation skills measurably. Although targeted at intermediate and advanced learners, I can see the text helping beginners as well, and I have recommended it for associates and friends. In sum, this is a very helpful and comprehensive review of Spanish."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"As a Spanish teacher I was delighted to find such a grammar gem on the market for Spanish students at all levels. I bought the book with the intention of using it as a guide and review of many difficult grammar concepts in Spanish and I definitely was pleased with the grammar material and brief cultural readings that are included in the book. The book covers all key grammar concepts that must be mastered in order to speak Spanish confidently and with superior grammar control. The book contains twenty-eight valuable chapters in which key grammar concepts such as verb conjugation and verb usage, tenses and moods of verbs, the passive voice and other key elements are analyzed. The heavy emphasis on verbs and verb usage is indicative of the quality of this book especially since the ability to conjugate and use verbs correctly are the key to mastering any language. The practice exercices are also very valuable and readily force the student to apply the knowledge learned in the chapter thus understanding the practical use of verbs, prepositions, idiomatic expressions or whatever the grammatical concept may be. This book is definitely one of the most handy Spanish grammar tools available and can always be used as a reference for clarification of one's queries in Spanish be it a written grammar concept or an oral query. The purchase of this grammar book will enable you to fortify your Spanish and clarify many grammatical queries. A highly recommended purchase."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"If you have already studied Spanish and want to strengthen your skills, this is the book for you. It would also be a good supplementary text for first, second and third year students of college level Spanish. Better than most books that cost twice it's price, it not only gives you clear, well thought-out, and well organized descriptions of all the essential grammar points in Spanish, it also includes copious exercises to drive the points home. This &quot;workbook&quot; aspect of the book is an invaluable asset, since once you have understood the grammar point, you still need to practice it a bit make it second nature. I guarantee that if you work you way through this whole book and absorb its contents, you'll have a very good grasp of Spanish indeed. Coupled with something like the Pimsleur courses, a person could get quite fluent is six months of solid daily study."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"This book is an excellent way to regain the elements of Spanish you've lost from lack of study or exposure to the language. Although it covers every major aspect of the language, it's not designed to teach Spanish from scratch, but rather to assist the backslider in regaining his/her lost knowledge. I bought this book prior to returning to Spanish studies after an 18-year absence, and the preparation enabled me to enter the program almost as if there had been no break.If you really want to review your studies or pick them up after a long absence, it's important to do the exercises in the book and to check your answers. Also, go through each chapter, as even simple stuff like the present tense contains subtleties that are easy to forget.This book is more comprehensive than the grammar textbooks we use for class that cost three times as much. Again, I wouldn't try learning Spanish from this book alone, but I would recommend it as a supplement regardless of which approach you are taking to learning the language."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"Be careful when reading other reviews. When you see that this book is recommended for people who have already taken \\"a couple of years of Spanish\\", they must mean four years in high school PLUS a couple of years in college.The book looks good and the CD is handy, but if your Spanish isn't already pretty good, this book isn't for you. I can carry very basic conversation in Spanish (in the present tense only) and couldn't even understand the first exercise on the CD.So just beware that if you only had two years of Spanish in HIGH SCHOOL, this book isn't for you. I must sell mine."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"This book was highly recommended to me by a number of people from a Learning Spanish newsgroup or forum.

The book consists of 28 chapters and over 400 hundred pages of grammatical explanations, exercises, vocabulary, verb charts, and cultural notes written in Spanish.I have been studying Spanish for more years than I care to tell you. Finally, I am making drastic improvements, and becoming fluent in the language seems very realistic for me and not merely a dream. Thanks to the Ulitimate Spanish Review and Practice and Learning Spanish Like Crazy. And when I say that I have made drastic improvements I am not just speaking from my personal opinion. My Spanish speaking clients are constantly asking me what method am I using to learn to speak Spanish so well.A few days ago, I was at a store and I asked the \\"chica\\" behind the counter \\"cuanto es?\\" and she could not believe that I am actually learning Spanish and that I am not a native.

This book is doing an excellent job of tying everything together, particularly with its extensive exercises. Like any good review book, each chapter builds on the ones before it as opposed to introducing a topic, reviewing it, and dropping it for good. And several of the exercises will give your brain a good workout.I'd quicky recommend this book for someone with a solid basic grasp of the language -- perhaps a second-year student. It may prove to be too advanced for early students of the language, as some concepts (such as commands) appear in exercises several chapters before they're actually reviewed.All-in-all, an excellent resource"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"I have had a few spanish courses and I am one of the people that really like the language so I decided that I wanted some books to help me get to know the language even more.

Working by myself, I was able to complete the book in about a month and felt well-prepared for my test.This book is laid out to be user-friendly, breaking complex grammar topics into manageable chapters. Each chapter presents explanations (in English), examples (in Spanish with translations), a vast array of practice exercises, options for oral/speaking practice, and application of the topic to an authentic article of written Spanish. Additionally, the CD-ROM offers extra practice activities for each chapter, as well as listening practice and two different comprehensive tests.This book was wel worth the price- a steal really- and is a better investment than most of my college textbooks were. I will definitely keep it handy as a reference for any future grammar questions that I may have.

On her recommendation, I started at the beginning, and have been working my way through the explanations and exercizes.I've found the presentation of grammatical points clear and easily understandable, with a minimum of grammatical jargon and good number of examples.The exercizes are certainly useful, since I've found that even if I understand a grammatical usage clearly, I need to practice it extensively if I'm going to use it when I'm actually talking with people in Spanish.My tutor pointed out that the exercizes could be better, especially for more advanced students, if they mixed different usages in the same exercize, rather than simply repeating the same type of sentence again and again. This would make the student think a bit more, and force him or her to recall previously learned forms.After working my way through the book, I agree with that criticism.Otherwise, I can warmly recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve his or her undertanding of and use of Spanish."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice: Mastering Spanish Grammar for Confident Communication","review":"This was a nice wasy to study.

The campaign to take Thailand, Malaya, and Singapore took exactly seventy days.Falk is very detailed in his writing about what happened to cause the loss of the fortress Singapore. In one of the chapters of the book, he details the loss of the British Force Z (Repulse and Prince of Wales).Falk does a good job of telling us why the fortress was weak. Its defenses pointed toward the sea, and not the landward side of Johore. Also the state of the British Empire waging a war against both Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, weakened the country to the point where inadequate defensive forces were provided to Singapore. The result was a disasterous defeat of the British, with many of the soldiers spending years in prison building a railroad (The Bridge over the River Kwai). Falk spent too much time on detailing what units did what, and not descibing what the effect of the defeat had on World War II. Otherwise a good read on a great defeat of the British Empire by the Japanese Empire."},{"Title":"Ring of Fire: A Tribute to Johnny Cash","review":"This nice little package is a fitting tribute to the memory of Johnny Cash.

Revisar ese pasado intelectual compartido de M&eacute;xico y Estados Unidos nos lleva a a&ntilde;orar sus v&iacute;nculos y sus debates, la riqueza de sus intercambios culturales, el di&aacute;logo y la comunicaci&oacute;n que establec&iacute;an, intelectuales de ambos pa&iacute;ses: Dewey, Vasconcelos, Tennenbaum y Abreu G&oacute;mez, por ejemplo, en torno al de-bate sobre la educaci&oacute;n en las d&eacute;cadas de los a&ntilde;os veinte y treinta. Desde entonces, los intelectuales han entrado en un proceso de decadencia y esto coincide con el ocaso de la educaci&oacute;n en ambos pa&iacute;ses. La educaci&oacute;n p&uacute;blica en M&eacute;xico y en Estados Unidos vive un colapso permanente del que parece no poder salir nunca. Las elites se forman en los colegios privados desde los niveles b&aacute;sicos y hasta la universidad mientras que la escuela p&uacute;blica vive en condiciones lamentables. Cada vez hay menos lectores en M&eacute;xico y en Estados Unidos, las crisis econ&oacute;micas afec-tan directamente al mundo editorial, y la televisi&oacute;n se encarga de que cada vez se publiquen menos libros. Todo esto produce un deterioro intelectual en ambos pa&iacute;-ses, que coincide con la ca&iacute;da de puentes entre las comunidades de Estados Unidos y M&eacute;xico, la falta de un debate p&uacute;blico vigoroso y, por supuesto, el empobreci-miento de la cultura pol&iacute;tica. Los intelectuales, en general, han ido desapareciendo. En Estados Unidos han desaparecido de los espacios p&uacute;blicos pues todos se han atrincherado en las uni-versidades; en M&eacute;xico, al contrario, los intelectuales p&uacute;blicos abundan pero no hay quienes discuten con argumentos rigurosos los temas trascendentales. Abundan los \\"tigres de papel\\" que se ocupan de sus escaramuzas personales y se olvidan de sus quehaceres intelectuales. Los &uacute;nicos quienes han hecho que los mundos intelec-tuales de M&eacute;xico y Estados Unidos se toquen son Carlos Fuentes y Jorge Casta&ntilde;eda. Ambos han sido objeto de ataques y descalificaciones, m&aacute;s que por la diferencia ideol&oacute;gica, por la habilidad que tienen de comunicarse con el exterior. Detr&aacute;s de las cr&iacute;ticas, a la \\"visi&oacute;n distorsionada de M&eacute;xico\\" que ellos se encargan de di-vulgar por el mundo, est&aacute; la envidia y la impotencia que provoca a sus enemigos el hecho de que Casta&ntilde;eda y Fuentes puedan salir del pa&iacute;s a hablar y escribir para un p&uacute;blico extranjero. La gran paradoja es que los dos intelectuales mexicanos con presencia en Estados Unidos son de izquierda y, al mismo tiempo, los m&aacute;s naciona-listas y renuentes a estrechar los v&iacute;nculos entre los dos pa&iacute;ses. Todo esto da cuenta del gran deterioro social que sufren ambos pa&iacute;ses. Los par&aacute;metros universa-les de convivencia humana se han colapsado. El entendimiento, el di&aacute;logo, el reco-nocimiento y la cooperaci&oacute;n tienen que ser los elementos que tratemos de recons-truir al restaurar, tambi&eacute;n, los puentes entre mexicanos y norteamericanos. El es-pacio p&uacute;blico de ambas naciones debe renovarse. M&eacute;xico y Estados Unidos deben com-partir una &eacute;tica de conducta con responsabilidades comunes. El tendido de puentes entre M&eacute;xico y Estados Unidos y sus comunidades intelectuales es posible. Podemos buscar afinidades tender puentes y construir una identidad com&uacute;n. El tema del ocaso del trabajo intelectual en M&eacute;xico y en Estados Unidos es de una pertinencia absoluta. Es claro que las comunidades intelectuales de ambos pa&iacute;ses se han deteriorado y que esto coincide con el deterioro de la educaci&oacute;n. Los intelectuales estadounidenses y mexicanos se ocupan sistem&aacute;ticamente de sus ri&ntilde;as y sus odios y no pueden estar, de esta manera, a la altura de sus predeceso-res. La preocupaci&oacute;n por aparecer en los medios de comunicaci&oacute;n suple a la de dis-cutir lo trascendental. La degradaci&oacute;n del debate p&uacute;blico en ambas naciones es al-go preocupante y los problemas derivados de ella son graves y numerosos. Sin em-bargo la soluci&oacute;n que ofrece el autor, a la lacrimosa situaci&oacute;n intelectual y edu-cativa de ambos pa&iacute;ses, es la de estrechar los v&iacute;nculos perdidos entre M&eacute;xico y Estados Unidos. Aguilar Rivera dice que los intelectuales mexicanos deber&iacute;an \\"abrir\\" su discurso y su trabajo hacia Estados Unidos. Los intelectuales envidian a Fuentes y a Casta&ntilde;eda porque no son capaces de hablar y escribir como ellos: en perfecto ingl&eacute;s y en una l&iacute;nea cr&iacute;tica que pone el acento en las desigualdades en-tre ambos pa&iacute;ses. Imagino que quedan pendientes las respuestas a algunas preguntas obligadas: &iquest;por qu&eacute; con Estados Unidos?, &iquest;para qu&eacute; tender puentes intelectuales con ellos y no con otros?, &iquest;por qu&eacute; pensar en una identidad com&uacute;n y en la b&uacute;squeda de afinida-des?. Las contradicciones saltan de inmediato. Si Casta&ntilde;eda afirma que mejores re-laciones con Estados Unidos son \\"menos relaciones\\", &iquest;no ser&aacute; que es algo arriesga-do pensar que &eacute;l es uno de los art&iacute;fices del cambio y de la reuni&oacute;n de las comuni-dades intelectuales?. Si Carlos Fuentes y Casta&ntilde;eda son intelectuales m&aacute;s univer-sales que Krauze y Zaid &iquest;es porque dominan el ingl&eacute;s?, o porque se han criado, es-tudiado y trabajado en Estados Unidos. Excepto ellos dos en realidad \\"&iquest;todos can-tan igual?\\". Si \\"la mirada cr&iacute;tica, no la alabanza ni la reverencia, es el motor que mueve la inteligencia\\", &iquest;por qu&eacute; no hay una mirada cr&iacute;tica hacia Fuentes o Casta&ntilde;eda en su libro?, &iquest;por qu&eacute; pensarlos las v&iacute;ctimas de todo un sistema inte-lectual anquilosado y desconfiado hacia lo biling&uuml;e?. Creo que Aguilar Rivera no ha justificado sus pasiones con argumentos convincentes, ojal&aacute; y el libro hubiera seguido la l&iacute;nea de la primera parte. En la segunda parte cae, irremediablemente, en \\"el empobrecimiento del debate p&uacute;blico de M&eacute;xico y Estados Unidos\\" y toma par-tido en el \\"affaire Krauze\\" que tanto ha deteriorado el ambiente intelectual mexi-cano."},{"Title":"Life and times in Hopkinton, N.H","review":"I received this book in great condition, and swift service! Great Company! A+A+A+A+I have never had a problem with the service of Amazon service, and receiving my goods!"},{"Title":"Until the Final Hour","review":"I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. It was nice to get the collapse of the Third Reich from the perspective of a woman who was there...trapped in the bunker below the Reichs Chancellery as Berlin was being surrounded by Russian troops. Mrs. Junge's memoirs paint the distinct picture of a dying empire....and her memoirs go hand in hand with Joachim Fest's outstanding volume INSIDE HITLER'S BUNKER.One thing that I noticed as I was reading through the book was the complete spell that Hitler held over Junge, even though she was never a part of the National Socialist party or claimed to be a Nazi sympathizer in any way. The sheer magnetism of Hitler's personality and charm sucked her in....and until he died...she was hooked. Another point that Mrs. Junge brought up was how she was pretty much sheltered within Hitler's inner circle. Until the fall of the Reich, she had no real idea of the atrocities that were being committed by the National Socialists. It brings to light the enormity of the German government and the full scope of the empire....and how one department could be doing something so horrible...and possibly another department not even knowing about it. By the end of the war, the National Socialist government had grown into a huge bureaucracy where one could actually do as they pleased, possibly without the big-wigs in power knowing it, if they were extremely careful about it. Not to say that the Holocaust never happened, it most certainly did!, but it is interesting just to observe how Mrs. Junge was probably just one of many who had no idea of what evils were done in the name of their government and their country. This book just further exposes the sad history of a great people who are seduced by an evil genius and the guilt they will have to live with for a long time to come for their being so manipulated.This book is a really excellent read. It reads quickly and the translation from the German is hardly noticeable. Ms. Muller's introduction and epilogue really help to put Mrs. Junge's memoirs in perspective. Also, it is interesting to see how Traudl Junge came into Hitler's service and what happened to her after it was over. So, go out and read this...it is great!"},{"Title":"Until the Final Hour","review":"For any reader interested in Adolf Hitler as a person, not just as the ranting and raving dictator, Traudl Junge's account is the best resource available. Junge (nee Humps) was one of Hitler's private secretaries from the tenth anniversary of Hitler's coming to power to the dramatic fall of the Nazi regime just two and one half years later. During much of this time, Junge's duties were primarily social. Junge accompanied Hitler for meals and relaxation almost daily. She observed him in a way very few people did and was one of a minute number of Hitler's companions who survived the war to tell her story. She wrote her memoirs in 1947 and they were later published in Voices From the Bunker. I have read that book about four times and this edition once. Her account is as fascinating now as it was the first time I read it. Voices From the Bunker is one of my all-time favorite books.If you already have Voices From the Bunker and are wondering if this book is worth owning, I would say it is only if you are interested in Junge beyond her experiences with Hitler. This book includes more background information on her pre-Hitler life (I had not read before that her father had taken part in the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch) and a 30-page chapter written by Melissa Mueller in 2001 that follows Junge's post-war life chronologically. It would not be until the revisionist 1960s when people took an interest in her story. Otherwise, the bulk of the work is the same 1947 account in Voices. I've compared sections between the two books and, although they are not the same verbatim with a few minor details added or omitted, the account is basically the same. I like the way Voices is divided up better, with more chapters separating the story (i.e. The July Bomb Plot). It is more useful for looking up information than Until the Final Hour which is mostly one long chapter. Voices also includes accounts of Hitler's aides-de-camp Otto Guensche and pilot Hans Baur which this book does not offer. Until the Final Hour does have very interesting end notes with side tidbits and brief biographical information on many of the people Junge mentions.Junge died February 10, 2002, soon after the first German publication of her memoirs. Her memories were controversial in her homeland because her experiences with Hitler were pleasant. She knew him as a polite host and gentle father figure who showed compassion and human emotions (i.e. when he offered condolences to her after her husband died at the front). Only in brief snippets does she hint at the harsher side of the dictator. Hitler tries to hide his emotional explosions in meetings with his military officers. Frau von Schirach (wife of the head of the Hitler Youth) was no longer invited to be Hitler's guest after she voiced concern to him about trains full of deported Jews headed for Amsterdam (p. 88). Junge would finally become angry with Hitler when he gave up on the war and was accusatory to the end (Junge typed up his last demands and will). She, of course, kept such feelings of disappointment to herself. Her viewpoint is, admittedly, from an isolated world with one set of beliefs and a \\"puppet master\\" who controlled the day-to-day lives and thoughts of those around him. She describes Hitler's demeanor and routine at the Wolf's Lair (Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia), at the Berghof (his mountain retreat), and finally in the bunker as Berlin was being surrounded. She offers a unique perspective on many aspects of the dictator's life: his dietary habits, the attention he gave to his dog Blondi, his outlook on the war, his after-dinner small talk with such intimates as Eva Braun and important visitors like Albert Speer, Josef Goebbels, etc. Her account of the final days in the bunker with the Russian army drawing near is very moving. You almost feel like you were there."},{"Title":"Until the Final Hour","review":"A memoir as one of Hitler's private secretaries (from the first meeting in November 1942 through the end in April 1945). \\"Traudl\\" Junge was born Gertraud Humps. Later, with Hitler's encouragement, she married one of his orderies, Hans H. Junge in June of 1943. Hans Junge was killed in action on August 13, 1944. Though it all she continued working at Hitler's side and looked on him as a father figure. The book shows her interaction with Hitler along with his private side. She is able to give thumb nail sketches of his inner circle, as well. Mrs. Junge was present in the F&uuml;hrerbunker and describes the events therein. She typed Hitler's last will and political testament. She also heard \\"the shot\\" in which Hitler ended his life.The book is not meant to be a scholarly written book as to those times and events. It is interesting and gives the reader anecdotes and observations. The book is written mainly from the point of view of the (then) rather naive, non-political young woman who witnessed the decline and fall of both Hitler and Nazi Germany. A main source for the movie \\"Downfall\\".Footnote: Much of the information put forth in the book above was covered by Mrs. Junge in her contributions to: \\"Voices From the Bunker\\" by Pierre Galante. However, \\"Voices From the Bunker\\" was not quite as detailed overall and further did not include pre-Hitler and post-Hitler information as to Mrs. Junge's life."},{"Title":"Until the Final Hour","review":"The BossThis is a good book. It is good because it is honest. It is good because it looks through the eyes of a woman at a world dominated and usually described only by men. And it is good because it spreads a thin veil of pudeur over events that are today often shown in all their crass ugliness - such as the charred corpses of Saddam Hussein\`s sons.In her first serious professional position Traudl Junge became one of Hitler\`s personal secretaries and stayed with him for 30 months until his death. She tells us about him what she saw. To many of us, this may not be enough, many of us would like to be confirmed in our mental picture of a screaming, violent paranoid, apt at biting his carpet when things got rough - this is, after all, the way he has always been depicted, even long before the Second World War had broken out.The book makes us imagine him, in the presence of Traudl Junge, as a man with a mission and certainly very convincing when it came to that, but otherwise quite commonplace to the point of being somewhat boring, cloth-cap, muffler, and greyhound, quite literally, except that the greyhound would be a German shepherd, not much of a reader, and no longer in a mood to watch movies. He was able to hide his relationship with Eva Braun quite as efficiently as Franois Mitterand managed to cover his own liaison. Nothing that Traudl Junge tells us about him would have us think that he was anything of an inhibited Dr. Jekyll who would turn into a bloodthirsty Mr. Hide as soon as the padded doors of his office closed behind him.When Traudl Junge met Hitler, the tide of the war was starting to run against him. He was beginning to realize that he might not be able to achieve his aims. In this situation, he behaved as most of us would: he closed his eyes - partly so to avoid having to face the facts, partly in an effort to go against the sea-change and muster up all the forces that the German people could still mobilize.An interesting aspect of Traudl Junge\`s book is the fact that it was written down in its entirety within a few years of those momentous events, while her memories were still fresh and unaltered by the post-war political re-education that the Allies brought to bear on the German people. Thus, there was no need to incorporate any belated realizations into her account of what she had seen, no need to imagine behind facets of Hitler\`s behaviour events that later might have taken on a particular significance, no need to change her point of view and bend with the remover to remove scenes that she had observed.Even those things that the author does not express sometimes tell a story. We have been told repeatedly that Hitler loved to view in his private theatre the film showing the execution of the men who conspired against him a year before the end of the war. His secretary tells us nothing about that kind of thing, even though it is highly likely that Hitler - if the story were true - would have rounded up his inner circle to share his gloating pleasure.A special praise should go to Melissa M&uuml;ller who helped Traudl Junge with this book and who wrote an accompanying text that shows a high degree of empathy for the author and the times she describes.This book is not an account of what Hitler really was like\\", but it does show us what he could, at times, be like - at the hour of his death, for example."},{"Title":"Until the Final Hour","review":"At last a first hand description of daily working conditions and personal impressions of A.

When he's good, he's great, and he wins the Caldecott Award for best children's illustration. When he tries too hard, he's sly but opaque, clever but obscure. \\"Waffle,\\" for example, plays with concept at the expense of clarity, and the result is a disappointing mish-mosh. This book is on the heady side, but musically-inclined youngsters guided by a talented teacher, parent, or other adult will enjoy's Raschka's imaginative deconstruction/reconstruction of Coltrane's magnificent jazz piece.Raschka almost nails it with this visual and verbal description of saxophonist John Coltrane's incredible \\"Giant Steps,\\" a landmark number of dizzying complexity, speed, and joy that most energetic younsters would like on its own. However, much of the appeal lies in a very intellectual exercise requiring levels of abstract thinking and reading ability beyond most of the young audience who will be attracted to the picture book format. However, teenagers, pre-adolescents with a musical bent, and adults will appreciate Raschka sensitive evaluation of Coltrane's talent. Younger kids might like the colorful (although not vividly colorful) pictures, and the pictures of the raindrops, snowflake, and cat. However, these by themselves are not that appealing, and the song's \\"narration\\" is clever but not a very interesting story. That is why the book doesn't quite work for early elementary school-age kids reading it on their own.The most fascinating aspect of Raschka's \\"Giant Steps\\" is that he purposely draws the song all wrong! The book disappoints, and then tricks us, because Raschka knows exactly what he was doing. The cat narrator leads the shapes and colors in a visual performance of Coltrane's number, but the impression is, well, unimpressive. Even for a metaphor of Coltrane's music, the colors look blurry and the composition are unfocused.However, at a break in the performance (on pages 24 and 25), Raschka gently tells us that the preceeding images (by Raschka) were not quite right, were not Coltrane. The \\"performers\\" (and the reader) must understand that Coltrane was strong, yes, but \\"strong yet light.\\" The colors should be rich, not \\"muddy,\\" because \\"Coltrane's music is dense but transparent.\\" And while Coltrane did blow \\"a fountain of notes, a shower of notes...those notes made lines that were dynamic and strong and vivid.\\" In a remarkable performace of his own,. Raschka redraws the musical sequence to reflect these attributes, and this time he captures the rhythms, sounds, and energetic clarity of Coltrane. It's a masterful achievement, but I don't know how many kids will appreciate it. A dazzling, albeit puzzling, work that stands, as Ellington once said, \\"beyond category.\\""},{"Title":"John Coltrane's Giant Steps (Richard Jackson Books)","review":"We really liked reading John Coltrane's Giant Steps.

Listening to the music really helped us understand the book. Some of us wish that the author had given us the cd with the book. Others of us think it was great the way it was!Chris Raschka writes good books!"},{"Title":"John Coltrane's Giant Steps (Richard Jackson Books)","review":"When you review a picture book you have a responsibility to two kinds of consumers: The parents who buy the books and the children who read them. Now when I was a kid you probably could've handed me junky handwritten papers illustrated in crayon and I would've loved them. Children know what they do and do not like and it is the responsibility of their parents to choose well-written worthwhile books that will stand the test of time for their youngsters' brains. However, at the same time you don't want to be the kind of parent who only gets books for your kids that are \\"good' for them. I see these kinds of adults all the time. Unfortunate children are dragged to my library and forced to read books like \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" and \\"Treasure Island\\" which, while good, aren't the kinds of books that reluctant readers are instantly going to gravitate towards. The same goes for picture books. Sometimes I'll recommend a picture book that children may initially find dull or confusing simply because it's either a work of art or so well-written that I'm sure the children will grow to love it. Which brings me, in a definitely roundabout way, to \\"John Coltrane's Giant Steps\\". This is a book that undoubtedly seemed like a good idea when it was thought up. I mean, what could be cooler? You take a John Coltrane song and then using artist Chris Raschka's remarkable watercolor and inks show the song as a visual piece of work. The idea is sublime. The result is deathly dull and confusing for kids.If you are not familiar with \\"Giant Steps\\" the song, you may wish to listen to it as you read this book. The book begins with the words, \\"Good evening. And thank you for coming to our book. We have something very special for you tonight. It's John Coltrane's marvelous and tricky composition \`Giant Steps,' performed for you by a box, a snowflake, some raindrops, and a kitten. Why not stay and see it?\\". Why not indeed. The song begins well enough. The raindrops (featured as all blue or while within blue) provide the tempo. The box is the \\"foundation\\" or bottom. The snowflake is the harmony. Finally, the kitten is the melody. The song proceeds nicely enough until it collapses into a seething pile of confusion. The narrator chastises each element and corrects them (using a red colored pencil to circle faults and flaws). Helpful comments include lines like, \\"I know you're our foundation and you've got to be strong. But can you be strong yet light?\\". They try again with far better results and the book ends on a high (ha ha) note.I think I've figured out why the book doesn't work. It isn't just that Raschka has failed to include a cd of the song (a necessity). This is simply a book that has to be read with a cd that speaks to the reader and stops and starts the music perfectly with the book. Otherwise, there's no point in playing the song with this book when the text halts midway through to make corrections. Now I love Raschka's style, don't get me wrong. But the book would still be interesting to children if he'd gone so far as to make the kitten a little more realistic and a little less expressionistic.In a way, I feel that Chris Raschka just strove a little too hard. This book's a work of art, no question. But it's just not interesting to kids. I'm not saying the right kind of dedicated parent couldn't MAKE their kids interested in it. But this isn't the kind of picture book I see the kiddies pulling down off of the shelf to take home. Mostly, this is a book appreciated by adults who want their children to like jazz. Good luck with that. There are plenty of great jazz-based picture books out there, you know. \\"Ella Fitzgerald: The Tale of a Vocal Virtuoso\\", by Andrea Davis Pinkney is a fine example. But this is a picture book that will be loved by children over the age of 12. Just bear that in mind should you purchase it."},{"Title":"John Coltrane's Giant Steps (Richard Jackson Books)","review":"Chris Raschka has to be one of my favorite illustrators. Charlie Parker Played Be Bop, Yo! Yes?, a Caldecott Honoree, and Arlene Sardine are some of my favorite picture books of all time. But when I picked up John Coltrane's Giant Steps, things changed. Yes, Giant Steps is creative. Yes, it's gutsy. But on paper, 'Steps' falls flat on it's artsy face.The first pages of Giant Steps introduce us to 'a box, a snowflake, some raindrops, and a kitten', our performers. We are then told (while the 'performers are limbering up') about the Giant Steps' composer, a man by the name of John Coltrane. Afterwards the box, the snowflake, the raindrops, and the kitten begin their strange dance, blending their differing colors in 'harmony'. The performers carry on with their dance, by now leaving the young readers either confused or annoyed. Then the dance suddenly stops, and the narrorator corrects our dancers on their various mistakes. And then the dance begins again! *Sighs*I'm gonna take a stab in the dark and say that ninety-nine percent of children will not enjoy this book. The one percent (if that many) that will, have already heard of John Coltrane and his Giant Steps. The other ninety-nine, like I said before, will probably hate it, like I, myself did. Even Chris Raschka's paintings do little to distract the viewer from this terrible book! I'll admit that Giant Steps had a beautiful and creative premise, but it sadly falls into the cliche of 'Just because it sounds good, doesn't mean it'll look good on paper!'R, your friendly neighborhood reviewer."},{"Title":"John Coltrane's Giant Steps (Richard Jackson Books)","review":"&quot;Good evening.

This is Reti's magnum opus which has found its way onto nearly every master's &quot;desert island&quot; short-list. Reti analylizes the development of chess from the middle of the 19th century (Anderssen, Morphy &amp; Steinitz) through his own time (tragically, Reti died at 40 in 1929). Using particularly instructive games, he shows each of the great player's contributions to chess theory and gives the reader an insight into their style of play. The book is a huge 435 pages (in my Dover edition) and comprises 70 often deeply annotated games. As befits its date of publication, it is written in English Descriptive Notation. The quality of printing is rather poor -- many of the diagrams are dark and difficult to make out at a glance. There are also numerous translation errors as well. The German chess term for the Exchange (winning a Rook for Bishop or Knight) is Die Qualitat (umlaut over the a). In MOTCB,! the exchange is referred to as &quot;the quality&quot; on several occasions, a literal translation that does not make any chess sense. Despite these problems, this is a keeper. Buy it. Study it. Reread it every few years as your chess skills improve and wonder at everything you didn't really understand the first time through. It's that good."},{"Title":"Masters of the Chess Board","review":"Richard Reti shows the evolution of chess by analyzing games from great players from the past. In doing so, he also provides the reader with basic ideas on how to handle the opening, approach the development of pieces and confidently enter the middlegame. The contrast between the hypermoderns and classicists is also of interest and, in my opinion, a landmark in chess is represented by this book.The biographical notes are also interesting from the chess culture point of view. I love this book and consider worth having it in my personal library. Why 4 stars instead of 5? Because of the descriptive notation..."},{"Title":"Masters of the Chess Board","review":"This is a chess book that every collector should own as part of their chess library. It is one of the all-time classics. It was published by Dover and runs 436 pages in Descriptive notation. (If this book was ever republished in algebraic notation I would rate it 7 stars!!).It basically contains a sampling of master games from many of the greatest masters of all-time; Anderssen, Morphy, Steinitz, Tarrasch, Lasker, Schlechter, Pillsbury, Maroczy, Marshall, Rubenstein, Spielmann, Nimzowitsch, Vidmar, Tartakower, Capablanca, Bogoljubow, Alekhine, Grunfeld, Euwe, Saemisch, Colle, and Torre.Each chapter focuses on a different master in the order described above. There is a biographical sketch of each master at the beginning of each chapter as well. It focuses on a particular masters achievements and some of the unique ideas and methods that master brought to the game.There are a total of 70 very well annotated games.This book is not only a great games collection, but a virtual textbook on how to play the game. It thoroughly discussed many different opening systems, middle game strategies, and endgame topics.One thing I noticed was how many combinations originating from these games are used in so many tactics books such as 1001 winning chess combinations, or combination challenge. I have used those training books in the past - and now I know that they come from real games and who played them!This book has become very hard to find. My advice is this - if you can find this book in a used book store somewhere, don't hesitate. Grab the book, pay for it and get out of there fast before someone else finds the book. You will not regret buying this book.I rated it &quot;only&quot; 4 stars for a couple of reasons - 1)it is in descriptive notation (this book makes it worthwhile learning DN if you don't already know it) 2)Reti died before all of the chapters could be finished. Some of the later chapters in the book are not as thorough and interesting as the earlier ones. Some of the biographical details are left out.Even with the limitations mentioned above, there are few chess books as fun and instructive. Based upon the level of annotations in this book, players rated between 1,100 - 1,600 USCF would probably benefit the most. Players outside of that rating range would still enjoy playing over the games, but would not gain as much insight from the notes."},{"Title":"Masters of the Chess Board","review":"This is one of the most interesting training books on chess I've read. This books walks you through a history of chess theory from the mid 1850's to the late 1920's, teaching you the ideas while having you go through a selection of games explaining them.Almost all of the games are fantastic and the ideas are timeless. Reti is probably the greatest chess annotator of all time. This makes for a truly great 2nd book on chess (about the level of &quot;My System&quot;) for the desciplined reader. It can be too easy in the book however to miss subtle points that the games bring out, and since Reti died while writing it the book never reaches the climax. A strong recommendation for a classic"},{"Title":"Masters of the Chess Board","review":"This review is just to highlight to potential purchasers that the 2008 Ishi Press reprint is still in descriptive notation.

Widely regarded as one of the most stimulating books ever written on chess, its strategies and personalities, Masters of the Chess Board has both educated and enchanted generations of chess enthusiasts. Richard R&eacute;ti -one of the leaders of the hypermodern school of chess which rose to prominence in the 1920's - was a formidable over the board grandmaster as shown by his victories at the splendid tournaments of Kaschau 1918, Gothenburg 1920 and Teplitz Schonau 1922. His victims included Capablanca, Alekhine and Nimzowitsch, while his elegant destruction of Bogolyubov deservedly won the beauty prize at New York 1924."},{"Title":"Masters of the Chess Board","review":"This book is Reti's masterpiece and I consider it one of the finest chess books ever written. Reti died, in 1929 at the age of forty, just before its publication. In it he chronicles the development of chess with sketches of the game's greatest practicioners. In doing so, he analyzes some games played by these masters.The analysis has imperfections by today's computer aided standards, but this is not primarily an instructional book. Rather it is a work of literature wherein a great mind shares his love of chess with beautiful prose.Those seeking instruction of high quality from a contermporary of Reti might consider Grandmaster Aron Nimzovitch's \\"My System\\". It is entertaining and a classic on positional chess. And it is written in a lively and unique style."},{"Title":"Masters of the Chess Board","review":"Like his preceding book, Modern Ideas in Chess (1924), Reti's Masters of the Chessboard (pub. 1930) is a classic of 20th century chess literature that is still rewarding and instructive reading today. It should continue to remain required reading for students of the game. That Reti died young (before he could complete this book) is one of the great tragedies. But what he did write is golden - namely, perceptive chess biographies of the greats, from Anderssen and Morphy to Reti himself and Alekhine. He provides each of his subjects with a shrewd selection of sparklingly annotated and truly representative games. I've never read a chess book that is so effective in eliciting greater enthusiasm for its subject matter. Reti unerringly underscores the development of key chess concepts and ideas as exemplified in the contributions made by each of his masters -- particularly the slow but critical progress from purely combinative attacks towards an understanding of positional values. Throughout, the text remains a model of clarity and exposition. It is surprisingly easy to understand, even when explaining some profound concepts, for Reti never resorts to dumbing-down the instruction, as many others have done. The publishers are to be commended for bringing back the Dover edition in a new format. The use of the old descriptive notation did not bother me at all, as I was well acquainted with it. But it would have been worthwhile to learn it just to be able to enjoy this book and others in the Hardinge Simpole Chess Classic Series, such as the tournament books annnotated by Alexander Alekhine."},{"Title":"Masters of the Chess Board","review":"Richard Reti shows the evolution of chess by analyzing games from great players from the past.

The book will give you some idea of thedevelopment of the game. Other treatments that do this are Reti's 'New Ideas in Chess' and Euwe and Nunn's 'Development of Chess Style'. 'Masters of the Chessboard' was published circa 1930 and the raison d'etre for its publication was Reti's adverse reaction to writings of one Gutenmayer. To give one example of Reti's suspect analysis take his annotation to the immortal game (Anderson - Kieseritsky,1851), published in 'New Ideas in Chess'. This has been carefully demolished in Hubner's article 'The Immortal Game' published in the American Chess Journal (No.3). 20 pages of detailed analysis reveal the truth of the game in a way broad generalizations cannot. 'Masters of the Chessboard' won't radically improve your strength if you're already over 1500 USCF.

It blends very well with any book on the Seven Point Mind Training, the Way Of The Bodhisattva, The Tibetan Book of the Dead and the major sutras.

An example would be &quot;Q: What Kind of hat did the French teddy bear wear? A: A bear-et (beret).&quot; Most of the jokes are obvious enough that younger readers should be able to understand them but not all of them are going to be understood. Children who don't know who Abraham Lincoln are obviously won't get the joke. The jokes presented here though are ones that are similar to jokes that children tell each other all the time.

At first I thought I'd wasted money on this workbook because it follows the book. I figured I could have just recorded the tasks in a notebook and didn't really need this workbook to go along with it. Well you could do that but this workbook does make it much easier to keep track of everything. I didn't always have the Shape Up book handy to refer to and this workbook has everything in it so you can take it with you without having to take the Shape Up book. I would recommend reading the entire Shape Up book and then using this workbook with it.Here are the sections in this workbook:-Getting Started - listing the things you like about your body, the things you don't, things you want to work on, etc.-Exercises. Shows the various types of exercises you can do and how to do them.-To Do List-Self-Evaluation-Food and Menu Ideas (this section was great because he breaks foods down into the \\"A\\", \\"B\\", & \\"C\\" lists and lists the types of foods that fall into each category and then provides sample menus and some recipes)-Weeks 1-8. These pages allow you to record your goals for a day, food record, exercises for that day and has end-of-the-day questions.

Hope is great, but false hope for someone dealing with trama, is not. This book cannot answer the questions as to why a person in mentally sick and so forth. It instills a false sense of relating to the world. Im a therapist, so my opinion should account for something."},{"Title":"The Awakened Heart","review":"The author uses this book to express his narrowminded simplistic theories. The author uses the word \\"addiction\\" very loosely and is anti-12 step claiming that throngs of people have searched for problems in their life so that they can join the \\"recovering masses\\" as if needing to save ones' life from early demise due to alcoholism or drug addiction is some sort of fad. The author does not provide any data to support his broad claims. I'm glad I bought it used and did not pay for shipping. I'm putting it in the recycling bin."},{"Title":"The Awakened Heart","review":"It happens that sometimes in moments of silence, honesty and surrender we become aware of our deep desire for love - both to love and to be loved. This deep desire is our true nature and it is God's life in us. This is May's simple thesis. The power and beauty of his book is that he unabashedly celebrates this love and slowly gets us to become aware of and appreciate its presence and also to recognize the ways we seek to stifle it or twist it or run away from it and some of the reasons why we do this. Like his other works, May here again blends his unique experiences of prayer and psychology into a touching re-affirmation of our heart's basic goodness. His book opens an inner door to a greater trust in the instincts, intuitions and spontaneous acts of love that arise from that sacred space. How courageous for a man to write about and value the apparent &quot;weaknesses&quot; and &quot;vulnerabilities&quot; of love in a time when the &quot;virtues&quot; of efficiency and action are so exalted. By now, having read most of his works, I feel like a friend. And so as a friend, I say, thank-you Jerry."},{"Title":"The Awakened Heart","review":"This is one of the wisest books I have ever read.

Absolutely amazing book in it's simplicity and beauty."},{"Title":"The Awakened Heart","review":"What a deeply enriching book! I have had to read it a few pages at a time to savor and feel my way through what is being said.

It was none of that, but it did help me open up to Love -- the greater love for life, for people, and especially for myself and God.This book was not an easy read, but it was worth it. While reading, little light bulbs went on in my mind as several realizations became clear and obvious. I've read a great deal of spiritual material before, and had become almost against the word 'God' because it connotes a judgmental creature looking down upon us. This book does not go into \\"defining\\" God, but refers to the term a lot. As a result, I was able to return to being okay with the word and really feel what Gerald May was talking about.It was really worth the money, and it's one of those books that you read 2 years later and realize how much deeper is becomes the next time around."},{"Title":"The Awakened Heart","review":"This was not a book I could read without stopping.

My favorite is his first book Simply Sane. It can be re-read and contemplated for years. He has a very important broader point to make about the self identification as a person always needing \\"recovery\\"...or \\"improvement\\". This is totally beside the point of treating or addressing physical/chemical addictions.

Only one of these authors somewhat accepts the thesis of Northern material superiority. These authors are far more mindful of the fact that mismanagement or deep-seated flaws within the losing side of a conflict can be larger factors in the ultimate outcome than positive actions by the winning side.The authors all note some inherent advantages of the South: a need to only defend territory, the vastness of the South, a transportation network, the ability to produce large quantities of foodstuffs, a commodity, cotton, of great value in the international market, a huge labor force of three million slaves, and a certain psychological advantage in the defense of a way of life.But these authors discuss any number of factors that led, not necessarily inevitably, to the defeat of the South. The authors point mostly to both military and political malfeasance, as well as personalities and inherent characteristics of Southern society, as leading to defeat. The manner of financing of the War produced tremendous inflation; the supplies of cotton were mismanaged both as a source of revenue to fund the war effort and as a tool to force European nations to recognize the Confederacy; food supplies were confiscated at below market prices; and manpower was poorly utilized both in recruitment to the Southern army and in the deployment of labor on Southern farms.The states rights and independent political stance of Southerners seemed to prevent a coherent national posture being formulated in winning the Civil War. One of the authors points to the anti-statist views of all Southerners as interfering with producing a disciplined army. Southern units elected their superior officers and were disinclined to follow orders with which they disagreed. In contrast to this aggressive independence, some of the authors point to a general weakening of the Southern psychological state and even a &quot;loss of nerve.&quot; The Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, is viewed by one author as a huge factor in the defeat of the South. Davis incompetently micromanaged the war effort, pursued flawed economic strategies, was personally difficult to engage, and exhibited an ineffectual indecisiveness and conservatism in times needing forceful and visionary actions. But the one-party system in the South prevented the rise of an effective opposition that could have addressed the original poor choice of President.Beyond any material advantage, the authors generally contend that Lincoln and Grant were trump cards for the North. Both were better suited to their jobs both in temperament and competency than anyone in the South. Some would almost suggest that Lincoln and Grant being on the Southern side could have reversed the result.This book was reissued in 1996 after first appearing in 1960, but it is as readable and relevant as anything being written today. There is some overlap in the material covered in the essays, but the ideas are interesting and challenging. You won't see all of these ideas in a general book on the Civil War."},{"Title":"Why the North won the Civil War (Collier Books)","review":"This is a slim book (approximately 124 pages) that contains essays by different writers who each examine a major factor that contributed to the South losing the Civil War. Although in hindsight it appears that the South was doomed to lose, in reality, it was a close contest that literally could have been won by either side. Although the North had significant material advantages, the authors point out internal factors and decisions made (or not made) by the South that contributed greatly to it's eventual defeat. This book, although originally published nearly 50 years ago, remains surprisingly relevant and thought-provoking today.As an interesting aside, the forward to the book was written by retired Major General U. S. Grant III, the grandson of Union General (and later President) U. S. Grant."},{"Title":"Why the North won the Civil War (Collier Books)","review":"Half a century ago some of the nation's leading Civil War era historians put together this collection of essays seeking to explain, from a variety of perspectives (economic, military, political, diplomatic), why the North prevailed in the epic contest of wills between the states. We have arrived at the sesquicentennial of the great conflict and yet the insights and arguments found in \\"Why the North Won the Civil War\\" have lost little of their cogency.Many could (and have) argue that the southern cause was doomed from the start. Richard Current makes this conventional case in his contribution \\"God and the Strongest Battalions.\\" In short, he maintains that northern victory was practically guaranteed owing to the Union's insuperable advantages in manpower (2.5 times the south), capital (4 times larger), and industrial output (an order of magnitude greater), among other areas of comparative strength. Sure the Confederacy made mistakes, Jefferson Davis and Treasury Secretary Christopher Memminger could have crafted better policies, but the ability to overcome the South's economic handicaps went far beyond the power of any man or group of men, Current (and many others) argue.But is that a fair and complete view of the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the competing sides? Did not the American colonists and Vietnamese communists face longer odds in their improbable quests for independence? Did not the Confederacy hold the advantage of interior lines, a long and difficult to blockade coastline, some of the best military officers of the war, a three-million strong involuntary labor pool (i.e. slaves), great natural defenses, and the strategic advantage of being able to win simply by not losing? If neither northern victory nor southern defeat were foreordained, then how to explain the defeat?The essays by T. Harry Williams and David M. Potter reviewing military strategy and the political leadership of Jefferson Davis, respectively, are learned and forcefully argued, but hardly make a convincing monocausal explanation for the South's defeat. Nevertheless, Williams' essay in particular is a gem and recommended to any student of nineteenth century military history. He stresses that Jominian thinking was dominant among the West Point trained officers on both sides of the conflict and it is no accident that two of the three great generals in the war (Lee, Grant and Sherman by his calculation) were northerners who eschewed the Napoleonic concept, Grant even claimed that he had never read Jomini. Rather, the North's two leading commanders embraced a more Clausewitzean approach of total war, seeking the destruction of the main enemy army wherever it may be found through withering preponderance of force, not a victory of maneuver through superior planning and the capture of critical physical locations as dictated by Jomini.The most convincing essay, I found, was the largely contrarian contribution by David Herbert Donald, \\"Died of Democracy,\\" which argues ironically that the true weakness of the Confederacy was an unwavering commitment to democracy and individualism. He compares and contrasts the democratic/libertarian South to the often dictatorial North. For example, the South continued to elect non-commissioned officers and junior officers throughout the war and many men and entire units refused orders they disagreed with or simply didn't find personally satisfying. The North, on the other hand, had mostly cooperative, professional troops, especially the large percentage that were recent European immigrants and freed slaves. The South retained freedom of the press throughout the war and only briefly and locally suspended habeas corpus three times. In contrast, over 300 northern newspapers were shut down during the war and Lincoln suspended habeas corpus throughout the Union. The South claimed to be fighting for \\"states rights\\" and individual states that made up the Confederacy were just as jealous of their local prerogatives under the new southern form of government as they were under the Union, Donald maintains. It was this dynamic - the North, acting like a pack of dogs in their fight against the South, acting like a group of feral cats - that was the ultimate cause of Union victory and Confederate defeat, and its a theme that Potter further develops in his essay, showing how a collection of fiercely independent states with no two-party system could effectively develop a national policy on how to best leverage the power of \\"King Cotton\\" or raise revenue for the war effort through some form of national taxation or allocate the use of the captive slave population to fight the war. All of these potential war power policies were neglected in the face of state and individual property rights that made up the intellectual foundation of secession in the eyes of the South's political leadership.All told, this is a nice complement to any Civil War library."},{"Title":"Why the North won the Civil War (Collier Books)","review":"I was required to read this for a military history class, and as usual the professor chose a great read. Some people said it was hard to read & identify the theses of the essays due to the length, but I didn't find it a hard read & the arguments are fairly easy to identify since they cover different topics: the 1st essay being an overview & the remaining 5 covering the social, economic, political, military, and diplomatic aspects of the conflict.Despite somewhat hard read, most found it enjoyable.

The civil war does not represent a subject of great interest to me. Americans, killing Americans is basically depressing. This book, though, I find fascinating. It is a concise examination of how organizations, the military, people, governments work. If you are a student of human nature, you will enjoy it. I continue to pick the book up, and will open to any page and reread passages that stimulate thought. For a civil war \\"buff\\", it will place you in deep waters illuminating why things turned out the way they did."},{"Title":"Why the North won the Civil War (Collier Books)","review":"I have used this space over the past couple of years to commemorate many events important in working class history, leftist history and just plain democratic history (hey, that is our heritage too). My idea, as explained in my profile, is to try to transmit to the younger generation of leftist militants a sense of the rich, if many times negative, history of our movement. With that in mind, I have noticed recently that while I have spilled a certain amount of justifiable ink on honoring John Brown and his band at Harper's Ferry and on the personage of Abraham Lincoln, also justifiable, I have not spent nearly enough time on some of the other great issues of the Civil War period itself. I begin to rectify that error here. And it is an error. A lot of what the United States have become in the world, for good or evil, stems from the events of that period.Some of the books that I review in this space as I introduce subjects that I think will be of interest are those that first got me interested in the subject. Thus, the books tend to have older copyright dates and, in many cases, have been superseded by more recent (and generally, better) work on the subject. But I still see value in them as a starting point. That is the case here. I distinctly remember, after having gone through the basics of the American Civil War in my high school history class, going out to buy this book in order to better understand the question posed by the title of this book- why did the North win the Civil War? Although this book does not directly address some of the reasons that I would give now for why the North succeeded it nevertheless gave some, to me, provocative thoughts about the issues then.This short book is a result of a conference held in the late 1950's at Gettysburg, in preparation for celebrating the Civil War Centennial, which discussed various historical points of view as to the basis for the Northern victory. Now there have been innumerable books on every conceivable aspect of the Civil War, from songs to sewing, so by this year 2008 so it is hard to say that this book sticks out. However this book represented the best thinking of the last generation of Civil War scholars on the general trends of the times. The subjects delved into-Northern and Southern economics, generalmanship, diplomacy, effects of war- weariness, Southern character defects have all been expanded on since. But here is a place to start an outline of the subject. This book also helps to understand one of the positive consequences of the Northern victory-the consolidation of a unitary trans-continental state. Of course, readers, let us keep our eyes on the prize- the real import of studying about the Civil War is to see how the great social issue of that day-the abolition of slavery got fought out to the finish. For that we need to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Why the North won the Civil War (Collier Books)","review":"The book is good for anyone who wants a quick understanding of certain possibilities of why the North won.

I am only in my mid 20's and I can relate to many of the experiences described in this book. It's a very quick read as well. If I could give it 100 stars I would. For those readers who complained about the length of the book, yes it is a quick read but the book only costs 10 dollars.

However, it appears that Mr. Lewis was banking on the success of that book when he hurriedly put together this short memoir of a high school baseball coach that seemingly impacted his life in great ways. Mr. Lewis manages to package that nice story up in barley 70 pages.The thought was nice, however, it very much lacked any kind of character development and real substance. Just as we get to meet his \\"Coach\\" the book is almost over.This is a nice little read that you could get through in an hour or less, however, if you have a hearty appetite and want to sink your teeth into a meaty book, this is not for you. Skip it and read Tuesday's With Morrie."},{"Title":"Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life","review":"I'm a little confused by this book.It's the third one I've read by Mr. Lewis (and I've seen movie adaptations of two others), but even considering the subject matter and what it meant to him, it just doesn't have the usual 'oomph'.This book is about his beloved high school coach, 'Fitz', but it's more a truncated polemic about misplaced societal values, how 'entitlement' has taken us away from those values, and about parenting that's not quite rooted correctly and clearly not executed in the best way imaginable.While well-intentioned, I believe that what the author set out to do could have been better accomplished either in a long-form essay...or a book using 'Fitz' as the touchstone and go-to reference throughout, but incorporating much more from modern American life that illustrates what he's maintaining.As a final stab, I really don't think that the message was relayed as poetically as it deserved."},{"Title":"Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life","review":"I would suggest this book to anyone who likes sports and a beneficial lesson. Coach is a fast read but has very descriptive language. This book is about a man named Billy Fitzgerald who was a basketball and baseball coach at Newman, a school in New Orleans. He was nicknamed Coach Fitz.The conflict of Coach is the naming of a gym. The parents of Coach Fitz's current and recent players highly oppose naming the gym after Coach Fitz. However his former players from about 10+ years ago highly recommend naming the gym after him. Coach Fitz is a very tough coach because he pushes kids to their limits to show them what they can do. The former players have used this lesson to apply to other aspects of their lives. At the time the kids were getting pushed, they thought he was just a tough coach so they didn't realize what he was doing for them.For example, Michael Lewis recalled that after a winless start to their baseball season, Coach Fitz made the team practice sliding into third base head first after a game. They didn't slide properly in a game, so Coach Fitz got mad. They slid until the entire team was muddy and blood covered. They weren't allowed to wash their jerseys until they won. With that motivation, they finally won. The parents of the current and recent players got frustrated with Coach Fitz when he did things like this so he was prevented from doing them again. With these restrictions, Coach Fitz was not able to teach the lessons of perseverance, diligence and pushing limits.Reading Coach made me realize why people such as parents, teachers and coaches could be so tough. For example, last year I had a really tough math teacher but when I took the regents I was prepared and now understand why I was pushed so hard."},{"Title":"Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life","review":"I understand completely, and Michael Lewis articulates gracefully and masterfully what it means to have a coach who is a life force driving you to be your best self beyond the specifics of any sport.

I highly recommend this book to those either in the midst of or contemplating raising children."},{"Title":"Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life","review":"One does wonder why Mr. Lewis allowed a great article to be transformed into a razor thin volume, augmented with a few pictures. Hopefully his superb article on the California recall election in 2003 won't be packaged as a hardcover in the near future. Then again, pictures of Arnold Schwarzenegger will surely move many copies.The profile of Coach Fitz feels rather incomplete, relying almost solely on the author's own memory and its conflict with the current win-at-all-costs mentality of today's parents. If there is a real story to be had here it is the increasing social acceptability of parents as hyper-advocates for their children in school, sports, and pretty much any artistic or creative endeavor. That is a subject that deserves book-length treatment (and not just a hardcover pamphlet, either).Assuming that readers of \\"Moneyball\\" haven't yet done so, they would do well to pick up \\"Liar's Poker\\" instead of this book."},{"Title":"Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life","review":"Michael Lewis has written a very brief memoir in which he remembers the importance that his baseball coach had on his life by expressing confidence in Lewis, looks into the influence that Coach Fitz had on a few other plays and uncovers the unwillingness of today's parents to let the coach \\"make men out of boys\\".The high point for me in this book had nothing to do with Mr. Lewis or the book. I simply found myself day dreaming about a coach who had a similar influence on me, Coach Joe Page of Pacific High School in San Bernardino, California. Coach Page was Lee Marvin's cousin and looked like him except Coach Page had an even meaner expression on his face. He had our attention before he opened his mouth. When he spoke, our hearts palpitated. And he expected us to accomplish great things. And we surprised ourselves by how well we did. I was more proud of my A in Coach Page's class than I was in becoming a valedictorian of my class. I haven't been in as good a physical shape since then. Coach Page also taught me lifeguard skills which I wouldn't have learned otherwise. I've been much more confident around the water ever since.Coach Fitz was a coach of the same style . . . expecting and demanding that everyone give their all. I would have liked to have heard more about Coach Fitz in the book. But there's too little.The story about Mr. Lewis is a pretty good one. But there aren't enough stories about other athletes.And the description of current parents and their children would have been more impressive if the parents had had their say. As a defense, I suspect that this book won't make the grade. Many who read this book will say that Coach Fitz should go. That wasn't Mr. Lewis's intent, but it may well be his effect.Other than reminding me of Coach Page, I'm sorry that I read this book. It didn't deserve to be published in my judgment . . . although Coach Fitz sounds like someone who should have a good biography written about him.I was most disappointed by the photographs which rarely contain images of the coach or the people mentioned in the book."},{"Title":"Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life","review":"As has been noted, this \\"book\\" is basically a New York Times Magazine article. Though the story of a coach now having to deal with spoiled players is interesting, don't bother with this one if you are looking for a long read. The claimed 93 pages is for a 7\\" by 5\\" book that's double spaced and includes 25 pages of pictures leaving 68 pages of text.The story was interesting, but ended without any real conclusion or resolution.

Michael Lewis puts together a touching work that causes the reader to stop and think.Every athlete and their parents should be required to read this book. I know my baseball players will be!"},{"Title":"Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life","review":"Despite the fact that I am always fascinated by whatever Michael Lewis writes about, I had not planned to read Coach. In the bookstore, it looked like one of those \\"inspirational\\" books they stock at the checkout counter, next to the gift books about angels and cats.But then I heard an interview with Lewis on NPR radio. The book was originally a magazine article in the New York Times Magazine. He summarized the story in a few minutes. A coach he had at his prep school (I didn't even catch what sport Lewis was playing) had changed his life by treating him, in a critical moment in a must-win game, as if he was the clutch player Lewis and every other kid dreams of being. Lewis rose to the occasion and the confidence he gained from the experience radiated to his academic work and beyond. But now, twenty-some years later, the parents at the private school are pressuring the headmaster to oust the coach. They say his heavy-handed ways are hurting their kids' self-esteem. Lewis ended his radio summary by revealing that publicity from the New York Times article had resulted in the coach keeping his job, although the school was now looking for a new headmaster.What a great story. It was short and had conflict as well as a satisfying ending. But then I read the book, which is simply the article, unchanged.In it, the coach has a temper that seems uncontrolled and frightening, even to the adult Lewis. Coach takes a second-place trophy his team won and smashes it on the locker room floor, indicating his disgust at not winning first. He refuses to drive home when the team has lost, obsessively walking miles through New Orleans at night (yikes) to punish himself for being a loser. When the team doesn't hustle enough, he makes them practice sliding headfirst on concrete-hard dirt until they are bloody and bruised.Lewis's interviews with former students of the coach sound like Stockholm Syndrome sufferers, people who've been kidnapped and held hostage but come to sympathize with their captors. The former players speak with admiration as they describe how Coach intimidated them. Lewis tells of being on the mound in another clutch situation as Coach shouts ridicule at him from the dugout, distracting him enough so that he misses a grounder that hits him in the face, causing him to black out. But when Lewis regains consciousness, he loves Coach, just as Winston loved Big Brother.Lewis mentions that when he was a young pitcher, the coach had him put Ben Gay on the bill of his cap, to use for spitballs when his fastball wasn't doing the trick. I'm not familiar with prep league play, but isn't throwing a spitball against the rules? The more I read, the less I admired the coach.As usual, Lewis's writing is compelling, and once you start Coach, you won't be able to put it down. You just may not find it as inspiring as Lewis meant it to be."},{"Title":"Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life","review":"Lewis makes a remarkable statement: a person is not born with selfrespect, but earns it. A struggle to overcome fear and failure is necessary. There are those that try to instill these beliefs on children, even though the lesson is not appreciated immediately in their youth and the profoundly positive impact is not understood until later in life. This is what the book is about.Lewis' high school coach drives them hard. The kids don't understand why initially. Over time, they learn that through hard work they can achieve their goals--not just in athletics.Casual readers, based on earlier reviews, seem to think that the coach is obsessed with winning; they miss the point (just as Lewis did when he was in 7th grade). Lewis talks about a season when the team was 1-12: The coaches frustration is not with the win-loss record, but that they kids possess the drive to improve and compete. He is not preparing them to win baseball games, but obtain their goals for years to come in life.The book is a criticism of a growing opinion among parents that kids are born with respect, instead of needing to develop it. Achievement builds selfrespect, not conception. Parents should be exposing their children to fear and failure to allow them to overcome these obstacles instead of protecting them from it.The touching element is that a successful author living comfortably in the Bay area champions someone that people no longer believe in, because this person championed him when nobody, including Lewis, believed in himself. It is the ultimate strength of character that Lewis' coach successfully cultivated in Lewis and others.As a subscriber to the New York Times, I get the magazine. Unfortunately I did not see this article when it was published. To say a book that is a reprint of an article does not have merit is to foolishly presume that everyone gets the Times and has the time every Sunday to devour it. A reprint of an article takes a concept from a select few to the masses. Shame on those who do not appreciate this."},{"Title":"Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life","review":"I differ with previous reviews lamenting the brevity of the book. Obviously, adults reading the book were thinking in terms of adults. I read the book thinking about my 12-year old grandson and felt it was a perfect book to send him at this stage in his life.This is exactly the type of book you would want to send your grandchildren or have your own children read.It sends a powerful message and being written by someone having been coached by this person at the age of 13 makes it even more valid.It may be short, but that's the beauty of it. It keeps your interest, gets the point across and leaves you wishing for more or better yet, offers the opportunity for discussion with young adults."},{"Title":"Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life","review":"Best selling author (Moneyball, Liar's Poker, and the New New Thing), Michael Lewis has written a little (90 pages) jewel with \\"Coach.\\" Lewis reflects on his life at Isidore Newman School and the impact that his baseball coach and teacher, Billy \\"Fitz\\" Fitzgerald, had in shaping his life.Fitz entered Lewis's mind at age 12 and has stayed there ever since. Think about that rare teacher or coach that has stayed with you into your adult life; reminisce with Lewis as he rediscovers the attributes of this relationship and its impact on his life.Lewis's catalyst for this book was hearing that a former player was organizing an effort to remodel the old school gym and have it named after Fitz. Current players and their parents were doing all they could to persuade the headmaster to get rid of Fitz, while at the same time, cash was pouring in from former players and their parents.This conflict allows Lewis to contrast a time when Fitz worked tirelessly to give his boys a sense that their lives could be something other than ordinary with a time - today - when values and character are less important. Fitz's effectiveness ended when he could not adapt to the change - the culture of \\"kids being bestowed with a sense of self-esteem at birth.\\"The system of values he attempted to instill is no longer in alignment the parents nor with the culture. His system is no longer wanted - it is not \\"in\\" - and is no longer tolerated.

He did not disappoint. It is a brief, almost essay-like book that gives us snapshots of his coach and himself that reveal worlds about life, coaches, athletes, parents and rising to meet the challenge.He contrasts very effectively the experience he had with the experience of present-day players, and sets the coach and his ways in graphic relief against both. His admiration for his coach comes through the telling of the story, and not through a simple list of his accomplishments.The book does give important lessons on the game of life, thus fulfilling the promise of its' title.One of the book's strengths is also a weakness. It is too brief! This will make it more easily accessible for many, but this reader was left wishing for more...but isn't that the grand goal of most good authors?

COACH is the storyof the author's coach when he was in high school who now--becausehe hasn't changed his approach--isn't completely understood byhis players or their parents . . . in fact, many even want tosee him replaced.And that's a shame because as Lewis notes, [he was] \\"a man tryingto give boys a sense that their lives could be something other thanordinary.\\"Others have that same opinion, too, including Peyton Manning whomight be the highest-paid player in pro football:\\"As far as the respect and admiration I feel for the man, I couldn't putit into words. Just incredibly strong. For me, personally, he prepared mefor so much of what I faced at the college and pro level. Unlike somecoaches--for whom it's all about winning and losing--Coach Fitz wastrying to make men out of people. I think he prepares you for life. And, ifyou want my opinion, the people who are screwing up high school sportsare the parents. The parents who want their son to be the next MichaelJordan. Or the parent who beats up the coach, or gets into a fight in thestands. Here's a coach who is so intense. Yet he's never laid a handon anybody.\\"My only complaint about COACH is that it is quite short--only91 pages, in fact, in a 5\\" x 7\\" format . . . it left me wanting to readmore about Lewis' high school days and how he describedthem . . . such as in the following passage:Graduating from Babe Ruth to the varsity with only the slightest physicaljustification ( I now resembled less a scoop of vanilla ice cream than arounder Hobbit) meant coping with an out-of-control hormonal arms race.A few of our players had sprouted sideburns; but the enemy retaliatedby growing terrifying little goatees and showing up at games with wivesand, on one shocking occasion, children. I still had no muscles, and nofacial hair, but I did have my own odor. I smelled, pretty much all the time,like Ben-Gay. I wore the stuff on my perpetually sore right shoulder andelbow. I wore it, also, on the bill of my cap, where Fitz had taught meto put it, to generate the grease for a spitball that might just compensatefor my pathetic fastball. Everywhere I went that year, I emitted a vaguelymedicinal vapor; and it is the smell of Ben-Gay I associate with whathappened next."},{"Title":"Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life","review":"Michael Lewis has combined a healthy curiosity about how organizations behave with an engaging narrative style to produce the eye-opening Liar's Poker, Moneyball and New, New Thing, among other books.In this short portrait of his high-school baseball coach, Lewis merges a study of that individual with an affirmation of the effect of his values on the boys who played on his baseball team at a toney prep school, along with an essay as to why such a manly, hard-core method is pretty much forbidden by the realities of parental pressure today.The book fundamentally expresses gratitude for the author's good fortune to have been at an elite high school in a spartan era. It does not fully explain the basic motivation of the coach, but leaves a melancholy impression that his type of dinosaur is needed now more than ever, just when the system seeks something different."},{"Title":"Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life","review":"I read this after finishing Michael Lewis' The Blind Side.

Was Fitz a positive impact on his life? Michael says so, but I struggled to understand why. Here was a coach who apparently believed in him by putting him in the game to pitch in a crucial situation. Or maybe the only reason he entered the game was because Fitz accidentally visited the star pitcher twice in the same inning and so was compelled to take the star out and put Michael in.Fitz was an intense coach and apparently was able to convince his team (at least back in the 70's) that hard work could pay off. I guess this was one of the \\"Lessons on the Game of Life\\". Coach Fitz said he cared about the kids but it wasn't clear from any of the stories that any of the kids thought the coach cared about them.Maybe the truth is that Coach Fitz was most concerned about winning. The author remembers most clearly all the things Fitz broke in the locker room after losses. Coach Fitz would walk home after losses to punish himself for the players sins. The players were not allowed to wash their jerseys until they won. I guess they weren't being the best they could be until they scored more runs than their opponent. Winning was also more important to Coach Fitz than following the rules, as he apparently encouraged the author to throw illegal \\"spitballs\\".For coaches looking for coaching models, I recommend NFHS Coaches' Quarterly."},{"Title":"Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life","review":"I know. I know. I read the magazine article too. I was a bit disappointed that the book did not expand more on the story. It's a short, quick read. It does provide an emotionally satisfying lift as we observe Coach Fitz go through the travails of dealing with teen-age athletes and their doting and obnoxious (for the most part) parents.I had a real problem with the photography in this book. Now, I understand that a full-page photograph was probably necessary to fill-out this book. As it is, with all the photos, it's still less than ninety pages. The photos, though, are mis-guided, ham-handed shots of kids staring of into space, kids in repose, kids....doing nothing at all, really. Certainly not in relation to what is going on in the book. There are a couple of shots of Coach Fitz and one of the author in his high school days. Those are fine. The rest just seem like stock shots, used to fill the rest of the book up. It was distracting to me.Worth a read. Probably be in the bargain bins in a couple of months, though. Kind of like chinese food - no matter how good it is, you're hungry two hours later."},{"Title":"Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life","review":"What a disappointment. Lewis, the author of several memorable books, has aapparently succummed to the temptation to make a few bucks off his name. This extremely short book ( I didn't pay enough attention to the details in the Amazon listing )is also extremely shallow, about his high school coach and the effect that coach had on his life. The book may have been a passable magazine article somewhere ( Oh, now I read some of the other Customer Reviews, and I see it was a NY Times Mag article ), but it certainly falls way short in the \\"book\\" category. Interestingly, Lewis writes this rip off book about his coach who constantly preached about not taking the shortcuts, and that the guys would not be rewarded by doing such.

That disparity, together with various physical afflictions, weighed on him and led him to withdraw from society, and just about everything else, to write. Write he did, for the thirteen years after 1909, grinding out the seven volumes of his \\"In Search of Lost Time,\\" unfortunately without useful editing. His first publisher was a vanity press.\\"In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower,\\" the second volume in the series, uses the experiences of the author's adolescence to reflect on art, desire, sexuality, death, irony, the force of sense impressions, and of course memory. Much of the text is enlivened or burdened, depending on the reader's point of view, with detailed descriptions of life in 19th century upper class French society. Proust also devotes tons of ink to Darwin-like observations of the behavior of homo sapiens. There are recurring characters to be sure -- the narrator, seemingly Proust himself, and his family (his diplomat father, his upper class mother, and his adored grandmother); the Swann family (upper class Charles, his actress wife Odette, once a widely desired demimondaine, and their coquettish daughter Gilberte); the aristocratic Guermantes family (Mme. de Villeparisis, her nephew the Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray, and the sexually avaricious Baron de Charlus), and the financially strapped Albertine Simonet and her aunt -- but they are typically seen, not through the usual stuff of character development (their actions and words), but rather through the narrator's minute observations of them and his reflections on what he observes. This makes for a good bit of interior monologue, punctuated, as in the case of an attempted seduction and the dissection of a high school graduation essay, by brief bits of Dickensian humor. My friend Richard Epstein, who has taught and himself contributed to the best writing in the English language, compares Proust to Faulkner and Joyce. Interior monologue is an acquired taste. This much is certain. If you like John Grisham or urban fiction, you probably won't enjoy \\"In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower.\\"For my taste, the text is unwieldy, the sentences elaborate beyond belief, the worthwhile observations, humor, and social commentary buried in an avalanche of words, the references to French history and art bordering on the obscure. I wanted to enjoy the novel. I wanted to appreciate the manners. Lord knows I wanted the narrator to get the girl -- any girl -- but when the going got tough, I almost put the book down and got going."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"Without a doubt, this is the best piece of literature I've ever had the pleasure to read. Proust constantly amazes me with his talent for exploring life and all it's intricacies and illusions. You'll be blown away by the depth and truth of this masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"Reading Proust is like drinking good tea. You don't get drunk quickly and don't get fed up quickly.\\"Within a Budding Grove\\" is a fairly Artsy & Crafty translation of \\"A l'ombre de jeunes filles en fleur\\". It is half way between a novel and a meditation on time, love, writing, painting. The descriptions are beautiful and we get sucked into the Proust universe.I like this story so well, I prepared an adaption of it with the gender of the main characters switched back to their natural and obvious or probable gender, see [....]."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"Though Proust is not for the casual reader, the Modern Library edition lightens the load a little: the font is big and thin, the pages small, so your eyes don't get lost in a sea of words; there's a great synopsis at the back so you can track what you've covered and find it again easily (a very big plus); and the volume is nice and thick so you can feel very accomplished. And, no one really says this: the paper is nice. It's nice to hold. Yay Modern Library Paperbacks.The Moncrieff translation is wonderful and gives you what you imagine is the tone of the time (late 19th century). I haven't read the newer translations. If you've made it through Swann's Way (took me two years), you'll know that things actually do start happening, there is a story. So there is much to enjoy here."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"Volume two of Le Proust's great work is a sensual delight. Part One (of Vol.2), by and large, is more about Swann's family and, of course, the agonizing and philosophizing in regard to \\"getting over\\" Miss Gilberte. There is much less about the narrator's family which ran the course throughout SWANN'S WAY. Stylistically, BUDDING GROVE is an absolute wonder. We are once again treated to the narrator's philosophies on life's ups and downs (how's that for a summation?). Once he gets to the fictitious seaside town of Balbec, the book surges--taking on the proverbial \\"life of its own\\". The reader is in the hotel room with him...and on the beach...and on the boardwalk, etc. It was a joy to see how Proust/Moncrieff would occasionally work in \\"street talk\\" with the mainstay of aureate and lyrical prose: a woman in Balbec is described as having \\"yellow hair and six inches of paint on her face and a carriage which reeked of harlot a mile away...\\" Delicious. Priceless."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"This book was such a joy to read, I was genuinely sorry to see it end. And of course, it doesn't really end; it just goes on into the Guermantes Way. Rarely does one come across a novel that seems so completely pleasing and visionary in its effects upon the reader. Apart from the general relief one feels in seeing the author finally emerge from his prolonged sojourn in the shadow of his mother, there is also the vicarious pleasure derived from experiencing a long-ago summer at the mythical sea-side resort of Balbec, in the shadow of young women in the flower of youth. You feel as if you are truly there with him, walking the promenade, gazing out to sea, hearing the sea-gulls cry, feeling the sand between your toes, and being nineteen again and living carelessly.Two great characters emerge from this novel who will exercise a profound influence on the young narrator as he matures in future volumes. The first is Robert de Saint-Loup, a dashing young soldier-playboy, whom Marcel clearly adores as a soul mate of sorts. This gives the reader pause; for considering how close the two young men become they manage to still consider themselves straight! Never mind, however, for we eventually learn that Saint-Loup is indeed bisexual, as are so many of the characters in this novel. Secondly we meet the playful, flirty Albertine whom Marcel decides is the one girl in the little band of jeunes filles whom he most wants as his female sexual conquest. Unfortunately, he does not have the capability of relating to her except in the most self-absorbed of ways."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"Volume 3 of 12 of proust's Remembrance of things past is another great example of beautiful literature. In this volume Proust's leaves the innocence of boyhood and ventures forth towards young adulthood. His relationship with young Gilberte grows and eventually he falls in love with the pretty thing. Alas however there are problems and the narrator must face the fact that Gilberte will never be the one for him. All the while Proust's writes of Madame Swann the much talked about woman with a shady past. Though the mother of Gilberte the narrator paints her as a vision of beauty and grace. He is captivated by her as well and in one charming passage describes in great detail a spring coat she is wearing on one of her walks where in it he finds treasures and scents like no other. the reader can feel the coat as it is being described such a writer is Proust. this volume ends with Proust arriving at Balbec with his grandmother and observing the Hypocrisy around him. It is quite comical for no one is spared and each class at that time viewed the other with suspicion and disdain. I was quite disappointed when the last CD was through but I have already ordered volume 4. Naxos has done an excellent job in bringing to life Proust's masterpiece and I can't wait to listen to all 12 volumes. I will savor them however ordering one every so often just to excite my anticipation a bit more. this book contains 3 CDs and includes musical breaks between the reading."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"While much of 'Swann's Way' seems to highlight the narrator's wonderment and obsession with certain things (love, architecture, the aristocracy, the theatre), 'Within a Budding Grove' seems to start a fall to disillusionment as everything begins to become attainable. It still seems that there is some hope for love, until the attempt to kiss Albertine towards the end of the novel places it just out of reach.There also is a glimmer of hope in the character of Elstir, whose impressionism offers a new way of looking at things. Overall, the book is an interesting homage to the journey of youth and we are left with a longing for even more than the 730 pages contain."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"I cannot imagine trying to read Proust's Everest of a novel until I've had enough life experience to be able to identify with his insights. How on earth was a man who died young and was confined to a bed for so many years able to learn so much about life and common human experience, emotion and perception? I don't know how, but I thank God that he was.For modern readers, Proust is definitely an acquired taste that rewards patience. I never thought reading the works of one author would make those of others seem so much easier to read. But such is the case with Proust. Nevertheless, one shouldn't regard his writing as therapy or medicine; it may read like self help at times, with its frequent use of the first-person plural, but it is a story first of all. His writing is just more detailed and insightful than that of all but a handful of modern novelists.Within a Budding Grove is a primer on patience and perception, one that will probably make you a better reader, perhaps a better writer, and certainly a more interesting human being. Struggle on patiently. You will get used to the labyrinthine sentences, paragraphs that run on for pages, and gargantuan chapters (if they can be called that) that don't really begin or end anywhere tidy. Eventually, you will likely come to enjoy it.My only criticism: at times one does get annoyed by the slow pacing. For instance, I knew that this is the volume that introduces the reader to Albertine. But it did take about 600 pages for the narrator to meet her! That said, there are plenty of tasty morsels along the way. Read it, not so much for the simple story or the minutely detailed descriptions, but for the numerous insights and the astounding wisdom."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"I waited decades to read Proust and eventually forked out a lot of money and bought all the volumes of the Everyman edition. I consider myself well enough read: Tolstoy, Garcia Marquez, Greene, Lessing, Fowles, Kafka, to name a few. And I also have a rule. If a novel doesn't grab you by the time you have read a fifth of its length, then you are wasting your time. Life is too short. With \\"In search of lost time,\\" I went further. I wanted the enlightenment of the greatest fiction of all time. I gave up after 1000 pages and do not know how I lasted so long. It was a dire struggle. There is no plot. The main character is a nobody. He forms no plausible relationships with anyone. He doesn't do anything. In fact, characterisation does not exist. No one is believable. There is no meaningful narrative or human interest. It has no politics on any scale. The endless trivia is not, I repeat, not poetic. The sentences go on for pages and make no grammatical sense. And even if you can figure out what obscure grammatical structure they are attempting to employ, forget about trying to make sense of them. People talk about Proust's musing over a cup of tea. That's about as interesting as it gets. If the heart of mankind is what you are after, read Tolstoy. That is great writing, beautifully written."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"Montcrief's translation, is the quintisential Proust. The, beautiful, florid prose is reminiscent of a time and a place that no longer exists, and captures the French aristocracy in the advent of WWI -- full of old-world trappings, yet abounding with subtle reminders of the globalization that was to follow. Proust's style and vision are directed admirably towards his artistic goal of appreciating art through sublimation, and express his idea that a true understanding of art comes first through appreciation, and then expression through a medium. This volume is full of Proust's own philosiphies on art, life and the people who abound in both. His observations, pointed and amusing, keep this volume relevant. Considering the wave of expatriate and existentialist writers who propogated Paris after the Great War, this book is truly the last in a line of works that view life in a grand, sweeping and elegant manner. Within a Budding Grove brought Proust fame and acclaim in his own time, and in ours can be seen as a masterpiece reflecting a time past, yet glimsping assiduously into the future. For those \\"in search of lost time\\" this is truly a great read."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"One of the seven volumes of The Remembrance of Things Past, Within a Budding Grove is my favorite. Proust was of course infinitely more than a narcissist and a snob, but it is perhaps this volume which shows this more than the others. In terms of pure sensousness this volume contains Proust's most purely &quot;beautiful&quot; passages. Here we see the beginning and the ebbing of Marcel's attraction to Gilbertte Swanne and his new attraction to Albertine. Here the elaborate and elegantly structured sentences are easier to appreciate than in the long passages about the unpleasantness of the Guermantes or Marcel's elaborate comments on the ebbing memory in The Fugitive.Consider one passage which Theodor Adorno admired very much, where Marcel encounters Madame Swann wearing a lovely dress: &quot;And I learned that these canons according to which she dressed, it was for her own satisfaction that she obeyed them, as though yielding to a Superior Wisdom of which she herself was High Priestess: for if it should happen that, feeling too warm, she threw open or even took off altogether and gave me to carry the jacket which she had intended to keep button up, I would discover in the blouse beneath it a thousand details of execution which had had every chance of remaining unperceived, like those parts of an orchestral score to which the composer had devoted infinte labor albeit they may never reach the ears of the public: or in the sleeves of the jacket that lay folded across my arm I would see, I would drink in slowly, for my own pleasure of from affection for its wearer, some exquisite detail, a deliciously tinted strip, a lining of mauve satinette which, ordinarily concealed from every eye, was yet just as deliciously fashioned as the outer parts, like those gothic carvings on a cathedral, hidden on the inside of a balustrade eighty feet from the ground, as perfect as are the bas-reliefs over the main porch, yet never seen by any living man until, happening to pass that way upon his travels, an artist obtains leave to climb up there among them, to stoll in the open air, sweeping the whole town with a comprehensive gaze, between the soaring towers.&quot;Adorno's comments on this passage are far more profound than anything I could say. (They are availabe in the second volume of Notes to Literature) What is so striking, says Adorno, about this passage is not its enraptured precision but the way Proust preserves the unmediated experience of childhood that is so easily destroyed by our conformist society. In showing that this experience can be retrieved Proust's writing is profoundly liberating, not filled with &quot;the false maturity of resignation.&quot; Though Proust was physically weak, the iron discipline of Proust's art reveals the deepest and most heroic discipline. Proust, in the end, is a martyr to happiness."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"Five stars for Proust's masterwork, but I wouldn't buy this book except for reference. Instead, look for the Viking hardcover or Penguin paperback of \\"In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower.\\" It's a hefty title, but it's more accurate and evocative than \\"Within a Budding Grove,\\" and I would say the same about the text.Scott-Montcrief did his work between 1913 and 1927, and he died before finishing it. Even as brought up to date by Kilmartin, it's now a bit dusty. James Grieve has given us a volume two for the 21st century. Almost any reader will be better served by \\"In the Shadow\\" than by acquiring the venerable \\"Budding Grove.\\" (Oh sure, the ideal would be to read \\"A l'ombre de jeunes filles en fleurs\\" in French, but for most of us life is too short for that!)-- Dan Ford"},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"Spoilers throughoutThe title A l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs is translated various ways. Moncrief's Within a Budding Grove sucks. Seriously, where are the girls and the play of light? I prefer Nabokov's more natural In the Shade of the Blooming Young Girls. My doubts about whether I am reading what the author actually wrote (coupled with my preference to read for style) normally steer me away from reading translations---but I make an exception for this vast, supremely intelligent novel.On the surface this part of the Recherche covers the beautiful, rich, stylish, asthmatic, and batty Narrator's youthful loves: Gilberte and her mother in Paris; the faces and voices of Albertine and the rest of the little band in Balbec; and Charlus (although the Narrator naively did not comprehend what was going on). They all end badly, Gilberte gets tired of him, Albertine calls for help to thwart his advances and Charlus even administers a salutary douche.I think the Narrator's love for Odette is the most profound of them all; it is her fragrance that intoxicates, her housecoats that delight, her chrysanthemums that have special significance. She is observed down to the lining of her jacket. The mauve vision of Odette in her slow procession through the Bois is for me the most enchanting part of the novel. Accompanied by her male entourage who are awed by her beauty and wealth, saluted by Princes, she is more aristocratic than the aristocrats and singularly sums up the belle epoque. And Odette is important to Proust, for, despite her mediocre intelligence, she has invented \\"a physiognomy of her own\\"---that is, she has invented herself.Proust is a subtle and penetrating psychologist and has superhuman powers of analogy. He has created images that impress themselves on my mind: the sea reflected in Balbec hotel's bookcases, the green dining room, Berma with her arm extended, the hawthorne, and of course the mauve image of Odette. As if it were an Elstir painting, Proust's novel has the feel of a mirage in a tinted haze; just so, the bit about the letters with Gilberte is recalled by me now as perhaps letters that the Narrator dreamed he wrote to Gilberte, or maybe wrote them and didnt send them, or maybe sent them and imagined her reply, or maybe he did receive an actual response. I cant tell. Very nice effect.The other thing that keeps me coming back to Proust is the brilliant observations that appear on virtually every page. To give but two instances: he dumps on Norpois \\"...to repeat what everybody else was thinking was, in politics, the mark not of an inferior but of a superior mind\\"; and reflects on Bergotte's genius, \\"...the men who produce works of genius are not those that live in the most delicate atmosphere, whose conversation is the most brilliant or their culture the most extensive, but those that have had the power, ceasing suddenly to live for themselves, to transform their personality into a sort of mirror, in such a way that their life, however mediocre it may be socially and even, in a sense, intellectually, is reflected by it, genius consisting in the reflecting power and not in the intrinsic quality of the scene reflected.\\" There is simply a lot to chew on.I wont talk of Proust's larger themes (Time, Art, Memory, Self-Deception, Life's Irony, etc.) but I do want to recommend some criticism that I found enlightening: Pippin's essay Becoming Who One Is (and Failing) and Landy's excellent Philosophy as Fiction.There are a couple things that continue to puzzle me: what is the actual relationship between Bloch and Odette? is Bergotte a homosexual? Perhaps the reader might leave me a message to help me out."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"...and that rush of memories. I read the first volume of \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" which is normally titled in English, (Swann's Way) some 25 years ago. Truly great literature should impact one's life, and certainly the first volume did. I vowed to visit the town depicted, which has hyphenated its name, Illiers-Combray, in honor of this masterpiece. I've done so, at least five times, visited Aunt Leonie's home, and literally taken the \\"Swann's Way\\" walk, the relatively short distance from her home to the lovely and normally unoccupied Pr&eacute; Catelan park, which should be an essential part of anyone's memory of this work. It can become a place of \\"pilgrimage.\\" I reviewed (Swann's Way) in early 2012; in doing so I did a straight line project based on reading one volume of the six, every 25 years, and readily realized I would not complete the entire novel unless I changed my pace. And I did, finishing this volume just under the wire in 2012, and committing to read volume three in the first part of 2013... this novel really is such an essential read.Reading Marcel Proust seems to call out for a special venue. I kept thinking of a hot-tub. Relaxed and soothing, certainly unhurried. His style of endless run-on sentences, with 10 and 20 qualifying phrases, seems to demand a leisurely read. I would have hated to think I had a deadline and a paper due on the book, as in a school assignment. Some passages I read two and three times, just for the sheer joy of his uniquely descriptive prose. And no doubt I'll pick up the book in the future, and read those passages again.The novel is set in the era commonly called \\"La Belle Epoque,\\" in France, just before the truly man-made, with the emphasis on that gender, catastrophe of World War I. In part, it is a novel of drawing room society and the endless machinations involved in establishing and maintaining a \\"pecking order.\\" What woman, for example, will refuse to even be introduced to another? That can all be a bit tiresome, but isn't that also how the contemporary corporate and political worlds work? Part of that society is the fictional writer Bergotte, who is apparently modeled on the real-life Anatole France. And there was a wonderful section on the narrator's anticipation and thrill in seeing the actress Berma in a production of Racine's \\"Phedre.\\"The core theme of this volume is the yearnings and infatuations of first loves. For me, the utterly astonishing aspect of this is that, as is well-known, Proust was a homosexual. Yet he seemed to capture heterosexual love, and in particular, the many subtleties by which a woman can knowingly entice a man, better than any other author. And he also captures the many obsessions a man can develop for a particular aspect of a woman's body, demeanor, or even attire. How, oh how did he see and understand so deeply into something he must not have intrinsically felt? In the first part of the book, his very first love is for Gilberte, whose likeness appears on the cover. Parents and supervision are very much in evidence, and it brought back a flood of memories (a la, le madeleine?) concerning those days of long ago. Obsessions and slights were never reconciled, as they so often aren't, and therefore life moves on. In his case, the second half of the book details the narrator's summer at the Grand Hotel at Balbec (modeled on the real town of Cabourg) on the Normandy Coast. It is there that he develops new loves and new longings, with a group of young coming-of-age women, who are not so subtly alluded to by the volume's title.For a novel that nominally does not have much action, there are some intensely memorable and evocative scenes. There is the 10-page or so description of Mme. Swan taking her \\"constitutional\\" near the Arc de Trioumph, in her mauve dress, with parasol and admirers. There is the grand entrance of Robert St. Loup en Bray, at the Grand Hotel. There is a memorable scene in which the diners at the Grand Hotel, behind the large plate windows, are described as being in an aquarium, observed by the working class outside. And I wondered if this inspired Pasternak to depict a similar scene inDoctor Zhivago. Yet another concerned how the narrator was enticed, and then rebuffed by Albertine.There are so many quotable sections; I will confine myself to only one, which illustrates how erotic a simple handshake can be: \\"The act of pressing Albertine's hand had a sensual sweetness which was in keeping somehow with the pink, almost mauve colouring of her skin. This pressure seemed to allow you to penetrate into the girl's being, to plumb the depths of her senses, like the ringing sound of her laughter, indecent in the way that the cooing of doves or certain animals cries can be. She was one of those women with whom shaking hands affords so much pleasure that one feels grateful to civilization for having made of the handclasp a lawful act between boys and girls when they meet...I could have conveyed by certain pressures of hand on hand; for her part, how easy it would have been, in responding by other pressures, to show me that she accepted; what complicity, what a vista of sensual delight stood open!\\" Wow, the way Proust describes a handshake with a woman, well, it might satisfy a man for an hour or so.Proust also had the insight to realize that in his first loves, he might be in love with his mind's image of a woman, rather than the reality that she is. I felt that he also overrated nubile charms, and underrated the joys obtained from the more mature and experienced. Overall, a most satisfying read, and one that deserves a special 6-star rating."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"We pick up here, in this second volume of the larger *In Search of Lost Time* with Proust's un-named protagonist at about age 15. He longs for the affections of his childhood sweetheart, the lovely Gilberte, who now accommodates his frequent visits with more overt enthusiasm... but it's all superficial and the young man's interest in her begins to wane. He maintains relations with her opulent and often odious mother, Odette, and he still reveres her father, M. Swann, but he hits upon the concept of searching elsewhere for his notion of female companionship.At this juncture, there's not a tremendous contrast between our youthful protagonist and Salinger's Holden Caulfield in the latter's own early days inThe Catcher in the Rye. But it's clear that Proust's protagonist's character is not quite so clinically flawed as that of Holden, (who appeared many years later.)The break is eventually made with Gilberte, more a process of osmosis than that of open conflict. And it's opportune for the young man that his mother, perpetually over-concerned for his frail health, launches him off to Balbec for a summer of vacationing along the southern coast, ostensibly so he can also pursue his unquenchable emphatuation with mouldering church frescoes. It's there, while residing in a resort hotel, that he encounters a band of giggling adolescent girls on the nearby beach. It takes him an agonizingly long period of time to eventually come to know them but he ultimately does, chiefly through the aid of a close friend of noble heritage [Saint Loup] and a venerable mentor, an elderly artist of notable fame [M. Bloch]. From here his relationship with two of the girls develops, but not necessarily as he anticipates.Along the social roller coaster of his life, it becomes clear that this youthfully amourous lad might have seized upon any opportunity for familiar relations with a young lady, even with a gal who was well below his elevated station. At one point at a train stop, he hones in on a peasant girl dispensing milk on the train and his naive fantasies about meeting this unremarkable gal run somewhat amok. But Proust moves him along, allowing the young man to only see her once again at a subsequent venue -- and by this time, his initial interest in her has diminished.Between numerous diaphanous episodes of the protagonist, Proust clings to certain themes which he initiated way back inSwann's Way (volume 1 of Remembrance of Things Past), improved 8/15/2010. The lamentable M. Swann's circumstance with his wife, Odette (a woman whom a lesser man of the period might have been inclined to throddle), continues to give rise to covert stress, thus:\\"I'll tell you who does need a good doctor, and that's our friend Swann,\\" said Bergotte. \\"And on my asking whether he was ill, well, don't you see, he's typical of the man who has married a whore, and has to pocket a dozen insults a day from women who refuse to meet his wife or men who have slept with her. Just look, one day when you're there, at the way he lifts his eyebrows when he comes in, to see who's in the room.\\" (Page 199.)Proust employs an infinite conucopia of clever literary devices to capture our interest. For example, he drops a compelling morsel, perhaps a brief description of a lovely girl with whom the protagonist is clearly emphatuated, and then he moves on for a time only to detail a completely unrelated episode -- he keeps the reader very hungry that way. We drool for more but we are cut off for precisely an endurable amount of suspense time.In summary, Proust's lyrical and subtly brilliant prose makes us long for the next tome in his renowned series,In Search of Lost Time, Vol. III: The Guermantes Way (v. 3). In the meantime, Volume II, *Within A Budding Grove* garners my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"This is Volume 2 in Proust's In Search of Lost Time series.In this volume, the narrator gets close to and then loses his first love, travels to Balbec, makes new friends, and starts to fall in love again. That's all that happens.But again, as in Swann's Way, Proust tells the reader every detail in beautiful prose - what the ocean looked like, why she acted that way, what the narrator is thinking, etc, etc.I found the first third of the book to be a little tiresome, since I was sick of the behavior of certain characters. But once we got a change of scene in the narrators travels to Balbec, I started to really enjoy Proust again.I have to say this once again - if anyone is curious yet intimidated by Proust (as I was), just try the first hundred pages of Swann's Way. You might be surprised."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"Whether you're in prison or you're a millionaire, you'll benefit from reading Proust. Look for Viking's (Penguin) newest, most complete translations for optimal enjoyment."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"In this second volume of &quot;In search of lost time&quot;, Marcel shows the evolution of his feelings towards women. The book starts off with his encounters with Gilberte, the daughter of Swann and Odette, in which the enjoy playing with other kids. Marcel finds misterious and fascinating the perspective of being admitted in Gilberte's intimate spaces: her house, the lobby, the rooms. His fascination includes Gilberte's mother, Odette; as well as he finds resistence in Swann's figure. But soon his passion for Gilberte disappears and he forces himself not to see her, in an attempt to make himself more interesting to her. But the unforseen result of his tactics is that his feelings for Gilberte fall into oblivion. Then, Marcel focuses in the meetings of the Swanns with the high society, in which Oddette is not completely well received (given her past as a &quot;cocotte&quot;); but she enters in the circles gradually.Marcel travels to the beaches of Balbec with his grandmother and that's where he meets Albertine and her circle of colorfull and charming young friends. It is also noticeable the character of Norpois, whose words to Marcel are full of double meaning and hidden intentions. Marcel meets his friends Saint-Luop, too. After a few sightings he seems a bit pretentious, but through an aunt of Saint-Loup's (who he meets through his grandmother) he gets to know this young man and they stablish a close friendship. An uncle of his is Charlus, who will turn out to be a very important character.By the end of the book the reader have met the circle of friends that Marcel has stablished as a result of his travel. He has taken the first step to his later relation with Albertine. Proust rejoices in describing things and one has to understand why is that. His references to the Dreyfuss affair serve as a way to show the behaviour of the high society and the snobism, which seems to rule the relationships between the different circles. Everything serves a purpose with Proust, even though an incautious reader may think that it is a long dissapointing book, I find it to be one of the great literary endeavours of the past century. His way of looking in detail the simple and most trivial life in all its seemingly meaningless details, turns such details in evidence of the connection between the big destinies and the low and selfish passions. A great example of this is when he discovers his own place in time, after considering how he relates to Gilberte and with his hobbies.This second volume of &quot;In search of lost time&quot; constitutes an honest, unidealistic view of love and how its nature is actually connected to the low passions that rule societies."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":".This is a great copy of Vol. 2 of A la recherche du temps perdu [In Search of Lost Time].Each volume in the septrology may be read individually as an independent novel.This is, of course, the very best translation available in English; probably the very best that will ever be available in English: certainly the next best thing to reading the original French.NOTE: Proust is not quick reading, and one who tries to read him too quickly will just as quickly lose the tread of the narrative.This text has its own time scale, and the reader must adjust his/herself to the text--not the other way around.In this stream of consciousness narrative, the narrator (/author) digresses as he speaks (/thinks): he digresses, digresses, digresses; and then, he returns, returns, returns to the point where he began. One has to follow his line of thought: this is the art and beauty of the text.Proust's achievement is one of the greatest edifices of Western art, perhaps comparable only to Wagner's Ring cycle.."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"the beauty of these novels is unmatched with the possible exception of thomas wolfe. come with me and dance til dawn"},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"Volume 2 of Marcel Proust's 4000+ page masterpiece, &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;, is, if it's possible, an even greater book than the first volume. I read Volume 1, &quot;Swann's Way&quot;, with the kind of astonishment and joy generally reserved for Tolstoy and Maugham, constantly amazed at Proust's (via Moncrieff, Kilmartin, &amp; Enright) ability to deepen sensation and memory to almost religious proportions, and when I finished I thought, &quot;There's no way he can keep this level of beauty up for another 5 volumes.&quot; Judging from Volume 2, I was dead wrong.Proust published &quot;Swann's Way&quot; in 1913, and waited 6 years to publish Volume 2, &quot;Within a Budding Grove&quot;; I presume that in the interim he reorganized his ideas, deciding to expand his novel and explore his themes in greater detail. This volume is much more leisurely and intricately paced than the first, as Proust masterfully tells us of the end of his relationship with Gilberte, his relocation to Balbec, and the beginning of his relationship with Albertine. The slow dying of love, the vaguely confusing experience of a new dwelling as it gradually becomes a home, watching beautiful young girls (the &quot;budding grove&quot; of the title) enjoying their beauty and youth as they walk down a city street...these things and more are plumbed and ruminated upon, with Proust's typically intricate and gorgeous language.These books, if the first two are any guide, are like nothing ever attempted in the history of literature. Rather than dealing with WHAT happened, Proust settles himself in for the long haul to try and understand WHY it happened; to quote Christopher Hitchens, Proust &quot;exposes and clarifies the springs of human motivation...with a transparency unexampled except in Shakespeare or George Eliot.&quot; But I don't think Bill nor George ever dug this deep; Marcel Proust is absolutely one of a kind, and he's not easy to read in this world of flash-images and expressways. He takes his time. Though he was dying with every labored breath (he didn't live to see the entire novel published), Proust was in no hurry to finish. His thoughts, like his sentences, have multiple branches. Follow them and you'll cherish the experience like it was your own.Moving on to Volume 3....."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"For the second book of Proust's masterpiece, 'In Search of Lost Time', his attention turns away from the black and white realities of childhood to the greyer realms of adolescence, and with that, the deep, burning sensation of unrequited love. In essence, the second book is a 530-page essay on the different forms of young love, from deep obsession to airy neglect, from the savage loneliness of rejection to the dizzying heights of a love returned.The book is split into two rough sections, the first of which is called 'At Mme Swan's'. Here we are introduced to Gilberte, Proust's first great love. The feelings he harbour's for her are ridiculously exaggerated, and oh so reminiscent of most people's teenage years. Every action, every word, every glance is analysed, studied, explored for meaning and intent. If, one day, Gilberte invites him to tea, the implications and potential meanings behind the invitation are debated internally for pages. If not, then even more pages are spent examining the pit of despair that Proust' soul fall in to. On top of this unhealthily obsessive love, we have his infatuation with Mme Swan, Gilberte's mother. There is almost a sense that Proust loves Gilberte because she is his age and he 'should' love her, whereas his affection towards Odette Swan is more real because there is no obligation or pressure from anyone, but less likely because she is twenty years older than him, and married.When Proust's love for Gilberte is over - as it inevitably must, in those tender years of a boy or girl's life - the terrifying lows to which his emotions descend is as remarkable as the highs of his spirit not twenty pages previous. He obsessively analyses the ways in which he will get revenge, plotting to make her love him again, just so that he can reject her, to let her know how it feels. He tortures himself emotionally, visiting Mme Swan and purposely avoiding Gilberte.What we have in this first part is a fascinating study on the tormented, melodramatic loves of early adolescence. Proust is too young at this stage to understand that love may not be forever, and can speak only in grandiose, exaggerated terms. If not for the fact that the prose is written with such grace and intelligence, his despair would come across as teenage angst at its very blackest.In the second part of the novel, 'Place-Names: The Place', Proust and his grandmother retire to the beach to aid in the recuperation of his body and mind. Always a frail child, the rigours of new love have taken their toll on the young man. He rejects love, deciding that he shall become a writer once more, a passion that he had denied himself when his love for Gilberte had seemed so real and assured. He is introduced to a variety of characters which, we are told during the narrative, will come to play a great part in his later life: Robert de Saint-Loup, the Baron de Charlus and of course Albertine.It is in this second section that Proust falls under the shadows of young girls in flower. He meets a group of girls, a 'gang' he calls them, and befriends first one, then all of them, reasoning that out of four or five girls, at least one would be worthy of love. Keeping with the true spirit of adolescence, he falls in and out of love with them all, needing only a stray glance or a casual smile to move from one girl to the other. Only two of them, Albertine and Andree, seem to return his emotions, and even then, everything remains chaste.Interspersed throughout, we have long, insightful remarks on what love can do to the body, to the mind, and to the relationships we have with other people. Speaking as a male recently finished with his teenage years, I can say that Proust has captured the depth of feeling, the obsessiveness, the surety that everything in the universe will be perfect if only the love is returned, the electric thrill of acceptance, the deep darkness of rejection with such skill that perfection is a word that springs to mind.Other topics are touched on throughout the novel. Early on, Proust is introduced to an author he holds in high esteem, one Bergotte. He is crushed upon discovering that the man does not exactly coincide with the image he had created while reading Bergotte's books, and ruminates on the fact that a man need not display the same intelligence and wit in reality as he does on the page. We must all focus our attention on achieving either a great reality or a great fiction, for Bergotte, his attentions were focused upon the fiction, and his personality and demeanour when interacting with flesh and blood people suffer. For Proust, it is an introduction to the idea that people can have two - or more - identities, and that a certain one is presented to a certain group of people.The writing is, of course, typical Proust. Sentences are long, paragraphs are longer, and not very much happens. Dialogue is scarce, action scarcer. The reader is there to observe Proust's thoughts, not to use him as a mirror to the world he inhabits. Luckily for us, Proust's thoughts are never dull or boring. He says early on in the novel, 'For genius lies in reflective power and not in the intrinsic quality of the scene reflected', and Proust's reflective power more than reveal the truth of this maxim."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"Penguin's new translations of \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" were just the nudge I needed to read Proust's masterwork again. I was particularly impressed by the job the American writer Lydia Davis did with \\"Swann's Way\\". By contrast, I have a few complaints about James Grieves's rendering of \\"In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower\\". Where Scott Moncrieff translated \\"petite bande\\" (of girls) with the expected \\"little band,\\" Grieves uses \\"little gang,\\" which to an American ear sounds rather tough. He mangles one of my favorite quotations. And there's a typo on the bottom of page 95: \\"not\\" instead of \\"now\\"!Overall, though, I like the liberties Grieves takes with the text, and we were certainly overdue for a freshened-up translation of one of the most important books of the 20th century. Unlike Proust's French, Scott Moncrieff's English has come to seem dusty and overblown. (For example, he rendered the title of this volume as \\"Within a Budding Grove\\", the literal translation being too racy for his 1920s audience of post-Victorians.)The American edition (from Viking) is particularly handsome. The four volumes now available are uniform in appearance when it comes to their cloth covers (grey and black with silver lettering), and the dust-jackets, though following a general theme, are distinctive enough that you're not likely to mistake one volume for another.

His plan to ingratiate himself with Gilberte by becoming friends with her parents backfires badly when Gilberte begins to distance himself from him. He agrees then to spend a season with his grandmother in a Norman oceanside resort named Balbec. There, in the most memorable scene in the novel, he makes the acquaintance of a &quot;little band&quot; of eight girls whose poise and sang-froid disarranges his senses. He falls in love, with first, then another. As the novel ends, we see him select one of them, Albertine, for future conquest.This is my second time through the budding grove of Proust's great multi-part novel with its crescendo of (unfulfilled) sensuality. Such was the impact of the Balbec scenes that I thought that the narrator's pursuit of the band of girls took up most of the novel. In fact, it does not appear until well into the last part and takes up less than 200 pages. It is simply that Proust imprinted that scene so strongly in my mind that, over the years, I mistook a part for the whole.WITHIN A BUDDING GROVE introduces some memorable characters that will come back in future volumes: In addition to Albertine, there are Robert de Saint-Loup, the painter Elstir, the Marquise de Villeparisis, and the Baron de Charlus. In the later volumes, we will see how Marcel (for that is the narrator's name) will fare with Albertine, and how the world that he saw as a shimmering fairy castle will shatter with the working out of his destiny, that of his friends, and that of the French in the years before the Great War.One of the great chess grandmasters commented on the opening setup position -- before any moves had been made -- by saying &quot;All the mistakes are there, waiting to be made.&quot;"},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"If you're looking at reviews of this volume, then I assume you've read Swann's Way and are considering buying more Proust. Within a Budding Grove continues the brilliance of Swann's Way, applying Proust's unequaled powers of observation to such experiences as struggling to be with his childhood idol, staying at a seaside resort, glimpsing and ultimately working his way into a clique of teenage girls, developing a friendship with an aristocratic youth, and visiting the studio of a great painter. As with Swann's Way, you will have frequent &quot;aha!&quot; moments when Proust's narrator opens your eyes to the previously overlooked drama at your elbow (and within your own mind)."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"It's my experience, reading this novel, to be perpetually grateful for the miracle of Proust, grateful, too, that he waited until his maturity to write; as someone who's spent time in writing workshops, I can only imagine the dissipation of his energies into anemic prototypes had he been persuaded to publish prematurely. Lovingly written, every word endowed with love of life and maturity's distillation of life experience, it is a novel (which reads like a memoir) of a life devoted to the connoisseur's pursuit of pleasure-how can that not alienate? Proust is consciously writing for an elite of mental or temperamental sympathy. To say that reading Proust has helped me through hard times is true-yet how can I-someone who has, to paraphrase a T-shirt I saw recently, a blackbelt in keepin' it real-not resent a courtesan with three ladies to aid in her toilette-however tenderly rendered?The mature Proust's vision of love-in this novel at least-is adolescent and self-absorbed, and there is no sense of a selfless or mature love, such as that of a parent for a child, which contains a dying to self as opposed to an expansion of self. (One thinks here of the authorial contempt for the too-giving parent, Vinteuil.) I pity Marcel: to lose oneself-the burden-to lose time-sometimes-is very refreshing indeed. Mired in the adolescent and egotistical point-of-view, without benefit of even the illusory counterpoint of an adult lover's (Swann's) point-of-view, the narrative does sometimes suffer from too much Marcel. Coddled, effete, he finely calibrates the shades of disillusionment that possession as opposed to reflection offers-the \\"psychological impossibility of happiness\\"-after having his wildest fantasies (Berma! Bergotte! Balbec!) fulfilled time and again. And he universalizes his singular temperamental trait, that inability to live in the moment.Proust is only too conscious of his weaknesses, and as a result, we get his poetics: \\"I am aware that this is to blaspheme against the sacrosanct school of what these gentlemen term \`Art for Art's sake,' but at this period of history there are tasks more urgent than the manipulation of words in a harmonious manner,\\" Norpois says, and one is laughing out loud with pleasure at the dissonance between Marcel's lofty musings on Berma and the cold spiced beef jiggling in its cubes of aspic, the delicious conflict of temperaments.He gives me back to myself-it's a long time since I've felt the sole inhabitor of my consciousness and had the leisure to puzzle out my sensations. Usually my mind is full to the brim like this: \\"Mommy-mommy-mommy-here comes little bear! What does little bear say?! Mommy-mommy-mommy-mommy-moooooommy! Here's little bear! Little bear is talking!\\" So that I don't have mental space or leisure to process even the simplest sensation, how the sun feels on my shoulders, for instance. Visiting Proust's cool room of mirrors and ocean waves returns that feeling to me, and that is precious. There is something precious in his extremity-his lack of apology for a sensitive and aesthetically-driven nature that is anathema to middle-class American values. And that rhythm like ocean waves! It gets in your head, lowers your blood pressure, no doubt alters brain wave patterns, the chemicals in neuropathways.There is something so extreme (admirable!) in Proust's sensibility-the extremity of his pursuit of pleasurable sensation intellectually reorganized and savored-that one feels-paradoxically-something dehumanizing in his gaze. His musings on the protoplasmic nature of young girls frankly chills me! Yet I see it as part of the \\"green fuse,\\" the life force pagan and repugnant at times. So, what happens in Vol.3? I can't wait, yet at the same time I hope for something I may not get."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"Reading Proust presents the challenge of understanding his complex method of conveying the impressions made upon him by various people, places, and things, impressions which are so deeply personal and unique that they can be very difficult for the detached reader to relate to. Proust can recall the torrid emotions of a teenage crush with the articulate language and clarity of an extremely intellectual adult with a literary voice so distinctive it practically exists in a genre of its own; and in &quot;Within a Budding Grove,&quot; the second volume of &quot;In Search of Lost Time,&quot; he subjects his narrator, now in his young teens, to the charms of two girls who will define for him a youthful ideal by which he standardizes love and beauty.Searching for ideals seems to be the young Marcel's goal in life. Whether he is enamored with the actress Berma at the theater, the writings of his literary model Bergotte, or the paintings of the artist Elstir, he immerses himself headlong into what he believes to be the supreme examples of artistic experience and absorbs the impressions so that he may reflect them in his own future writing. Oddly enough, his feminine ideal is no girl of his own age but Odette, the courtesan who was the obsession of his parents' friend Swann in the previous volume and is now Swann's wife, and whose checkered past casts a lingering shadow over her husband's social status, excluding them from the higher strata of Paris society (the Faubourg Saint-Germain) and keeping Swann suspicious about her behavior with other men.Marcel is trying to develop a relationship with the Swanns' lovely, lively red-haired daughter Gilberte, and he agonizes over the fear that he will not succeed in impressing upon her parents that he is good enough for her. It may seem strange that an adolescent Marcel should spend so much time talking about the Swanns, as though they were potential in-laws, rather than his own parents, but this is an indication of his preoccupying desire for Gilberte's company. Finally he comes to the realization that she does not feel the same way about him as he does about her, which accompanies his bitter shock at seeing her with another boy. Long after his passion for her has faded, however, he still treasures his memories of the time he has spent in Odette's salon.The second half of this volume concerns Marcel's summer sojourn with his grandmother in Balbec, a seaside resort. There he meets his grandmother's friend Madame de Villeparisis, whose father spent the nineteenth century hobnobbing with all the great French writers of the era, and befriends her grandnephew Robert de Saint-Loup, a young man a little older than himself, who is embarking on a military career. One day he notices a remarkably attractive girl walking a bicycle with a group of her friends; this turns out to be Albertine, with whom he forms a relationship that is more playful than the tense one he had with the frigid Gilberte but ends sourly with a refused kiss and a confused Marcel pondering her intentions.Marcel's hypersensitive nature grants him many advantages as a narrator, giving him the ability to overanalyze every situation that shapes his consciousness, but arguably limits his lifestyle. His parents coddle him about his health, even supposing an evening at the theater will debilitate him, and, as we see at Balbec, he accustoms himself to a new setting in an abnormally awkward manner. But perhaps his awkwardness, in love as in life, can be explained partly by the nymphic philosophy by which Odette guides her life: &quot;You can do anything with men when they're in love with you, they're such idiots!&quot; The truth hurts."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"Beautiful writing, and brilliant observations and well-drawn characters. Some caveats are the often labyrinthine sentences and multi-page paragraphs. Most people read SWANN'S WAY and no further, so those who make it through the 2nd volume might praise it excessively out of a slight superiority complex. Also, \\"Marcel\\" is also a little bitchy in his tone, and his \\"happiest when I'm alone\\" philosophy is kind of sad and self-absorbed, and his visiting whore houses is jolting after you've been reading graceful sentences and events. And some of his anthropological and psychological observations are trite and nothing most readers haven't concluded for themselves, and Proust sounds like he believes he's letting you in on some insights of which you're undoubtedly ignorant. But, yes, many of his insights are brilliant and eye-opening. And the sentences that are over-loaded actually are the exception, and the rest are doubtless among the most beautiful sentences ever written. Proust must have been extremely introspective to have thought so extensively about the most minute of moments...and good for us he was, since we get to enjoy the fruits of his introspection in this book. The humor that comes across is delightful, too. Proust has one thing you can't learn in any MFA creative writing program, and that is CHARM!"},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"How can anyone summarize even a single volume of Proust's massive six volume novel? Within a Budding Grove (sometimes translated as In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower) is the second installment of In Search of Last Time. We find the narrator perhaps marginally older on vacation with his grandmother living in a luxurious hotel in Balbec off the coast. This volume, paired with the first (Swann's Way), is really the introduction to the work entire if you can believe it. In it, the narrator perhaps matures slightly; he cultivates his keen awareness of art, meets new people, and ultimately falls out of love with Gilberte and falls in love with Albertine. His relationship with his grandmother is certainly expanded, and the reader comes to learn that the narrator is not merely motivated by a trivial pursuit of pleasure and bourgeois charm. He is in fact, a truly full human being, complete with fear, love, desire, and ambition. He meets one of my favorite characters in the whole book, the impressionist painter Elstir, a character clearly based Monet, Manet, Pissaro, and others. He introduces the narrator to Albertine through his paintings, and teaches him about the joys of life and art. There are some passages in this section of the book (the latter half) which I just can't resist from quoting,\\"I could never have believed that I should now be dreaming of a sea which was no more than a whitish vapour that had lost both consistency and colour. But of such a sea Elstir, like the people who sat musing on board those vessels drowsy with the heat, had felt so intensely the enchantment that he had succeeded in transcribing, in fixing for all time upon his canvas, the imperceptible ebb of the tide, the throb of one happy moment; and at the sight of this magic portrait, one could think of nothing else than to range the wide world, seeking to recapture the vanished day in its instantaneous, slumbering beauty\\" (pg. 657).also (how French is this?),\\"For a convalescent who rests all day long in the flower-garden or an orchard, a scent of flowers or fruit does not more completely pervade the thousand trifles that compose his idle hours than did for me that colour, that fragrance in search of which my eyes kept straying towards the girls, and the sweetness of which finally became incorporated in me. So it is that grapes sweeten in the sun. And by their slow continuity these simple little games had gradually wrought in me also, as in those who do nothing else all day but lie outstretched by the sea, breathing the salt air and sunning themselves, a relaxation, a blissful smile, a vague dazzlement that had spread from brain to eyes\\" (pg. 669).I certainly cannot add any insights into the greatness and profundity of this work which has not already been said by Edmund Wilson or Vladimir Nabokov. Within a Budding Grove is a deeply felt, beautiful and fleeting segment of one of the finest novels of the last century, I urge you to read it."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove,","review":"Upon finishing WITHIN A BUDDING GROVE, the reader will have been introduced to virtually all the major characters in IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME. Most importantly for later volumes, we meet and get to know Albertine, Robert de Saint-Loup, the painter Elstir, the diplomat Norpois, and Madame de Villeparasis, as well as a deepened acquaintance with such characters as Gilberte Swann, Madame Swann, and the extravagantly bizarre Baron de Charlus.Proust's extraordinary genius is evident on every page of this amazing book. One could point to any of a few dozen moments to illustrate this. What is amazing to me about Proust is how he can take an amazingly everyday event, and build it to proportions as great as any battle scene in WAR AND PEACE. For instance, at the end of \\"Madame Swann at Home,\\" the narrator recounts the times he would wait at the Arc de Triomphe to take a walk with Madame Swann and her entourage. The ensuing eight or nine pages, which merely recount the group walking through Paris, become as majestic and epic as any scene in Homer or Virgil or Tolstoy. No scene would seem to contain less potential for greatness, yet Proust is able to make it something truly unique and beautiful. Or, to take another incident, have there been many incidents in literature as filled with passion and emotion and suspense as the Narrator's first attempt to kiss Albertine? In a mere two pages, Proust is about to pack a surreal amount of dramatic (and comic) action.Although famous for containing at least part of both of the narrator's great love affairs, I find this novel even more fascinating for the extraordinary detailing of the myriad of social and class distinctions to be found in the seemingly infinitely varied French society. The great theme throughout the book, even when not specifically mentioned, is snobbism, and Proust owns the subject of snobbery as Homer owns that of war. Proust reveals snobbery primarily proceeding from those slightly lower on the social ladder. Ironically, he reveals those at the top guilty not of snobbery but of insolence and disdain, while not even his servant Franoise is innocent of being a snob. The tensions in the novel become particularly acute given the changes that were taking place in French society at the time. This theme is not restricted to this novel alone. It featured in SWANN'S WAY, especially in the attitudes of the Verdurin \\"faithful\\" and will be a major theme of ensuing volumes, especially THE GUERMANTES WAY.The section of the novel recounting his getting to know Elstir contains perhaps my favorite passage in all of Proust, where Elstir, upon the narrator's learning something unflattering of Elstir's past, tells him that no one has not done things that they would not love to expunge, but that no one ought to despise this, because this is the only way one can truly become wise. \\"We do not receive wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness which no one can else can make for us, which no one can spare, us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world.\\" This is not merely the opinion of Proust's character: it could stand as the central meaning of the novel as a whole."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of Chaos","review":"Why did i waste my time reading this book?

Cast, she weaves a spell in each book to draw the reader into her world of strong women, magic, and men equal and worthy of her heroines. She reinvents the classic children's fairy tales for mature readers who longed for a more fleshed-out story and characters.This book is for those who know how hard it is to find a good man worth holding onto, and that the outside form doesn't define what is inside the mind and soul. This is for those who love wonderful and honorable men and are wise enough to recognize a good thing when they find it.

I enjoy both and yes I do see the similarities between all three of her series but I have to say that this book caught me by surprise.I knew Cast was creative but this book tastes the cake. From the Empousa bloodline, the Realm of the Rose, the creation of human dreams, the dream stealers, the Beast and the rituals the main character Mikado an her handmaidens performed. All of these things came together to create a great novel.Also I have to say that the romance in this novel was far more powerful than any other books of Cast's I've read so far. I was cheering Mikado on and sympathizing with the Beast the entire way. Also the sex scenes were alot more detailed than those in her Divine series and The Goddess of the Sea (the first book from this series) and it didn't detract from the story which usually seems to happen with other smutty novels, it actually added to the romance. And trust me, I'm usually not into anything romantic, except Cast's.Overall, I'm so glad that I bougt this book and I'm planning on rereading it in the next few days."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"This is a retelling of probably the only fairy tale I really liked, Beauty and the Beast.

It didn't disappoint."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"I've read other romantic fantasy titles by PC Cast and have enjoyed them very much, and this book was a pure delight. It's a retelling of the classic \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" story, except that in this case, the Beast really IS a beast. How refreshing!Mikado Empousai is living a fine but rather ho-hum life in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She's got good friends and a good job, and even if she can't find a good man, at least she has her roses. As she says in the book, she's never met a rose who didn't like her, and part of what makes her roses thrive is the special cocktail she feeds them monthly on the night of the new moon: a bit of water, flavored with her own blood. Lately, Mikki has been having dreams: dreams of roses and dreams of a creature who is part man, part beast. The dreams are erotic and disturbing but not frightening. Part of her worries that she might be going a bit crazy, but another part of her enjoys the dreams too much to give them up.A series of events one night after a particularly bad date changes Mikki's life forever. She wakens to find herself transported to a completely different world, the Realm of the Rose, where she is the Empousa, the High Priestess of the Goddess Hecate. Mikki's role in this new realm is to oversee the care and keeping of the roses, for the health and vitality of these roses is what keeps the boundaries between the worlds strong. To aid her in this operation she has the assistance of the four Elementals -- Air, Flame, Water and Earth -- and the Guardian: a half-man, half-beast magical creature who is the protector/enforcer of the Realm of the Rose. He is also the living incarnation of her dream.Mikki and the Guardian must learn to work together in order to protect the Realm and the roses. But the Guardian, having endured aeons of ostracism and suspicion because of his beastly form, is reserved and hesitant, even as he is drawn to Mikki and she to him. Additionally, he has spent the last two centuries being punished for his unwise attraction to a human, and he doesn't want to risk his honor (and possible banishment) again. And quite plainly, there is a huge part of him that just finds it impossible to believe that Mikki could see past his beast-form to the man he is inside.This was a great story for me. I loved watching Mikki and the Guardian's relationship develop, and found their attraction to one another to be completely plausible. There's a small section in the middle that didn't interest me much, but it was brief and didn't derail my interest in the book. I also loved that Cast stayed true to the integrity of her story. In her acknowledgements, she gives a shout-out to her editor, who understood that the beast really did need to be a beast. Over the years, I've read tons of Beauty and the Beast stories, but the deus ex machina at the end always wraps things up too neatly and too predictably. There's one in this book, too, don't get me wrong, but I was totally satisfied by the ending of this story."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"Settling down with one of P.C. Cast's goddess books is an experience in the best of smart, modern fantasy. Each book is better than the last and they're all a blast to read. This one blends Tulsa, Oklahoma with roses, wine, a love of reading and believable magic-laden action juxtaposed with everyday life. In other words, it's easy to relate to the heroine who while appealing isn't your typical blonde-lassed young thang. A particularly cool device is this notion of being able to leave the ordinary world behind to take up a supernatural destiny. If you've never read a P.C. Cast, this is a great one to start with.

Cast takes a fresh crack at them, adding spunk and new spirit to them. This time, Cast has woven the old story of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" into Greek myth. \\"Goddess of the Rose\\" is the story of Mikado Empousa, a middle-aged woman in Tulsa who has started having \\"crazy\\" sexual dreams about a beast. After a failed blind date, Mikki goes for a walk in the local flower gardens, bleeds over some flowers and a statue, and gets whisked away to the Realm of the Rose to be the Priestess (Empousai) to the goddess Hecate.Cast's characterization for Mikki was wonderful. I loved how Mikki was in complete denial of being this Priestess because, let's face it, as wonderful as that sounds to us, we would freak out if we were in a similar situation. Mikki is a wonderfully complex character, with a wide range of emotions that make her easy to relate to. The reader might not relate to the situation, but she can always relate to how Mikki's feelings.Sadly, Mikki is probably the only truly complex character. The Guardian (the Beast) has his issues, but he is pretty static throughout the book, obsessing over Mikki and refusing to let himself have her, only to obsess over her and finally get her. The handmaidens are delightfully flat individuals, as stock as they come. I never did understand why the handmaiden who represented fire was so wary of Mikki.As a mythology buff, I was drawn to Cast's books the minute I read about them. Normally her use of Greek myth is dead on, and I enjoy how she weaves the myth into her own story. This time, however, I was disappointed. Hecate is often taken to be the goddess of magic and witchcraft, but was never intended as thus. Her first appearance in Thrace had her painted as the goddess of crossroads, wilderness, and childbirth. Moreover, Homer (the man who all but created Greek mythology) never mentions Hecate when he discusses the births of the other gods. It is more recently that she has been called the goddess of sorcery and magic.Altogether, Cast's \\"Goddess of the Rose\\" is a nice read that will help you pass time. As long as you're not looking for anything Earth-shattering and you aren't paying too much attention to the flatness of the characters, you'll thoroughly enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"Of all in the Goddess Summoning series, this one is above the rest.

She finds herself faced with the decision to return to the Realm of the Rose and become a goddess or have the Guardian come to the mundane world (and appear normal) to live a life time with her.Overall, the story is well written, vivid (but not overly), and has a satisfying ending. I am an avid book reader and can knock this one out in a day. I would recomend this to someone who has a day to relax or needs a day to relax."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"If you are a fan of Cast or of beauty and the beast stories then you will enjoy this book. I found it to be a very nice and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"This is the first PC Cast novel I've read. I enjoyed learning about the mythology involved and even found myself researching more, and I ordered the next book \\"goddess of spring\\". The love between Mikki and the Gaurdian is totally endearing and heart-warming, and especially that he is so shy.I give this one 4 and 1/2 stars and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys paranormals, time-travels, fantasy romances as well."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"Mikki feels out of synch with the world around her and the only thing that pleases her is her award winning roses that she cares for by giving them her blood during the new moon. She begins having dreams of a man-monster and a woman gives her rose scented anointing oil. In a play about Medea, she is asked to read some lines about Hecatate. Afterward she then visits the rose garden in the park and uses her blood to heal the sickening roses. Her blood accidentally is smeared on the statue of a minotaur creature and he suddenly comes to life, chasing her until she loses consciousness.Mikki awakens in the Realm of the Roses and her handmaidens tell her that she is the High Priestness of Hecate. She awoke the Guardian who was entombed in the statue in the garden in Tulsa. Now he is back to protect the realm while the Priestess is to care for the roses so that the realm will survive and magick and dreams will be sent out to all the worlds. The Guardian is forbidden by Hecate to love the high priestess unless she can love the man inside the outer visage of a monster. Mikki brings new life and changes the realm and in return the denizens love here include the Guardian but can beauty love the beast and if so when tragedy strikes will eternity keep them apart?PC Cast who is well known for her blending of mythological tales and romance creates in GODDESS OF THE ROSE a beautiful adult fairy tale when the heroine teaches the Guardian to see himself through her eyes and is willing to sacrifice herself to save the realm. Mikki feels at home in her new world because she is connected to it through her blood and the roses. Readers will be enchanted by GODDESS OF THE ROSE.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"It is sad to see the electronic version cost more than paper.

Decent writer, clever marketing."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"I thought the book started slow and flat inthe begining, but it starts to pick when the heroine is sent to the Relm of the Roses. It is there she begins to understand her roots.. She also finds herself facinating and attracted to a beast with the heart and soul of a man. I won't go into every aspect of this novel but I did enjoy the concept of the story, I have always been a big fan of Beauty and the Beast...and I likd the premise of the story, for those who wished the beast never turned into the prince...."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"This book was very well written and full of P.C.

Thanks for such enjoyment."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"P.C. Cast a fresh writer with a great deal of skill. Her first books were also good, but recently her books have gotten better and better. Excellent read.SIDE NOTE: I requested this book months ago, and was happy with Amazon.com's prompt serivce and delivery."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"I bought this book based on the strong reviews, never having read this author, and being one to enjoy a good fantasy read. I won't review the plot - others have done so. This book has some good qualities - a nice blending of the real world and the imaginative, mythology and creativity, some good dialog. However, this book is mostly about Mikki; few of the other characters have, well, character. The Guardian is the only significant other male character - in the Kingdom of the Rose, men must be invited in (and only after the Empousa - aka Mikki - casts an inviting spell) And the Guardian has had no experience with women. The whole Goddess routine of commanding and summoning got a little thin, along with descriptions of flowing robes and tending roses. The writing was also mix: obviously lots of research to ensure accuracy, but then, on ONE page these two phrases 'spherically shaped circle' (like there's another kind?) and 'Spiraling out like spokes on a wheel' (huh?). The climax is late in the book (kinda boring getting to that point); the problem is all Mikki's fault because she made a pretty dumb mistake; she makes things all better and then gets to live happily ever after."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"A really good 'magic kingdom with dark twists' story of which the romance is almost an inconsequence.The heroine is a complete nut-case. She Has Issues. She should have started talking to her psychiatrist friend long before she began having strange dreams. I suggest that she should have sought help when she first started cutting her hands and feeding her blood to her roses. That is not normal behaviour. Even for a rose enthusiast.This is the first romance I've read with an undercurrent of man-hate in it. Also there are far far too many women in this story. Mothers, grandmothers, goddesses, handmaidens, actresses to name but a few. Already I feel sorry for the hero. Living in this Land of Women. Some of whom are quite vindictive.But my main gripe is that by page 91 there has been absolutely minimal interaction between the hero and heroine. In fact. I don't even know the hero's name yet.Let's look at Mikki's little job. She's an 'executive assistant' in a large hospital. Ok. Another name for a gofer. And what, I suppose, is the dream of an immature gofer. Why. To Be The Boss and have gofers of their own. Which is exactly what happens in Mikki's fantasy. But a 35 yo? Come on. She should have more options than that about what to do with her life. Plus. She can't handle a guy who has different reading tastes from her but is more than happy to accept love from someone who is essentially a slave with a MD.Getting to the crux. This is a novel about carnal love between a woman and a beast. The hero has cloven hooves and horns. And then the author wimps out by having the pagan goddess Hecate take away his ability to consumate that love unless the heroine begs for it. I mean. The poor guy doesn't control his own fertility. If that happened to a female character do you think it would be acceptable? In a pig's eye it would. That's what I call man-hate. Also the hero is really simplistically portrayed and doesn't really act out of free-will.tbh. I never liked roses that much anyway. I could hate them after reading this story. Poor Mikki is a slave to the stupid plants. And, as becomes obvious as the novel progresses, she's also somewhat dumb. She must have seen the movie Jason and the Argonauts. Hecate is not a benign goddess. Plus. Those dogs which accompany her should have given Mikki a big clue as to the true nature of the Realm of the Roses, which actually turns out to be a realm of nightmares rather than nicey-wicey dreams. It is not acceptable for a thinking human being to give up her life for the sake of flowering vegetation. Mikki returns to the Realm of the Roses. But I would never have done so. The place is drenched in blood. Ugh. I couldn't really connect with Mikki. She's too earthy and, to repeat, is basically a man-hater.What I liked about the novel is how Mikki's strange little behaviours are amplified in her fantasy world, but her other worries (job dissatisfaction, lack of a love-life) are completely solved. I thought the author handled Mikki's re-entry to the real world in a very clever, seamless manner. Mikki never spared a single thought for the pain her friends might have felt about her attack and consequent departure back to Roseland. Another characteristic of the mentally disturbed. The more I think about the plot of this novel the more it creeps me out.But. A few years ago I might have loved this story."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"In the past, I've enjoyed Ms. Cast's books. They've been delightful & I read them over & over. This was a complete waste of time. It's slow starting, boring and dull. As much as I love roses & work so hard to keep mine in good health I would draw the line at feeding them my blood. Yuck!!"},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"This has got to be one of most boring books I have ever read. Or I should say half read. I can't believe with all of really great reads out there that someone would find this book good. I am going to dump this one on the book shelves at my gym. Maybe for free it makes a better read. However I doubt that."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"I contacted ZP books several time to see where my order was since it was late.

Wonderful characters, wonderful worlds, warm loving feelings and a joyful story. I loved it.Mikado Empousai is a unique individual, her blood can actually protect and raise the most beautiful roses in the world. She has only used her unusual powers to grow prize winning roses. The powers are handed down by the women in her familly. She is the last. Now she works at the rose gardens at Woodward Park in Tulsa. Whether by accident or the powers that be, Mikado completes a goddess summoning ritual and frees the imprisioned Guardian at the Park. Ultimately finding out she is a Priestess of The REalm of the Roses.The Guardian is a beast with the heart and soul of a man imprisioned inside. He has committed a crime against Hecate his Goddess, now that he is free he grabs Mikki and returns to the Realm of the Roses. A son of one of the titans he was cursed at birth to look like a beast. Being the only one of his kind leaves him to live a lonely hollow existance. But now he is determined to redeem himself and return to his job as Guardian of the Realm of the Roses. Not for him is touch or softness only duty.Whatever you expect from this story, you get so much more. The interaction between the Guardian and the Priestess, as well as the citizens of this wonderful land is priceless. You only find a book like this once in a long while. Do not miss it. If you like love, romance, duty and heartwarming devotion this one is for you. I am so thankful I did not miss it.This wonderful retelling of a Beauty and the Beast tale is so different and warm and I can only say I look forward to more of the Goddess Summoning Tales by P C Cast. Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"P.C. Cast creates new tales from old myths. In her latest book, she interweaves the tale of the Minotaur with Beauty and the Beast to create a fascinating story. Mikado \\"Mikki\\" Empousai hides a family secret; for generations, the women in her family have been gifted with the ability to grow beautiful roses with only a small sacrifice to feed the roses. However, this time things go a little differently as she inadvertently invokes a sacred ritual and awakens the Guardian who then transports her to the Realm of the Rose. Mikki agrees to devote herself to the goddess Hecate and begins work on restoring the roses in the Realm as she feels at home in this world. She sees the man underneath the beast in the Guardian, Asterius, as he shows her the magic of the Realm. She learns of the Dream Weavers and even more importantly of those who weave the tapestry of life that allows dreams to come true. Disaster strikes when four Dream Stealers, Hatred, Fear, Envy, and Selfishness, manage to enter the Realm of the Rose and taint the roses. As the roses begin rapidly dying, Mikado has to make the ultimate sacrifice. P.C. Cast has created an enchanting story that captivates the reader. Despite liking several other works by Cast, I wasn't sure I was going to like this book. However, the conclusion of the novel made the entire journey worthwhile as Cast cleverly tied together all aspects of the novel."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"To start off, I immediately liked this book because Beauty and the Beast is one of my classic favorites and this book was the author's personal take on the beloved tale. I have to tell you it astounded me how different it was and yet managed to enchant me within minutes. The mysteries implore you to read on and find the answers even as you lose yourself to the great plot.Mikki is the heroine who ends up accidentally breaking the Beast's curse and freeing him from his imprisonment. In exchange for his freedom, the Beast whisks Mikki off to the Realm of the Rose where he is Guardian. A land he is both awed and feared in but non-the-less calls home. Mikki slowly starts to see the inner working of both the people and the Realm and develops feelings for both. But can a human love a beast? She will have to find out while dodging enemies, unraveling mysteries and giving in to her darkest desires. A task daunting at times but ultimately worth the price it comes with.The first thing I noticed was the author's great descriptions. The story came to life off the pages and I felt like I was able to explore along with the heroine. And then there are the great characters. The heroine is quite loveable and sees the best in everyone. Makes a person cheer for her in her quest to right the wrongs done purposely or inadvertently. The hero is the haunted beast as you may have guessed. But P.C. Cast really puts a new take on him. For me he became more real, facing the dilemmas and hardships never mentioned in any other story but all too real in life. Quite an interesting pair and really worth the read.If there was anything I didn't like about this book, it was the ending. And that's because this is one of those books that you read and hate to see end. Eventually it will, but if you are like me, you will be so wrapped up in the story that the end will happen too fast and leave you wanting. Fortunately, this author has more great stories and the journey can continue in those pages for the avid reader."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"Another wonder installment in P.C. Cast's \\"Goddess Summoning\\" series (though don't let the \\"series\\" banner deter you -- each book stands alone. They're just linked by the mythic connection). Just when I think she might be getting a little formulaic, she proves me wrong. In \\"Goddess of the Rose,\\" Cast masterfully blends Beauty & the Beast with the myth of the minotaur, the underworld goddess Hecate and her own spin on Greek mythology to create a vibrant world filled with likeable characters and a plot that does keep you guessing. OK, it's a romance so you know there will be a happy ending -- that's one of the charms -- but part of the fun in Cast's books is trying to figure out how she's going to resolve the impossible situation she set up and then enjoying her clever and logical solution. I especially like the spiritual undertones in her books, which in this case includes forgiveness and learning from mistakes, not to mention not judging by appearances.I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend P.C. Cast's books. She has become one of my all-time favorite favorite authors. Her annual Goddess Summoning novel is an auto-buy for me along with Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter series (I'm loath to compare people, but Cast is technically the better writer though both create great characters in intricate mythic settings). My only disappointment is that Cast only releases one of these novels a year but if writing faster hurt the quality -- and it probably would -- I'll stick with this pace. Why wreck a great thing?"},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"I really liked \\"Goddess of Spring\\", the only other book I've read by Cast. I picked this one up because I really like the Beauty and the Beast story. I fully get that this is her own reimagination and some of the aspects are pretty cool. I liked the interesting things about roses(even though her focus on the garden is what makes the book slower, not that I'm complaining--it was her purpose), the Elementals, and Dream Stealers. The book probably could have done with more of the Dream Stealers. The book is slow paced and a bit predictable. It doesn't take long for the characters to like each other, though real romance takes a while. So, all I mean is it could have used some more suspense in it. There are alot of really great details in the book. Dream stealers, how dreams are made, how dreams come true are all great ideas in the book. The sex scenes were very slightly violent, but not weird as I thought they might be. The end of the book gets pretty quick and all the the loose ends are tied up. I enjoyed all of it. Mikado had girl power, most of the time and I liked her as a main character. Hecate also was awesome."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"A good read with a simple storyline and likeable characters. There are no twist or turns and the romance develops easily. The author does not really develop the characters beyond the surface, though they were both likeable enough. If you are into more complex storylines and characters you probably won't appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"Goddess of the Rose by P.C. CastThis is a lovely paranormal romance. It is like a wonderful grown-up fairy tale. I believe the author even states that she based it on the premise of Beauty and the Beast, but in this case the Beast did not transform into the \`usual' prince at the end.If you are looking for a fast read. This book is NOT it. P.C. Cast builds her characters slowly unfolding the plot with care and grace. This allowed me to understand the characters and to come to love them.Mikki has a rare gift with roses, she is transported by the Goddess Hectate to the Realm of the Rose and there she meets the guardian or Beast, Asterius. Asterius is treated poorly since all the inhabitants of the Realm of the Rose are afraid of a Beast. Only Mikki has the insight to see the wonderfully noble and lonely soul beneath the beastly exterior. Suffice to say there is a lot of self sacrifice and the novel ends happily. But boy did I cry a lot until it did end happily.What I took away from this story is the beautiful love the 2 characters had for each other. Many of the romances, just sort state the characters are in love but the reader misses the area of the book in between where the love blossomed. In other words, there isn't a courtship period! Although P C Cast's Goddess series are not fast reads they take the time for this reader to really enjoy the journey!Reviewed by Steph at Bookaholics Romance Book Club"},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"Being a woman that loved the Beast in Beauty and the Beast, not only the childrens story but the old TV show, I was one who was dissapointed when the beast turned into a prince. This is one of the BEST books I have ever read. P C Cast will have a reader for life if all the rest are like this one. Being the first book of hers that I have read I hope the rest are as good. Not only does the book have a love story it challenges you to look up greek mythology just to see where she is coming from. I was totally enchanted from the beginning to the last page. I could feel the Guardians claws on my own back and could smell the roses too. The imagination that Ms Cast has is awesome. I couldnt put it down. I definitly reccomend this to anyone that is looking for the \\"different\\" romance that stirs your heart as well as your imagination."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"The Empousai women have a secret to growing roses. By making a shallow cut in the palm of their hands and mixing their blood with water, the roses in their care bloom spectacularly. Mikki follows this tradition but has no idea that the reason it works is because she has the blood to be a high priestess of Hecate. When she accidentally sprinkles some on a statue of a beast in the Tulsa Rose Gardens, she awakens him and he takes her to Hecate's Realm of the Rose where she is to fulfill her destiny as the Empousa and the Beast is to resume his role as Guardian of the Realm. Mikki quickly learns to see the man within the beast and begins to fall in love like she never suspected was possible. The beast tries to keep his distance, given his past mistakes and his knowledge of Mikki's true destiny but feels himself being drawn in as well in this twist on a classic fairy tale.I didn't enjoy this one quite as much as the other Goddess novels; maybe it was the beast love, or maybe it was the weak goddess tie (linking Beauty and the Beast to the Greek Minotaur was pushing the limits of believability, even for a fantasy novel!). Whatever the reason, the plot just didn't draw me in. I do love P.C. Cast's imagination when it comes to describing the various realms and worlds she sends these mortal women to. Still a light, quick, summer read that will pass the time relatively enjoyably."},{"Title":"Goddess of the Rose (Goddess Summoning, Book 4)","review":"I've compulsively read all the Beauty and the Beast retellings that I've come across (across whatever genres) - as it's my favorite fairy tale. This is one of the best! (Up there with my favorites: Robin McKinley and Mercedes Lackey's versions). At first I thought it would be too dark and weird, but the characterizations are fantastic, and she hits all the key parts of the classic B&B fairytale. \\"Beauty\\" and her Guardian's relationship was beautifully developed, and the emotions were very touching. As I'm not a fan of contemporary novels, I was glad that Cast didn't spend much time in the current \\"mundane\\" world, but had most of the story set in the otherworldy realm.

How many times and in how many ways can an author tell us that when companies consolidate they must present their financial statements to appear as if they were a single company? This is not the only instance of use of repetition. An effectly written book would not have to repeat itself so much. If the concept is presented correctly the student will get it the first time!Additionally, the author spends too much time talking about outdated accounting methods and in many cases makes no preface as to the fact that they are no longer acceptable methods. So, while the student tries to drill this information in, he doesn't realize that it is inconsequential information.Throughout the text the authors refer the reader to Figures and Exhibits.

I remember reading the prequel \\"The Indian in the Cupboard\\" and thinking that it was a nice enough story, but it didn't leave a big impression on me. On the other hand, reading \\"The Return of the Indian\\" took Omri's amazing story to a completely different level.There's so much adventure and excitement packed into this one book. I almost couldn't stand the suspense in certain parts!It's the Perfect read for anyone who likes a bit of thrilling action!"},{"Title":"The Return of the Indian","review":"\\"The Return of the Indian\\" is a very good book, and probably a better one than \\"The Indian in the Cupboard\\". The story is about a boy(Omri) who finds a locked cupboard in a garbage can in the streets of London. When his mother gives him a key that fits no lock in his house, he tries the key on the cupboard it opens! And the story goes farther when he puts a plastic Indian he got from his friend Patric, in the cupboard, and it comes to life!! That was the \\"Indian in the Cupboard\\". In the \\"Return of the Indian\\", Omri brings back his Indian(Little Bear) and a cowboy, theres even more fun. But when something Happens to Little Bear, Omri must bring even more plastic figures to life, like a very patient and kind nurse, A marine squad with a howitzer and blazing machine guns, and a load of Iroquois tomahawks that want revenge on the English for burning their homes. I loved the action and suspense in this book. I liked the creative storyline, but I think the Author rushes a certain part of the book.

Brain development or poor sensory integration were never addressed in my college of education. My husband (also a teacher) & I found it on our own because the curriculum the school district used was minimally effective and very boring for our kids who had behavior problems. Using a brain development focus (based initially on John Bowlby's attachment theory which was the perfect vehicle for brain develop curriculum) our kids excelled and they were again excited about learning. This book is really about brain development and how child learn. Sensory integration dysfunction is what results when a child's brain isn't stimulated though his/her senses, which is how humans learn and develop perception. Why don't colleges that prepare teachers for their jobs address the foundation of learning: sensory integration? Why don't schools have curricula that addresses the first seven years of brain development as the foundation for learning? This book could move schools from re-form to transformation, which is what really needs to happen. get this book and education yourself. I actually got out of education because it was the proverbial up-stream battle to be an effective teacher."},{"Title":"Sensory Integration and the Child: 25th Anniversary Edition","review":"This book is well worth reading by both parents and beginning therapists.

This seems to be more of a dissertation, not a book to help parents."},{"Title":"Sensory Integration and the Child: 25th Anniversary Edition","review":"I cannot understand what people consider \\"defending\\" and \\"dissertation\\" about this book....Throughout the book I find an easy to understand language with comprehensive explanations of technical term, e.g., in a glossary (yes, this is a concept based on neurology and developmental psychology, so there is some technical language) and with lots of examples and pictures to illustrate the complex concept of how processing and integration information from our senses influences our physical, emotional, cognitive, social development, our view of ourselves and of the world, and our development into successful occupational beings. And Dr. Ayres describes the widespread consequences of disruptions of this neurophysiological process.This book transforms the reader's view of children - all at a sudden it's not just \\"behavior\\" anymore but you start to ask \\"why does this child behave like this?\\" To me, this is the most valuable and unique contribution of this book: to make adults step into the shoes of children with difficulties and imagine how it must be to live with some kind of distorted perception of one's own body and the whole world."},{"Title":"Sensory Integration and the Child: 25th Anniversary Edition","review":"As a new grad I found this book very helpful in breaking down the different types of Sensory Integrations kiddos can with specifics on what to looks for and how to approach tx."},{"Title":"Sensory Integration and the Child: 25th Anniversary Edition","review":"As an Early Childhood Educator I found this book a solid and easy to read reference tool - for both sharing information with families, clarifying concerns and considering the wide range of diverse principles around working with the challenges of sensory integration issues.

Anything he liked has to be worth a look, I figure. Drabble has a Peanutsian tone, with simple, unoffensive gags. Had I not made the mental connection with Peanuts, I might have written Drabble off as corny and uninspiring. Once I realized it's not TRYING to be as edgy as most comics try to be, I liked it better for what it is. I suspect Drabble is most enjoyable in the newspaper, served up one strip a day. Somehow the simplicity of each gag works best that way.

As an author, or artist as she would prefer, she is generally remembered by critics as a top notch short story writer at the level of Henry James. Her only completed and published large novel is Ship of Fools.Beginning work on this novel, at least 25 years passed before Ship of Fools saw print in 1961. Possibly the longer novel had its germination as early as the 1930s. Taking note of her struggles, many of her friends advised her to give up this longer novel and go on to other things. However, she was tenacious, and Katherine Anne Porter was determined. Finally by 1961 the novel was ready for print, and in that year she had \\"prepublication interviews in both Time and Newsweek\\" magazines. As she said at that time finally \\"finished the whole damn thing in six weeks.\\". By then Katherine Anne Porter was 68 years of age. Ship of Fools drew very mixed reviews, generally in Europe and specifically in Germany.Accordingly, Ship of Fools takes up quite a bit of space in Professor Hendrick's book. Ship of Fools was a great commercial success and was \\"sold to United Artists for $400,000.00\\" at a time when many working folks earned only $4000.00 per year! In 1965, the Collected Stories of Katherine Anne Porter was published winning both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. In 1970 the Collected Essays and Occasional Writings of Katherine Anne Porter was published by Delacorte Press. No new material appears from Katherine Anne Porter before the artist died on September 18th, 1980.Since Professor Hendrick's book was published in 1965 none of the information in the last paragraph comes from Professor Hendrick's 1965 book. However, the reputation of Katherine Anne Porter will always rest on several short stories, essays, and her one large novel, Ship of Fools. When his book was published Professor Hendrick could not realize Ms. Porter's writing career had pretty much dried up. Katherine Anne Porter's published writing career effectively ended with the publication of Ship of Fools. She did, however, contribute to the screenplay for the movie, Ship of Fools.I've always enjoyed reading this author/artist but also feel she did herself a great disservice by not being more productive. However, if one is familiar at all with \\"Callie\\" one realizes she could never be more than she was. So true with any one of us, as she said once she had had a hard life, but much of it was her own doing. I would also add: or undoing.Several good biographies are available and The Library of America has issued a single volume of her writings. All mentioned books are at present still available from Amazon.Hopefully, in the future, The Library of America will see its way to publish another volume containing Ship of Fools and her other non-fiction items as well. Professor Hendrick continually refers to a diary or journal the artist kept early in her writings. If, and that is a LARGE if, the thing still exists OR ever exited, those notes and writings could also be included. From her own conversations she said many times down through the years, she had destroyed, burned, etc. hundreds of her written work.As Katherine Anne Porter also continually stated, to read her work is to know all there is to know of her. She had little use for an autobiography and maintained most of her writings are autobiographical. She felt that by reading her published work was to know her.A very interesting, talented artist but one who somehow remains somewhat remote."},{"Title":"Experiencing the Soul","review":"A heart-soaring experience which holds a mirror that allows us to see humanity at its very best.--Stephen Simon, producer of What Dreams May Come and Somewhere in Time"},{"Title":"Experiencing the Soul","review":"I have been buying this book for friends as gifts.

Although I often worked overtime, it took forever to get anything done. I had no time for lunch so I was always tired. Filing cabinets full of old folders, a desk cluttered with reams of paper, family pictures, inkless pens, an outdated computer, a floor crowded with boxes of ancient files and boxes of supplies hindered me every time I tried to start a project, interview a client, or take a phone message. After spending a whole afternoon looking for an important document, I was so stressed that I thought of quitting. Fortunately, I went home and read Don's book instead. What a revelation! I thought that maybe this book would help me learn how to organize all that stuff. Instead, Don offered a more common sense approach. He suggested that if I got rid of most of it, the rest of the stuff would almost organize itself. With that in mind, I spent a whole weekend shoveling and bailing myself out of a 13 year accumulation of stuff. As I worked, I referred to Don's book. With subtle humor and gentle compassion for the average office clutterer, Don guided me with suggestions and techniques for &quot;finding the gold&quot; and getting rid of the rest. On Monday morning, I sat down in my clean and organized office and started on my first task. By noon, I had accomplished so much, that I was able to take an hour for lunch with my friends. By the end of the day, all my tasks were completed - and it had all seemed so easy! My boss started to notice that I was getting things done and began giving me more and better tasks. Since I no longer needed to work overtime, my stress-level decreased and I had lots of energy. After a few months of being dejunked and organized, I received a nice commendation - AND A BIG RAISE- with time to enjoy spending the money. Everyone thinks that I'm working harder - but I'm just working smarter. I also cleaned and organized my nine-year old son's &quot;office&quot; at home. He doesn't complain as much about his homework and is bringing home great report cards.It's great to be in control again of my office, my home, my life. Everything seems so sunny and rosy now. In Don's book, as well as in my book, the simple (dejunked) life is the better life. Don, keep on writing, and I'll keep on buying your books. Thanks for everything."},{"Title":"The Office Clutter Cure: How to Get Out from Under It All!","review":"When I was the secretary and the executive assistant, I was the best and most organized person any boss could want. When I became the boss, I became buried in meetings, interruptions, customer service and problems, no one to delegate to, and fear of losing something important. In the past 7 years I have bought many &quot;organizational&quot; books - some I even bought twice because they never got through to me (didn't even impress me enough to remember I had bought them before!) to help me tackle the piles of paper. I pretty much shuffled stacks around until I bought Don's book. I started reading it yesterday, and after being out sick for one week, I went in today (Saturday) and in 4 hours, cleaned out 3 years of paper. I didn't just clean - I got rid of. I looked at everything with new eyes. Don has a way of putting all that paper into clear perspective - you can look at paper and see if it should go or stay. It was incredible. Now my mind is decluttered too - just like he said. I would recommend this to anyone who has a lot of paper (and facts) to deal with. His common-sense approach helps you make it your own - there's nothing to learn - he just puts it all in perspective so you can know how YOU want to deal with it. I've never written a review before - but couldn't wait to write this one. I hope this helps some other person tackle their paper. I accomplished more today than I can remember in one day - and know this will help me stay organized and cut back on the 70 hr weeks I normally put in. My employees respect me, but I always felt out of control with all that paper staring me (and everyone else) in the face. Now my office looks like I am in control! Thanks, Don!"},{"Title":"The Office Clutter Cure: How to Get Out from Under It All!","review":"This is classic Aslett -- it will have you pitching half the papers on your desk in no time. Aslett has some good ideas on how to begin to conquer the clutter of accumulated paper, and ideas that can be used in discrete time increments. Of all the clutter / office organization books I've read, his are the only ones that actually make me eager to get to work.Two reasons I gave this book four stars rather than five, are (1) because of Aslett's gratuitous name-dropping &amp; boasting (when my coimpany was cleaning AT&amp;T, when I was consulting with the top executives of IBM, when I was making one of my many TV appearances with Regis &amp; Kahie Lee . . . ); and (2) because Aslett seems to consider himself an expert on all things rather than sticking to what he knows best. Of course, I've read most of his books, and there is some redundancy, as if they're just regurgitations of former material. If you haven't read his other books, you might not have this perception. Nonetheless, every time I read one of his books I can manage to throw out several boxes of stuff, and after reading this, my office at work no longer has any hidden stacks of papers waiting to be dealt with."},{"Title":"The Office Clutter Cure: How to Get Out from Under It All!","review":"I received an autographed copy of this book from Don Aslett a couple years ago after writing to him in praise of his &quot;Clutter&quot; series of books. So huzzah to Don! :-) I found this book, like his others, to be entertaining and eye opening. The only reason for four stars is that it seems geared toward a smaller office, where the decision to pitch files and streamline may be handled a little more easily. I think more space might have been devoted to how to deal with &quot;bureaucratic&quot; offices such as mine, where useless stuff must be &quot;archived&quot; with the okay of the higher ups. So much stuff I would love to pitch in the trash can, but can't, due to red tape. So someone who has full control of what stays, what goes, might glean more useful advise from this. I particularly enjoyed his office &quot;types&quot; list...Homefront Hannah, etc. I think everyone can identify with these."},{"Title":"The Office Clutter Cure: How to Get Out from Under It All!","review":"I don't work in an office. I work in a classroom. However, I found that much of what is said in this book applies to me.I teach science, and have worked in 2 different schools where I inherited the previous teacher's mess. In the first one, I applied many of Aslett's principles without even realizing it. There was so much junk that I couldn't even work. I did almost no labs my first year because I couldn't find anything!At my new school, started by organizing. Recently, I read this book and was inspired. I went through my storage area and threw out every broken piece of equipment. I also snuck out a few pieces of equipment that I knew I would never use.It has been a wonderful feeling. I now have room to have a sort of &quot;office&quot; in my storage room. I can find equipment quickly, making me more likely to do labs, and I have created room for the equipment I plan to order that I will use.I see no obvious connection, but I now get my work done a lot faster. I write a lot of my own material. Before I did my decluttering I was working until midnight or later. Now I'm going home for supper, and coming back and working only a few more hours.His book is not so big on specifics. That is why I did not give it a fifth star. A few more specific ideas on organizing papers and the clutter I'm required to have would have helped. Overall, however, he covers the general principles of clutter removal and organization, he is inspiring, and, most important, this book is a help.Honestly, this book made me a better teacher!"},{"Title":"The Office Clutter Cure: How to Get Out from Under It All!","review":"As owner of one of the U.S.'s largest cleaning firms, author Don Aslett has first hand experience with the way that mess and confusion can impede a good day's work. His book shines a light on the chaos, from overflowing wastebaskets to staggering stacks of paper, to (gasp!) the inside of the communal refrigerator. He reveals why out-of-control office clutter is not simply unsightly, but harmful to your productivity and your career. Then, he offers the cure, including ways to reduce paper accumulation, organize your workspace, weed through the junk and create your own filing system. He brings humor, enthusiasm and passion to tackling the daunting job you need to do before you can do your real job. If you want to be liberated from your office mess and experience the exhilaration of a clutter-free work life, we recommend this book - just put it on top of your stack."},{"Title":"The Office Clutter Cure: How to Get Out from Under It All!","review":"Ever since I read this book, my office has never looked better. Because I've gotten rid of all the clutter mentioned in this book - like any office supplies that are miniature, duplicate items, stamps with old addresses on them, just to name a few - I've become more organized than usual and have more focus than usual.The author helps you organize from the point of view of a janitor, which is something I never considered before. I now make sure to pick up any paper clips I've accidentally dropped on the floor and make sure if I toss paper in the waste basket and miss, I make the effort to put it in.He also points out the need to be considerate of others co-workers, which I greatly appreciated. One of my pet peeves is when people bring in smelly food to work (like fish) and then leave it in their waste basket to stink up the whole place. I also get annoyed when people use hairspray at their desk or wear very strong perfume.This author helps you declutter (rather than simply organize) your office at work and at home. He does have a flair for the dramatic. I think some of the statistics are untrue and examples are exaggerated, but still found this book very helpful. He really leaves no stone unturned."},{"Title":"The Office Clutter Cure: How to Get Out from Under It All!","review":"This book is a humorous pictural guide to reducing office clutter. It offers many reasons for \\"86-ing\\" piles of useless clutter and suggests alternate solutions such as using a briefcase."},{"Title":"The Office Clutter Cure: How to Get Out from Under It All!","review":"Don Aslett's Office Clutter Cure book isn't technically about office efficiency, but you will find if you follow his advice to clear the clutter from your office space, you will automatically increase your efficiency - it will inevitably happen without you even thinking much about it. You'll be able to find things easier, and for some reason, most people get more work done if their work area is cleaner. It might seem that there's no logical connection between clean work space and productivity, but it does exist (although I know many people think they work better in a messy office).Don Aslett has a great sense of humor, and it shines through in this delightful and easy to read book. Highly recommended if you work in a cubicle or small office."},{"Title":"The Office Clutter Cure: How to Get Out from Under It All!","review":"I teach this stuff, and this is the best book on the subject.

The first time we read it together, my daughter and I giggled at the clever rhymes, frenzied pace, and sudden ending. The animals get together for a feast, and all the foods they bring are vegetarian. \\"Moose bring juice and mice bring rice. Fleas bring peas and flies bring pies.\\" The story goes faster and faster, the rhyme almost becoming a tongue twister and the food flying around the table. Finally, at the end, the animals collapse into a pile to take a nap! This fun book requires at least two readings in a sitting. Enjoy! -Reviewed by Melanie Wilson"},{"Title":"Beastly Feast","review":"This book enhances children's awareness of rhyme (important reading skill) in a novel little story.

It is also a unique book in that the author tackles a topic not many have dwelled upon in 20th century thought. He presents emotion as a kind of perception that guides or organizes reason, but I would like to have seen more on this since he touches upon it briefly. The rest of the book is an excursion into epistemology and the author's own thoughts and evaluations. The book would have benefited from more examples as well. Come with a rich vocabulary (e.g., homunculi) and be prepared to tolerate rereading and dense language in attempting to follow arguments. I am not quite sure about the intended audience, but it would seem to be editors of philosophy or psychology journals, or the staff of philosophy departments. The average reader would need 2 to 3 times the number of pages to understand what is being talked about. This is a pity because the topic is important. Interestingly he uses 'she' for general reference. Overall, although it seems to be more of a skeptical justification that is bogged down in the analytic, cognitive approach, it is worth reading for the excellent ideas but does require forbearance."},{"Title":"The Rationality of Emotion (Bradford Books)","review":"I bought this book when I casually bumped into it in a bookshop. I was immediately captured by its intriguing title. The western culture we live in considers the rationality of emotion as absolute nonsense. (Some years later, I would read Antonio Damasio's \\"Descartes' Error\\" who takes this argument a step further, and convincingly shows that our emotional brain ultimately produces rationality !)To prove his point, Ronald de Sousa focuses on the way our emotions evolve during our lifetime. He starts his investigation with the way philosophy has treated emotions so far, trying to classify them, but without being able to come up with the definitive list. He then formulates the following hypothesis : \\"... yet it cannot be denied that there are, in other animals as in human babies, modes of behavior that we take to express something like human emotions. I think we can understand, in principle, how our repertoire of emotions gets built up, without positing a set of \\"primary emotions\\" that get combined like basic blocks or even mixed like primary colors. We do need a repertoire of primitive instinctual responses, but emotions are not mere responses. My hypothesis is this : We are made familiar with the vocabulary of emotion by association with paradigm scenarios. These are drawn first from our daily life as small children and later reinforced by the stories, art, and culture to which we are exposed. Later still, in literate cultures, they are supplemented and refined by literature. Paradigm scenarios involve two aspects : first, a situation type providing the characteristic objects of the specific emotion-type, and second, a set of characteristic or \\"normal\\" responses to the situation, where normality is first a biological matter and then very quickly becomes a cultural one.\\"What makes us human is the development of our emotions, not the capacity to do mental arithmetic or read a map. Our neocortex is an extension of our limbic system, our emotional brain. That explains also why all our actions are motivated by our emotions. Morality goes hand in hand with underlying emotions.Now, the beauty of philosophy lies in the fact that de Sousa has been proven right by scientific investigation *afterwards*, confirming once again that philosophy is the mother of science. Helen Fisher would show in her book \\"Why we love\\", published in 2004, that when brain scans are performed on people that recently fell in love, compared to people who have a stable relationship for some years, there is a clear displacement of brain activity from the limbic system to the neocortex, from \\"being in love\\" as a primary emotion to \\"love\\" as a moral emotion."},{"Title":"The Rationality of Emotion (Bradford Books)","review":"I read this book a few years ago and found it interesting. Since then I have learned more about the philosophical ground of the scientific method guiding the author's approach. Reading it again now, with a deeper understanding, is a greater pleasure.Paul Thagard and Mario Bunge demonstrate the relation between science and philosophy, as well as between philosophy and reality. When one understands what these relationships are, then one can appreciate the effectiveness of de Sousa's approach to rationality in this book.It is almost thoroughly scientific in its methods. There is some reference to Freud, but it's not essential to the argument. And the author displays compassion along with a robust sense of humor.My favorite section of the book, which starts on page 190, is: \\"What Are Emotions For? A New Biological Hypothesis.\\"When I began to seriously consider what emotions are for and what their origins are in biology, I began to understand my experiencing of emotions as they occurred to me. So, I began to feel less helpless in the process.More understanding is always better for a human. Misunderstanding what emotions are for can lead to serious problems.Anyone seriously concerned with rationality will find this book very helpful.De Sousa's subsequent work adds to the benefits."},{"Title":"The Rationality of Emotion (Bradford Books)","review":"De Souza's book is an interesting examination of a little-understood or discussed topic in philosophy, but it suffers from an excess of currently-fashionable subjectivism/skepticism."},{"Title":"The Rationality of Emotion (Bradford Books)","review":"De Souza's book is an interesting examination of a little-understood or discussed topic in philosophy, but it suffers from an excess of currently-fashionable subjectivism/skepticism."},{"Title":"Dangerous Roads (Novel Devotions)","review":"What a great read! Once again, I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Hergenrader's novel/devotional. What a fabulous story of one teenager, Phil's, cross country adventure to college and how he learns more about himself with each mile traveled. I think these books are wonderful for teenagers and parents alike. Parents, if you want to know the kinds of issues your kids are facing and how to help them deal with their pressures in a Christian way, then this book is for you. I'd like to give one to every teenager I know!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Roads (Novel Devotions)","review":"In Christina Hergenrader's latest book, Phil is at a crossroads in his life. Still healing from a painful break up with Katy (DOUBLE SHIFT), Phil heads to college with new step-brother Zak. But accidents aren't the only road hazards Phil faces. Phil's faith is challenged by easy access to drugs and alcohol. Zak's influence also threatens Phil's belief in God. But when Phil crosses the line and ends up in jail, he realizes he's been on a detour from what God wants and must find his way back to the true path.This book is an excellent read whether you're 9 or 99. Ms. Heregenrader probes complex issues of faith and temptation with finesse and candor. This book doesn't preach and Ms. Hergenrader is never heavy-handed in her approach to spirituality. A perfect book to read at the beach, with the family, even in the classroom."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"In spite of some of the nit-pickers who fret about Manchester's generalizations, this book is for people who really like living, breathing characterizations of the ages and people who shaped the events of their time. Contrary to one reader's comment, this is not an anti-Catholic book. The Church has its sordid side in days past, but Manchester demonstrates that its positive strenghts and values survived some of the abuses of its leaders. I have recommened this book to many people including members of the clergy. Everyone has commented that they took some valuable knowledge away from it."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I read a lot of history, but not much on the Medieval-Renaissance period. I'm sure many of these critical reviews have a point. For an expert it would be annoying to have some facts oversimplified or misrepresented. But that is inevitable for a little book by someone who admits he is not a scholar of the times.I was mesmerized from beginning to end. Manchester transports the reader to an era (lit only by fire) that is almost incomprehensible to our take-it-for-granted society. Yes, we get interesting sketches of the monarchs, popes, artists and explorers, but the real treat is simply learning what life was like in those days.He spends considerable space discussing the \\"shattering\\" of the Catholic clergy's corrupt hold on all aspects of European life. Erasmus, Martin Luther and other humanists finally broke through in the 16th Century, challenging, among many other contradictions between theory and practice, the church's sale of indulgences--the absolution of past, present and future sin for the payment of money.But Manchester's account of Magellan's astounding circumnavigation is alone worth the price of admission. Do you know the derivation of the first person who went around the world (hint: he's not European)?For those of you unfamilar with William Manchester, this book was essentially written on his death bed as a break from his arduous work on the final volume of his Churchill trilogy, which unfortunately remained unfinished at his death. He is the greatest narrative historian I have read. Although his politics (liberal) are different from mine (conservative), his writings are rarely biased in that sense. He is controversal in his historical judgments, but backs it up with facts and reason. But above all his writing at its best is simply beautiful to behold. I also highly recommend American Caesar, The Glory and the Dream, Visions of Glory and Alone."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I have been reading a variety of books in the last year in a personal pursuit to learn more about the middle ages. My neighbor lent me this book and I am now buying it for my own collection to read again later.I found the book to be extremely well-written and challenging -- in more ways than one. The reviewers here have done a good job of summarizing some of the finer points of the text, and yes, I found discrepancies with some historical facts. But, those discrepancies were minor in light of the overall message of the book. Mr. Manchester was clear about his purpose at the beginning -- demonstrating how all things are intertwined and related. One little-known piece of information in this book that illustrates this philosophy that I found rather intriguing: the mother of Prince Henry the Navigator was influenced greatly by Chaucer who had a deep interest in maps and star-charting. She, in turn, infused this interest in her son. How different would European navigation and discovery have been without that influence? Just an interesting what-if to ponder...The negative reviews I have read on the book did not provide any good reason to avoid it. In fact, most stated that they they did not agree with what Mr. Manchester has written, but there is nothing wrong with disagreeing with a book. It is certainly does not make it a bad book. I have read many &quot;bad&quot; books, meaning poorly written, no purpose, no direction, lacking any real depth, and so on. In my opinion, this book does not match any of this criteria.As one reviewer wrote, you really have to read many books on a given subject to get a more-rounded understanding. I would highly recommend using this book as a piece in the puzzle of understanding medieval life, and learning a bit more about the characters that we all have been exposed to in some form of education. It was refreshing to read some history in an entertaining format -- in story form and where the characters were more humanized."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"For people who never read a historic book, this is the one to begin with. It is more like a novel than, a sometimes boring, scientific work.It is a compelling evocation of the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance told through the adventures of some key players like Luther, Magelhaes and Henry VIII.It was a period lit by the fire of the stake. A symbol and warning that the power of the Church had still to be dealt with. A power that held 75 % of all the money in France and 50 % of all the wealth in Germany, while the lower classes lived in poverty and were literally and metaphorically (through the menace of the hell) starving.The adage of the pope was : do what I say, do not what I do, e.g. the incestuous pope Alexander Borgia.The Church of Rome filled her coffers with the compulsory selling of indulgences. No wonder that part of the peers chose for Luther: they didn't have to buy the indulgences any more.A realistic, wonderfully told, but bitter tale.For people interested in other books about this period, I recommend the magisterial work of Jean Delumeau 'Sin and Fear: the Emergence of the Western Guilt Culture 13th - 18th Centuries' and 'The Waning of the Middle Ages' by Johan Huizinga. For an acidic critic of the Church, see 'The Praise of Folly' by Erasmus."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"What an entertaining review of history. Manchester accomplishes what he said he set out to do(read the authors note); that is, produce a review of almost two thousand years of history in a single volume. Necessarily that means the focus is limited; he picks various elements of European history in the dark ages and includes a more substantial section devoted to Magellan's Great Voyage.Every popular history book I have ever read has come under withering criticism on Amazon from some \\"expert\\" who invariably asserts that the author got 5 or 6 \\"facts\\" of history wrong; thereby in their mind discrediting the entire book. Don't listen to them here.I am a 48 year old father who runs a business and has three kids in college. This is the history I have time for. I lack the time and scholarly credentials to go the the original sources. What Manchester does for me is exactly what I need him to do- boil it down to a manageable number of topics, provide the anecdotes and personality quirks that bring the history to life, and above all- give me the perspective that his trained historians mind can.My only complaint is that in the end, the title is inaccurate; huge advances in science, theology, philosophy and technology all occurred in this period that was illuminated by much more than just fire.For those who enjoy this book, I would strongly recommend Tom Hollands work on Rome (Rubicon) and the Greek/Persian conflicts (Persian Fire)."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I've been enjoying listening to the unabridged book on tape of &quot;A World Lit Only by Fire&quot;. Desiring to know more about the era, I turned to my copy of Will Durand's (Durant?) tome on the history of civilization. Surprisingly, in his volume &quot;The Reformation&quot; I found myself reading almost the exact phrasing found in Manchester's book, same information, same anecdote's. While Manchester does frequently cite Durand, I don't think the citations cover the extent to which Manchester esentially imported Durand into his work. If this were Manchester's solo work, I'd give it five stars..as it is, I don't know how to rate it."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"William Manchester's book was a phenomenon. He describes the history of the transition between the medieval ages to the renaissance. Along the way, he makes sure to include much salacious gossip - anecdotes that can't be proved or disproved, but were believed by the people of the era. The most powerful element of the book, however, was the underlying current of the revolution of thought from a faith-based era to a new, logic-based age. Every example in the book comes to this point, and the ending is indeed quite powerful. When I finally closed the book (and it's been awhile since I read a book straight through the way I did this one) I was left with a strong impression on how profoundly the world was changed by the historical fathers of the renaissance."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This book is beautifully written. It moves at a fast (tho' not too fast) pace.Manchester here paints for his readers a vivid picture of life in late medieval and early Renaissance Europe.

Read this book to get a sound perspective on our world today.Finally, although the last part of the book, on Magellan and his voyage, is not integral to the bulk of the book, Manchester's portrait of Magellen sparkles with insight.

We were all well aware of the accusations of sensationalization but still felt it was an extremely thought provoking contribution to our understanding of people, times and places. I have an advanced degree in Renaissance Art History and had little to criticize re: the Renaissance except I have never read anywhere that Leonardo Da Vinci was in any danger from the Inquisitors of church. But this is a small criticism of a really magnificent book. The portion re; Magellan was a fast paced adventure.

I made the mistake of reading the preface where Mr. Manchester explained that he wrote this book as a break from writing the final volume to my favorite Winston Churchill biography. He died before he could finish the final volume so his brilliant biography ends in 1945...that's right, at the height of World War II. Useless, but still brilliant.I think this book lacks on several fronts: not an engaging read, tries to cover too much with little explanation for how it all fits and let's be honest: I found it dull. Subjects discussed include Henry VIII (finally know where he got defender of the faith), Martin Luther (poor chap on the run), Magellan (Determined chap), Erasmus (coward), Tyndale (rebel with a cause) and several revolutionary thinkers who defied their time. I suggest this reading for those who need to write a research paper, suffer from insomnia or for some strange reason interested in the Middle Ages or the beginnings of the Catholic church.

Calvin's Church-State in Geneva was apparently as depraved as their Catholic enemies in Rome, etc. The story of Luther is among the best I've encountered, not to mention the Renaissance popes.

This leads him to make simplistic and erroneous statements about the &quot;Medieval Mind,&quot; view the Rennaissance as being detached from the Middle Ages, and claim that the &quot;voyages of discovery&quot; created the modern world. The book reads more like a bad high school essay than a work by a distinguished historian and author.Indeed, aside from the first thirty pages, the book isn't even about the medieval period. In fact, much of it is not about the Rennaissance, either. The book, which he admits, is mostly about Ferdinand Magellan.So please, stay away from this book.

The firm dates for the deaths of Arthur and Robin Hood are a bit disconcerting. And there are undoubtedly other minor errors. One wonders if other reviewers would be as harsh with those who set firm dates for Jesus' birth and death or if they would have any critical comments on a medieval history that left the out the mistakes of the Catholic and the leaders of the time. I believe the best way to understand history is to read several, preferably conflicting accounts and make your own judgments. One book is never enough - no matter how good the scholarship. A World Lit Only by Fire is certainly a fun place to start."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"A poorly informed book, written and packaged in an entertaining way. Very unfortunate that a good writer would do so little research before constructing his argument. Please see \\"Legends, Lies and Cherished Myths of World History\\" by Richard Shenkman for further debunking of old cliches. And this is NOT a \\"new\\" take on medieval history- it's the same propaganda the renaissance authors pushed centuries ago. Popular history can be great, but only if it also has the facts straight."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"It's a book about us, and how we got to be so complicated and interesting. Manchester reminds us that Europe emerged from the Dark period much the worse for the experience. The science, literature and philisophy of two golden civilizations had been lost -- not just their substance, but the very habits and skills of their practice! All that was left was superstition and xenophobia. Into the void, quite naturally, stepped the Church, which, quite naturally, became brutal and corrupt in its exercise of power. Of course it is true that some great minds still shined through, but that doesn't change the overall truth of the matter.What happened then was a miracle -- Gutenburg, Luther, the Reformation, the Explorers, the Astronomers... Learning reborn! Entire traditions of speculation and experimentation in every field rediscovered, revamped, even improved, against great odds and entrenched opposition. The true gestalt of the West was born, an uneasy and oft-broken truce between the old ways and the new, with the new inexorably, inevitable replacing the old. Replacing superstition with explanation is an exhilerating, even dizzying thing for most of us creatures of the West, and Manchester shows us when it all got rolling.I read a lot of history, and this book stands as one of my ever-favorites. Acadaemia (rhymes with macadamia)struggles with real learning, which is to say, inspiration and insight, that which makes us better for the knowing. This explains the criticisms of this book on grounds of its lack of original research. But for those of you who read history to get a better sense of who you are and how you came to be that way, this is a great place to start!"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Let me spare you the expense of the book - the Catholics were bad, then - inevitably, under the circumstances - came the Reformation, and the Prods were a LOT worse. Let me say I love Manchester's other books (American Caesar, Goodbye Darkness, the Last Lion), he is capable of breathtakingly good writing. But in this book - which he confesses in the intro is not a 'scholarly' work - he makes the Hist 101 bonehead mistake of judging a historical period by modern standards. As a result, practically everyone comes out as a bad guy. I can see how some modern PC types might like this, and I shudder to think of this book actually being used as a textbook, as other reviewers indicate. It is a good read - a good story, well written - but once read, don't think you 'know' the period - you only know one narrow viewpoint."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"A World Lit Only by Fire\\"The Medieval Mind\\"Basically an introduction to the rest of the book, the Medieval Mind covers vaguely the harshness and bleakness of everyday life in the Middle Ages. It speaks of impoverished bodies meandering their ways through life without any real knowledge or understanding of that world. Perhaps grimly pictured, the Middle Ages is shown to be a time of despair and rampant disease and war. This section of the book also outlines the second section, briefly naming many kings, popes, saints, and reformers, whom are all elaborated on in the second section of the book. The Medieval Mind also prepares us for, what the author considers the one decisive shattering blow that changes the Dark ages into the renaissance.\\"The Shattering\\"The shattering, said by the author to be Ferdinand Magellan, came in the form of the circumnavigation of the Earth which is discussed in much greater detail in the third section of the book. This section, however basically serves to sum up five hundred years of history, thrown together almost randomly, from the daily life and clothing of peasants to the misanthropic tendencies of the popes to the struggles King Henry VIII had in annulling his marriages. There are stories of the papal throne becoming a brothel as well as stories of incest, intrigue, and politics. Yet through the madness comes one prevalent theme--the struggle of power from the pope to the king. We are also guided through the Renaissance and into more modern days, discussing in detail the plight of Michelangelo and Pope Julius II. And finally, a great deal of effort went into narrating the history of the church's reforms, stemming from Martin Luther and Erasmus and additions from Tomas More\\"One Man Alone\\"The story of the most important bridge from the Medieval into the present, that of Ferdinand Magellan. Magellan, himself Portuguese, set out with a fleet of five ragged ships under the flag of Spain in hope of finding the paso from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans. After months at sea traveling south on the Atlantic coast of South America, his crew finally mutinied and one of the ships returned to Spain. The aptly named Straight of Magellan was finally reached where another ship was lost. Now the three remaining ships and their crew headed for the Asian islands. Running deadly low on supplies the ships stopped in the islands of the Philippines, where the sailors had their ways with the local women. Magellan, a true Christians, only had his beliefs confirmed when he reached Asia, and so he began to convert as many of the natives as possible. When one tribe was unwilling to convert he went to war where he died in the Philippines. In the end only one of the ships made it all the way around the world where its captain, one of the original traitors was heralded a hero. The truth will out applies here, as Magellan is the man we know for circling the Earth. The third section, however, ends by summing up all the main themes of the past two sections.... At times I felt this book was interesting and those are the times I would like to hold on to. There were very many interesting facts in the second section, which, I've already stated, I feel would have been better expressed if there was some chronological order to the material. Not that I'm pessimistic, but I enjoyed reading about the indulgences of the certain papal figures elaborated upon, as well as reading the background information behind Becket, Anne of the Thousand Days, and The Agony and the Ecstasy. The only time I considered this book a bore was when trying desperately to figure out which character the author was talking about, because there are so many in history with the same name, that I just got so confused I had to put the book down and take a break...."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This book stirs up a great deal of controversy, especially its analysis of the Papacy and Lutheranism. Some facts in this text are uncontroversial while others can and often are interpreted differently. However, this book presents a light scholarly approach that is easy to read and certainly provides the reader with a picture of the territory discussed. The most fascinating aspect discussed is the ferocity that many groups defended the ignorance that guarded their power. Heretics were burnt at the stake not because they were considered wrong but because they were a danger to the powers that were (be).This book will open your mind if it is read as a hypothesis of the impact of the control of information and the impact that has on the powerful and the powerless. Also, it is indisputable that written language, dissemination of knowledge, and the rising merchant class (and thus non-state controlled wealth) were the downfall of the dark ages. If Leonardo had been born 2 centuries earlier, his ideas and thoughts would have been lost among the illiteracy of the age. Gutenberg's invention freed humanity from the oppressing darkness of ignorance and now, as the world becomes more complicated, so many are reaching for the easy solution of ignorance and fundamentalism. Seeing the world as it is can be frightening, but to blindly follow those who wield power only results in the tyranny of the majority. So truly, did Mr. Manchester write this text as a true historical work of medieval history and the birth of intelligence or as an allegory for today's world?"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"William Manchester was a brilliant writer. He prefaced this book by saying he intended to write a third volume of The Last Lion (Winston Churchill) but became too ill to undertake such an intense project, so he opted to write something of slightly less weight. While an interesting read, it do not have the same substance as The Last Lion or American Caesar. Because Manchester had such a interesting writing style, the book is worthy of your time, so that you can take a look into the medieval mind and the renaissance. Expect to be fascinated, as always, by Manchester's delivery, but be prepared to be a little disappointed in the thoroughness and depth of his coverage of the subject matter. It might have been too big a project for too few pages. This book does no diminish Manchester as a great writer, however."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"The book was very enjoyable. The info gleaned about the Catholic Church and how it's corruption eventually led to the creation of Protestantism (thru Luther) was an eye opener.A lot of the facts stated in the book, I checked on-line (such as what King Christian did etc.) and the facts I checked were in sync with what the author conveyed.The parts about Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour etc were incredibly interesting.I highly recommend this book and that you read it for yourself and ignore the nay-Sayers with an ax to grind."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"The more you read, the less you know. This is not even good historical fiction; you will be *far* better served by reading Barbara Tuchman'sA Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century. Or just read The Canterbury Tales or a collection of Fabliaux if you want a salacious medieval read."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"You know, I started this book with such high hopes. The narritive was so interesting, but as I progressed, I found the effectiveness of this book obscured by Manchester's prejudiced view of the Church and the people of the Middle Ages. I would strongly recommend checking this book out of the Library before buying it and checking the basic facts out against more reputable authors before accepting any of this man's book as factual or unslanted in the telling of this period of history."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"A lot of those who have lambasted this book (oddly, all but a few have chosen to remain anonymous), call this book inaccurate. Yes, maybe. But point me to a book that is accurate about this period? Frankly, we need to remember that during the entire span Mr. Manchester is discussing, people had barely an idea of what was going on a few miles away from them. By using secondary and tertiary sources - occasionally amounting to little more than rumours - Manchester walks a fine line between truth and sensationalism indeed. But the historian who sticks to the hard facts walks the line of giving only the smallest, driest glimpse into an age that shaped the world. My advice to you is this: Use this book only as inspiration to go out and look for the truth yourself. If nothing else, it is the most intriguing look at the age I have ever come across, and raised more good, solid questions in me concerning the common past of the Western World than any other book has managed to do. I am perfectly aware that a lot of his sources are shaky, but I am also perfectly aware that these shaky sources are the ONLY sources.This book is well worth the time it takes to read it, if you truly are serious about studying the age and not just learning the dry, known facts. However, beware the bizarre fetish Mr. Manchester possesses with Magellan. While illuminating, it started to drag a tad. Just write a wholly seperate book if you want to say so much about him. Have a pinch of salt ready before you finish this wonderful work, just so you don't take it to heart, and only to mind."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I know very little about the Middle Ages and my high school AP Euro teacher forced us to read this book over the summer as an introduction to the subject. I hoped that if I skimmed through it I would be able to get it over with quickly. However, I found the book very interesting and captivating. Manchester portrays history in a magnificent way that I have never seen before. He constantly switches between different topics in a very fluid way. In addition, he gives insight into human nature by showing how people's blind faith led to oppressive society that caused them to suffer under the corrupt church and other powerful people. It showed me that history isn't a series of facts that you cram into your head before a test but a beautiful puzzle where everything is connected. Again, I know nothing about the period that he covers so I cannot say whether the book is historical accurate."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Sorry to see so many intellectual snobs, denouncing a really fun and good read. I listened to the audio version, not once but several times. I think he did a wonderful job of bringing the average, man on the street, to life. I'd never given much in depth thought before, to how difficult life was in the past or how, well, awful it was. Of course I was aware, that they for the most part went to bed at dark and got up at dawn and tilled their fields. Much time was spent in just survival. Manchester, made it seem very real, and how they managed their survival. I enjoyed the parts about the catholic church, and as someone else mentioned, I also googled things to either check the facts or look at pictures of the people. I did not find anything wanting. It is the top of my favorites list for 2012. So if you enjoy tidbits about history, go ahead and ignore the nit pickers and enjoy this wonderful book. So often history books are boring, slanted and, heck, just not that well written. This one is fun, informative, and enjoyable. Even better, listen to the audio version, Barrett Whitener, does a good narration, and has some very enthusiastic moments."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Despite the title, this book is largely about the Catholic Church and the Reformation: by far that is the longest of the three essays that make up the whole: the other two are a short overview of the long darkness of the medieval period, and a study of the first circumnavigation of the world by Magellan (or, more accurately, by his asian servant).This is not a scholarly work, and does not profess to be: it is \\"popular history\\" written to be readable first and foremost. Apparently there are factual errors made and conclusions drawn which may not be able to be substantiated in places: I think it is clear that the book has to be read as opinion rather than \\"this is exactly how it was\\", with things that interest the author getting the limelight. To a degree, that grates on me, because it makes me wonder about the superb unfinished biography of Churchill that William Manchester wrote: does it suffer the same errors?The first essay is the shortest, and the most interesting. Its 30 pages on the medieval world, after the fall of Rome and before the Renaissance.I can see how the medieval man viewed the world as timeless: for a thousand years, from 400 to 1400, the world was pretty much the same, with the turning of the seasons another constant among many. To us today, that is pretty much unthinkable: when car models change every year, powered flight is (just) within living memory, the internet, mobile phones: the past is a foreign country. Manchester's point is that for the medieval peasants, it wasn't: it was pretty much like it was, year after year.Still, how he missed the Black Death I'm not sure.Next up is 200 pages on the Borgia Popes, the sale of indulgences, Erasmus, and Martin Luther. Comparatively this is not as interesting (once you wrap your mind around a corrupt Pope, its all a bit ho-hum) but it is still probably the best way to learn about this period of history. I learnt all this in high school, and wish I had just been pointed at this book for a few hours instead.Finally, there is a study of Ferdinand Magellan's epic journey around the world, in a lot more than 80 days. Unlike Sir Francis Drake, he failed to come back alive, which adds a little pathos to the story, but all up its pretty well told.This book is not really about the medieval mind, or the Renaissance: its mostly about the birth of the concept of the modern nation-State replacing the greater concept of \\"Christendom\\", and then how those early explorers created the ability for the Western world to seed itself all over the globe. There are doubtless errors and misdescriptions here, but they don't get in the way of telling the story that Manchester wants to tell: \\"Here is the beginning of the end of ignorance. Go and find out more if you wish\\"."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I found this to be a pretty good read. However, because of its flaws perhaps this book should be called a historical fantasia or long historical essay. Manchester's perspective is simplified, one-sided, and sensationalistic. This is obviously a 'popular history'. On one hand that means it's a quick, fun read. On the other hand, you don't have to be a history professor to realize that he's leaving out not only a lot of relevant facts, but also alternate viewpoints that would provide a more fully rounded picture of the period he's discussing.The book is roughly organized into three parts. The first describes the middle ages as a phantasmagorical hellhole like something out of a Brueghel painting. The second part narrates the origins of the Protestant reformation as a response to Papal perfidy. The third part tells of Ferdinand Magellan's historic circumnavigation of the globe. Along the way, there are portraits of significant historical figures such as Luther, Erasmus, Thomas More and others.Manchester puts a lot of weight onto iconic historical moments and figures, in order to interpret them as historical turning points. This leads to a fair amount of simplification and 20/20 hindsight. The moral of the story is conventional and not hard to discern: the Light of the Modern world was born out of the decline of Dark Ages. As the author himself notes, he uses only secondary sources, mainly Will Durant's Story of Civilization, and although that is a multi-volume work, it also is something of a 'popular history.' Thus Manchester's work is sort of a gloss upon a gloss. I don't think it pretends to be anything else, though, so unlike some other reviewers, I can't be as harsh in my judgment against it.If you're looking for a light, easy read that doesn't put too many demands on the reader, this may be what you're looking for."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Professor Manchester makes two important admissions in his preface: firstly that he was recovering from illness when he wrote this book (for which I am sorry) and, secondly, that he is in no way an expert on the period about which he is writing (which becomes painfully obvious).I wish I had known these things when I picked the book up as this is a very poor attempt to give the layman a picture of european civilisation at the time of the renaissance, reformation and age of the discovers.The book is divided into three parts, the first (the renaissance) is packed full of salacious nonsense; what I suspect are some rather unsavoury prejudices; and a lot of &quot;facts&quot; which are doubtful (so insecure did I become about the author's grasp in places that at one point I wondered (unfairly no doubt) whether he thought there was a man wandering about England at the time whose name was Thomas Cardinal Wolsey - this turned out to be a consistent piece of &quot;style&quot;).The second part (dealing with the Reformation) seemed largely concerned with Martin Luther's anal fixation and toilet humour (which although not particularly enlightening was marginally entertaining).The third part (the age of discovery) is incredibly superficial (I suspect the chapter was an extended version of a preface for a biography of Magellan).All in all, a great disappointment which (perhaps unfairly) does not make me want to rush out and try any of Professor Manchester's other efforts.If you want to gain an appreciate the Middle Ages, forget this and turn to Norman Cantor's recently revised book &quot;The Civilisation of the Middle Ages&quot; - now that's scholarship and it is un-put-down-able (the greatest introduction to the Middle Ages presently available?)."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"When I pick up a \\"researched historical\\" I expect to find factual information and a truly well-researched thesis and presentation. Apparently that was too much to expect from this author. If I want a sensational, fantastical story, I can go straight to the National Enquirer, get my cheap thrills and save some cash."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"In his Author's Note for \\"A World Lit Only By Fire,\\" William Manchester writes how he came across the idea for the book. Asked to write an introduction for a book on Ferdinand Magellan, he wanted to \\"provide the great navigator with context, a portrait of his age....,\\" and this became the impetus for a book on the Renaissance. The Renaissance was an era rich in historic events, and Manchester does retell the Portuguese navigator's voyage and he believes \\"Magellan was essential to a comprehension of his times...a key to the period....\\" The title of the book is actually \\"A World Lit Only By Fire: The Medieval Mind and the Renaissance, Portrait of an Age.\\" It is misleading. Picking up the book, I thought it would be about how the great minds of the age (Da Vinci, Michelangelo, etc.) plied their trade in 16th Century Europe. Reading the Author's Note moved me in another direction, but decided to press on, only to find that Manchester doesn't write about Renaissance geniuses, but of immoral priests, Vatican intrigue, and the sinister machinations of clergymen for control of peasant minds and tax revenue. He writes at length about Martin Luther, the protesting monk from Wittenberg, railing against the sale of indulgences and sin and vice of Catholic holy men. It's a book devoted to the Reformation, and not the artistry of painters and sculptors or inventions of the age, or the discovery of exotic lands (save for the ones Magellan finds) by its navigators.So why wasn't Magellan's story more the focal point of the narrative, the thread bringing the material together, instead of a chapter towards the end of the book, if that was what Manchester set out to accomplish? Manchester mentions EVERYONE you could think of who you've read about in this particular time period. There are too many important figures, too many years in between events (the circumnavigation of the globe by Magellan, Martin Luther, the fall of Granada in Spain, etc.), way too many battles and papal intrigues to keep track of. I enjoyed the book, learned a lot, but it is muddled and, constrained as he is with the enormity of the subject matter, Manchester paints with the broadest strokes possible."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Imagine, centuries from now, you are given the opportunity to write a popular history book on Modernism (19th - 20th century). What aspects of the age do you include? Surely, the past two centuries have given what future man may still regard improvements. In the social realm, to use just one example, the abolition of slavery, the granting of suffrage to women, and the recognition of natural freedoms and rights regardless of class or blood, rightly may be called improvements of this age.Yet, it is the same age that has given us examples of totalitarianism, communism, genocide on unprecedented levels, the devaluation of the human person and the family, the decline of culture into commercialized sterility, and the rise of nihilism. What approach does one take in writing such a book? Can one say of our age: it was a World Lit Only by Enlightenment?William Manchester gives a book that, while enjoyable to read, sadly offers a simplistic and polarized representation of the late medieval and early Renaissance Age. The thread of William's portrait of the age is not hard to identify. On the one hand there are the faithful (read \\"superstitious\\" and \\"ignorant\\") Christians, who form the majority and who blindly follow what the Church teaches them regarding their roles and the world around them. Any violence, oppression or prejudice is attributable to their ignorance, which William has no qualms linking with their faith. On the other hand, there are the select few whom Manchester lauds as pure individuals, men of reason, who question the medieval assumptions and who alone merit our recognition as our forebears in knowledge.This polarized representation does not give an accurate portrait of the age. William excels in viewing the age from the perspective of a secular humanist with Enlightenment thought as his patrimony, but he cannot, without lapsing into condescension and mockery, truly enter into the medieval mind and acknowledge the internal logic that guided it. There is no shortage of medieval scholars who have done just that. I have no problem with William Manchester writing from a secular humanist viewpoint, but the frequent snides about those with whom he disagrees does little to William's credit, and makes otherwise enjoyable reading at times annoying.Better books have been written on the age, ones in which good and bad are considered together, and the man of the age is not looked down on for being born into his circumstances and living according to the world view in which he was raised. Jacques Le Goff, in his Medieval Civilization: 400-1500, does a finer job in placing the medieval people in the context of barbarian invasion and the movement out of towns and into the country. Important advances were made (as in agriculture) but perhaps not in all the areas considered important by an educated Western person today."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This book is horrible.

Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I think that every 20 sentences in the book should read thus:Do not fear, reader - the renaissance will be here soon!William Manchester is very careful to create a 3D portrait of the people he uses to progress his book. As an age as a whole, however, he creates the medievals as idiotic, fearful peasants and gluttonous, hedonistic royalty. He writes of faith as a terrible thing to have, only justifiable if it is constructed on a foundation of reason. I cannot tell you how accurate his portrayal of Martin Luther is; however, it seems to be very drastic. He writes off everything that the Catholic church does and every Catholic as Machiavellian, anti-Christian, anti-intellectual evil. Of course for a good amount of people, this is true - but Manchester does a terrible job of painting everyone with the same brush. His treatment of Protestants are equally as homogeneous - people converted solely for political reasons or pride/embitterment. Manchester seems to propose that no one actually believed in the tenants of Lutheranism.Prof Manchester writes the whole book uphill - with the pathetic villagers in their cultural wasteland at the bottom, and the apotheosized, magnanimous heroes of the renaissance at the other.In terms of construction, Manchester's structure is almost ruined by its uncohesive nature. He drifts from plot to plot (His Magellan story is some of the worst, most useless nonfiction writing I've ever had to make sense of) and he sprinkles every 10 pages or so with some confusing leitmotif.To summarize - good for a different view; could be deadly if it becomes a classroom norm for a generation."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I think William Manchester is trying to make a point here. He's honest about it, unlike other modern scholars trying to hide their bias in a veneer of &quot;Objective Scholarship&quot; like Ed Said and others (for which I recommend &quot;The Muslim Discovery of Europe&quot; by Bernard Lewis, who reminds us that 'non-Westerners' view the 'West' through their own lenses, 'Occidentalism', as well).Anyway,Manchester here is pointing out to layman several ideas that we generally don't think about.1. Reinforces the idea that the vast majority of peasants don't know that multiple times there are two or three competiting Popes.2. That illiterate peasants with nothing to do, find something to do, like fornicate. This idea of good little honest serfs just stitching their clothes, dancing in lederhosen or whatever, and singing hymns all winter is absurd. We think that when medieval Priests moan about all the fornication in cities and villages across Europe, they're just being zealots. Maybe they were being honest.3. That for all the complaints about how rough we have it in the West today, it was once a whole lot worse.He gives alot of color to people who many have revered as heroes. Like Luther, or some of the Popes. Some people don't like the truth about Luther's profane rantings (he was the son of a miner after all!) or the inequities of the Medici brats whose Papacy was brought (do you think they instantly became pious men from spoiled plotting children once they become Popes?)I think the people who don't like this book don't want their &quot;El Cid&quot; and &quot;King Richard&quot; fables de-bunked. They want their staid history from an eagle-eye view, of the battles of Agincourt and Tourneys and dates and places, but when it comes to humanizing the late Medieval/Renaissance men of history, their fantasies come under attack and they react with repulsion."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"A World Lit Only By Fire is a very interesting and well written book.

This was a harsh world and one where most of the people were poor, illiterate, and kept that way by their rulers and the Church.The author spends a great deal of time setting the background of the time before moving to various events that were going on such as the Protestant Reformation, Henry VIII's trials with the church over his divorce, and the various persons who ran afoul of the church. The book also details alot of the excesses and abuses of the Roman Catholic Church at the time and how it led to some radical changes in the world. The last part of the book deals with Ferdinand Magellan's voyage around the world. It is quite detailed and gives the reader a close view of him with his virtues and his flawsI would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the historical time period and wants to get beyond the romanticized versions of tales that were taught to all of us as children. It also provides a good history of the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Reformation for persons interested in them."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"While this book may offend those with religious sensibilities (as evidenced by some of the more negative reviews), I think does a fine job of zeroing in on the follies and character of the age.

It may not be as scholarly a book as some would like; nevertheless, it does deal with issues that many scholars tend to skip over as they struggle to write apologies for the way things were.For my take on religion in general, go to:[...]Howard Ferstler"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This book is awesome. It is well written. Extremely informative and forces you to think. This is definitely not a novel. The scary part of reading this book is the parallels we can draw with our current era.

Are we headed into another dark age spurred by the Christian right?"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"If you have any interest in the truth about history and why the world came to be the way it is, this is a terrific book. This is the European History equivalent of \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\". It is easy and interesting to read unless you try to remember everything that is in it. Using specfics to bring history to life, I could read this book many times and still find new things in it. This book dispells many myths about the \\"march of history\\" and the \\"role of the Church\\" while examining many facets of human nature. While highlighting the contributions made by many individuals, this book serves as a warning to the dangers of religious fundamentalism and self indulgence. The Catholic church would not approve of this book. The book ends by examining the life of Ferdinand Magellan, his beliefs, his preservance, and his amazing success that lead to the \\"religious exuberance\\" that undermined his judgement and cost him his life."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This book is highly recommended for those who want a quick overview of the transition between what we call the Medieval Ages and the Renaissance. While sometimes its organization leaves one wondering about the overall theme, it does cover important points concerning the role of the papacy and the Reformation. A good start for those who want a short introduction on these subjects.While Manchester's interpretation of events can be questioned, that is different than to say the facts are in error. For example, Norman Cantor in the 1993 first edition of \\"The Civilization of the Middle Ages, A Completely Revised and Expanded Edition of Medieval History\\" suffered from serious errors of facts. On page 123 he stated \\"It took the Arabs.... seven centuries to take Constantinople.\\" Anyone remotely familiar with the history of that event would have known it was the Ottoman Turks who conquered the city. As if that was not enough, on page 479 he went on to state that Marco Polo was Florentine! While later versions corrected these mistakes, the point is those mistakes never seemed to get mentioned as a problem by the initial reviewers!Thus, while Manchester's wandering may leave you agitated or enlightened, it should not be dismissed. A great read that expands one's insights and makes one want to learn more about those times."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Firstly I must admit that I have very little knowledge of the Renaissance (I found it a boring subject at school!) but I found this book to be a very interesting and entertaining account of that period. The author makes clear at the start of the book that it was not going to be a scholarly masterpiece. Fair enough, he produced what I think was a good book that got you thinking about the subject he was presenting. Now that he has sparked your interest you can go and find some scholarly tome to get the rest of the story. This book was an easy to read and lively account of that period and I found it a joy to read."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"While, as many other reviewers have noted, Manchester's biography of Magellan at the conclusion of this work is certainly scholarly and insightful, the rest of this text, especially the rather pathetic thirty-page rant against the Church entitled &quot;The Medieval Mind,&quot; is consistently shallow and cliched. That the author truly believes that 1,000 years of European history can possibly be summarized accurately in so few words should disqualify this book as a serious, scholarly &quot;portrait of an age.&quot; In short, Manchester's view of the Medieval millenium as a time of unending brutishness, depravity, and intellectual stagnancy is as thoroughly unenlightened and pseudo-intellectual as the false &quot;Middle Ages&quot; which he describes."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"A World Lit Only by Fire by William Manchester is a good read about the late mediveal times through the Remaissance.

The author is very opininated and has some false information. \\"The peasants of Europe felt it was cooler to work clothless during the summer months.\\" Yeah right.There are some \\"adult\\" scenes in the book were Manchester talks about intercourse in detail.

Previously Manchester had also done an analysis of the John F. Kennedy assassination so that he is well versed in the meaning of history and the importance of particular historical facts-as opposed to the self-serving and fraudulent press releases.The central story of Manchester's effort here, that takes up about one third of the book, also concerns one of those larger than life historical figures from an earlier period in Western history, the career of the Portuguese explorer extraordinaire Ferdinand Magellan. However, if this was solely Manchester's purpose that might be worthily satisfied by an extended monogram. He has provided as well, despite his penchant for great heroic figures, a very readable look at the dawn of capitalism as it emerged out of the mire of what used to be known in historical studies as the \\"Dark Ages\\".In the process of that exposition Manchester has done an interesting job of detailing much of the history of those dark ages- a period of history that today's readers may not be familiar with but which was an important precursor to the development of European capitalism and to the history of the international labor movement that Karl Marx wrote about in the 19th century. Manchester runs quickly through the decline of the Roman Empire, the rise and stabilization of the Christian church in the wake of that decline and its role as the international (at least for Europe) arbiter of the political, economic and social world of the times. With the understanding that Manchester's effort here is of a piece with his general theory about the role of heroes in history those of us more familiar with the period can begin to understand something of the nature of the changes that were occurring at the time that his protagonist Magellan was accomplishing his feat in the early 16th century (circumnavigating the earth and therefore empirically proving that the earth was a sphere).The heart of the book for us, however, is the detailed description that he provides for the bulk of the 16th century an extraordinary period that saw the breakthrough of international trade westward as well as eastward, the rise of nation-states as segments of society gained literacy and began to express themselves in their home languages, the development of cities as centers of commerce creating the conditions for a division of labor that would later form the basis for industrial capitalism, the struggle between the secular and the sacred in determining the course of social life including some very saucy stories about Popes, princes and their ladies(the Borgias in particular), the feuding between various religious factions most notably between the Roman Church and Martin Luther of Germany and Henry VIII of England and the flowering of artistic culture and learning that we can observe remnants of today in any major art museum.Historical materialists look at the history of any period to determine its main thrust. Manchester has done a more than adequate job of detailing those events and movements that caused the decline of Europe for approximately one thousand years from the fall of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance. The most important aspect of this book and the one that makes me want to recommend it to today's readers is its study of the late 15th and early 16th century- a time when dramatic changes were occurring that would begin the long process of accumulating the expertise to create the progressive capitalist system. Without the changes in the manner of religious thinking, ways of producing goods and notions of culture it is possible that Europe, and through it the world might be very different today- and not for the better.That is true as long as we don't forget in that content the down side of this spurt in human culture- the rise of colonialism that accompanied international exploration, the religious wars that torn apart families and nations and the rise of a middle class cultural ethos that has placed more than its fair share on individual self-fulfillment at the expense of the social and gone some distance to slow the struggle for socialism down. If you need a quick look at the broad picture of what happened to make Europe a central cog in world history from the 15th century on read this little work to whet your appetite. Then go out and get some more specialized books to appease it."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Don't let the title fool you. This book is mostly about the Renaissance; only the slim first section meditates directly on the Middle Ages. We should expect this; the people of the Middle Ages left scant written evidence of their lives. As Manchester writes, &quot;Even those with creative powers had no sense of self. Each of the great soaring medieval cathedrals ... required three or four centuries to create ... Yet we know nothing of the architects or builders.&quot;The middle section describes the Catholic Church as an institution of declining power and influence, culminating in the Protestant reformation. Manchester recounts the un-Christian debauchery of various popes and papal officers. When in power, the Protestant elite behaved hardly better than their Catholic predecessors. The balance and majority of the book offers a biography of Magellan and his circumnavigation of the world. Manchester considers this the crowning achievement of the Renaissance.Manchester writes popular history. His solid (sometimes stolid) prose provides a serviceable narrative. This history does not claim (in fact, the author specifically denies it) any new or breakthrough scholarship. Manchester is not writing for experts. He describes the seam between two ages, the age of God and the age of man, that became the most important period in human history. An analogy is helpful to understand its significance. Early in his life, a newborn baby has no sense of others. In the baby's mind, his mother exists solely to fulfill his needs. Medieval man, believing Earth the center of the universe, was in much the same state. During the Renaissance, Europeans -- like the newborn child becoming aware of others and their separate existence -- discovered the world around them. In the 20th century, we are still reeling from the shock of this revelation."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"In William Manchester's A World Lit Only By Fire, the Middle Ages was depicted as being corrupt and dark, because of the hypocrisy of the Church and it's teachings. The corruption of the Church and the society contributed to the failure of Medieval Europe. Although the start of a new religion was supposed to bring hope and renewed faith to the people, it brought mostly scandals, hardship, deaths, and darkness. With further analysis on Martin Luther, Desiderius Erasmus, and Magellan, Manchester introduces the problems, which contributed to a world literally lit only by destruction, which eventually led Europe into an intellectual, cultural, and economical downfall.Manchester uses grotesque language and examples to describe the shattering of moral and intellectual beliefs and values in the Church and society. He also goes on to say that \\"...lust, and particularly noble lust, seethed throughout Europe.\\" (74) Since the papacy during this time encouraged this immoral behavior, \\"...boys were sexually aggressive, and girls liked them so.\\" (70) Instead of bringing faith into Europe, disorder was all that Medieval Europe had to offer. Although Manchester proves a good point about why the papacy should not have submitted to the many temptations surrounding them, he is biased when explaining the failure of the Church to guide the people on a moral journey in life. He fails to acknowledge that Christianity did bring good and hope to the people all over Europe. He is hostile towards the clergy and does not present the subject objectively. Although this part of the book was an interesting read, he is so busy attacking the Church for every wrong thing that they have done that the feeling of an objective \\"history book\\" about the whole Middle Ages is lost.While the Church still faced its moral problems, Martin Luther was ready for a change in their behavior and attitude, which made him an enemy of the Church. Manchester also discusses the rage that Luther felt when he discovered that Johann Tetzel was selling letters of indulgence to the public. This led him to write ninety-five theses preceded with a pacifying prelude: \\"Out of love for the faith and the desire to bring it to light, the following propositions will be discussed at Wittenberg under the chairmanship of the Reverend Father Martin Luther, Master of Arts and Sacred Theology.\\" (140) Manchester dwells too much on how, why, when, and what Luther did that eventually led to the Protestant Reformation. It just droned and went on forever. It felt like it did not have an ending. This second part of the book was too detailed and lengthy which made it boring. In addition to that, he was also biased when portraying Luther and Erasmus whom he loves because he makes it seem like nothing they did was wrong. When writing about history, he should be more objective and not only prone to people he admires.In the final installation of the book, Manchester focuses on Magellan, \\"...the mightiest explorer in history...\\" (31) Unfortunately, Magellan joined in a war between local groups in the Philippines and while fighting, \\"A poisoned arrow stuck him unarmored right foot...\\" and it \\"...killed our mirror, our light, and comfort, and our true guide.\\" (280-281) Since Magellan was the first explorer to circumnavigate the world, he is used as a symbol of a new change in the society and world. Because he opened the society's eyes by proving that the world is round and that all things are possible if only people put the time, heart, and effort into them, Manchester portrays him as his hero in A World Lit Only By Fire. This is an incorrect analysis on Manchester's part because what does one explorer have to do with the change from the medieval darkness to an age of improvement. There were many explorers before that. Moreover, Magellan did not really circle the world since he died halfway through his voyage. Although this was so, it was brave of him to go on the voyage without even knowing where he was heading and because of that, Magellan can still be considered a hero because of his endless determination and heart to try to do something that was unachievable during that time.I think that overall, Manchester's A World Lit Only By Fire is good if you are interested in the corruption of the Church, the failure of Medieval Europe, the preference of science over religion, and the discussion about Ferdinand Magellan. Other than that, this is not a book for you. It is rather lengthy and Manchester dwells on people or events that he does or does not admire. Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but when writing a secondary source on history, it is best to stay objective so that everyone will get the entire picture and not just a half of it. Although some parts of the book were too grotesque and sensual, I enjoyed the last part where Manchester talks about Magellan and the challenges and difficulties he faced when circling the world. Because of his achievements, Magellan opened a new door with his fortitude, left us the key to a new understanding of the world so that we too can explore, and discover new things that lie on this earth that may prove to be as illuminating as the wide ocean he once sailed and explored. Moreover, the title itself proves to be significant. In \\"a world lit only by fire\\", everything would be covered in shadows representing bedlam; the faint light implies that there is hope for the people to try to pull away from the darkness. However, because fire denotes destruction, the people during the Dark Ages, were living in a world full of corruption with a small hope that a light will guide them to peace and goodness."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Mr. Manchester's single volume of history presents the evidence of history which establishes the corruption of the apparent task of all organized religions by their assimiluation into civil government.Mr. Manchester's opinion of the time from 400AD - 1500AD is, \\"After the extant fragments have been fitted together, the portrait [of the era] which emerges is a melange of incessant warfare, corruption, lawlessness, obsession with strange myths, and an almost impenetrable mindlessness.\\"My opinion is we do not seem to have learned the lessons of history.I have a blog at \\"[...]\\" under the name lawrence where my essay attempts to develope this topic further."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"William Manchester has shed the true light on the middle ages - there was none.

Life was truly &quot;nasty, brutish and short.&quot; When I tire of the pain and agony of modern life I only have to read the first 80 pages of this book to realize that we are now living in the best of times (all of our teeth, antibiotics, and hot water).

The book focuses so much on the sexual encounters of the people during this age that it is enough to make one sick. It solely talks about the Christian religion as opposed to the actions and ideas of the pagan, Jewish or Muslim reigions.

Early on, my teacher warned that it was a highly biased book and not to focus too much on Manchester's subjective and demeaning writing. Unfortunately, as I got into it, it was impossible to ignore. Even with my limited knowledge and freshman education I was still able to see through many of the inaccuracies.Firstly, as a practicing Catholic, I was seriously offended at his cruel view of the church. Manchester glorified Martin Luther and his starting of the Protestant Reformation while showing the Catholics as corrupt and evil people. Granted, the Catholic church does have its share of skeletons in the closet (i.e. Pope Alexander VI and his family and the condemnation of Galileo Galili) but then so do just about every religion on earth. Manchester fails to mention the thousands of hospitals, orphanages, and schools constructed at the order of the Catholic church. Furthermore, while Martin Luther brought up several seriously important issues and founded the Protestant Reformation, there was little information on how he went mad and made rather rash decisions near his death.The timeline of the book is incredibly difficult to follow. There are several cases in which Manchester will be writing in one century and then a few pages later go back to the prior century. This makes it confusing and frustrating to try and keep up with the subject. He also makes a point to emphasize how primetive and unintelligent the medieval man was when in fact many men were highly educated. Frankish king Charlemagne, although being illiterate, did his best to keep the education of his people a high priority. Schools and universities could be found all over Europe. The only thing truly blocking knowledge from spreading all over the world was the isolation, which was lessened greatly once the Printing Press was invented.There are plenty more things I would like to get into but I doubt that review readers would enjoy having to read another book.

The book starts off at the fall of Rome and all the invaders that crossed its borders. Then the book moves to the reformists and their ideas, like Martin Luther King and how the government rules, and moves on with more concrete ideas as to what major events changed people's attitudes and life's during the period, such as Magellan's journey.This book starts off with the decline of Rome. There were many events leading up to the fall of Rome that actually began the century before. Indifference and bureaucratic absolutism was one thing that caused the fall. Rome controlled a 10,000-mile border, but it had always been vulnerable. Huns who attacked the country, and according to the book were \\"bred to kill and trained from infancy to be pitiless,\\" (pg.4) crossed the border. The Huns didn't just stop there either. In the fourth century, the Huns finally met their match and were defeated by China. Because of this, they spread westward and conquered land there. The Huns destroyed everything in the cities they entered to the point where the cities were unrecognizable. Dark spread over this continent of Europe and Europe would not rise up until forty generations later.In the middle of this book, after Europe has risen out of the ashes, it talks about the government and especially Martin Luther. Luther was said to always be difficult in his young age and when he was older. He became a theologian, and was considered the most anal. He claimed to see the devil and was engaged in a fight with the devil himself. He posted a denunciation of the Pope on the Frederick's Castle Church, causing a big uproar, but by posting the paper, it signified that Martin Luther was ready to defend it against all charges. On all saint's day he posted a Disputation of Clarification of the Power of Indulgences, there were ninety-five theses and next to the paper was \\"Out of love for the faith and the desire to bring it to light, the following propositions will be discussed at Wittenberg under the chairmanship of the Reverend Father Martin Luther, master of Arts and Sacred Theology.\\"(Pg.140)Towards the end of this book it discusses Magellan's journey. Before Magellan left, many agents tried so hard to sabotage his ships so he couldn't complete the journey. He traveled around the globe, which at that time was thought of as impossible, but died before his could reach his homeland. Magellan was considered the era's greatest hero and it's difficult to find another figure to match his heroism. It is also said that Magellan's character was flawed. \\"Men who do the heroic deed and otherwise are usually not good obtaining personal relationships,\\" (Pg. 289) this was applied to Magellan. In his memorial, twenty-five degrees of the south celestial pole, stand two galaxies shining bright. They are companions of the Milky Way and also known as the \`Magellanic Clouds,' \\"trails of glory that arouse awe.\\"(Pg. 287) The clouds are a good representation of a memorial for him, because like him, his memory shines down on the world that was opened by his voyage.I think this book is a great book to read for AP European History because it is a good source to read to have some knowledge of the time period and some key events that made our world what it is today. I'll admit it started off a little slow but soon picked up. I learned a lot from this book, as to how the Catholic Church was run and the changes that followed. This book took me more into depth about the medieval ages than any textbook of history has ever done. I think the title fits the book perfectly in that A World Lit Only By Fire, The Medieval Mind and The Renaissance Portrait of an Age is exactly what the book presents. The first part, \\"A World Lit Only By Fire,\\" is appropriate because Europe had \\"dark clouds\\" resting over it, and the little events that kept erupting was only lighting Europe by a tiny flame. The events kept the spirit alive and gradually the flame grew. And the second part \\"The Medieval Mind and The Renaissance Portrait of an Age\\" is fitting because the book is about the time period.

I can recommend this book to all persons who seek a better understanding of the modern world and its emergence.A brief synopsis of the book would be the change the world experienced as it gradually moved from the darkness and superstition of the dark ages to the springboard for growth and enlightenment of the renaissance. We see the narrow mindedness of the religious hierarchy and its intolerance for anything that challenged the bible as literal truth. Today, no one but the most nave or blinkered would see the world as the centre of the universe or that Noah saved the planet with his ark. Yet these views were widely held for centuries. We owe a great deal to the courageous men and women who pushed forward with trust in science rather than faith in superstition.Manchester's book is not a work of great originality. He would have been the first to admit this fact. Rather, it is a work that encapsulates the flood of events that were unfolding. We begin in the later stages of the dark ages and finish with the renaissance, the reformation and finally, the exploration of Magellan which put the final nail in the coffin of the remaining flat earth believers.I suspect that many will see this work as being driven by the hand of the devil.

Manchester's genius is not of high historical scholarship, but rather of rendering a masterful narrative that appeals to the non-fiction reader, but does not become mired by esoteric details. In short, Manchester is able like no other recent author to filter the interesting from the irrelevant. This makes him &quot;popular&quot;, and therefore less appealing to the dissertation crowd -- but also makes him the writer that you always read for an extra hour before turning out the light at night. The particular strength of this book is that it does not stray from the author's objective: to present what he believes to be an illustration of the medieval mind. But while it approaches a general study, rather than a specific person or event, it still maintains an interesting narrative pace through its anecdotal structure. Manchester presents the dichotomy between morality and hedonism, not simply for sex-sensational purposes, but to illustrate the guiding forces of the medieval mind which he believes to exist. This is the medieval mind as Manchester sees it: prurient, holy, inquisitive, and very human; he presents the illustrations which fit his argument. If there is a flaw, it is that it is a subjective presentation that is almost cloaked in objectivity. But this is due to Manchester's artistic presentation, in which he advocates his position not through historical argument, but through the &quot;pictures&quot; of his anecdotes and illustrations. Admittedly, it is not of the caliber of &quot;Glory and the Dream,&quot; but does not seem to attempt to be such an undertaking. Taken for what it is -- an immensely entertaining, yet intelligent, brief study -- Manchester delivers a quality product, as always. Wm. Manchester is the John Lennon of history, and even if this is his worst book (which it may well be) it is still an excellent, five-star book."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Someone doesn't like the Catholic church and wants you to know it. Contains a bounty of factual errors. I'm glad that I had gotten this from my public library and didn't waste any money on it. Save your money for a real history book."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Manchester's A World Lit Only by Fire. The book provides a good synopsis of medieval Europe. Manchester manages to incorporate important details without bogging down the text. Doubtless, there are more comprehensive works on this subject, but the author manages to condense this information into an accessible book. While A World Lit Only by Fire isn't exactly a page-turner, it is easy to read. Manchester understands how to capture his audience.I'm not a historian and I felt as though I learned from Manchester's book. From what I can tell, it isn't meant to be a scholarly work on the medieval period. It is clear that some feel as though it has an outdated perspective on medieval Europe. For me, the lay reader, it was an excellent overview.The book is broken into three sections.The first section discusses the origins and effects of Roman Empire's disintegration in the 5th century.The second section covers the Middle Ages, leading up to the Renaissance. This is the most comprehensive part of the book. It discusses the Borgia family's rise to power, changes in the Roman Catholic Church, the Protestant Reformation, and artistic and scholarly developments during this period.The final section chronicles Magellan's voyage. While this part is linked to the book both by the voyage's timing and by Manchester's theme of the medieval mind, it seems somewhat out of place. This part details Magellan's life and his voyage. The rest of the book provides a broader overview of Europe, with some attention to the personal lives of important figures.The bottom line: If you are looking for a cursory look at medieval Europe and don't know much about the subject, this is the perfect book for you."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"The book gives an entertaining and easy reading overview of the Renaissance and Reformation. It is not a serious history book as Manchester admits in his introduction. He borrowed heavily from Durant and other authors for his material with little original research. I found the book confusing as he jumped back and forth over the years to make a point, which left me wondering just what happened when. Often I was left questioning the basis for what were, to me, unbelievable statements. Nonetheless, the book is worth reading."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I was initially angry at the prospect of reading this little work -- written in Manchester's seventieth year -- rather than a third and concluding volume of his monumental Churchill biography. Alas, the word is now out that there will be no third volume -- that the author lacks the will or capacity to carry on.Manchester -- together with Catherine Drinker Bowen -- is clearly the great biographer of the century. His passing from active work is a deep personal blow to one who has savored his work for more than thirty years.This ersatz volume I found to my delight to be highly engaging and insightful into the Age of Gutenberg and Michaelangelo, of DaVinci and Tyndale. This book is in the best tradition of Will Durant -- a great writer who doesn't plow new ground but places the mountain of existing literature into a context and framework."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Manchester makes the age come alive. Half-way through the book, I reported to my 80 year old mother who had just finished her re-read of Dante and was ready for a new &quot;read.&quot; She obtained it and finished it before I did! Loved it. Looking over some of the reviews here by the 'scholars' I am reminded of the definition of an expert: An &quot;X&quot; in mathmatics is an unknown factor and a &quot;spurt&quot; is a drip under pressure. Perhaps scholarly experts do not wish to read about how out of touch those in power really may be. Read this book!"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Don't be put off by the faux historical critiques of some other reviewers here - this ain't a textbook. This is a book to read by your own fire, as you relax, submerge yourself in its own warm bubbling spa, a veritable Ganges of rhetorical flow. And so enjoy this deep yellow river of Popes, renaissance artists, maps, Kings and voyages, culminating in Magellan's glorious, crazy circumnavigation of the globe, the reason Manchester wrote this in the first place. Manchester sees Magellan much as he saw MacArthur in American Caesar, a gloriously flawed genius. We can see clearly that Manchester loved researching and writing this - share the love, dive in."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"EVERYONE in the church was unabashadly corrupt for 1000 years, NOTHING was invented during the same time period, and then ... Wala ... Da Vinci and the humanists arrive and Europe - now unshackled by the church - explodes into a flourishing and modern society. The author manages to fit the entire period into his own tidy little box of prejudices, and in the process ignores all of the past 50 years of scholarship on the period in doing so. I'm no expert of history, but I know that it is never quite that simple - people tend to be complex and you get the good mixed with the bad. The writer is certainly an entertaining storyteller, I would just prefer he not write in a way that purports it to be fact.... If you have an axe to grind with the Catholic Church, this is your book - if not, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This book was assigned summer reading for one of my classes, and I found it to be a quick read.Manchester's book on the trends of thinking during the medieval and Renaissance periods has certainly provoked a great deal of thought, and continues to sell well and provide for entertaining reading.Beginning with the fall of Rome, Manchester takes a subject-by-subject approach to dissecting these historical times. He examines areas such as the mind of the medieval layperson, the Church, the events leading up to the Protestant Reformation and Church of England, and the journey of Magellan.As Manchester himself states (and other reviews often mention), this is not meant to be a definitive historical volume. Many details are left out for the sake of keeping a compelling narrative. And compelling it certainly is -- most readers will be shocked by the barbaric tales of goings on in the Vatican as well as in other places. Magellan's saga is equally gripping at times. Who knew how he died?The difficulty of sacrificing detail for expediency, of course, is that it can present a distorted concept of history. Such distortion does not seem intentional by Manchester -- but by compressing the continent's 1000-year history into an appropriate book, some of the characters in this drama have been flattened into two-dimensional caricatures. Manchester is so effective at describing the outrageous transgressions of the Church that the reader wonders if the Church did anything right during those thousand years. Little time is spent on feudalism and its effect on the world. Tales of Robin Hood and the Pied Piper seem to be presented as mythic legends of real people, though the history is far from clear. And Magellan's journey is narrated as proving for the continent that the world was round, though his trek was hardly the first nor conclusive indication of the globe's true shape.It's a difficult line to walk -- if Manchester had allowed more space to tell the history more fully, the book would have spanned more volumes, been much less interesting to read, and hardly anybody would have read it! I still think Manchester has taken some unnecessary shortcuts and liberties, but his World here is certainly one that readers will want to learn more about."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"There are scholarly works of history, well written, researched, accurate, and boring. Then there are works, that are perhaps not as accurate, not as exact, but that show you how things actually were, and the influences and connections that shaped history. This is not one of the former, but definitely it is one of the latter.There are inaccuracies. Knight might have originally meant a minor landed noble in old Anglo Saxon, but the Spanish, French and Italian terms (Caballero, Chevalier, and Cavalieri) mean just horseman. There are also a couple of proofreading errors, but they are obvious.Now for the good part. The book tells a story. It tells the story of a continent that is seeped in darkness, and of its slow ascent into light. Of how the light of reason takes over where the oscurantism of revelation used to rule. How the revolution of reason permitted the reform movements of Luther and Calvin; and how those reform movements, commited the same atrocities that the original church had and was guilty of. No punches are pulled, and no confession is respected.This book may not allow you to pass a medieval history final, but after reading it, you will know and understand, not only what was going on in Europe's darkest age, but why and how. What was gained and lost as the Renaissance dawned on the horizon; and also, there are interesting inferences that can be drawn, appropriate for modern times, on other areas of the world, where revelation rather than reason, alas, still holds sway.I read it in two days, and highly recommend it to the amateur historian, or to anyone who would like to know what it felt like to live in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Forget about the nonsense that other reviewers have written, if you like history, this one is a highly entertaining and valuable book. Looking at the criticisms, other readers point out the errors in the book, without giving many concrete examples. They seem so anxious to attack the author that one of them even falsely claims that the facts of Copernicus death are wrong in the book. It looks like the critics cannot stomach very well the attacks of Manchester on the Catholic Church and the Papacy. Too bad! Yes, there may be a few errors here and there. I think that I've detected one: Francis Drake did not take the same straight as Magellan, if I remember well my high school history lessons. But, so what? I've had fun reading the book and I've learned a lot, even if a few dates and facts are not entirely correct."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I enjoyed this book and believe the book is a great read. Some may question its &quot;facts&quot; but I noted that some of the accusations are not correct.For example, he never states that Copernicus was burned as a heretic (at least in my hardcopy editon, pages 89-91)and that it was indeed Giordano Bruno who was convicted of being an heretic and burned at the stake.Still, it is not a book for scholors. But for the general reader, it is a good introduction and will make you think about life back then."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I had to read it for school. It gave some interesting insight into history, and some of it was JUICY! (They have a section on the orgies the pope used to have!) The end however is all about Magellan's voyage and that almost put me to sleep."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This is a light, readable book by a master of written English. This book does not rise to the level of historiographic brilliance that other Manchester books achieve. However, he states his intents and limitations in his introduction. Therefore, readers are forewarned. That being said, and two stars being subtracted for a lack of profundity, historical exhaustiveness, and occasional errors of fact, this is a delightful book. It represents a reasonable consensus of the conclusions reached by the secondary material available on the topics of his choice, the end of the Middle Ages, the dawn of the Reformation, and the voyage of Magellan. Could he have been more temperate and balanced? Yes, he could have, but what he writes is factually accurate 99.0% of the time, and he provides a reasonable explanation for the changes that took place during the time period he considers.Accessible, to any literate adult, the book being a small undertaking it picks and chooses its material carefully. Some would say with prejudice. From the reader reviews that proceed this one, it would appear that Manchester has managed to offend many, some Protestant and some Latin Catholic, as well as, some claiming deep knowledge about Magellan. But then perceived prejudice and bias is often a function of reader response. Furthermore, there is criticism about his using only secondary sources as his research base. A number of reviewers purport to be scholars of the Middle Ages, although, many of them seem not articulate enough in written English to be what they claim.That the Vatican was a pest hole of immorality, political intrigue, and reaction during the period in question is beyond doubt. Manchester revels in the prevailing vice of lord and prelate. One of his major points is that practice had so far diverged from doctrine in the late Middle Ages as to make the societal construction of the era obsolete. He is no more certain that the response to it was a reformation. By in large, only in the secular domains does he find reasons to see improvement. Comparing atrocious behavior under Popes Alexander VI and Leo X can be fun. At least, Manchester was civil enough not to describe the \\"dance of the walnuts.\\" For those of more sober disposition or greater prejudice, there are many books on the late Middle Ages that avoid an in depth review of its vices. There are two available books on the voyage of Magellan neither of which add much for the general reader not in this book. Far worse could have been written about about Martin Luther and John Calvin. I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to the general reader."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"At first I thought there was NO WAY I could write a clever title for my review. And it looks as if I was right! Well, I tried......I first read this book when it was released in the 1990's, and I really enjoyed it. So when it was recently re-released in Paperback, I read it again. And I loved it MORE.If you just want the facts, ma'am, this book is not for you. This book is FULL of facts, but so much MORE! It's subjective, and has a cast of hundreds of colorful characters.It's NOT a textbook, it's a book that takes us from the fall of the Roman Empire, to the Renaissance, the Reformation, and a little beyond. If you just want names, dates, or data, this book is not for you.Wonderfully written, William Manchester makes you feel as if you are there, (the Dark Ages) even though, after the FIRST CHAPTER of this book, you will be thanking GOD you WERE NOT THERE.I cannot concieve of life back then, some of us think of the Dark Ages (if we think of them at all) as nothing more than the Black Plague, Serfs, poverty, Knights, Kings and Queens, and strife. And that's all true, but there is SO much more.It shows the power of the human spirit, that we can prevail under the WORST of circumstances, and also, we find out HOW people prevailed, and why.I have read quite a few reviews of this book, some by students who \\"had\\" to read it, others by people who must have expected something ELSE, but I was REALLY surprised when certain reviewers gave this book a ONE STAR RATING. No way. It's incredible, even if you have a problem with the religious aspects in this book, it's a MUST read.As a Catholic, I found that NOTHING bothered me, it was just information (meticulously researched, by the way) of how the corrupt Catholic Church engaged in the practice of \\"Indulgences\\", which is to say, one could actually BUY their way into Heaven, or pay to get your Grandmother out of Purgatory; you get the idea. Ludicrous. But when the Church was low on money, they sent out their minions to small towns and offered this as an option, and the people, as POOR as they were, paid. DID know about that pratice, but not the extent of it, nor how long it went on. When Martin Luther is introduced in this book, he makes it clear to the desperate common man that nothing they spent could guarantee ANYONE a \\"get out of Hell\\" free card. The Holy See did not have those powers, no one does, of course. Martin Luther is INDEED a very ODD man, but he was brilliant, devout, and also the first man to HAVE THE BIBLE WRITTEN SO THAT PEOPLE COULD READ IT! He had it transcribed into his native tongue, GERMAN, and before that, the Bible was written and published in LATIN only, and no one knew what they were reading, or should I say \\"reciting\\". Latin was a lost language, and the Holy See wanted to keep it that way, a \\"control\\" over the common man...if you will. When people began to be able to comprehend what the Bible SAID, all Hell broke loose, and the Holy See went to great lengths to try and silence Martin Luther and his supporters. Thank God they didn't succeed.I DO like the way William Manchester holds this book together; he doesn't go from A to B to C, he jumps back and forth, from one time period to another, but let's the reader know, that everything he is writing will eventually lead back to the same points. This style of writing (connecting historical facts, while making the material read somewhat like a Novel), is bold, but it gets the point(s) across very well. If you want a book with just dates and events, this book WILL disappoint. This book is VIVID, and as I said, colorful, and whether or not you agree with some of Manchester's opinions, it is GUARANTEED to make you THINK. And that's a GOOD thing.It was interesting that Manchester finishes his book with Magellean's daunting, (to say the LEAST), quest to nagivate his ships around the globe...interesing in it's OWN right. However, my husband was reading __On The Edge of the World__, the new book about MAGELLAN and his journey, (also incredibly well written and fascinating), and we compared some facts of that time, and they were both absolutely in tune with each other.I feel an author has the right to take SOME artistic lisence when writing a book (interjecting his own thoughts, things like that), to a POINT, and that's just what Manchester does, and it works.You may not agree or like everything that's written here, but it IS history. Basically it seems as if God took a vacation during the Dark Ages, and to see the light at the end of the tunnel in this book gives one a good feeling in regard to man's ability to prevail under the WORST of circumstances.William Manchester writes in a style that allows you to visualize those times, the people, he is descriptive, he doesn't drone on, and the book moves along quite nicely, but it IS NOT a \\"very easy read\\". You should be prepared for some shocks, and also be prepared to visualize parts of history that I am sure some people would either rather forget, or never know. Any way you shake it, it's COMPELLING and INFORMATIVE and NEVER boring. \\"Boring\\" is the LAST word that comes to mind when I think of this book.The debauchary of some of the Popes, especially the Borgia line, was appalling, one just has to READ this book to believe what Popes did THEN, and what it's like NOW. In the Dark Ages, the Holy See had more power than any King or Queen, and that pesky Henry the Eighth, while not the nicest person we will ever encounter in a book, did a LOT to make sure that religion did not govern everyone's lives. People did have free will, we should all be forever grateful that there WERE people who risked their lives, (or lost their lives, to show the world as they knew it then; that they had CHOICES.There is so much more about this book that is good, INFORMATIVE, and INTERESTING. The Spanish Inquisition, (a terrible thing, but something that must not be forgotten), the way people lived, the way they died, the way certain cultures continued to live in fear of Demons, or worshipped Gods of ancient times. If a woman became pregnant and her husband was away, it would often be said that an INCUBUS had come in the night, and impregnated the innocent women. Of course, since many of the poorest of the poor lived in one room and slept in one large bed, one can see how lots of hanky panky could occur........in more ways than one.Serfs often walked around completely naked in summertime, and most of their lives, they spent trying NOT to die. No hopes, no dreams, no chances. Just survival.They daily life of a peasant was boring to them, and hard, but I found itincredibly fascinating. INCREDIBLY. I could go on and on, and I usually do, but this is a GRIPPING book, sometimes even amusing, often horrifying, but always consistant with the facts of the era.If someone chooses to rate this with ONE STAR, they might as well title their review \\"Words, Words, Words,\\" indicating they don't like to read anything deeper than a Mary Higgens Clark romance Novel.__A WORLD LIT ONLY BY FIRE__ is wonderfully written, thought provoking, honest, well researched, and gives the reader a fascinating look into a time that most of us know so little about.

Yes, I still hold William Manchester's book in high esteem.Your caution signal is well received. AWLOBF is the only book dealing with the Middle Ages that I've read; any prior exposure to the subject must have occurred either by self-initiative as a pre-high school student, or during my first year in a high school history class (eras now only dimly recalled, decades later).Well, where does one start to see what might be wrong with Manchester's work? For lack of a better alternative, I slogged through 245 of the 257 Amazon reviews of the book.\\"Slogged\\" is exactly the word to use. About twenty of the reviews were exemplary, regardless of the verdict, which, overall, made the reading of all of them a worthwhile venture.Length didn't matter. One of the best was either a one or two-sentence review by a lady who said that after having read what people a thousand years ago had to endure, she is \\"grateful\\" that she lives in an era where vast improvements in our lot have been achieved.Regardless of the stars awarded, some of the best were written by the following authors (place reviews in chronological order by hitting \\"Newest First\\"):Paul Stafford (07/20/00); \\"A Customer\\" (08/08/01); Chris Gordon (09/11/01!!!);Marco Jimenez (02/27/02); Glenn McDorman (07/13/02); Juli Tolley (06/24/04);David Blair (12/21/05); Father Phillip Bloom (d. 01/04/06); Stephen Smith (10/20/08);Orville Jenkens (11/18/09); John Battle (05/18/10); & John Middleton (12/20/11).(You'd think that, by now, Amazon would have installed a \\"Find a Specific Reviewer's Review of This Book\\" search box feature.)Of the rest, I should mention the ones that caught my eye which were the negative reviews that were:A) Submitted under an alias; &B) Submitted under alias or real name, accused Manchester of getting his facts all wrong - but did not quote Manchester's assertions that they considered to be in error, & also did not offer a single refutation by quoting a historical source that contradicted Manchester's assertions.Needless to say, their oft-strident opinions were worthless.Especially offensive was one critic's Divine Right of Magisterial Dismissal: \\"I will not delve into details.\\" I could see him waving his wand at his computer screen as his undoubtedly flummoxed secretary was taking dictation.For sheer pith of inadvertent revelation of a writer's vacuity by the writer himself, I nominate \\"Manchester's not a professional historian.\\"I almost sent the author a Crane thank you note. Leading off his review with this breath-taking announcement instantly liberated me from having to plow through the remainder of whatever he had to say.In the same spirit of proving that in some parts of America, the Middle Ages is still in fine fettle, someone else regarded W.M. as \\"Although not a historian...\\"The Better Luck Next Time award went to the author of \\"When I pick up a researched historical...\\" She obviously didn't do any heavy lifting in high school.Astonishingly, of the 245 reviews I read (I couldn't locate 12 of them; don't ask), only 5 featured the dismaying format that repels one from reading a word of it: The unpunctuated-big-black-dense-inked, page-long, one-paragraph unreadable review. That was mildly encouraging.In passing, I'll note that the positive reviews - whose authors, of course, were not burdened with the requirement of providing specific proof of error - also generally failed to feature quotations from the book. That so few passages of \\"A World\\" were deemed worth quoting was, conversely, regretted.All in all, pretty flimsy stuff. As I stated to one reviewer who objected to these conditions of debate, \\"Reading these reviews, positive & negative alike, I felt as if I was in a mere fashion show, where all that it took for someone to kill off a line of clothing was their mere dislike of what they were seeing. Whether or not the fabrics were of first-class material did not matter at all. \\"(To avoid redundancy, let's leave it at that. If you have the time to peruse the comments directed towards the AWLOBF reviews, those made by myself to other reviewers might be of interest to you.)Well, that's where I'm at tonight. Only one reviewer, Mike McGrath (08/03/10; no author's quotes; no factual rebuttals; all rhetoric), mentioned a professional reviewer, professor Norman Cantor (now deceased), who had written an article in the Washington Post's Book World (05/03/92). I was interested in reading it, but when I Googled the article, the screen promptly pitched dozens of items about Eric Cantor, the current House of Representatives Majority Whip. Big help that was.So I'm right back where I started, looking for a well-written, substantive, non-ax grinding summary of what is stated in AWLOBF.Any suggestions? If there's anything that is factually misleading or incorrect in AWLOBF, I want to know about it. I admire Manchester, but I haven't lost my standards.Thanks!Don Reed"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Whether you are looking for a spectacular read, are a student or just a history buff, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is of a caliber that is equally enjoyable to any of the above readers.Beginning with a glimpse into the medieval European's mind, Manchester goes on to describe the key events and personalities that led to the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation - both of which are firmly rooted in the medieval tradition, both irreversably changing Europe into a modern society. The book is magnificent. Even though I am very familiar with the era, Manchester's writing kept me in rapt attention. In writing about individuals such as Lucretzia Borgia and Martin Luther, you truly get a feel for them as real people, not just dry names and dates as is so often the case in histories. Manchester also does a remarkable job of clarifying and explaining the events which were so influential to European (and world) history: the birth of the Renaissance, European exploration of the world, the Protestant Reformation, the Columbian exchange.A World Lit Only By Fire is entertaining, fascinating and historically accurate. I am sure you will enjoy it as much as I have - I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This is not a history text, far from that, as Manchester asserts in the beginning of the book. This book is for enjoyment purposes and meant to be taken with a grain of salt. Yes, there are discrepancies with certain timeline events and peoples. On the same note, I have found many errors within elementary, high school, and university texts as well.I am skeptical that most reviewers who gave this book less than 3 stars are, in fact, disturbed or offended with the assertions put forth by Manchester.In conclusion, if you wish to be entertained while getting a unique view of the era, this is a very good book.If you are devoutly religious and take offence to the assertion that the church has ever done any wrong or you perceive that all popes and religious figures were good and pure, then stay far, far away from this book. Also, I would not use this book for high school aged students as a stand alone text; on the contrary, this is at best a supplemental read if used for educational purposes and should only accompany a stronger, more soundly based historical account of the period."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This was required summer reading for my daughter's 10th grade AP European History class. The assignment also included an essay and a few sheets of fill in the blank questions. For weeks she and her friends struggled with the assignment because of the dry and uninteresting nature of the writing. The time period covered was, in fact, quite interesting, and many writers have covered the material better.I don't recommend this book. I'm an avid reader and medieval history fan, and while I helped her with her questions, reading passages of this book was nearly painful."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Despite the author's bias, \\"A World Lit Only By Fire\\" is both informative and interesting.

I read though a lot of it and it isn't my kind of book but it was a decent written book and I would recommend it to history buffs."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"It takes work to make the \\"broad sweep of history\\" come alive and be meaningful the way Manchester does. I don't read histories too often, but this is worthwhile. in a series of strong vignettes built around the life-and-times of central figures of the late Medieval era, it covers the crucial time period for Europeans that stretched from the dawn of the Renaissance into the Reformation and leaves you at the footsteps of The Enlightenment. Characters he selects for these tales include Lucrecia Borgia (whatta hot tomato!), Erasmus, Martin Luther, winding up with his favorite, Magellan. It's his theory that Magellan's proof (to the Europeans) that the world was a sphere was the final blow to the Church's secular supremacy. He pulls these threads together expertly in a lively readable style; it's not too long either."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"As a Medieval Studies major I was eager to read a book that was NOT required. I was overwhelmingly surprised with this one. _A World Lit Only by Fire_ covers the basics of medieval history while enlightening the reader with stories of the time. What impressed me most was the variety of characters displayed. I'm sorry to say that most of the books I have read on the subject did not mention many of the people found in this book--or at least not in as much depth. I am intrigued and eager to find out more about each of them. I highly recommend this book to anyone who desires an easy-to-read, in-depth introduction to medieval times."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I am not a historian. I read quite a bit about history but rarely do I read about the time period covered in the book. I feel that many of the people who reviewed this book probably missed the point of the work. As Manchester clearly stated in the intro this is not a work of scholarship, it is a distillation of a variety of historical accounts that he read. I suppose the critique is that Manchester chose the most provocative topics to discuss. Judging by the pure emotion poured into a number of the scathing reviews of this book, he apparently offended many with his point of view.Whatever the facts are about this book there is one fact that is important from my perspective. This book is very entertaining. Unlike many historians I have read Manchester essentially compares the life and times of people in the Middle Ages by looking backward critically. It is this perspective which makes the people seem incredibly primitive and makes you wonder how the human race survived so long. His subjective review of the actions of the clergy and Papacy are mind numbingly inflammatory and tantalizing.If you can look past that or do not have a problem with that point of view I suggest reading this work. If you feel like reading a book about history that is fun and wildly entertaining I would definitely read this.The author's distain for organized religion and the clergy of the Middle Ages and Renaissance clearly comes out in the book. If you consider yourself highly religious or a pedantic historian I would probably go some place else, you might be offended by this work."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"_A world lit only by fire_ is by no means supposed to be a friendly look at the Middle Ages. It's a history of the days between the fall of Rome and the beginning of the Age of Discovery, which led to the colonization of America and the foundation of the world as we know it today. It's gritty, compelling, sometimes funny in it's depiction, but it makes no excuses for the inhabitants of those centuries between the end of the Empire and the beginning of enlightenment. Those who say it was a horrid book probably haven't looked at it objectively at all and are taking their own biased opinions from Arthurian legend and what their college class tells them. Most compelling is the true story of Robin Hood...he isn't Erol Flynn OR Kevin Coster...he's more of a thief than a noble. Don't but don't let me tell you the whole tale, go get a book and add it to your collection. It's a must read for anyone with a remote interest in the Middle Ages"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This book is absolutely marvelous. While others may criticize Manchester for not being 'scholarly' and sticking to movements and the generalities of medieval Europe, I say &quot;Thank you!&quot; We didn't read this to be taught &quot;and this king begat this king who begat this. . .&quot; and all that rubbish. We didn't read it to memorize &quot;and this is the year which is considered the beginning of the --- period in . . .&quot; We don't care. We read it because we wanted to know some of the more interesting tidbits that one of the most fascinating periods in human history has to offer us. Thats what makes history intresting! Not the dates of certain reigns of certain monarchs, but what those monarchs actually did that our World History books back in tenth grade failed to mention, being deemed inappropriate for 15 year olds. I encountered this book in an AP European History course, and of the 17 members of the class, I can't name a one that regretted taking time out of the summer before their senior year to read this book. Intresting books like this are what inspired me to become a history major, and I have no clue as to why anyone would want to go into History if all it was was boring dissertations and thesises having solely to do with what generally happened when. Without facets of history like the ones presented in this book, no one in there right mind would ever give a second thougt to the subject. Also, I myself am a Catholic but have the good sense to recognize the shortcomings of past leaders and their practices. To say that A World Lit Only by Fire is unfairly Anti-Catholic for airing some of the dirty laundry of Renaissance popes is comparable to saying that Schindler's List is unfairly Anti-German for presenting them in an unfavorable light."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I'm a medievalist. Yes, Manchester got a lot of the Middle Ages stuff wrong, or at least very distorted. He doesn't make facts up, but he presents some *highly* selected facts and bases fairly wild conclusions on that selection.He says, for instance, that no technological progress happened in the Middle Ages, but reading even the title of the book \\"Horsecollar, Waterwheel, and Cathedral\\" proves otherwise. For another instance, he professes to believe that medieval man had no sense of self, \\"a total lack of ego,\\" because there are no signatures or records of those who built the cathedrals. Yet if we look at any modern construction project -- bridge, skyscraper, or jet plane -- we likewise find no signatures, no egos except those of the corporation which built it. Are we modern people, then, also without ego? Not exactly.Furthermore, it's true that Manchester seems to thoroughly enjoy the R-rated aspects of the medieval church, so much so that's it's hard to believe this is the same man who wrote the somber, dignified \\"Death of a President\\" or most of Churchill's biography, \\"The Last Lion.\\" I can only assume that, having survived the serious illness that he mentions at the start of this book, Manchester was in a \\"what the hell!\\" mood, and just let 'er rip.For the record, medieval society did make advances in the lives of common folks; for just one example, the invention of the horse-collar, which sounds mundane now, enabled animals to pull loads and heavy plows so much more easily that whole areas of Europe were opened up for agriculture for the first time.And the medieval church, while it surely had its bad apples, also kept literacy and science alive and provided all the social services that governments struggle to provide today.Furthermore, the great Renaissance men he admires weren't always all that great. Manchester here uses the familiar trick of criticising the \\"enemy\\" for what he *does,\\" while praising the \\"good guys\\" for what they *think.* For instance, Galileo's science was indeed wonderful, but the way he treated his two young daughters -- forcing them unwilling into a convent at ages 12 and 10, so that the younger went insane -- might be reasonably set alongside the antics of rotten old Pope Alexander VI as a way *not* to treat your children.So, yes, Manchester's wrong about a lot of things. But he has so much fun with it that I, for one medievalist, don't grudge him his pleasure. The book is lively and entertaining, which most medieval histories are not. Those readers who go away thinking that the Middle Ages was stagnant and the popes were evil will at least have learned a few things about Renaissance advances in science. Other readers may be tempted, by this spicy taste of history, to look further and deeper. Either way, it's good."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Reading this book, I was continually reminded of an observation made some years ago by my professor of medieval French literature, in response to a student's question about whether Renaissance was superior to medieval culture. The professor responded, &quot;Do you know why so many people fainted in the presence of King Louis XIV? Not because they were overcome by awe, but because the man stank so badly--he never bathed the royal body!&quot; He went on to contrast what he perceived as the appalling personal hygiene habits of the Renaissance with the more regular bathing practices of medieval people. Sure, maybe this was just another exaggeration in the long-running and acrimonious debate between medievalists and Renaissance scholars. The point is, however, that when you start trying to retrofit historical periods with modern values and judgments, you invite an unending stream of &quot;yes, but...&quot; retorts.Manchester's book deserves more than its share of retorts. It has many overt biases, beginning with the title. Lit only by fire? Did the sun never shine between the years 1000 to 1500? Was every human alive in those centuries as darkly ignorant as Manchester depicts them? One wonders if Manchester has ever seen such wonders of the Middle Ages as the Cathedral of Chartres and Notre Dame de Paris or experienced the wonderous effect of light shining through their stained-glass windows.The book is stridently anti-Catholic. In principle I don't mind even though I'm Catholic, because the Church--as would any institution of such longevity--has quite a few skeletons in the closet. So, yes, but... the Church also had a hand in the beginning of universities, hospitals, charitable institutions, and much else that we regard as good. It provided refuge and served to hold the power of kings and lords in check. My teenage son is reading this book as required summer reading, and his first comments only a few chapters into it echoed those of other reviewers on this site: the negativism and salacious stuff are laid on so thick it becomes tiresome, and eventually downright annoying.Nonetheless, there is no gainsaying the effortless quality of Manchester's writing, and the chapters on Magellan and the age of exploration are superb. Yes, but... I don't suppose the Incans or the Aztecs much appreciated the coming of the Europeans."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"The only thing decent about this book is the treatment of Ferdinand Magellan-- but then, I understand the book is an expansion of an article on Magellan that Manchester wrote earlier. He should have stuck with the article, or written a book just on Magellan.Generally, the book is full of historical views that are outdated, discredited, or just plain without any basis in fact at all. The history of the period has been lumped together into one giant chaotic mass, with little attempt to show change over time. It appears that his main sources for his research were children's history books written before 1950 and Victorian &quot;historical&quot; porno novels.It was an enjoyable read, in the sense that such novels as &quot;Princess Daisy&quot; are enjoyable, but it is worthless and misleading as a source of actual historical information.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Possibly one of the worst history books ever written. Manchester does not at all stress relevant points. He tries his best to discredit any accomplishments the Medieval Ages have brought. He praises Magellan's colonial efforts, and absoulutely nothing else."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I was going to title this review \\"A Mind Lit Only by Stereotypes.\\" William Manchester repeats the old clich&eacute;s about the ignorance and crudity of the Medieval Mind - and how it was shattered by casting off the restrictions of religious dogma. For example, he states that the \\"menace of Copernicus\\" was that \\"if the earth were shrunken to a mere speck in the universe, mankind would also be diminished.\\" This, according to Manchester, challenged the Scriptures which \\"assumed that everything had been created for the use of man.\\" Not quite. The Bible asks what worth man has in comparison to the majesty of the heavens (cf. Ps. 8) and the standard medieval textbook on astronomy states: \\"The earth in relation to the distance of the fixed stars has no appreciable size and must be treated as a mathematical point.\\" (*Almagest,* bk. I, ch. v) Manchester would have done well to have read *Those Terrible Middle Ages* by the renowned French historian Regine Pernoud which debunks the common myths about that historical period.Still, I must say that Manchester told a darn good story. I found myself comparing it with a popular novel which claims to recount history - *The DaVinci Code.* They were both fun to read, but neither went very deep into their characters. For example, Manchester devotes about fifty pages to Martin Luther but mainly focuses on colorful details such as his reported farting matches with devil. He never gets inside Luther or helps a reader understand why his theology continues to have such an impact almost five centuries later. Likewise, the other people he depicts - including his hero Magellan - come across as two-dimensional characters. Nevertheless, they were more believable than the cardboard characters in *The DaVinci Code.* And, unlike Dan Brown, Manchester uses fairly respectable sources for his tale.*A World Lit Only By Fire* will provide a few evenings of fun reading. Hopefully, it might lead the reader to more substantial books such as the works of Regine Pernoud or the recent book by Thomas E. Wood, Ph.D., *How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization.* And if you really want to understand the Medieval Mind, it is time to read (or re-read) *The Divine Comedy.*"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I first read this book when I was a senior in high school and it was horrible, horrible, horrible. Part of that, of course, was my fault because I wasn't really prepared to read this book at that time. But at least part of the blame rests with Manchester. His book is horribly organized, there's a lot of name dropping, and there's a lot of head-spinning minutae that I found to be neither important nor put in its appropriate context.That was the first read.About nine years later, after college and law school, I revisited this work. I realized that as I grew, so did the book, but it's still wasn't great. This time around the names, references, and details made sense, but it was also clear to me that Manchester did not succeed, in my view anyway, in showing exactly what happened between the Renaissance and Middle Ages to mark the pronounced difference between the two.Recommendation: if you're already familiar with the Middle Ages, it's probably a 4-star book that will fill in some holes in your knowledge of the period (as it did for me during my second visit with this book). However, if you're unfamiliar with the era and are thinking about learning a bit about the Middle Ages and Renaissance, DO NOT START HERE. Try &quot;A Distant Mirror&quot; by Barbara Tuchman and perhaps something like J.M. Robert's &quot;A History of Europe,&quot; or, if you're really ambitious, his &quot;History of the World.&quot; After this, I guarantee Manchester's book will make much more sense."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"For anyone who knows the first thing about the Middle Ages, this book will tend to induce projectile vomiting. Manchester approaches the subject with jaundice, gets his facts wrong, and is laughably illogical. The worst thing about this book is that so many people have read it under the mistaken impression that it has something substantive to say. Flee from this book as fast as you can."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"William Manchester is Professor of History Emeritus at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. Over the years he has written many popular works on history; this is his contribution to the medieval period.Manchester's particular interest and area of expertise is the life and accomplishments of Ferdinand Magellan. This book sets up the picture of Magellan's world, beginning with the Dark Ages and moving to the beginning of the sixteenth century. He sees in Magellan a symbolic figure--the personification of the end of the medieval mind and the beginning of the modern age. The last major section of the book is about Magellan himself.After discussing the medieval mind in general, Manchester proceeds to show how their world progressed and then came to an end. He traces the major events in Europe over a five hundred-year period. He conceives of the medieval mind as being superstitious, subject to the authority of the church, and full of erroneous ideas. One notes throughout the book a pronounced dislike of religion, especially of Christianity and the institutional church. His sharpest barbs are reserved for popes and Protestant reformers. With the coming of the scientific age, he sees the intellectual demise of religion in general and Christianity in particular. Religion is relegated to ethical values and encouraging legends. It is disappointing to see how he ignores the fact that Christianity, and Protestant Christianity in particular, spurred the modern scientific method.Manchester admits that he depends almost exclusively on secondary sources. This is a major weakness of the book. While writing in my own field (Reformed theology) Manchester betrays an abysmal ignorance of Calvin's ideas and positions and history, accepting the most common stereotypes. He gives a very unbalanced picture of Calvin, and I think of Luther as well.I would rate this book as two stars, except that his excellent discussion of Magellan's life, adventures, and significance raises it up in my opinion to three stars.This book is written for a popular audience, and one can see while reading it that he is used to college students. He writes in a quick, racy style that is easy to read and often entertaining. He often writes about sexual topics, more often it seems than called for and giving more detailed information than necessary; but then maybe this was necessary in his lectures to keep his college students listening."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This book, 'A World Lit Only By Fire', by William Manchester, is an appalling book. Written in a sensationalist, purple prose, and with only a passing swipe at scholarship, Manchester gives such a dystopian vision of medieval and renaissance times that one is forced to approach the book as fiction. I cannot recommend this book to anyone, expert, scholar, or junior high reader. It is false."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This is definitely not the first book you want to read about the Middle Ages. Notwithstanding the laudatory comments of other reviewers, and the virtual reverence in which William Manchester seems to be held. There is quite a controversy about this book, to judge by the other reviews - which I urge you to read to get a flavour for the dispute. Here is why I say you should avoid this book.The man who revolutionised the way we think of the Middle Ages was NOT William Manchester. It was Norman F. Cantor. His book, \\"The Civilization of the Middle Ages\\" was the first book to focus on the culture and religion of the period as opposed to the political history. And before Cantor it was a commonly held view that Western Europe during this period was a dank hell-hole with no redeeming value for civilization - indeed most people referred to the period as \\"The Dark Ages\\". Cantor changed this forever. Cantor's enthusiasm and erudition is legendary. The book, when it appeared in 1963, created a sensation - and it has recently been expanded and updated.Why all of this about Cantor in a review of Manchester? Because NONE of these things can be said about Manchester's book. Now the apologists for his book suggest that those of us who are critical of it should \\"lighten up\\"; that \\"A World Lit Only By Fire\\" is an introductory volume for general audiences; that it is beautifully written - and so forth.Fair enough. But on at least part of this we will have to agree to disagree. Yes it is an introductory volume, but BECAUSE of that I have cause to shudder. This is NOT the first book I would want a general reader to encounter as he or she launch forth on a voyage of discover of the Middle Ages. For one thing Manchester is dead wrong about so many things it takes your breath away. This has been adequately documented elsewhere, so I will not delve into details. Manchester almost exclusively uses secondary sources - which is not a crime in and of itself - but the astonishing fact is that he does not even acknowledge the existence of Cantor! THAT is criminal. It is almost as if he wants to wish Cantor (who would be his competitor in a sense) out of existence. And the worst part of it is that Manchester's view of what life was like in the Middle Ages is vastly out of date - it is unrepresentative of what we now know to be the case.The first time I tried to read this book I actually put it aside in disgust after sixty pages. But I forced myself to finish. It is full of trite generalisations, glib commentaries, vapid truisms and empty but expansive judgements. This is not to say Manchester did not love his subject matter. It is to say that his grasp of it is tragically flawed. The general (and indeed specialist) reader is advised to RUN to \\"The Civilization of the Middle Ages\\" by Norman F. Cantor and to steer clear of this below par effort from an otherwise quite brilliant writer."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"In my book, \\"Astronomical Symbols on Ancient and Medieval Coins\\", I devote a number of chapters to the astronomical symbols that were depicted on medieval coinage as signs of divine right to sovereignty.

What pretentious and circuitous writing! All the glowing reviews of this book indicate two possible, yet opposite, ideas. One, that the book is comprehensible to some, probably those well-read enough to be familiar with all the persons, places, history and literature that are referred to. Or two, that this book, by such a prestigious writer as William Manchester, is so incomprehensible that the literati write glowing reviews in order to mask their inability to make sense of the book.To assign this book to high school sophomores is a crime! I am helping a fifteen-year-old friend with her summer reading. She is in accelerated classes and is plenty smart to merit placement in the advanced placement history course that requires this book. Reading it, however, is a bigger task than she can manage, so I offered to help. What an unpleasant surprise awaited me! I have a bachelors degree, cum laude, from Illinois Wesleyan University. I have read many books since graduation, and have had innumerable discussions with my philosophy-major husband and his intellectual friends. All that is to say that I am neither ignorant nor stupid. I now believe, after working on this book, that it is assigned as summer reading because the teachers find it as difficult as I do to help a high-school student make sense out of it.I give this book one star. I would give it zero except for three reasons: one, my respect for the greater body of William Manchester's work; two, I find Manchester's pretentious language use and anti-Catholic/pro-Moslem slants to be quite humorous at times -- although dangerous to those who take his odd phrases and overt biases as historical fact; and three, Amazon.com doesn't offer \\"zero\\" stars!I encourage high school and college readers to submit their reviews of this book, in the hope of saving the sanity of future students.P.S.

All forms of collectivism hold that the individual should be sacrificed to a greater good. And all of them try to subordinate Man to their will with all force necessary. They wouldn't have to use force (they say) if people would just obey! In modern (Collectivist) times we were taught that ideally collectivism is noble, but Ayn Rand showed us how to defuse that little booby trap. Manchester shows us the Dark Ages, 1000 years of factual, Christian and Collectivist idealism. They lived in squalor. Manchester writes, &quot;The centerpiece of the room was a gigantic bedstead, piled high with straw pallets, all seething with vermin. Everyone slept there, regardless of age or gender... almost all the floors were of clay and rushes from the marshes harboring spittle and vomit...&quot; Christianity was in control for one thousand years. Was their aim to enlighten? No, it was to subjugate. Did they show Man how to lift his head? No, taught him to bow it. Did they teach Man how to live a better life on earth? No, they despised this earth. Did they teach Man to get off his knees and take pride in himself? No, pride is a sin and Self is evil. They had Man exactly where they wanted him - a mindless, tormented zombie who had no name and lived for centuries in the same nameless hamlet. And for those who were brave enough to argue; they were burned to death. Life on earth was as horrible as the depraved Christians could make it. And, some of them relished the misery and were actually arouse by the pain they inflicted. It's all in the book. Manchester shows how evil the enemies of Individualism are and how they try to subjugate the individual to their greater good! If you can call the Dark Ages good.For a thousand years the Man haters enjoyed the spectacle of Man crawling on his belly and the spectacle of Man being brutalized, AND OF MAN BEING OBEDIENT!!!When the Heroes of the Enlightenment finally gained enough force to make a difference they found the unbearably, sad refuse of a thousand year of torture was hard to see. Manchester writes, &quot;The mighty storm was swiftly approaching, but Europeans were not only unaware of it; they were convinced that such a phenomenon could not exist. Shackled in ignorance, disciplined by fear, and sheathed in superstition, they trudged into the sixteenth century in the clumsy, hunched, pigeon-toed gait of rickets victims, their vacant faces pocked by smallpox, turned blindly toward the future they thought the knew - gullible, pitiful innocents who were about to be swept up in the most powerful, incomprehensible, irresistible vortex since Alaric had led his Visigoths and Huns across the Alps fallen on Rome, and extinguished the lamps of learning a thousand years before&quot;.If you believe that you have a right to your life.

Manchester not only writes about the main events, but he is able to catch the reader's attention with interesting and unexpected facts so the book does not completely sound like a history book. This books shows that a book cannot be judged by its cover because the title may seem to be one of a book which talks about the whole world, when it really only talks about Europe. The book tries to include most of the important historical figures of this time period such as: Sir Thomas More, John Alvin, Erasmus, and Henry VIII, but unfortunately Martin Luther and Magellan are talked about the most so it seems the writer is biased and favors these two men. This book can be seen as an introduction to the period of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, but it is really a brief history book discussing the lack of achievements in the Middle Ages, different aspects of the Renaissance, especially the Church, and Magellan's travels, which help broaden the reader's knowledge and at the same time might bore him or her.The first section of the book, A Medieval Mind, gives somewhat of a summary of the Middle Ages as it discusses the lack of achievements, which is informative but seems to show the writer's bias. Manchester seems to display a bias in this first section by making it seem like he is trying to show that no great events happened in the medieval times. The Middle Ages are described in this section as being a time when people were not so educated and the medieval mind was invisible and silent because of \\"the medieval man's lack of self ego\\" (21), but the men of the time would probably disagree with this bias. Even though it somewhat shows Manchester's bias, it is interesting to learn that in the Middle Ages people only had first names and \\"...noblemen had surnames...the rest...were known as Hans, Jacques, Sal, Carlos, Will or Will's wife...\\" (21), a great difference from today's society where everyone has last names. It seems like the whole book would be biased as in the first chapter, but is proves not to as the following chapter about the Renaissance explains much detail about this period of time.The next section of the book, The Shattering, is more interesting than the first as it informs about the different aspects of the Renaissance, especially the Church, but there is some information about the Church that is highly unexpected. The unexpected information about the Church, which was about the pope, was the most interesting because it was some of the most engaging details in the book. It is quite interesting to learn how promiscuous the head leader of the Church was because the Church in the Middle Ages was highly respected. The information about Pope Alexander VI, also known as Rodrigo Lanzol Borgia, seems to drift away from the rest of the book's more knowledgeable facts and stir interest as it describes in great detail how the pope \\"was distracted by the sight of her adolescent daughter lying beside them, naked, thighs yawning wide, matching her mother's thrust for pelvic thrust...He switched partners midstroke.\\" (76) Moreover, it was interesting to read about the papal parties were basically sex parties and how \\"servants kept score of each man's orgasms.\\" (79) because this was a surprising fact. Although this part of the chapter was interesting, almost half of the chapter consisted of information about Martin Luther and the Church, which was not as interesting because it was like reading a history book and made it seem like Manchester favored Luther as he described him as \\"the ultimate determinist (176).\\" Besides seemingly showing favoritism to Luther, the book does provide a good deal of information in the next and final chapter of the book.The last chapter of the book, One Man Alone, focuses on one man, Ferdinand Magellan, who was alluded to in the two previous chapters, and his travels make this section engaging with the facts and information presented. The part of this section which was interesting is the information offered about Magellan's time spent in the Philippines, because other resources usually do not go in depth about this topic and talk about it briefly. The book was able to present more unexpected information, again about sexuality, and keep interest, when it explained how, \\"The men ran wild... the Filipino maidens preferred white lovers, finding them more erotic and more vigorous...\\" (270) which strays away from just plain historical facts and add some juicy details. Additionally, the writer mentions how after his death, \\"every evidence of Ferdinand Magellan's existence had vanished from earth\\" (282), an ironic statement because Manchester has alluded to Magellan in every chapter and now he talks about Magellan's existence vanishing. Furthermore, the book may be somewhat helpful if the reader is looking for some information about the history of the Philippines because a good amount of information about Magellan in the Philippines is presented. In the end, A World Lit Only by Fire, maintains its historical value while at the same time provides the reader with interesting details and may unfortunately bore the reader as well in some parts.When I first saw this book, I was not sure what to expect because the title did not tell much about the contents. I thought that the whole book would not be interesting because the first chapter was pretty boring because it did not talk much about main events, rather a general overview of the Dark Ages. As I read on, the book was getting a little better, but most of the second chapter was dull because it seemed like I was reading a history book, expect the part abut Pope Alexander VI, which is why I wrote about that section. That part was interesting because, as I stated earlier it was unexpected. The other parts of the second chapter were also monotonous because there was so much time spent talking about Erasmus and Luther, but I did learn a lot about them and the other important people because of all the information about him. The last chapter was not that dreary because there was a good amount about Magellan in the Philippines, which was interesting to me because I am Filipino. Overall, I learned a lot about European history and it has helped because when I am reading the text book I am able to recognize names and know some of the things being talked about, but I probably would never read this book for pleasure and if it was my summer assignment."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I was forced to read this very long and very boring book over the summer for my Ap European History class. Normally I love to read nonfiction history, but this book was an exception. Very unorganized, and hard to understand it was very choppy and there was absolutely no flow whatsoever. Mr.Manchester seemed to be a bit obsessed with the corrupt sexual details of the time period and it seems he could find nothing good about the church at all. I don't know what our teacher was thinking when he made us read this book, I wonder if he actually read it."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"When I saw this book I couldn't believe that it was written by my William Manchester - but it was. What was he doing in Medieval times and not World War II or post war America? I enjoyed the book. I see that it has brought a lot of medieval critics and experts out of the catacombs. I'm no medieval expert. For me it was a fun and interesting read. It was Manchester throughout and I had no trouble keeping up an interest. When I finished I said to myself, This guy can make anything interesting. He had a great knack. He was a darn good writer.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother\\" A Novel"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"A blockbuster of a story about the roots of Western Civilization. Manchester is an entertaining writer with amazing depth and intellectual range. Anyone with interest in history, especially the dark and sordid history of medieval religion should read this one."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"The book was an excellent read. Although not arranged chronologically, it was still presented in a manner which was very logical and easy to follow. Manchester provides fascinating details on a variety of subjects, including the development of the Roman Catholic Church and its influence on medieval society. My only complaint is that Manchester, an apparent athiest or agnostic, makes off-handed comments regarding the accuracy of the bible without providing any historical basis for his remarks. Since Manchester is such a renowned historian, I would have expected him to provide some evidence to support his assertions. That he failed to do so causes me some concern about the accuracy of his other thesis, but I still think the book is worth reading."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This author has no real concept of the medieval ages, basing his text on what can only be seen as stereotypes. The author frequently gets his information wrong, and contradicts himself when it is convenient for his exploitative text. As another reader put it, this is &quot;tabloid literature&quot; at it's finest. He uses the outdated method of progressive history and speaks in dull metaphors of darkness and light. Read this book only if you want trite and clich&eacute; nonsense about an extremely interesting period of history. Absolute trash."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"In the book A World Lit Only By Fire, Manchester discusses the impact of the Dark Ages, the Medieval period, and the Renaissance as each had a major influence on Europe. The significance of this book is to develop knowledge of society and its characteristics during these eras. Throughout the book Manchester mainly talks about the history of the Roman Catholic Church and the quest of Ferdinand Magellan. The book is separated into three parts: The Medieval Mind, The Shattering and One Man Alone. Which give a detailed description of the figures that played a major role in society and whose actions and personality stood out above all. All three sections discuss the changes that occurred at the time and the effect they had on the people. A World Lit Only By Fire broadens the reader's understanding of European society, religion, exploration, and how each impacted and influenced history.In the first section, The Medieval Mind, Manchester gives the reader an elaborate description of the fall of the Roman Empire and the Dark Ages and its effect on society because of plague, famine, and reoccurring climate changes. All of which thinned the population and brought storms and floods. The fall of the Roman Empire seem to come as a shock to some people of the time but to those who it was evident lacked enough knowledge to help build it up again. Manchester felt it astonishing that no one from this time saw where it was leading. In other words, \\"They lacked perspective\\" and \\"Like all people at all times, they were confronted each day by the present, which always arrives in a promiscuous rush, with the significant, the trivial, the profound, and the fatuous all tangled together\\" (pg.26). \\" The popes, emperors, cardinals, kings, prelates, and nobles of the time sorted through the snarl, and being typical men in power they chose to believe what they wanted to believe, accepting whatever justified their policies and convictions and ignoring the rest\\" (pg26). The people of this time were oblivious to what was happening in the world and because of this the reformation and rebirth of society became even more difficult to rebuild.In the second section, The Shattering, Manchester presents us with the characterizations of the later middle ages and Renaissance period with the corruption of the Catholic Church. The one scandalous Spanish family that stands out in this period is the Borgia's whose name had become notorious \\"a half-century earlier, when the reigning pontiff was Pius II\\" (pg.75). The Borgia family gained a notorious name because of the sexual intercourse they engaged in with one another that led to the conceiving of a child. Pope Alexander VI decided that \\"once the infant was born; Lucrezia could pass him off as her baby brother --- as indeed she did for the rest of her life\\" (pg.85) He did this to reduce suspicions and accusations of the child being his. This immoral act influenced the corruption and questioning of the Catholic Church because it did not follow the regulations and traditions of the time. Meanwhile Italian arts flourished, because all the controversy and lack of moral restraint ignited creativity. Some of the great artist and sculptors of this time were Michelangelo who painted the Sistine Chapel, Raphael, Botticelli and Titian because of their unique artistic style/techniques. Leonard Da Vinci was also one of the great artists who was a true example of a Renaissance man because he looked beyond all the chaos as well as questioned everything and wanted to know how everything worked. Da Vinci, like Copernicus, \\"threatened the certitude that knowledge had been forever fixed by God, the rigid mind-set which left no role for curiosity or innovation\\" (pg.91). Had Leonardo Da Vinci lived in a different era, he may not have been able to look beyond the unquestionable (God) and be free to create masterpieces and express himself. Other influential people who made a difference and actually challenged the world in which they lived are Erasmus and Martin Luther, because they felt the behavior coming from the Church was unacceptable and the traditions it presented were not put into practice. There was no unity present in this society and it was mostly because the Church did not set high enough standards for people to live and follow by. There was however, one very influential man who seemed to have an impact and produce a change in society and culture during this time named Ferdinand Magellan.In the final section, One Man Alone, Manchester introduces to us the Portuguese explorer, Ferdinand Magellan who is present throughout the entire book because his aspiration in life was the unknown. His aspiration influenced other explorers to follow their navigational senses and discover new lands. Magellan's voyage around the world led to his death in the Philippines because he was trying to convert natives to Catholicism. His desire to explore often affected his life, personality, and caused set backs. Magellan's voyage opened the world, \\"thus introducing the modern age.\\" (pg.229) For example, \\"The patterns of Magellan's age are now clear\\" (pg.228) meant that even after negative influences and natural disasters there could still be an uprising of curiosity and discovery. Ferdinand Magellan was one of the first individuals to cross all the meridians of the globe, lead an expedition sailing westward from Europe to Asia, and to cross the Pacific Ocean which made him an ideal explorer.I personally felt that William Manchester, in a World Lit Only By Fire, provided the reader with a significant amount of information and detail from each major event and person in each time period. Manchester tends to jump around a lot from one point in history to another which at times made the read difficult and a little confusing. He knew however, how to keep the readers enticed in what they were reading by introducing and giving full descriptions of the controversial times. From reading this book I learned a lot of things that I did not previously know. I think A World Lit By Fire is actually the perfect book to read to become acquainted with European history."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This isn't quite a tabloid, and it isn't quite a history book. Mr. Manchester is writing this book for the &quot;masses&quot;. It's true, it's kind of an &quot;old fashioned&quot; look at the Middle Ages, BUT,my bet is the truth is somewhere between today's revisionists and Mr. Manchester. I find it sort of odd that no one mentioned the seemingly endless pages on Luther, especially when the book is over half finished before you finally get to the Renaissance and Magellan's &quot;biography.&quot;Evidently some of the reviewers didn't read Manchester'sstatements on bibliography, or they would have known he did take a lot of his information from Will Durant....speaking of old information and old ideas of the Middle ages..I found this book to be pretty enjoyable reading. If you take into account that the average reading level of the &quot;average&quot; American is somewhere btween the 4th and 6th grade level, you realize it's hard to get people to read anything at all. It's nice that people can read some semblance of history in an enjoyable narrative rather than nothing at all. Most people won't read the more &quot;sophisticated&quot; and &quot;scholarly&quot; works of history at all, so at least their getting something at their level."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I read this book several years ago and am about to read it again.It's one of my favorite books. As a High School student I was bored by history but all that has changed since reading this book. Manchester's approach to dealing with this period in European history is engrossing, enlightening and even entertaining. I have since gone on to read several books on the early history of Wales, England and the monarchy. I have to credit my new interest in history to Mr. Manchester and this book. I look forward to reading more works by this fine author."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Wow--I had to read this book for my AP European History summer reading, and I was not looking forward to the task. Although it started out very, very slowly, it became increasingly interesting throughout, and it is loaded with an abundance of information from the popes to Copernicus to Machievelli. Very resourceful, and it's one I shall always keep. I had no idea how different life was during that time until I read this book. I'd love to be in Manchester's class."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Manchester seems to be an interesting character himself from what can be ascertained from his writing...he just ups and decides to write about medieval-renaissance Europe from his sickbed. Well, I certainly can't say I wasn't entertained while reading this book...hell, i can guarantee I'll never read a more entertaing account of a papal orgy in my lifetime. Now for the scholarly criticism -- no breakthroughs to be found between the covers. First, if you really want to get an idea how awful medieval life was, read _A Distant Mirror_ and skip the first section. Then, he chooses Ferdinand Magellan as his &quot;linchpin&quot; for the Renaissance, but I really never understood why, except for the fact that he was quite dashing. Plus, guess who he identifies as the man who saved Europe from the depravity of the church? You guessed it...Martin Luther!! Such a controversial stance for a historian to take! His account of Luther's life owes everything to Erik Erikson's _Young Man Luther_, in fact he did an excellent job paraphrasing the book into two pages. In the end, and oddly enough for a modern historian, he ignores the socioeconomic conditions of the time as impetus for the Renaissance/Age of Discovery, and instead writes a composite biography of the Great Men of 13-14th century Europe. But sure, it has its redeeming qualities as well. I love his writing style, great for popular history. I especially loved his account of Magellan's circumnavigation, but the part where he says that Geoffrey Chaucer started the Age of Discovery is almost laughable. I had a lot of fun reading this and you probably will too, but if you're doing research, go somewhere else."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I own upwards of 5000 books. This is the only book I've ever thrown away. The only possible redeaming feature of this book is that it is a catalog of every existing medieval history cliche."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"The book reads like a novel. It's a page turner that will have you dashing to the internet to dive deeper into a endless string of historical figures, events, and discoveries.Most of us have been taught to believe that the Middle Ages do not offer much that is significant or interesting. Manchester will show you otherwise. This is not, nor was it meant to be, a definitive volume or scholarly treatise. It is, however, an informative, entertaining, and quick survey of a critical but often neglected part of western history.If you enjoy history you will enjoy this read."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"The real history of Medieval times and the beginning of the Renaissance. I found this book so enlightening, informative and interesting. I've read medieval histories before, but none have ever left me feeling like I knew more than I did after Art 101 in college.High School students should be required to read this to get a real idea of what Medieval times were like, and why the reformation came!"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"William Manchester's book about life in medieval and renaissance Europe is an excellent study of the forces at work in Europe, where the power of the Roman Catholic Church was fading and more secular leaders were coming to power. Some readers will object to the heavy doses of sex (Manchester seems to revel in the lascivious details of the lives of those in power) and pretty rough treatment recieved by Catholic Church, but all in all, this is a very interesting book about the political forces at work in Europe at that time.Manchester spends most of the book describing life in Europe, where common people were unfamiliar with the world beyond the horizon, and the divine right of kings was immutable law. As the book progresses, he goes on to describe the desire for increased secular power and corrosion of morality in the Church, particularly under the Borgia and Medici popes, and the eventual backlash against the Church, both from the spiritual and scientific worlds.The last part of the book is devoted to Ferdinand Magellan, who is Manchester's man of the times; a relentless and resourceful explorer who managed to circumnavigate the world in spite of terrible difficulties and changing priorities. This section, while seemingly a deviation from most of the rest of the book, in fact provides a look into the progression of Europe from a bunch of backwards fiefdoms into a continent of empires.It's unfortunate that the parts of this book that most will remember are the tawdry sections, because there really is some very good history inside. It provides a good introspective into the forces that would come to shape the political landscape of Europe into a face the world would see until the turn of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This book is really a good way to make history fun. It is not way intended to be an academic tome. Think of a good historical film like \\"The Messenger\\", \\"Luther\\", or \\"Saving Private Ryan\\": these movies were all great to watch and yes you probably learned something by watching them, but they weren't the most accurate films either. This is how I see \\"The World Lit Only By Fire\\". The bottom line is this book is a fun introduction into the middle ages - renaissance, which up to the point that it was written, had rarely been written in such a brilliant and accessible manner.The accessibility to this book is its greatest feature. From page one on the reader is delighted with interesting writing great anecdotes and a modest portion of what keeps prime-time television going (sex and violence). It is also a quick read with just over 200 pages in small paperback format, it does not require a huge investment of time and energy by the reader.I highly recommend this book to interested people of all ages. I especially would like the younger readers to pick this one up. It isn't difficult and you will history can be fun and exciting to read. Though an introductory work, you will feel better informed about life in the middle ages and the enlightenment. Give it a shot!-- Ted Murena"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I always wondered what had happened during the \\"Dark Ages\\" or better known as the \\"Middle Ages\\" (to be politically correct) and William Manchester aids us in his book. His technique in writing, at least here, is very informal and is not written with strict adherence to a certain style Historians regulary do their books. It is fresh and comical, if I may so well put it. It is informal, but is informative.One aspect I liked about this book is the way the author does not hold back anything regarding the respected Theologians, Popes, or any other persons held in high esteem by the public. He brings out the good, bad, and even the ugly in all of them. I found it very helpful, being a Bible student and Church deacon to know the truth behind the Roman Catholic Church, the struggle for the reformation, and the multitude of blunders many renowned Theologians make, not even sparing Martin Luther.This book is a good read. It is a fresh way of knowing the way of life in the Middle Ages."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"For a student required to read a history book, there is no better choice than this. True he may not get all the dates correct but for someone who is not planning to major in history that is unimportant. What is important is that Manchester made something that would otherwise have been boring (for some of us) into an enjoyable read. I learned so much from this book and it felt almost like a historical fiction rather than a textbook. If you are not familiar with the period however, I suggest that you start out with a dictionary which you can later abandon."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"A wonderful, engaging, coherent look at a remarkably confusing period. Manchester makes it come alive, provides continuity to seemingly chaos and describes it all in terms vivid enough to last life time. His descriptions of the major players and the times they lived kept me entralled. A must."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Manchester is not attempting to write a piece of scholarly work with this book but rather a work of popular history that should grab any layman's attention who has a fascination for the Middle Ages. The book is filled with what makes Manchester stand out as an author; masterful storytelling that puts the reader right in the middle of the event, colorful characters that make history come alive, and all of the interesting anecdotes that one does not hear in history class. It is not quite as good as his classics &quot;The Glory and the Dream&quot;, or &quot;Death of a President&quot;, but it does not disappoint and is a great book to start out with if one wants to begin studying this fascinating period in world history. If you want to get high school students turned on to the Middle Ages, then this is the book to start with. As a history teacher and as an historian, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"William Manchester's account of Megellan's circumnavigation of the world and the effect his voyage had on commonly held views and \\"truths\\" of the world was delightfully insightful. I was entralled with the way Mr. Manchester tied the current events of Magellan's time into his writing. I have shared this book with friends and given it as a gift. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, whether they are looking for a very well writen book that is a joy to read, or are seeking knowledge."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Though not an historian, the author intends to shed light on the medieval era - basic living conditions and thinking - and on its transition to a perhaps more humanistic, less rigid society. Unfortunately, the book is scattershot in its approach - chronologically, geographically, and thematically. The author is highly selective in his choice of topics and subjects, spending an inordinate amount of time on some, while leaving gaping holes about the era. For example, there is no discussion of feudalism, guilds, pre-capitalistic developments, etc. In addition, it is bothersome that the author includes no notes, raising issues of believability.Though the book begins with the sacking of the Roman Empire in 300-400 AD, the main theme of the entire book is the dominance of the Christian church hierarchy, headquartered in the Vatican and lead by a succession of popes, over all of European society. Even the barbarians quickly fell in line. The Church was not so much about religion as it was about power - the ability to dictate thought processes in the masses and to demand unequivocal allegiance. The fact that average Europeans had no knowledge of Latin, the official language of the Church and the nobility, kept them suitably ignorant. The Church kept society in a static state, actually quite backward compared to the Romans, for nearly one thousand years by using its capacity to prevent new thinking and developments through intimidation.The author details at length the shocking dissoluteness of the entire Church officialdom - the debauchery and hedonism of even the popes is hardly to be believed. Equally disturbing is the incredible resort to butchery by all officials perpetrated on people for even the pettiest of crimes, let alone those who questioned the authority and wisdom of the Church. Indicative of the barbarity of the times, the author tells of Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman emperor, circa 800 AD, promptly beheading 4500 Saxons who demurred from baptism. Despite the heavy-handedness of the Church, cracks in its control of knowledge appeared. For one, there was an artistic and humanistic rejuvenation in the 1400s. Individuals such as Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci appeared, whose focus on the reasoning ability of individual men, though not directly challenging to the Church, did erode its claim to all knowledge. In the author's account, it was Martin Luther's disgust with the oppressiveness of the Church hierarchy and his push to lead an independent religious movement that was most significant in undermining the Church. Of course, the reaction of the Church to Martin Luther and the rise of Protestantism, at times equally unforgiving to deviants, resulted in yet more massive killings for the crimes of independence.One of the primary claims of the Church was that the Earth is the center of the universe, essentially flat with Hell below and Heaven above. But gathering evidence collected by worldly explorers and fledgling scientists demonstrated that the Earth had to be a sphere, although the dissemination of that knowledge triggered suppression by the Church. The author elevates Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese sailor who led a small fleet of five Spanish ships westward in 1519, in an attempt to reach the Spice Islands, as the exemplar of the changes underway in Europe at the beginning of the sixteenth century. One of his ships and eighteen men did make it back to Spain three years later having completed the first journey around the world; however, Magellan very incautiously provoked a battle with natives in the Philippines that resulted in his death. The author covers Magellan's journey extensively, primarily based on a diary kept by a crewman, though again no notes are included. While it was a daring journey with obvious scientific ramifications, it seems somewhat arbitrary to view Magellan as the epitome of men who challenged the dominance of the Church, directly or indirectly.Some reviewers have dismissed the book as being totally useless. That seems to be an immoderate view. The book is vague, hard to follow, and hardly comprehensive. Yet, it does capture the flavor of the times to some degree. And the author's depictions of the power and hypocrisy of the Church, Martin Luther, Henry VIII, Erasmus, and Magellan are worthy. In some ways, the book may lend some insights in some areas that a more comprehensive, yet conservative, historical approach would eschew. On the other hand, it's difficult to see a five star rating."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I first read this book about ten years and have reread it at least once. The writing is amazingly understandable considering the complexity of the subject. Manchester treats his subject fairly. Catholic, I found a balance between his writing about the Catholic Church and then about the Protestant Churches enlightening and reaffirming. This in effect was mind changing because I had not previously known about the Protestant backlash that mimicked the Inquisition. The presentation of the slow change in Medieval times is a significant contrast to present day change. This has become one of my favorite books to recommend for a good read."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I think that I have read A World Lit Only By Fire four times. It flows and gives the sense of a time of superstition giving way to a new realization by Magellan's epic journey. The Distant Mirror is also a wonderful book and they should be read together. I have often given this wonderful book as a gift. I plan to read it again."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This is the first history book I have ever found interesting. I don't have a lazy brain, being a technically active person, however, history content has always been so dull I gave up on it starting in fifth grade. That is until I encountered William Manchester's work. I am on my second reading of A World Lit Only By Fire because the topics and style are vastly interesting. Here you will read the truth about pilgrimages, popes and punishment; the brave, the brazen and the blunders that propelled earthlings forward despite the incredible follies of the times. Remove the veil - it's not much different than current times."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I have not often seen a book polarize readers so greatly. There are some major mistakes in the text to be sure, but it is still a fine book. Anyone who has read Manchester's other books may realize that he often puts a lot of his own feelings into his writing. (In the Last Lion, his adoration of Churchill shines through.) He has done that here and I think many are put off by that, even more than his mistakes. They should not be."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Manchester does it again with an outstanding book. The tidbits about Martin Luther's strange quirks [which you will find written about in few books] would have the preeminent protestant put away in the loony bin today. As with Manchester's other books- he takes you there with detail. While some Medieval academics look with contempt on this work- this academic finds few flaws in Manchester's works. If only more &quot;historians&quot; were quality writers !!!"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"i thought is was a very interesting attempt at tying together all the major factors and persons from the beginning of the dark ages to the renaissance.it was not too detail orientated to be boring. i would recomment to anyone who has not studied history extensively but would like an interesting and informative overview."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This is an excellent cultural summary of the long period called \\"The Dark Ages\\" in Europe, 400-1600 CE. Manchester provides many fascinating details as he spins the tale of events, people, nations, religious movements and cultural challenges.He is able to pack in the details while still moving the story along, making excellent connections between the various facets of the complex story. He enables the reader to paint a mental picture of the setting and the people in their cultural system of the Europe of the Middle Ages.Manchester writes in a novelesque, mildly humourous manner, with references to scholars of the periods he portrays. His focus throughout is to portray the worldview of the peoples of Europe.He probes for the beliefs and concepts of the world that underlay the amazing ideas and events that puzzle us today.He shows how the threads of power, profligacy, superstition, exploitation and ignorance flow together in a confusing stream through those centuries till the rediscovery of classical science and philosophy opened up the cultures of Europe to a broader world and approaches to reality.Those streams finally broke through to result in the modern view of freedom, coordinated concepts of knowledge, and exploration of the physical and conceptual world at large."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"As a history nerd, the prospect of taking an AP European History course my senior year of high school was delightful, until I discovered that reading this book was required summer work. Upon trying to stomach the blatant hatred (not just bias, but actual hatred) towards Christians and most notably Catholics (the entire book is spent trying to prove that they were not Christians because they sinned, so I suppose he has never read the Bible), I had to battle his scatterbrained presentation of so called \\"facts.\\" There is no rhyme or reason to the \\"organization\\" of this book, where \\"The Shattering\\" starts out with a synopsis of the life of Magellan and quickly jumps to the misfortune of being a Jew at the time, without explaining the connection or even the reason for mentioning Magellan.He also proposes his own theory about the Pied Piper of Hamelin, and I have found no evidence to support his claim, as I was intrigued by the brutality and detail in which he described the after math of the Pied Piper kidnapping the children.There also seems to be some sort of strange obsession with sex that indicates he needed to visit a psychologist before he died. Talking about sex does not make me uncomfortable, but the detail in which he describes certain nobles lascivious behavior seems unnecessary and detracts from what is left of the mediocre standing of the book."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I am not a historian, so I hesitate from passing judgement on the accuracy and completeness of fact, or the integrity of Manchester's interpretations. I am skeptical by nature, so as much of this book might be provacative to some, it has sparked my curiosity.I did find the book an easy, interesting, and at times amusing read, and a catalyst for my additional reading on the era."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"A World Lit Only by Fire is a fascinating study of the end of the Middle Ages in Europe and the beginning of the Renaissance. Originally intended as an introduction to a biography of Ferdinand Magellan, A World Lit Only by Fire is an engaging introduction to medieval and Renaissance cultures.Not a scholarly study based on first hand research, the work is intended for the general audience. However, Manchester is an accomplished historian and biographer of prominent 20th Century figures. This is arguably a strength in writing this book. Manchester brings both a professional historian's critical eye and a fresh outlook to examine a pivotal historical period.The book contains two chapters only: a 25-page overview of the Middle Ages and a 264-page portrait of the pivotal people and ideas responsible for destroying the medieval (primarily Roman Catholic) world view.Manchester begins by examining what made the Dark and Middle Ages so dark and so middling. His answer is: the death of classical civilization and the subsequent dominance of the Catholic Church. He captures this stifling dominance when he writes, \\"the entire medieval millennium took on the aspect of triumphant Christendom....the life of every European, from baptism through matrimony to burial, was governed by popes, cardinals, prelates, monsignors, archbishops, bishops, and village priests.\\"Manchester's general descriptions of the Medieval period's darkness are particularly interesting in the various sad, fascinating, and little known details he provides. For example, \\"in the year 1500, after a thousand years of neglect, the roads built by the Romans were still the best on the continent.\\" He describes a Yorkshire gravestone that attests to the reality of Robin Hood, and he provides some details behind the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, who was more a sadistic pedophile than a fairy tale enchanter.The author captures an essential aspect of Medieval world in describing the lack of individuality among most Europeans: \\"The most baffling, elusive, yet in many ways the most significant dimensions of the medieval mind were invisible and silent. One was the medieval man's total lack of ego. Even those with creative powers had no sense of self.\\" He notes that most Europeans of the time had no surnames, and that the builders of Medievaldom's most famous creations, the soaring gothic cathedrals, were anonymous.The ugliness and brutality of medieval life, Manchester argues, was made possible by an institutionalized mindless. The people and their leaders considered most worthwhile knowledge to be already known - and since much of that knowledge was based on religious authority, to challenge it was usually considered heresy. He quotes Saint Vincent of Lerins saying the Church was, \\"a faithful and ever watchful guardian of the dogmas which have been committed to her charge. In this secret deposit she changes nothing, takes nothing from it, she adds nothing to it.\\" Manchester quotes another cardinal who asserted, \\"The Church is not susceptible of being reformed in her doctrines. The Church is the work of an Incarnate God. Like all God's works, it is perfect. It is, therefore, incapable of reform.\\" Thus, to \\"appeal from the living voice of the Church,\\" was \\"a treason.' \\"The absolute authority of the medieval papacy resulted in its abuse of power, as exemplified by the Borgia popes. Their political and religious corruption was matched only by their sexual depravity. These pontiffs would hardly be recognized by today's masses of Catholics who adore the papacy.Both in spite of and because of the Church's disgraceful behavior during this period, the seeds of the Renaissance were planted by prominent Catholics. With the rediscovery of classic Greek and Roman literature, many Renaissance artists and intellectuals became prominent within the bosom of the Catholic establishment itself. Manchester covers several, including such illustrious figures as Di Vinci, Copernicus, Michelangelo, Thomas Moore, and Erasmus.Manchester also provides a vivid portrait Martin Luther, depicting him as both a conservative and a radical individual - driven by a devout religious idealism and tormented by demons from his abusive childhood. This young German theologian would come to change the face of Christianity by his obstinate refusal to accept the absolute power of the Vatican. The tremendous bloodshed resulting from the subsequent Protestant Reformation occurred not only between Catholic and Protestant, but within each group. Protestant sects became ever more zealous in trying to purify their lives and faiths, leading to absolutist Christian religious theocracies, such as that in Geneva led by John Calvin. On the other side, the Catholic counter-Reformation and the Inquisition became infamous for their wide-spread practices of torture and murder of anyone suspected of being a heretic or a Jew.In the end, Manchester returns to Ferdinand Magellan, presenting an inspiring portrait of the man whose story was the impetus for this book. We see Magellan as a microcosm and culmination of the age. A mariner of almost unbelievable fortitude and courage, Magellan's iron will forced his tiny armada of five ships onward and onward, covering vast stretches of the world's oceans, overcoming mutinies and horrific living conditions. Though Magellan did not survive the journey, due to an overzealous evangelistic streak, the historic first circumnavigation of the globe he made possible forever shattered the medieval world view by providing European society with visceral, convincing evidence - lacking in more theoretical demonstrations - that the Earth is a sphere. This feat was instrumental in destroying the mindless inertia that was the essence of the medieval mind. In fracturing the Church's philosophic dominance, Magellan achievement directed men's eyes outward toward the horizon and the promise of life on this Earth, instead of upward or downward toward the mysteries of the next life.A World Lit Only by Fire provides an engaging view of the death of the medieval world and the rebirth of Western civilization. Manchester thereby demonstrates the power of ideas to significantly change the course of history. Excellent reading."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"When a friend recommended this book to me, I looked at the cover and thought she must hate me. I put off reading it for months because I imagined it would be dry and dull. I could not have been more mistaken.Is this the book you need to read to pass a college history class? Absolutely not. But is it the book you need to read to learn about the atmosphere and characters of the Renaissance? Absolutely yes.Manchester's book reads like a novel. The Renaissance was an age full of the interesting and fascinating, from artists like da Vinci and Michelangelo to the murdering, philandering and utterly debauched Borgia clan to crooked Popes to the curious and single-minded Magellan.Far from being dry and scholarly, this book is ripe, verdant and informative in a witty, chatty way. I loved every page."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I am not an expert book reviewer, so I will present my views in list form: (1) Manchester demonstrates a perverse interest in the details of the torture and sexuality of this period; (2) I appreciated that he gave an overview instead of the life histories of Luther, Erasmus, and the other major figures; (3) he should have spent a few more months at least getting the major sections of the book to cohere--the transition from his extended tirade against the evils of the papacy to his praise for Magellan's voyage was more rough than the waters Magelland encountered in his legendary strait; (4) Manchester's analysis of the meaning of the term \\"hero\\" in the final third of the work was probably the most bizarre writing I have ever read from a historian or writer of Manchester's caliber. Perhaps by the end of his writing, Manchester had begun to lose his bearings much as Magellan apparently did after he arrived in the Philippines. Manchester argues, for example, that a soldier who falls on a grenade to save the lives of others is not a hero because the act was \\"impulsive.\\" He also argues that anyone with supporters cannot be a hero, and that physical courage has little to do with heroism. Manchester should have been more truthful and simple and admitted that Magellan was HIS hero and that others often called heros are not HIS hero. In fact, physical courage--such as that demonstrated by firefighters on 9/11--can make one a hero, as can \\"impulsive\\" but selfless behavior, such as falling on a grenade. Almost everyone who has accomplished great things has had some supporters, even if he or she has been thoroughly opposed--consider Jesus Christ and Martin Luther King Jr."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I now regret having decided to read this book at all! I decided to read it because I thought it would have been written as well as the author's two previous volumes about Sir Winston Churchill which I thought they were excellent by the way. However, I was very disappointed. As I read his book I didn't know if I was reading the work of a historian, who was well past his prime and should have retired on his laurels, or that of some renegade theologian with an axe to grind. The author writes in brutal detail about the harshness of life in medieval times just before the reformation with all its accompanying murders and of their lack of moral restrains of any kind though they would doubtless at least confess to possessing some. He not only goes into lurid detail about some of the more adulterous affairs of the laity but even more so that of the priesthood and of how nunneries were more brothels than anything else. He seemed more than willing in letting his readers know about the sexual proclivities of the popes as well! More examples can be given but I believe this and what follows will suffice.He wrote about how the Gospels contradicted each other and of \\"flagrant contradictions in the Bible\\" but fails to provide his reader with any details. These and other such anti-Christian attacks infest his book and assault the senses of someone that was searching for a good read of the period but came away extremely disappointed. This is the work more worthy of a supermarket tabloid and less that of an eminent historian. In my view Mr. Manchester's light has dimmed considerably with the publication of this book."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I'll add my voice to others who find favor with the writings of William Manchester. The is a great book. It was a delight to read and very informative, covering a time period that I was largely unfamiliar with."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"William Manchester is my longtime favorite writer of history and biography. You can see more detail on him elsewhere and his magnum opus on Churchill needed to be finished posthumously and has just come out. This book on the transition from Middle Ages to Renaissance is by far the smallest book of his I have seem but retains the wonderful writing style."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"As an AP World History teacher I had to take a look at this to consider for required reading, and I have to say that I was pretty shocked after reading it that this is used as much as it is in the classroom. Manchester's writing is lively, but his use of sources shows no critical examination. He takes the nobility's appraisal of peasant life at face value, Catholics' characterization of Martin Luther without much balance, and in general overstates the figurative 'darkness' of the Medieval Age.The book is not without legitimate insights, but personally I found it way too much of a mixed bag to endorse, especially for high school readers."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Manchester's account of the medieval mind is eminently readable and entertaining, but as he himself notes in his introduction, &quot;this is a slight work, with no pretensions to scholarship&quot;. He is at his best when he expounds on the medieval mindset at the eve of the Reformation, the most solid aspect of the book. But his scholarship is weak in spots, and he has a curious flaw: there is a prurient quality to his commentary on the sexual aspects of history, a jarring note in this most WASP-y of writers. Still, he delivers on the title: reflections on the medieval mind. It's not his best effort by a long shot, but as History Lite, it's highly enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This book was a wonderful break from the normal textbook history I am used to, but the question has been raised in my mind as to whether or not Manchester is treating the times he covers are nothing more than a glorified soap opera. It is incredibly entertaining, especially for a 15-year old mind (heh), as it deals (an incredible amount) with sex. Aside from that, he provides a goodly amount of commentary about the popes, seeming to take the view that the Church is bad, anything bad is the Church's fault, etc. Far be it from me to dispute this... he knows more than I do. If you want to be entertained, pick this up. As to its historical content, go ask someone who knows. Now lemme get back to the book... the sex is just gettin' good! (Lol, I'm just kiddin, people!)"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Manchester's interpretation of the period is certainly original. Indeed, I think that Medieval and Renaissance scholars would dispute much of what he says. The work is shallow, superficial, and at times borders on distortion of fact (for example, the statement that Lucrezia Borgia was having incestuous relations with both her father and her brother, a view which is not widely held). For those who are interested in the Middle Ages or the Renaissance, there are many good books on the market. This isn't one of them. Try &quot;Daily Living in the Twelfth Century&quot; by Urban Tigner Holmes, or &quot;The Black Death&quot; by Philip Ziegler."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I was required to read this book for my AP European History course, and I was slightly disappointed.The book is a basic composite of the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, and as my teacher points out - one of the only books to do so. The format of the book is not good though. It is split into 3 sections, the first being an intro to the transition the people went though, the 2nd focusing on the Church, and the 3rd (the strangest) is a complete biography of Magellan. The first two sections discuss the importance of the Church and the influence of Martin Luther, while the third almost has no relation to the first two sections. The third section tells all about Magellan and his accomplishments, such as circumnavigating the world (he didn't actually circumnavigate the world, he died in the South Pacific) and bringing Catholicism to Fiji.I found the Magellan section to be very, very entertaining. The problem with the book itself is that it does not flow well; it is almost as though Manchester chose to write about the Renaissance, then at the end tack on his personal narrative of the greatness of Magellan.If you have to read this book for an AP European History class, which I think is the standard for incoming students, then I would buy this book and really just focus on Magellan, because that is the one thing that will hold your attention. Although unrelated, the Magellan section provides a great look at one of the most important explorers ever."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"The book is a good yarn, I argue, because it brings human scandal (esp. sex, cruelty, pride) into historical narratives, which can sometimes be dry. However, there no serious treatment of the history, no annotation, which is a terrible disappointment. Usually, when you read a history book, you can say \\"Oh, that's interesting, I'd like to learn more\\" and find further reading in the endnotes or bibliographical essay. None is provided here; so when Manchester says, \\"As one historian writes...\\" there is no way to see who that person was or continue with the thread."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"In William Manchester's A World Lit Only by Fire: The Medieval Mind and the Renaissance - Portrait of an Age, Christianity underwent many events crucial to European history: an achievement of reuniting a struggling Europe in its Dark Ages, its decreasing power in the Renaissance, and the finding of new lands for Christian monarchs and the greater glory of God. The book begins with describing a weak Europe, which suffered greatly because of depopulation as a result of the Black Death. However, Christianity helped to rebuild Europe and a \\"renaissance\\", or rebirth, began. Renaissance popes became corrupt and reformations of Christianity were led. Nevertheless, that did not stop Magellan in circumnavigating the whole world to become a hero.Manchester explains that in this upheaval in Europe, Christianity triumphed in bringing an age of \\"light\\" rather than \\"darkness\\" after its Dark Ages. Europe suffered a plague that swept all over the continent: \\"the Black death and its recurring pandemics repeatedly thinned the population\\" (5). Also, Germanic tribes became bloodthirsty and invaded regions all over Europe. However, despite their bloodthirstiness...all were devout Christians (6). The spread of Christianity enabled the rulers to enforce the faith upon pagans, but that was not the only reason why many people believed. The people in that era stayed faithful because \\"there was no room in the medieval mind for doubt\\" (20). To be faithless was to be doomed, and so the Catholic Church taught that there is no salvation outside of it, and it found its strength in total resistance to change.Though Christianity helped a struggling Europe, it seemed to change once Europe went through its \\"rebirth.\\" Many factors contributed to a \\"shattering\\" of Christianity in Europe. In an era in which papacy ruled and monarchs forced faith upon their people, faith was really all they knew. However, this all changed once the papacy, as Manchester implies, became corrupted. With all this corruption, Christianity began to lose its authority over the Europe it once helped revived. \\"[Both] piety and hostility toward the papacy coexisted among central Europeans since the fifth century\\" (160). This hostility began to increase as the European people continued to hear about \\"wild stories of Vatican orgies, the poisoning of pontiffs\\" (160) and overall \\"corruptness\\" of the Church; many wanted to reform. Both Martin Luther and King Henry VIII of England led a reformation. However, they both had separate reasons to do so. Luther was a theological rebel (206), but Henry was still Catholic in all aspects except one - he desired to divorce, which is against the Catholic Church's teachings. The Renaissance was not only an intellectual revolution, but a religious one as well.Christendom was coming to a schism, yet Ferdinand Magellan had no awareness of it. During the time of Luther's reform, he would already be out at sea: \\"Thus he will die ignorant of Christendom's coming schism, a tragedy for devout Catholics like him; he would have readily sacrificed his life defending the Church\\" (228). Little did he know that he, one man alone, would sail around the world. He sailed the Pacific Ocean, with much distress of not knowing what was ahead of him. He ended up in the Philippines, which gave him hope after months of anxiety. The Filipinos welcomed him, and Magellan \\"decided to make amends [between the Moluccas and Portugal] by staking another claim in the name of the Spanish king...to be the property of his Christian Majesty, the sovereign of Castile and Aragon\\" (267-268). He had converted the Filipinos to Christianity and decided to stay on the islands to assure the loyalty of the Philippines to Spain and their new religion. This led to conflict between the indigenous people of the Philippines and his crew that resulted to his death. Juan Sebasti&aacute;n del Cano led the voage back home and received all the honor and glory. \\"But he, like Christ, was also a hero. He still is. He always will be\\" (289).Manchester addresses many ideas in European history, but as an author, he gives off a little bias here and there, especially when it comes to terms of the Catholic Church. When writing about history, it is important to show only facts. Manchester, along with anyone, is entitled to his own opinion, but it seemed that he mainly focuses on the bad aspects of Christianity and not how it improved the Europeans through its age of rebirth and discovery. Also, Manchester backtracks and jumps around multiple times when dealing with history. He does not go chronologically, which may get confusing at times. He also focuses too much on corruptness and promiscuity. If only he held off a little more of his bias and wrote clearly, I would have enjoyed it more. Overall, it was an insightful read that grabs a modern Westerner's attention to understanding \\"a world lit only by fire.\\""},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I was so engrossed in reading that I forgot about Magellan altogether, until suddenly, there he was. It felt like a rude jolt. Once I started reading the part about Magellan, it felt even more like a rude jolt. I've read so many dry history books that reading a flowing narrative was a treat. I found it relaxing, eye opening. I saw the players as people, where as before I'd viewed them as popes, kings, peasants and lumped them into some kind of category. I almost wish he'd gone on longer, spent more time developing the narrative, and left Magellan off completely. Put Magellan in another book, the contrast was too rough."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"The good part about this book is also its worst aspect; it's entertaining. That means that people will remember it, and will more readily retain its content.This is a disaster because the content is almost completely false, as well as horrifically biased. Manchester uses nearly every outdated misunderstanding and simplistic notion about the Middle Ages that could be possibly crammed into a single book.I will be honest and admit that I did not read the last quarter of the book. I did not actually want to continue past the first quarter, appalled as I was by completely inaccurate 'facts' such as commoners not having last names (even the most casual research of period village documents clearly shows that commoners started using proper last names only very shortly after nobles did), and unfounded, insanely biased statements about eras being 'good' and 'bad' that would not have passed muster in my first undergrad essays.Why did I keep reading it? I wanted to find out why people thought this book was so wonderful. There HAD to be something of value in it.I gave up finally, since I'm no masochist and the realization that this book was going to be used as a source of information for countless Americans began to make me physically ill.Medieval scholars have enough difficulty in overcoming the prejudices and fallacies that are prevalent about this time period without the unwanted 'assistance' of this irresponsible author.One can only wonder how a person could write a book about history that would be read by millions (and used in schools!) while admitting they know nothing about their subject, that they did not do their research, and that experts disagreed with nearly everything in the book, and then sleep soundly at night.I can only conclude that it must have something to do with hubris and making money."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I don't doubt his skill as an author, but as a historian, Manchester fails miserably.Imagine, if you will, an author writing in 4003 about our own time- if that author takes his cues from Manchester, he would get his facts only from The Jerry Springer show, talk radio, and some online bulletin boards. You can imagine the bleak, inaccurate picture such a writer would paint!See the problem? Manchester breaks the first rule of writing history-- he starts with the thesis first, working backwards to find materials that prove his point. Using this method, anyone can prove anything.The real tragedy is that he writes for a popular audience- people who have no background in medieval history, and so can't see the giant gaps in his information.If anyone wants to know more, here's just two names you should look into: Hildegard von Bingen (a &quot;Renaissance&quot; woman, before the renaissance existed-- a mystic, scientist, composer and nun) and Thomas Aquinas (who should need no introduction!)Manchester also, essentially, ignores the Byzantine Empire (which, though geographically \\"east,\\" played a huge part in shaping the rest of Europe). This is a real shame, not only because it rips his thesis to shreds, but also because the average, educated reader is so unknowledgeable about the subject.Medieval history is a fascinating, important field. It's a shame and an embarrassment that a talented author like Manchester would do such a terrible job covering the subject."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I have to say that as I read some of the reviews that I am amazed at some of the arrogance of the reviewers. The fact is that no matter if you are an expert in the period or just someone looking for a good read, an entertaining read, this book does the job well! Prof. Manchester is brilliant in his literal portrait of this period, and as a working historian, I found it enthralling, even if it isn't a so called scholarly work! Popular history is a term used, in my opinion, to describe a book that has color, as opposed to dry fact. Prof. manchester makes some very provocative statements, and presumptions, and I for one found that there WAS merit in his work. Who says you have to be an expert in a given area in order to write an excellent and entertaining work? I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"In reading the previous reviews, it is necessary to point out that good, gripping reading just isn't a good enough criterion for a book about history. Accuracy is first, readability comes after that. Manchester's book isn't accurate. That's a very bad thing for a history book. Be smart: Read what's true rather than sensational. Skip this one and go for the heavy weights, or better yet, go to Amiens or Notre Dame in Paris and still believe that the Middle Ages were dark. You might follow that up with a trip to Auschwitz to see how 'light' an era we now live in."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"William Manchester collects all the anecdotes to support his view of the Middle Ages: it was a terrible time (he defends the now abandoned term \\"Dark Ages\\") when nothing of value had happened. According to him, no innovation took place and everyone was backward and brutal. He supports this bleak and inaccurate view through carefully selected tidbits of facts and throws them at the reader without giving a complete picture. This leads to an incomplete understanding of this era and I pity the reader who gets their complete view of the Middle Ages from this book only. This book is VERY misleading and downright dishonest, but aims at sensationalizing and confirmation of the worst stereotypes that exist among the uneducated about the Middle Ages. It's classic yellow journalism masquerading as history.Overall it's a book to endure for a fanatic of the Middle Ages who wants to fish out some new info or for a person who would like to confirm their preconceptions about \\"the set back in human history called The Dark Ages\\"."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Unfortunately, William Manchester did not do his homework before writing this work. To his credit, he does at least admit to not doing the research. This book might provide an interesting story, but readers need to be aware that it cannot masquerade as a serious history text."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"In his introduction Manchester admits that he is not an expert in the history of the period and goes on to prove it in the rest of the book. He is getting older and it shows with his fascination with the more seedy aspects of 15th century sexuality (some of his sources are less than reliable). He also does not give a balanced picture of the belief system of the common people. His understanding of the Catholoic church of the period is shallow: as in other areas, he only views things from the perspective of an late 20th century American, with all the assumptions and baggage that that entails, rather than understanding his subject from the inside out and in its own time and place. He does try to enliven his subject with well-crafted prose, and seems to have a genuine regard for some of his subjects. If you want a book on this period, you would do better to go elsewhere."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"First let me say that I am saddened beyond measure that it seems as if William Manchester won't be finishing his biography of Winston Churchill. Anyway, while A World Lit Only By Fire may not be premium Manchester, it is pretty damn good particularly in his biographical sketches. And why not? His m&eacute;tier after all is biography. And yes the general picture that he draws of Medieval Europe is the one set in the minds of mainstream historians of the old school, which I think describes Mr. Manchester pretty well. So what? The revisionist historian of today is the old school mainstream historian of tomorrow. From someone like Mr. Manchester I expect a whopping good story, well told and he does that.I can pick nits with it too, and that is part of the fun. For instance, a big hobby horse of mine is the way academic disciplines are so isolated from each other that scholars studying in one may be totally unaware that another discipline might actually illuminate and/or clear up long standing misconceptions. If Mr. Manchester had picked a copy of Italian Folktales Selected and Retold by Italo Calvino, he might not have characterized the medieval peasantry the way he did, ie: \\"Their anonymity approached the absolute. So did their mute acceptance of it.\\" As a compendium of tales pulled directly through the ages from the oral literature of the medieval peasant, Italian Folktales demonstrates that said peasant was anything but mute.Well, never mind, but it would have been such fun to go at it with Mr. Manchester hammer and tongs in a classroom setting. And that is how I think of this book as a long tour de force classroom lecture by a master storyteller. Enjoy."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I bought this book because I liked the title. I still like the title. The content is rubbish. Perhaps the trouble is the genre. \\"Popular history\\" is a story so popularised, so dumbed down, as not to be history. But even given that fact, this book is bad. The author is an American journalist, not a historian. If one were to list all the inaccuracies you would have a list longer than this book. Almost every sentence requires qualification, many sentences and nearly all key judgements need at least a paragraph of qualification because they are so wide of the mark. Manchester's book reads much like a 300 page attack on the Catholic Church. The heroes are the Protestants. This can be done well, but the lack of intelligence at work here is mind-boggling. I think it is very sad that this book is - according to the cover - a \\"national bestseller\\"; it is sad to think of people reading and believing this stuff, especially young people, who, with its salacious gossip-driven narrative, are more likely to read this than something factual, and because it is published, more likely to believe it. The publishers, Little, Brown & Co, must take much of the blame. It is one thing to want to sell books to make financial gain, but when this leads to what we have here, the propogation of drivel posing history, then it is against culture."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This book is what happens when a scholar of modern history refuses to do any research on an earlier age, but decides to write a book about that earlier age anyway. Manchester seems to have a great fondness for modern cliches about the medieval period, and hasn't actually bothered to read any scholarship written in the past forty years--and yes, if you want to actually learn real information about the medieval period, you need to read scholarship written after World War II, even if you're just writing for a popular audience. Tell me, non-historians, do you want someone to justify lying to you merely by assuming that because you aren't a specialist, you won't know the difference? I don't think any of us want to be treated in such a condescending manner, whether it happens in a used car lot or a history book.If you actually want some decent popular medieval history, go read Terry Jones' and Alan Ereira's bookTerry Jones' Medieval Lives; though they've definitely got some biases, they actually did some research and have a lovely bibliography to prove it."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I'm a big fan of medieval history, of many cultures, and this book was a disappointment. Manchester has a huge bias about medieval history that is not borne out by the facts. He clearly does not ascribe to most of the current thinking among scholars of the era. This book is misleading and does not belong on anyone's reading list. While Roman roads may have been better than anything built later, much of our modern infrastructure actually began in the Middle Ages, from new methods of ploughing to new trade routes. Massive changes took place in the world, including Europe, during the period between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance, including industrial revolutions that changed the way woven fabric was made and traded, new social relationships, and new ways of thinking. How people told time and thought about time changed drastically, just as one example. The Renaissance and the Enlightenment did not spring forth out of nothing. The groundwork for those changes was laid in the Middle Ages, which is sort of Manchester's point, but he overstates the backwardness of the Middle Ages by so much, it comes close to satire. I really wanted to like this book, but it's so far off the mark I feel it does not belong in any library. If it shows up on any university reading list, it should only be as a bad example."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I had to buy this book for a summer assignment my sophomore year of high school, and I spent a lot of time reading it and taking notes on it because we were supposed to be tested on it at the beginning of the school year.

In the end, you will have a better view of the reformation than most college courses in the subject provide AND you may even wonder how the same popes that appreciated Michelangelo could get their politics and economics so badly wrong.Read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" for a slightly darker view and \\"Van Loon's Lives\\" for an even better take on Erasmus.

I'm sorry to say that most of the books I have read on the subject did not mention many of the people found in this book--or at least not in as much depth.

Anyone enjoying this book would also find The First Salute and A Distant Mirror to be very satisfying."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"While I find Mr. Manchester's style forceful and gripping, I don't at all agree with his description of the Middle Ages as one thousand years of slaughter, famine and pervert popes rollicking around, with very little else taking place. With the sole exception (thank God!) of the fornicating popes, the same things take place in our own times (the Holocaust, the Middle East wars, Somalia, endemic poverty in South America, and so on and on) and no one cries out that we're living in a &quot;dark age&quot; - even though we are.(In fact, I would be very wary of any book that tried to convince me that nothing worthwhile happened in a thousand years.) Mr. Manchester forgets the mystics, the poets, the painters, the pilgrims, and what not. His book, which is evidently aimed at the non-historians (a category I belong in), is exaggeratedly simplistic and reads like a sensationalist magazine. I don't like to read clich&eacute;s - I consider myself, as a reader of average intelligence, to deserve better.Besides, some of the information Mr. Manchester gives seems at least dubious. For example: &quot;(page 22) Among the implications of this lack of selfhood was an almost total indifference to privacy. In summertime peasants went about naked&quot;. Really? Where? This is a typical example of a subject which is approached in a seemingly serious way, only to draw a conclusion which is too general in scope, and too insufficiently explained, to be believable. Another example of big words and small seriousness: &quot;(page 67) On Sundays, under watchful parental eyes, girls would dress modestly and be demure in church, but on weekdays they opened their blouses, hiked their skirts, and romped through the fields in search of phalli&quot;. Give me a break!!! All in all, this book, in spite of its powerful style (which was mildly entertaining until it became too inaccurate to read)was a disappointment. For a deeper probing into medieval life and thought, I recommend Johan Huizinga's &quot;The Autumn of the Middle Ages&quot;. It's a much older work, but much better too."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I think many of the negative reviews you see here are from Catholics who are trying to stop you from reading this book.

I am also very much into living history, and my husband and I have extensively researched the late medieval period for our persona, specifically Ireland and Britain in the year 1500. I have to agree with previous reviewers that this author is not only factually wrong, his personal opinions have colored this book and created an even darker shade of muck. But the one thing that outraged me the most (and prompted the flinging) was his utter lack of respect for other religions, instead choosing to force his own narrow Christian template on the complex subject of pagan conversions. He has obviously done no research on these native pagan belief systems, the deities they worshipped, or the conversion techniques of the church. Overall, the author's lack of research is instead replaced with opinion, conjecture, and language flashy enough to garner a spot on the bestseller list. A shame that such a worthless use of paper should somehow be lauded in this way and as such seen as an authoritative work on the medieval time period. As someone else stated, I wish I could give this book a negative rating. I hope my words have done this instead. Instead, I highly recommend the series of books by Joseph and Frances Gies on medieval life (&quot;Life in a Medieval Castle,&quot; &quot;Life in a Medieval Village,&quot; etc.) if you truly want a well-researched and interesting picture of what life was like in that era."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Excellent book reviewing elements of this period of time.

However, the more I read, the more I'm discovering that this book appears to be mostly just a rehash of legends and popular misconceptions, and is factually way off...Why go to the trouble to write this book, but then perpetuate untruths?My point is: Even if this is not a scholarly work, he really shouldn't have been so sloppy with facts...it was so unnecessary...his writing style is such that even the truth would have been interesting!"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"William Manchester is one of my favourite historians. His two volumes on Churchill and the biography of MacArthur are excellent. This volume is well below his high standards, and he seems to flounder in trying to produce a narrative to cover a huge spread of history. Unlike the tremendous Glory and the Dream, he cannot weave his narrative magic over such as long period.Manchester always writes well and this is no exception. The critical problem is that he really offers no fresh insight. His descriptions of Magellan's voyage are riveting and he seems to delight in telling every gruesome detail of the middle ages. For all the narrative excellence, he does not get into the mind of an era.Also in some cases, his selection of sources is dubious, particularly his section on the Borgia's is based on some very shaky sources and his conclusions would be hotly contested by many.This book can only be a good and colourful general introduction to the period, but little more."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"The only really good thing about this book is the great title. I'm sure that's the only reason it's been around so long.The medieval mind is only a little bit of the book, and is hopelessly generalized, exaggerated, without any attempt to analyze in depth of how it was; it gives neither accurate information nor much of a feel for the era. He repeats some information that is known to be false (possibly due to research done since he wrote the book). Then the bulk of the book is about the Renaissance and Reformation, which was readable enough (keeping the details of Martin Luther readable is not an easy task), although again hopeless generalizations, inconsistencies, and some real whoppers. Finally, there's a smallish section on Magellan that's as unbalanced in admiration for him as the rest of the book is unbalanced in condemnation of the middle ages, catholic church, popes, kings, protestants, etc., within a highly detailed account of his famous trip; not interesting, and I didn't bother to finish the book."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"The late William Manchester remains a famous and widely read historian of such monumental bestsellers as \\"The Death of a President\\"; the three volume life of Winston Churchill and \\"The Arms of Krupp\\" among others. One of his lesser (and shorter) book is \\"AS World Lit Only By Fire.\\" The book was first published in 1992; it is 300 pages in length.The tome surveys the important events, trends, lifestyle and famous personalities of the age. Life was short, hard and brutal in Europe. The Reformation led by such leades as Martin Luther, John Calvin, Zwingli and others led to the end of the Roman Catholic's Church hegemony over Christianity in the West. Scientists probed the universe being led by men like Copernicus, Galileo and Johann Kepler. Manchester spends many pages discussing the voyage of Magellen the first mariner to circumnavigate the globe. Art and architecture flourished in the works of artists such as Da Vinci, Titian, Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael and many others. Great monarchs ruled such as Henry VIII in England, Francis I in Frances and Charles V in the Holy Roman Empire.The book has many quotable quotes. A sampling:\\"The Dark Ages were stark in every dimension. Famines and plagues, culminating in the Black Death and its recurring pandemics,repeatedly thinned the population.\\"-p. 5\\"Death was the prescribed penalty for hundreds of offenses.particularly thouse against property.\\"-p. 7\\"In some ways the period seems to have been the worst of times-an age of treachery, abduction,fratricide, depravity, barbarism and sadism.\\"-p. 34\\"Although they called themselves Christians, medieval Europeans were ignorant of the Gospels.

The book would best be enjoyed by a person new to the study of the Middle Ages, Renaissance and Reformation periods.

The printing press and growing nationalism were important in the progress made in this long historical period."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This is a review of the Hardback binding of this book. Don't waste your money - you may as well get the Paperback! This is not a properly printed and bound hardback version of William Manchester's book. It looks like a \\"Print-on-Demand\\" book i.e. a scanned version of the original that is quickly run off when ordered. Because of the scanning, the illustrations are awful - dark, high-contrast images, lacking detail. The actual binding of the pages is like a paperback ie. individual sheets stuck into a thick wad of glue. They will fall out!

He covers a vast amount of real estate in a readable, interesting style. The Catholic Church receives the worst reports of an age characterized by worst reports.

It was an age best reflected in the quote: \\"Life was brutal, hard and mercifully short.\\""},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I was expecting a history book. I love history books. This was more of a history story, a fireside tale of history. That's ok -- I can take that. It reminds me of Undaunted Courage by Stephen Ambrose -- about the Lewis and Clark expedition.While *not* a comprehensive history of the Middle Ages, this was a great read. Manchester sketched the time period so clearly. And through this portrait, he brings some of the major thinkers and ideas that quickened into the Renaissance.The book gives you context for all else you may read about the fall of Rome, the crusaders, the Moors, the scientists, and the explorers. I thought the most memorable character highlighted was Magellan.And throughout, I considered the book very aptly titled: a world lit only by fire. What can human imagination, human passion, human determination not accomplish?"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Manchester doesn't even bother to distinguish between the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; and the &quot;Middle Ages&quot;, and it's downhill from there.

Some new and interesting stuff about sex in the Middle Ages, however."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I was taken aback when, within the first chapter, the author noted how Alaric (the Goth) had difficulty keeping his Huns (no kidding) from sacking Rome. I wanted to give Manchester the benefit of a doubt, but within the first chapter he totally neglected factual content in favor of anti-western, anti-Christian diatribe. While still in the opening portion of the book, Manchester went on to provide so crude a summary of Augustine's philosophies that I can't believe he actually read any of Augustine's works; instead, I think he just skimmed a few books for juicy quotes that could be taken out of context. Manchester's quick to tell us that Charlemagne was illiterate but fails to mention that Charlemagne's patronage kept much of the work of classical Europe alive through the \\"Dark Ages\\".The book isn't even intersting reading. Manchester is so intent on derisively simplifying the turbulent ages following the fall of Rome, that every historical character he writes about comes across as 2-dimensional -- blood thirsty and ignorant.

What I found instead was a historian's version of the National Enquirer - lurid, overly sensational, and thin. I'm just as fond of a good Pope orgy story as the next person, but I object to shoddy research in pursuit of one. My knowledge of the timeperiod covered is slightly better than that of the average person, but I'm no expert, which means that when I start finding factual errors in a history text, something went very wrong."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I should probably preface this review by noting that I am a passionate student of Roman/Byzantine/Medieval European history, which is how I know this book is hogwash. However, there are many historical eras with which I am far less familiar, and if I were to pick up a book as stunningly inaccurate, prejudiced and misleading as Manchester's \\"World\\" on the subject of, say, medieval Japan, I would come away grossly misinformed about a very broad period of human history. Yet the danger here doesn't come from the book's content alone; after all, the publishing industry churns out volumes of reprehensible pseudo-history every year. It's the fact that the name of a highly regarded historian is attached to it, and that somehow, this dusty reliquary of lies has managed to maintain it's reputation despite much of it's so-called scholarship being centuries out of date when the book was first published. To summarize, Manchester begins with a long denunciation of the Middle Ages, propounding savage cliches and a few head-scratchers that I'm pretty sure come from the author's imagination. He continues, moving on to the Renaissance, by compiling the most ludicrous and sordid gossip swirling around the Borgias, and presenting these as fact. Martin Luther is portrayed battling the devil with his feces in passages supposedly derived from his writings which, while I cannot testify to their veracity, I would not suggest sharing with any Lutherans you might know. The one bright spot, in the section that closes the book, is Manchester's sweeping delineation of Magellan's famous voyage around the globe. This passage, told with great narrative skill and dramatic flair, is evocative, tight and almost cinematic in style. Manchester is clearly in his element here, presenting a strong personality, a flawed hero whose all-consuming passion to achieve a destiny even he doesn't fully understand becomes a metaphor for man and his own greater mission. One wonders why the author didn't write a book about Magellan instead, and how such a clearly gifted historian (whose other, contemporary, works of history are far more rewarding and accurate) could even believe, let alone commit to paper, some of the tall tales masquerading as facts in this book. The great irony is that, with \\"A World Lit Only By Fire,\\" Manchester has helped perpetuate the ignorance he affects to despise in the Middle Ages."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"The book was truly rewarding in its detail of a period of the world's history which is still virtually unknown."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I first read this when I was in my late teens. I loved it: it was my first introduction to the kooky tapestry that was the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. In fact, I read it several times. For a long time it remained my favorite popular history book. (It's a delightfully readable account of why and what happened when the late Middle Ages started blossoming into the Renaissance. You'll find it filled with wondrous events and larger-than-life characters.)At this point, though, a couple of decades elapsed and I have picked it up again. In fact, I've read it twice through this week.When I read it in my younger years, there wasn't something called Wikipedia. In fact, there wasn't even the Internet. So when you read about something, you had the devil's own time checking up on it. You would have had to have been MIGHTY curious. So you let most references slide. Rational ignorance and all.Now, however, if something intrigues you (or even if you'd like to see a picture of a certain building or work of art), it's about 3 seconds away on Google Image. For me, at least, this has totally transformed the process of reading. Now you can check up on everything, get additional information on everything, follow up on everything, etc. It's certainly made reading much more fulfilling than it was when I was younger -- and it was fulfilling then! Instant footnotes for every book!Problem is, some books have suffered because of this.Case in point is Manchester's \\"A World Lit Only By Fire.\\" Twenty years ago, I simply had to take what he said about Lucrezia Borgia, Julius II, the Pied Piper of Hamelin, etc., at face value, as ferreting out, in my university library, the truth of all of his crazy stories would have meant months merely to get through this thin volume.But now that I can double-check every wacky story and factoid, I have to say: Manchester passes along -- uncritically -- a lot of canards, urban legends, and speculation. And what's interesting is that if you check Wikipedia's sources, many of them are dated before the publication of this book (1992), meaning that Manchester SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.There are many examples of him doing this, but the one that got me curious was the Pied Piper story. Manchester says that didja know? he was a vile pederast! Wikipedia -- much better sourced than Manchester (!) -- claims there was never any solid justification for believing that, and the guy may never have existed at all. This happened again and again to the point where I came to think that Manchester was relating the story of the Renaissance not how it really happened, but how he would like to believe it happened.Anyhow. Still a cracking good read, though. But one I now regard with a more skeptical eye."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Manchester's account of the medieval mind is eminently readable and entertaining, but as he himself notes in his introduction, &quot;this is a slight work, with no pretensions to scholarship&quot;. He is at his best when he expounds on the medieval mindset at the eve of the Reformation, the most solid aspect of the book. But his scholarship is weak in spots, and he has a curious flaw: there is a prurient quality to his commentary on the sexual aspects of history, a jarring note in this most WASP-y of writers.Still, he delivers on the title: reflections on the medieval mind. It's not his best effort by a long shot, but as History Lite, it's highly enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Manchester's work is an enjoyable retelling of the period between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Although, it is not a &quot;scholarly&quot; work, it brings this important period into perspective in a way that everyone can understand. Of course there are weak points, but Manchester's work may entice, non-scholars to learn more. To the harsh critics of this work, I say; History is not the sole property of historians, nor should it be. Hat's off to Manchester for an entertaining an informative work that I've already passed on to several friends."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This book is completely irresponsible. It is full of falsehoods, some of which are slanderous. And it is extremely biased.For example, early in the book, Manchester accuses St. Augustine of holding that sex was evil. On the next page he goes even further and says that Augustinians considered even procreation to be evil! This couldn't be further from the truth. Augustine was so clear in recognizing the goodness and legitimacy of sexuality that he wrote an entire treatise entitled \\"The Good of Marriage.\\" In this treatise he defends the legitimacy and goodness of marriage AND the sexuality and procreation associated with it.The bias of the book is apparent in every way, although by the title of the book this should not be surprising. In his own introduction to the book, Manchester notes that he is not a medieval historian, and prior to writing the book, had only a typical educated man's familiarity with the time period. And he notes that the real medieval historians that he had look over his work took an enormous number of exceptions to what he wrote.

Many people are fascinated by History and its causes, yet those same eager minds are clueless to the motivations and events that shaped our World during the 1000 years, after the fall of Rome to the why the Renaissance even happened. This book answers questions I never really knew...Protestantism, Inquisition, Bad Popes, Humanism, Visogoth, Henry VIII, Erasmus, Huns...its all here. The desire for knowlege on the subject is there, the problem is the dirth of vibrant materials and that exist seem to be an esoteric and mundane examination of specific events or Characters...the type of writing that is better left to the researcher or the student who is forced to read.Manchester is an awesome storyteller who combines a tremendous knowledge of his subject with a wit and insight that makes for a fantastic read. It is very hard if not impossible to put this book down. To know that the facts are right on, the characters were very real, and the events are the foundation of who and what we are as nations, families, congregations and people is just the biggest buzz you can get from reading. It opens your mind up and creates a desire to know more and a sense of satisfaction that you now have a grasp of knowlege that before you read this was just a cloudy picture. I have urged everyone I know to read this book, it is like having a brillant friend telling you a tale by the campfire. Just a WOW read.The negative reviews in here have been emotionally motivated. The facts in this book are well researched. The critics I have read here are mostly abolisionistic, book burners, and religious zealots who do not like anything that does not support there causes without question. Luther was not &quot;God Like&quot;, John Calvin was an egomanical Theofacist, The Popes were not &quot;All Saintly&quot; and Christian motivation for slaughter and torture of there fellow man in the name of Jesus was not a fiction made up by the devil to discredit God.

Everything. More exactly, I think the author occassionally went three pages before he blamed something new on the Catholics. But, at least he was balanced. Mr. Manchester pointed out that anything positive was in spite of the Roman Catholics.I can not recommend this book, or any book, written to prove a presupposition rather than to arrive fairly at a conclusion.

I love reading about the medieval era and have read many books about the subject, both historical novels and scholarly. This book is my favorite. &quot;A Distant Mirror&quot; was a wonderful book but difficult, I felt, to plow through. One reviewer felt William Manchester was a bit arrogant and derogatory in his dealing with the so called &quot;dark ages&quot;. I never felt as though he had this attitude, but rather that he gave the details as an impartial observer with a complete command of the subject. I would recommend this book unhesitatingly to anyone interrested in the middle ages, especially those new to the subject, as it is both packed with interresting facts yet not pedantic."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"The book was in great shape, as indicated in the ad.

When I teach myself a subject, I like to start with something basic. For example, if you wanted to do a lot of reading about Ancient Greece, you could watch the movie Troy before you started. You'd learn the names and the pronunciations and then later, while you read, you could associate the allusions made in the later works to images and living characters, rather than sparse memories of your middle school journey through Homer. It's not the most glamorous or scholarly way, but who cares? Aside from those benefits, this book is interesting. Manchester does a wonderful job explaining the humanity of each age, you're left with a grasp on how the people alive back then felt about something, rather than some historians' consensus on an event. You can't really ask for more from a book."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"A World Lit Only By Fire, written by William Manchester exposes the truth behind two distinct periods in the history of Europe: the Medieval Age and the Renaissance. Manchester first starts with the fall of the Romans and the emergence of the Germanic tribes. He then continues into the golden age of all things intellectual, the Renaissance. Manchester concludes his journey into European history with Magellan's triumphant but tragic voyage around the world. Manchester's bold portrait of these two ages unveils the truth behind the stark, trivial Dark Age that Christianity could not revitalize, the enlightened yet controversial Renaissance, and Magellan's single voyage that changed how the world is viewed today.The Dark Age, the period that stretched from 400 AD - 1000 AD, was an era of chaos that even the Holy Catholic Church could not revive. Manchester wrote, \\"Intellectual life had vanished from Europe,\\" (3). After the fall of the Roman Empire, Europe became greatly distressed. Violence and the Black Death plagued Europe and left it a disaster. In times of trouble, the Catholic Church is depended upon, but in this case, it only caused more turmoil. Although Medieval popes and rulers were completely committed to Christendom, they often had difficulty ruling according to Christ's teachings, as seen in the use of the death penalty for almost every possible offense. The first Holy Roman Emperor, Charlemagne, \\"....gave them [Saxon rebels] a choice between baptism and immediate execution,\\" (7). Christians killed fellow Christians in the debate at the Nicea Council over the divinity of Jesus. \\"Christ's missionary commandment had been clearly set forth in Matthew 28:19-20, but in the early centuries after his crucifixion the flame flickered low,\\" (8) is an exact depiction of Medieval Christianity which carried on to the Renaissance, the golden age of the intellect.The Renaissance was the intellectual and artistic movement in Europe, but it was also a time of corruption in the Church. While renowned artists such as Leonardo da Vinci was painting beautiful pieces of artwork, the papacy was busy with sexual impurities. On page 37 Manchester describes the papacy: \\"At any given moment the most dangerous enemy in Europe was the reigning pope.\\" The popes and other leaders of Christianity were influential and powerful, but in actuality they were the least devout, compassionate, and especially chaste men that could ever have been expected. An example would be Pope Alexander VI who was notorious for committing incest with his own daughter, Lucrezia Borgia. He was also known for having outrageous banquets in which guests were praised for engaging in sexual intercourse with prostitutes. Manchester states, \\"Ironically, the purity of Christ's vision had been contaminated by it's very popularity,\\"(40). Popes even engaged in indulgences, the selling of pardons for sins, which abused of the sacred sacrament of reconciliation. Although the Renaissance was an age of gold for the intellect, it was a declining moral stage for Christianity.The last section of Manchester's A World Lit Only By Fire describes Magellan's rough journey that upset the Church's belief and amazed the world. Magellan \\"...was nothing if not stubborn,\\" (255) and he was determined to find a passage to the west through or around South America. What his crew learned after his tragic death in the Filipino Islands was a shocking discovery. When the crew sojourned in Santiago, they believed \\"...that the date was Wednesday, July 9, 1522. But crewmen who landed to pick up supplies reported that in Santiago it was Thursday, July 10,\\" (290). This first puzzled the man who kept record of the dates on board, but he came to a conclusion that Copernicus' theory that the earth was revolving around the sun was right. The earth was moving, completing a full cycle every day. By circling the earth, Magellan's crew had gained another twenty-four hours. This completely defied the Church's belief that the earth was the center of the universe, geocentrism. \\"In many ways it was the crowning triumph of the age, the final, decisive blow to the dead past,\\" (291). Manchester persistently implied Magellan's significance by mentioning him several times throughout the course of the book. Manchester believes that Magellan is the \\"one man alone\\" who paved the way for the future and diminished the medieval mind, seen in his statement: \\"The power of the medieval mind was forever broken,\\" (291). According to Manchester, it was the one defining moment of the Dark Age and the Renaissance.A World Lit Only By Fire by William Manchester is not exactly a favorite of mine because the information he presented seemed subjective which made me question the validity of his statements as facts. However, it was an eye-opening book that revealed all the controversy behind each major event or figure of the Renaissance. Manchester did a fine job including meticulous details, but his writing style was a bit confusing because the events in which he described were not in chronological order. Manchester often used the phrase \\"...and yet...\\" which puzzled me because he continuously jumped from idea to idea. On the other hand, this book was helpful in the sense that it taught me several things I did not know before, such as the corruption and deception of the papacy and kings. It was a good preview for a European History course. When I began studying the Renaissance in my AP European History class, I recognized several of the people I read about in . \\"Oh, I remember that!\\" came up frequently while reading about the Renaissance for class. When you come down it, I do recommend A World Lit Only By Fire to history-lovers because it was a comprehensive, insightful book that presented a thorough portrait of \\"The Medieval Mind and the Renaissance\\". For those who are not, think about picking up another book before taking this one off the shelf because it most probably will only be a bore."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Mr Manchester has made up his mind and is not to be swayed: Everything bad that happened during the Medieval &amp; Renaissance periods happend because of the Church, and everything good that happened was in spite of the Church.

Manchester's spin on the medieval world is wholy biased: unhelpful to the casual reader, and downright insulting to medievalists. I read this many years ago, as a senior in high school, and was appalled even then by the haughty demeanour of this author as he looked down on medieval people from the 20th century, making no effort to hide his sensationalist writing and willfull misinterpretation.

I'll grudgingly give him that. However, I wonder exactly what his purpose was in writing the volume? He must have known it would take a beating for its inaccuracies, so he didn't write it for the academics or scholars. I can only conclude that he wrote it as popular history, that is, to entertain the general public. Just the same, though a more casual approach with more entertaining material is justified for a general readership, still these people deserve a book that at least attempts to be truthful. Did he have an agenda? I don't know but it seems so. He skims over some individuals and periods while devoting multiple pages to others. I can't tolerate historians who cover fascinating times so dully that even fellow history buffs can hardly stifle the snores. However, I am picky enough to want reasonable accuracy too.

It is almost willfully ignorant about its supposed subject matter, and does little more than repeat long-debunked stereotypes about the \\"dark ages.\\" I have an MA degree in medieval history, and have taught western civ and world history for eight years. Only mentioned to show that I have some actual qualifications for this opinion."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Having enjoyed William Manchester's works in the past, and being interested in the material supposedly covered in this book, I was prepared to enjoy A World Lit Only by Fire when I sat down with it. But, as much as I would have liked to, I couldn't.Manchester states that he's no expert on the period, and neither am I, but even I could see the glaring and seemingly endless number of factual errors throughout the book, not to mention the myths (such as that of &quot;la belle Ferroniere&quot; and Francis I) he presents as fact. The book isn't really even about the Middle Ages, aside from twenty or so pages Manchester devotes to outlining that thousand years of European history. The majority of the book is dedicated to Renaissance and post-Renaissance Europe, and a sizable chunk of that is solely concerned with the career of Magellan.This would be acceptable, of course, if Manchester's &quot;history&quot; wasn't just a rehash of 19th (!) century clich&eacute;s and stereotypes about the Middle Ages: that is, a Europe composed wholly of mud, blood, sex, torture and ridiculous superstition, utterly worthless and depraved. And although I'm certainly not a fan of the Catholic Church, Manchester's endless cavalcade of largely unsubstantiated potshots at that institution is particularly annoying. If this book was someone's sole source of information on the time period, they'd be excused for thinking that Europe from the fall of Rome to the rediscovery of Classical culture in the Renaissance was pretty much composed of people expiring from sexually transmitted diseases... when they weren't poisoning popes and burning witches, that is.So, why two stars and not one? A World Lit Only by Fire may be tabloid history, but it could be considered a guilty pleasure if you keep in mind that it's utter nonsense. The portion of the book dedicated to Magellan is also a cut above the rest. Given that the majority of readers will probably be utterly ignorant about this time period, though, it's pretty irresponsible of Manchester to present a bunch of unrelated half-truths and myths as history. He says in his Author's Note--along with various other veiled apologies--that he didn't plan out the writing of this book in advance and it certainly shows.If you want to read about the time period covered in this book without sacrificing facts for readability (or vice versa), try A Distant Mirror by Barbara Tuchman, the appropriate volumes of The Story of Civilization by Will Durant (The Age of Faith, The Renaissance, and The Reformation) or The Civilization of the Middle Ages by Norman Cantor. They show that reading about this period can be both entertaining and informative, even if there isn't a bloodthirsty, syphilitic twelve year-old bishop on every page."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"I read this book when it first appeared, and have since carried pleasant if rather vague memories of it. Rereading it some 16 years later, I'm horrified by how bad it is in places, and wonder what in the world I saw in it the first time around.The opening section entitled \\"The Medieval Mind\\" is especially, embarrassingly, bad. In it, Manchester reduces an entire millennium to a quick and spotty sketch (this must account in part for the vagueness of my memories) which is full of over-generalizations (the medieval world wasn't a bona fide \\"civilization\\"), simplifications (\\"there was no room in the medieval mind for doubt; the possibility of skepticism simply did not exist\\"), and absolute howlers (medieval peasants went naked in the summer; the medieval mind had no spatial and temporal awareness or self-consciousness).Less bad--but still bad--are the succeeding two sections, both much longer than the opening one on the medieval period (this, despite the book's subtitle). One of the sections is on the Renaissance and Reformation, the other focuses on Magellan and the European \\"discovery\\" of the New World (which Manchester tells us was the germ from which the entire book grew). There are some interesting biographical vignettes in the Renaissance section that probably account for my pleasant memories--Savonarola, da Vinci, and Erasmus in particular--but there's no real effort on Manchester's part to wrestle with the meaning of the new humanism that fueled the Renaissance or to explore the intricacies of the Reform revolt against Rome. Instead, he falls back on tired stereotypes; his long account of Martin Luther is especially hackneyed. Manchester's concluding account of Magellan's voyage, with its brief nod to Renaissance astronomy and the science of navigation, is enthusiastic and lively, and is probably the best--or least bad--part of the book. But again, it's sketchy and breathless.So what accounts for the remarkable popularity of this book? Its quality should've landed it on the out-of-print shelve long ago. My only guess is that Manchester's well-deserved fame for his contemporaneous histories (WWII, Winston Churchill, Douglas MacArthur) bestows a borrowed and undeserved aura of authority on this one. But authors (and their agents and editors) really ought to know when they're in over their heads, and refrain from writing bad copy just because they know they can get it published."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Any work of history is bound to have a few errors of fact or interpretation, but &quot;A World Lit Only By Fire&quot; is riddled with astonishing inaccuracies. At one point, Manchester claims that Copernicus was burned at the stake by the Inquisition. In fact, Copernicus died of natural causes (cerebral haemorrhage) in 1543! Publication of his &quot;Book of Revolutions&quot; was actually encouraged by certain Church officials during his lifetime, and the book was not proscribed by the Church until 73 years after it was published. Perhaps Manchester was thinking of Giordano Bruno, or perhaps he was not thinking at all. Another example: His description of John Calvin's bloodthirsty doings relies on heavily biased secondary sources, many of which have been discredited by serious historians. There's no need to bring up further examples, since Manchester himself claims in his introduction that a historian who read the manuscript disagreed with statements on almost every page of this book. It seems safe to assume that Manchester's unwillingness to correct or qualify these statements was the result of his having an axe to grind. If you have even a glancing acquaintance with medieval history, you'll be shocked by Manchester's willful disregard for basic facts. If you're new to the subject and want a good introduction, try Barbara Tuchman's &quot;A Distant Mirror&quot; or Norman Cohn's &quot;Pursuit of the Millennium.&quot;"},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Is this some kind of joke?As a young man, William Manchester served in WWII. He then pursued a career in journalism, spending time overseas. At some point he shifted to an academic career and compiled, probably in part from experience, biographies of Churchill, McArthur, and J. F. Kennedy -- safe territory for a journalist. His list of works include some fiction and essays; we can surmise that first and foremost, he is a writer, not an analyst, and certainly not a researcher.As his \\"Author's Note\\" reveals, at the age of 70 during a convalesence, he decided to write a \\"portrait\\" of the 16th Century as a backdrop to a study of Magellan. In roughly two years he churned out \\"AWLOBF,\\" notwithstanding the fact that his background in the 16th Century was no more than \\"the general familiarity of an educated man.\\" As a result, his efforts to deposit ink on paper yielded a work that has an uncanny resemblance to recently used toilet paper.Anyone should be suspicious of a book that provides firm dates for the death of Arthur and Robin Hood. (Chronology, p. X). Carless mistakes such as misidentifying Grand Duke Ivan III as the first Tsar of Russia (p. 35; Ivan IV (1533-1584) = first Tsar) serve only to shred its credibility.As Manchester himself states, the book is \\"a slight work with no scholarly pretensions. All the sources are secondary, few are new. I have not mastered recent scholarship on the early sixteenth century.\\" In fact, turning to his \\"Acknowledgements and Sources,\\" we find that he gives credit above all to the Will Durant's \\"Story of Civilization\\" (ca. 1954) and the Encylopaedia Brittanica. In other words, we are blessed with a careless synthesis of dated general compilations, themselves compiled from dated secondary sources. The lack of attribution makes it impossible to discern the basis for Manchester's vast array of brazen assertions. Further, the engrafting of his \\"portrait of the age\\" upon the material concerning Magellan yields a singularly disjointed work.It is particularly reprehensible that Manchester unquestioningly accepts scholarship that is invariably two or three generations old. The most prominent theme, repeated ad nauseam, is that someone turned the lights out in Europe in the latter part of the 5th Century and it was only through the sudden and blessed intervention of Humanists who re-discovered the ancients in the 15th century that the world was saved from the \\"Dark Ages.\\" Yes, he liberally applies that hackneyed and questionable term -- to the entire period.Contradictory evidence such as the writings of Petrarch and Dante are only \\"lonely execeptions\\" to the total dearth of anything valuable in the long night that gripped Europe in the rather simple mind of William Manchester. (Augustine, Abelard, Acquinas, Chaucer?) Accordinly, the first 28 pages which purport to summarize the history of the Medieval world should be summarily removed from each copy and thrown away.Even a cursory review of medieval studies since say, 1950, puts the lie to Manchester's basic premise. (For the story of this development in the 20th C., see Cantor's \\"Inventing the Middle Ages\\"). For an Emeritus Professor of History at Wesleyan, the lack of effort is astounding. Any old source is a good source. For example, as to Davis' \\"Life on a Medieval Barony\\" (1924!!), he says: \\"Davis was writing about the thirteenth century, but his picture of a medieval community is valid in depicting the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\\" How Manchester would know is a mystery. What changes the Black Death (mid-14th C.) might have occasioned must have been just too inconvenient.As so many have commented, no salacious detail is missed by the priapic pen of Bill \\"Horndog\\" Manchester: \\"lore [always a reliable source!!] has it that he was coupling with the older woman when he was distracted by the sight of her adolescent daughter laying beside them . . . [the passage gets much more graphic from here]\\"Dr. Manchester, if he merits that title, has only succeeded in unbuttoning the fabric to expose the withering envy of old age for the sexual potency of youth. Wesleyan should be embarrassed; even casual readers should move on to something more intellectually honest."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"\\"In the Medieval mind, there was also no awareness of time.\\" This breathtakingly ludicrous statement appears on page 22, and it represents everything that is horrifying about this book. (Just for starters, try telling any farmer of any era that he has \\"no awareness of time\\" and you'll end up in the manure pile, literally or figuratively.)Read Regine Pernoud's \\"Those Terrible Middle Ages: Debunking the Myths\\" (published in May 2000) or go to the library and pull out the 38-year-old \\"Horizon book of the Middle Ages\\" instead. Manchester's vituperation of the era borders on hysteria."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"One reviewer here, the author of a rather scathing evalutaion, asked that high school students submit their reviews of this book. I'll happily comply (I'm currently a college student, but read 'A World Lit Only By Fire' for the fist time while in high school), though I doubt my review will please her, as I found this book absolutely fascinating, highly enjoyable, and very easy to read. As far as I'm aware, no one else in my AP European History class had trouble with it either.Rather than detailing events in chronological order as many historical books do, Manchester takes us through subject by subject. Beginning with an explanation of the Medieval mind and how it came to be, Manchester goes on to address every possible aspect of life in the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods. In addition to recounting events of historic significance and discussing prominent people of the times, he takes us to the very core of Medieval being, describing in vivid detail the dress, eating habits, beliefs, and living conditions of all classes, from peasantry to nobility. The book closes with a section devoted to the explorer Ferdinand Magellan, telling of his voyage to circumnavigate the globe by which he inadvertantly helped bring about the twilight of an age.There are some things which set this book apart from the bulk of scholarly historical texts I have read. Perhaps the most unique is its organization. Most historical texts begin at one point in time and continue on, year by year, until they reach the end of the period they are covering. Manchester has done things differently. He does not stick to a chronological line in his writing, but rather begins with one aspect of Medieval life and winds his way back and forth through each topic until everything has been told to satisfaction. Now, such a system might prove choppy if not for Manchester's great skill in weaving topics together. The crossover between one subject and the next is sometimes all but imperceptible. He takes one idea and, when finished with it, shows precisely how it ties in with the next. The writing is seamless. Manchester develops a beautiful literary illustration of the interconnectedness of different aspects of Medieval life. As he himself states in his note at the beginning of the book, &quot;each event [leads] inexorably to another, then another...&quot; (pg. XV).The organization and fluency of the writing makes this book easy and pleasurable to read, but there is yet another feature which makes 'A World Lit Only By Fire' special. Manchester's tone brings the author to life. It is plain to see that he has his own opinions on what he is writing, and lets them come through with an easy humor that pokes fun at history's idiosyncrasies without being vicious. While one can see that he has some biases (and everyone does), he covers all aspects of an issue without letting his feelings distort it, but still managing to make his opinion known.It is these characteristics, and a meticulous attention to detail, that separate Manchester's work from the ordinary, cut-and-dried textbook writing we see so often. It draws the reader in just as a novel might. The book is thorough and comprehensive, but the presentation makes it seem almost as if a story is being told. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about life in Medieval Europe."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Known among medievalists merely as &quot;that book,&quot; Manchester's &quot;World Lit Only by Fire&quot; vividly tells a compelling story; the only problem is that the story he tells bears little to no resemblance to the realities of medieval Europe. Manchester gets facts wrong (for instance, being a century off in dating Chaucer's &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;), commits logical fallacies (for instance, comparing the quality of life of medieval peasants to that of Renaissance lords, and concluding that society as a whole became richer), and seems more interested in writing polemic than history. The reason seems obvious. Manchester, in lionizing Magellan, wishes to make his readers feel good about colonialism, materialism, and European expansionism; in doing so, he must try at all costs to discredit any other form of Western civilization, particularly the insular, spiritually-based outlook of medieval Europe. Manchester's book is not medieval history but colonialist propaganda. If historians were subject to malpractise law, this book would have lost Manchester his license."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"This has got to be the single worst book written about the middle ages. Manchester, who is a 20th century historian, seems to be trying to revive long dead scholarship. Most of his sources were bettered long ago. His ideas that the Middle Ages were a vast period of darkness, and only with the coming of the Reniassance (actually to him probably the Reformation and Luther) did it brighten, are so wrong that this book has actually been ridiculed by most historians. The Middle Ages were the birthplace of the 'modern' concepts of Law, Medicine, Government, Education, Christianity, and many others. The Renaissance brought a little better art, a little further exploration. The Reformation brought a new way of looking at Christianity. Neither hold a candle to the bonfire of the Middle Ages. If you want a good solid introduction the the Middle Ages try Painter and Tierney or Hollister. A good Intro for the Renaissance is Burkhardt. And a good intro for the Reformation is Donald Wilcox, or DeLamar Jensen."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Upon reading the collection of negative and indignant reviews of _A World Lit Only By Fire_ it seems obvious to me that many readers completely misunderstood Manchester's purpose in writing it. If you are looking to pass a pop quiz on medieval history or to find the standard party line on the Middle Ages, don't look to Manchester's daring piece. If you are interested in an observant, insightful, juicy, and imaginative portrait of the Western World in upheaval, this book certainly qualifies. The book is anything but clinical and objective. That fact has obviously ruffled the feathers of dusty, party-line medieval history buffs who want a 300-page series of facts and dates. But the book's honest subjectivity and willingness to judge the important people of the past are what make it worth reading. Anyone who believes historical writing is anything but the author's opinion about the past is fooling themselves, and at least Manchester does not attempt to cloak his conjecture in a stodgy air of authority. _A World Lit Only By Fire_ is a fascinating and colorful take on the transition from Roman Empire to Renaissance and Reformation, written by a superbly intelligent, articulate, and bold historian. It is not a historical reference manual and does not pretend to be.

Every cliche and long-debunked tale gets a fresh airing in Manchester's strangely ideological zeal to depict mediaeval times and people as backward, devoid of innovation or even intelligence. He is quite willing to contradict himself in a single sentence if he can find another way to show mediaeval lives as barbaric, ignorant and foreign. His complete failure to understand basic concepts of feudalism and religious devotion is simply wilfull and inexcusable; his slobbering fascination with the grand guignol of the papacy's worst excesses and the more outre myths and legends is simply perverse. Here we have a writer so purposefully, determinedly ignorant that he sincerely posits that Magellan's voyage \\"proved the world was round\\". Magellan! Even Washington Irving said it was Columbus! That Robin Hood really existed -- but was a brutal thug, that the Pied Piper of Hamlyn also existed, but was a pederast who raped, slaughtered and butchered 140 children, all on his own, one day. There is no limit to Manchester's depravity and his enthusiasm for wallowing in the ugliest end of every mediaeval myth, and there is no beginning to any actual research he has done or knowledge he has. Ignorant, baseless rumour-mongering, a sordid and inaccurate depiction of a society that the author does not understand that tells us far more about his own twisted worldview than it does about the age in question. It is not even fake scholarship, there is no attempt at scholarship.\\"A World Lit Only By Fire\\" is valuable to the student of mediaeval history as a perfect distillation of the worst misunderstandings, rumours, myths, and misinformation that people believe about the period. Everything from the \\"jus primae noctis\\" to the preposterous idea that subsistence farmers who are forced to eat spoiled meat can only tolerate it if it has the most expensive substances in the world --spices -- sprinkled on it. Every clueless, titillating rumour and half-baked theory of belief in a flat earth is here indulged. The existence and popularity of this stupid, ridiculous book tells us much of the woeful historiography of the late mediaeval period. But it tells us nothing about the period itself, because its author knows nothing about it and never had any interest in learning about it."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"There are plenty of trashy historical novels to keep us entertained in planes and this might be a good example (although I read it on a coach) except that it is claiming to be factual.

Some of the events Manchester describes did happen (although by no means all) but he totally fails to supply any sort of context or explanation. His bias is so glaring as to be embarrassing and he gives the impression of having a one track mind.If you want to learn something go elsewhere. If you want good historical fiction go elsewhere.

What is he adding, aside from bias, inference, and lack of empathy for his subject (people have always been people, after all, just like us).I paused and searched several websites for reviews and reactions. Sure enough, my doubts were affirmed by well-supported critiques by people qualified in the field. It seems Manchester's claims are not supported, in many cases.I have also read the National Enquirer once or twice, just for fun, though never made it through a whole issue. There may be truth in there, but the spin and shoddy inference SO gets in the way.For me. A non-historian. Just another educated reader.I'm off to buy (from Amazon) the highly recommended A Distant Mirror-the Calamitous 14th Century, by Tuchman.

That may be so; but even popular history has to get the basic facts right.

This book should be subtitled 'Sex Sells'."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Capturing the Renaissance period in a history book is hard to do without giving the absolute truth since most of history is oral tradition. The fact that children read and learn the material in the book automatically bowdlerizes the information. For the valid fact, William Manchester's A World Lit Only by Fire is a good example of the controversy and pragmatism the Renaissance was about because of its description of one of the highlights of European history. The book touches on each aspect of the Renaissance as it begins with the launch of the Renaissance, moves on to the spread of the Renaissance spirit, and ends on the note of the age of exploration which eventually ended the Renaissance. Such figures as Ferdinand Magellan, Lucrezia Borgia, and other influential individuals and their influences are discussed. This literary work has a different approach to the true Renaissance because of its controversial topics.As the novel begins, it starts with the most obvious topic, the beginning of the Renaissance. Manchester did this to the put the reader right in the middle of 14th century Italy, where the \\"magic\\" begins. As the book displays, Christianity was such a major influence on everyday life. This can be seen in this example, \\"Despite their blood thirstiness - ... all were devout Christians (pg.6).\\" As the story goes on, many other passions replaced Christianity being prestige, science, art, literature, etc. For instance, from the words of John Calvin criticizing the Copernican theory that the earth revolved around the sun, when he said, \\"Who will venture to place the authority of Copernicus above that of the Holy Spirit? (pg.90).\\" As these substitutions for devotion flourished, the Renaissance itself flourished and fled to Northern Europe.Now that the Renaissance attitude was spreading throughout Europe, England, France, and Spain were now touched by the movement. Art flourished among all these nations and was in great demand to the wealthy class. The book documents the figures that influenced the art aspect of the time like Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Donatello, and Botticelli. Being that Manchester was rather biased towards Leonardo, The book depicts him as \\"divine\\". For example, as shown here as Manchester confers \\"...he, was among other things a master of engineering, biology, sculpture, linguistics, botany, music, philosophy, architecture, and science...(pg.92).\\" While the inspiration grew, many other \\"specialists explored the boundaries of their field, and even their world.Towards the beginning of the 16th century, Europe become interested in finding different rout to their major exports, the Spanish especially. The novel clearly expresses this infatuation with the unknown with the example of Ferdinand Magellan. Since he tried to construct the way to sail around the world and eventually prove that the world was round, he accepted the hardships he would face and sailed on. The book describes his voyage as \\"the culmination - opened the entire world, thus introducing the modern age (pg.229).\\" As Manchester says, he does in fact open the world.I personally enjoyed the factuality of the book. Such controversies like the Borgia Family made a historical novel interesting and more attractive to today's society. As the Renaissance is a central event in European history, this novel gave a better understanding of this influential period of time. Since it only covers the first part of the age of exploration, I feel the book should have gone into additional detail on the next couple years and the continuance of the exploration age. All in all, the book gives sufficient information and facts on the subject at hand which, I believe was exactly Manchester's goal in writing this great novel."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Good reading, but you have to keep an open mind..."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"If you like history, you'll love this.

Everything affects and is affected by everything else.\\" This of course we know is very clear!!!Taking place shortly after the downfall of the roman empire, Europe was in kaos from the medieval age to the renaissance. However during that time there was a continuation of the Greco-roman empire, (Europes most advanced civilization) thru the renaissance of more of the same. This age was as barbaric as any could get...the interpretation of Christianity was flawed in scope and where applied was brutal, reckless, domineering. The aristocracy was corrupt, greedy incestrous, murderous...the general populace, diseased, savage, ignorant, starving. The order of the day, warlords attacking each other for assets in every portion of the euro vicinity...the author describes the time from 400 ad to 1500 ad, an awful long time to be in this condition...Prison, well no, execution by way of burning at the stake, slash and quarter, beheadings, the use of the jungfer (this sent a 1000 chills up my spine) was the norm. Some of the most evolved individuals, such as Martin Luther, Leonardo di Vinci, Nicolus Copernicus, Sir Thomas Moore, Eramas, exploring advances and taking the church to task were murdered, discredited, assassinated banished. OH MY EUROPE WUZZ OFF THA CHAIN...For anthing different beyond their world was inconceivable. The once awesome pied piper was actually a psychopathic child dismembering murderer, robin hood was actually a cold blooded rogue and guinevere, well it is questionable as to whether she was even real.

This book's themes are not new, same old unenlightened slam of the Middle Ages that was so popular in the past, and as written it's not even good history. This is a series of topical essays, written in no apparent order, that employ as much scathing criticism of a people living in a time and place as can be fit in. This is a return to the \\"Medieval humans were ignorant, filthy, oppressed, collectively dull specimens of the species, and thank goodness for the improvement that the 1500's brought\\" variety of historical thought that has been gradually dying a natural death as modern research proves otherwise. (These Medieval \\"oafs\\" built Gothic cathedrals, Bill.) I don't like Manchester. I mean I don't like him personally. And I didn't care much for the things he had to say in his simple little tabloid-ish book, either.

If the world was \\"lit\\" then the world itself would be burning."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Manchester thinks he is insulting the Middle Ages with his title, but it takes just a second's reflection to remember that the world was lit only by fire until the nineteenth century. And it goes downhill from there. I don't have anything specific to add to others' comments on Manchester's pervasive lack of organization, accuracy, logic, and taste; I'll just say that I virtually never quit reading a book in disgust, but I made an exception in this case. I wish I could give it a negative number of stars."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"\\"A World Lit Only By Fire\\" is a salacious comic book posing as history. The author gives us a hint about this when he casually mentions that one of the world's foremost authorities \\"challenged me - and rightly so - in virtually every passage of the work,\\" adding that this distinguished scholar \\"took exception to several of my interpretations.\\" No doubt. The book is grotesque. Manchester's essential point is that the middle ages were a time of horrifying ignorance and degeneracy. Now there's a novel idea. And the unspoken, blatantly teleological question that overhangs the book is, \\"How did an era as revolting as that one manage to produce the miracle that is us?\\" On page after page, Manchester invites, no, forces us to read sensationalized and often unsubstantiated accounts of depravity, cruelty, and criminality, always pretending he is repulsed by adding that these acts were \\"wrong\\". And then he launches into yet another historically unsupportable account of papal depravity, or something equally titillating, inventing prurient details when the facts fail to provide, as they so often do. In the end, this book can be summarized as a caricature of history in which the author \\"struggles\\" to understand how the religiously-rooted superstitions of a dark and dangerously degenerate era finally yielded to the glorious secularism which the author obviously adores. His answer: scientific discoveries and exploration proved the underlying religious dogma was untrue, and that liberated the mind of man to create the wonders we now enjoy. How nice. And what a wonderful formula for transferring money from our pockets to Manchester's. Important issues surround the middle ages, but Manchester's book cannot enlighten us about them. It is a childish fantasy better suited to simpletons who believe they see universal truth in the flickering screen of their utterly pointless video games than to thoughtful readers who seek real information and careful analysis. Considering the many fine alternatives, serious readers should look elsewhere. Manchester's \\"A World Lit Only By Fire\\" is both a joke and an annoying waste of time."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"Unfortunately I had to return this item, but the seller made it fast and easy."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"The book is poorly written, full of fictional rantings and generally liberal recapping of other historial history books.

His analysis of the just-post-Roman Christian Church in particular was PAINFUL to read. It was quite clear from his writing that he had not bothered to return to the source documents themselves but had simply stuck with others' interpretation of Christianity. He perpetuated several urban myths about the history of Christianity, and his interpretations of medieval life seemed to assume, frequently, that medieval people not just thought about the world differently than we do (a valid assumption) but that they were substantially dumber than we are (invalid).A student who turned in a paper to me citing this book as fact would probably get points off automatically for lack of ability to adequately analyze sources for factual accuracy.

Manchester's not a professional historian, has no particular expertise in this period of history, and occasionally gets his facts wrong.

As an English major graduated from a top liberal arts school and a senior financial executive with a large engineering and construction company, I have come to prize works that seek to convey as much information as possible, in the most interesting way and, of equal importance, with economy of style.This work is a joy. The author, well known for his works on Churchill, obviously relishes the diversion and complexity of his subject.Chock full of facts, stories, history, personalities, philosophy, &quot;science,&quot; science, religion, culture, etc., etc., this non fiction book is a &quot;page turner.&quot;Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give this book is this-I have loaned this book to at least ten people.

According to him, no innovation took place and everyone was backward and brutal. He supports this bleak and inaccurate view through carefully selected tidbits of facts and throws them at the reader without giving a complete picture. This leads to an incomplete understanding of this era and I pity the reader who gets their complete view of the Middle Ages from this book only. This book is VERY misleading and downright dishonest, but aims at sensationalizing and confirmation of the worst stereotypes that exist among the uneducated about the Middle Ages. It's classic yellow journalism masquerading as history.In addition, Barrett Whitener who's voice we hear in this recording has a peculiar way of pronunciation that may be hard to get used to. For example he pronounces \\"Medieval\\" as two separate words: \\"Midi - evil\\" and confuses the listener by reading dates in an add fashion: for example year 840 becomes \\"forty-eight-hundred\\" but at other times the years are read more conventionally. Otherwise he does a good job and is quite convincing.Overall it's a book to endure for a fanatic of the Middle Ages who wants to fish out some new info or for a person who would like to confirm their preconceptions about \\"the set back in human history called The Dark Ages\\"."},{"Title":"World Lit Only By Fire","review":"As it has been said, this book is very summative in its treatment of the period and might leave less intelligent readers with a stereotyped understanding of the period. However, the book could not have been any more than summative, given that Manchester's expertise is in modern history and that all his sources were secondary. He even admits that concept of the book grew out of a prologue he was designated to write for a biography of Magellan. Manchester's work, despite these flaws, in a captivating read. He has a gripping and masterful use of the language to provide deliciously lucid descriptions, and he has a penchant and flair for absorbing descriptions of the debauched frolicking of the times. While the section of the book dealing with Magellan may suffer from the work's inherent bias, it is a fantastically moving and tragic read that could have been developed into a larger, entirely biographical work."},{"Title":"A Lady in Disguise (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Lady Emma Weston has not been to England since she was 6, but now the Tsar's visit to her birthplace offers her a chance to go home again. As members of this delegation, Emma's aunt and uncle are very conscious of the need for decorum with their young charge, but Emma yearns for freedom. She impulsively decides to masquerade as a servant to see the fireworks exhibit and is rescued from a scoundrel by &quot;Jack&quot;, who recognizes the lovely Lady Emma. Jack, the Viscount St. Albans, is one of England's finest intelligence officers, and it occurs to him that Lady Emma may, in fact, be a spy and not the delightful innocent she appears. He vows to discover the truth about the LADY IN DISGUISE, and discovers along the way that he loves her dearly. Amanda McCabe spins another engrossing tale for her devoted fans. Readers will sympathize with her spunky heroine, who just wants a taste of freedom, and her hero will melt hearts as he treads the fine line between deceit and delight."},{"Title":"A Lady in Disguise (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"All in all, &quot;Lady in Disguise&quot; was a rather satisfying and magical read; and it definitely would have received a 5 star rating from me even it wasn't for the fact that it did suffer from poor pacing towards the end of the book.Tired of being hemmed in by protocol and proper behaviour, Lady Emma Weston, the niece of the visiting Russian diplomat, Count Suravov, has escaped from the Pulteney Hotel, disguised as a maid, in order to enjoy the London sights. Much as Lady Emma loves her aunt and uncle, and much as she's been grateful to them for having taken her in when her parents died, she has found her life at Tsar Alexander's court to be rather stifling. Lady Emma had rather hoped that being back in England again would mean a little relaxing of all the rules about protocol and proper behaviour. Unfortunately, she's found life in London, so far, to be as stifling as life in St. Petersburg. And so, she's decided to slip out, in order to enjoy a few hours respite. And she was enjoying herself quite a bit until she was accosted by a lout. Fortunately, she's rescued by a very dashing and handsome Englishman whom she promptly (and unwisely) looses her heart to.Except that her Englishman is no ordinary Englishman, he's actually Jack Howard, the Viscount St. Albans, and he's a spy in His Majesty's secret service. And it is while he's out (dressed as an underpaid secretary) delivering secret papers to Count Suvarov, that he runs into the Count's lovely niece, Lady Emma. Now Jack recognizes Lady Emma (he'd been introduced to her a few nights before); but it soon becomes clear to him that she does not recollect having met him at all. Half in love with Lady Emma because of her dazzling looks and her dreamy eyes, Jack decides to play along, little dreaming that he would find himself totally in love with the bewitching Lady Emma by the time their day together is over. To be able to meet Lady Emma again and spend more time with her is all Jack can think of. And yet what will Lady Emma say when she discovers his charade (as she will sooner or later), and can he persuade her to overlook his deceit and to carry on looking at him with her heart in her eyes?I don't know if this has ever happened to you, but here's what happened to me: I was enjoying the book enormously -- the nice and sedate pace at which things were unfolding between Jack and Emma, the manner in which the authour had fleshed out Jack's and Emma's characters (as well as a few others -- Madame Ana, Bertie Stonwich, Sir Jeremy Ashbey, Emma's aunt, Lady Lydia, and Jack's mother, Jane), as well as the slightly darker subplot that was developing in tandem to the main plot involving the Jack and Emma's romance, when suddenly everything moved at lightening speed (in the last 15 odd pages), to a shocking climax, with several issues still left hanging (in my opinion) in midair. And since this is supposed to be a Signet SUPER Regency romance (which I took to mean a little longer than the usual 200 odd pages format), I had rather expected everything to be resolved a little more satisfactorily and a lot more smoothly. For example, how does Lady Emma take the news that she's married to a spy? Will Jack give up spying in favour of a quiet life with Emma? Was there something even more sinister to the villain's fixation on Lady Emma than was indicated with the hurried ending? I wanted these questions answered, and was rather disappointed when they weren't.On the whole though, &quot;Lady in Disguise&quot; is a rather magical and satisfying story of two lonely people who find love and fulfillment in each other -- and if that's not a good enough recommendation, I really don't know what is."},{"Title":"A Lady in Disguise (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I enjoyed Lady in Disguise. It features a heroine who knows her duty and will do it, but she just wants one taste of life's excitement that she sees occurring outside her window.

I am surprised to see myself giving a 2-star rating to this 5-star author.Lady Emma Weston, neice of a Russian Count and Countess, has lived in Russia for most of her life. She travels to England with her aunt and uncle, expecting it to be exciting, only to find that it is anything but. Emma has very little patience for etiquette and Society. Hoping to find the adventure she came for, Emma dresses as a maid and sneaks into the streets of London.While there, she is rescued by a man named Jack Howard, who is dressed as a tradesman. He says he is a secretary--and she doesn't remember meeting him the previous night. Jack, who is actually Viscount St. Albans, is intrigued by the dark-haired beauty who claims to be a Russian maid (he knows the truth about her identity). Jack decides to play along with her ruse. Together, they spend one magical night on the streets of London.Emma is afraid she'll never see Jack again. Of course, they DO meet up again... about 1/3 of the way through the novel. This interesting beginning is followed by a grueling middle and end.&quot;Lady in Disguise&quot; lacked the mysticism of Amanda McCabe's previous novels. The characters were (in my opinion) rather dull. I became irritated by the heroine's naivete and impulsiveness. We were introduced to a mere skeleton of a villain, who barely made an appearance in this overlong novel. The ending was awkward and rushed.Fortunately, the novel is well-written and easy to read... if you can commit to the 278 bland pages (178, if you exclude the good beginning)."},{"Title":"A Lady in Disguise (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"there were a few issues with this book although i really enjoyed it...one is the fact that we didn't get to see much passion between jack and emma. we were built up and built up waiting for them to consumate their marriage and then disappointingly, it is entirely left for the imagination. i also did not like how they got married sooo quickly after meeting...not very believable, nor very romantic. i think it's best when romance is built up slowly.it was a fun to read book, and had a very nice premise to it. although the villian, jeremy, comes across weakly. his story is never fleshed out...and it could have been made interesting too. all i can say is thank god he didn't try to kidnap emma, because honestly the story is so full of cliches that i found myself expecting that.i've read more romantic and passionate stories before, but if you are looking for something cute in the way of a regency romance, then check this book out."},{"Title":"A Lady in Disguise (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"This book is fairly well written and the plot is mildy interesting.

Montgomery makes his point very clearly through his examples. When Greek astronomy moved to imperial Rome, the science was understood for its pragmatic value."},{"Title":"Subcontact: Slap the face of fear and wake up your subconscious","review":"This book is in the same vein as people who have discovered the Ouija board or channelling. The enthusiasm builds... the closed community feeds off its own excitement... they start inventing their own vocabulary for things... and, pretty soon, they have a religion/movement/therapy that they proclaim to the world.So what did these pioneers actually discover?1. That doing a \\"fearless and searching moral inventory\\" is useful for facing your fears and putting things into perspective.2. That learning to interpret your dreams is a good skill to develop.3. That setting goals and making clear intentions helps you to become a better person.4. That the regular practice of daydreaming with someone listening/transcribing/guiding can bring about some very interesting stories that you can then interpret as you would a dream will give you some neat insights into yourself/the world.I applaud the authors for emphasizing the benefit of daydreaming and of creating a format where dream-relating and interpretation is valued but these ideas do not consititute a 'system of self-discovery' that is worthy of the attention they feel it deserves.Really... the authors speak about their work in the same tones that New Agers talk about their out=of=body experiences.

P. G. Wodehouse's enormous output of books can be found in castles and cottages, and have been translated into dozens of languages; the Russian versions are particularly adored. It is true that he doesn't appeal to everybody; I have run into many who think he just put out the same silly comedy with interchanging characters. They are completely wrong, but we can't argue about tastes. Barry Day and Tony Ring are two Wodehouse enthusiasts who had the bright idea of taking bits and pieces from Wodehouse's amusing letters, inserting parts of his work, and tying it all together with a very few notes as a small biography. Their book, _P. G. Wodehouse in His Own Words_ (Overlook) is a great success, but it must be said (and they would agree, I am sure) that its success derives from page after page of quotations from the master.Woodhouse had a happy early life, and loved school. His public school values of fair play, loyalty, and honesty stuck to him all during his life, and may easily be found within his stories. A dip in his father's fortunes made college impossible, and he entered commerce for which he was completely unfit. He had trouble in the basics like getting to work on time. If his supervisor was as good at dry understatement as Wodehouse was, Wodehouse might have gotten the following warning, which comes from one of his books: \\"I must ask you in future to try and synchronise your arrival at the office with that of the rest of the staff. We aim as far as possible at the communal dead heat.\\" What he did do with fervor was to write stories. It was tough in the beginning, as he took a while to acquire his tone now familiar. \\"I wrote nineteen short stories in three weeks, I just sent the stories out... (all of which, I regret to say, editors were compelled to decline owing to lack of space. The editors regretted it, too. They said so.)\\" But once he found his voice, magazines and book publishers in England and in the U.S. were enthusiastic. He crossed to the U.S., working in the theater and in Hollywood. After being imprisoned in Nazi Germany, he settled into working his last decades in America, writing constantly, and tending his dogs and cats. When he died in 1975, he was in the middle of a novel, and he was writing new lyrics for a musical _Kissing Time_ that he had written in 1918. And less than two months before, he had been given his knighthood.Wodehouse was not Shakespeare. (\\"Shakespeare's stuff is different from mine, but that is not to say that it is inferior.\\") His plots can be clever, his characters unbelievable dolts (as is Bertie Wooster, but as is not the invaluable Jeeves), but his expressions guarantee a smile, and possibly a guffaw, on every page. \\"The Sergeant of Police... was calm, stolid and ponderous, giving the impression of being constructed of some form of suet.\\" \\"I don't suppose he makes enough out of a novel to keep a midget in doughnuts for a week. Not a really healthy midget.\\" \\"I've seen worse shows than this turned into hits. All it wants is a new book and lyrics and a different score.\\" \\"I was in musical comedy. I used to sing in the chorus, till they found out where the noise was coming from.\\" Day and Ring seem to have read every Wodehouse book with total recall to find comments on butlers, golf, America, clubs, and the clergy. Even displaced from his daffy plots and characters, the many quotations here provide spiffing entertainment, and will remind even the best of fans that it is always a good time to get reacquainted with Lord Emsworth, Gussie Fink-Nottle, Aunt Agatha, Psmith, the Mulliners, and all the rest of the balmy crew."},{"Title":"Wodehouse In His Own Words","review":"This splendid little tome, co-authored by Wodehouse fans Barry Day and Tony Ring (the latter of whom is President of the International Wodehouse Society) will tickle every rib of anyone who has ever mined the rich, seemingly bottomless vein of humor that is the work of Pelham Greenville \\"P.G.\\" Wodehouse.If it is true that the foundation of all comedy lies in truth, then Wodehouse was a master observer of the human race, every hue, stripe and rosette of it. This book brings together so many wonderul excerpts from various Wodehouse works (and he was prolific, authoring more than 90 books in his lifetime), that it has a place not only on the shelf of Sir W.'s fan's but also in the hands of those who have not yet discovered this enduring genius with an exquisite and masterful grasp of the English language.The only downside to being a Wodehouse afficianado is that one must own a bookshelf just to house all of the books that are \\"musts\\" (and most of them are) ... small price to pay for a library that will keep you in the proverbial stitches, come what may.This is a great addition to that library -- or a good reason to start one of your own.Right ho!"},{"Title":"Wodehouse In His Own Words","review":"&quot;A splendid Wodehouse vade-mecum; no home should be without a copy.

(\\"Plum\\") Wodehouse fans. It provides an easy to read, accessible biographical overview of Plum's life built mostly (say 90%) upon extracts from Plum's books, plays and letters. This means that whilst learning about Plum, you are actually reading Plum, so it kills two thingamajiggies with the one thingamajiggy, as Bertie would say.So the whole damned idea behind this book is pretty damned good. And the two clever chaps who have put pen to paper here really seem to be know their onions, Plum onions. Besides the normal life history caper that most Plum beginners probably know, his English boarding school education, comic writing and that dashed nasty business of being captured by Jerry in World War II, Misters Day and Ring, dig into some less well known aspects. In particular his Broadway and Hollywood careers, rather than being a sideshow, these two adventures were old Plummy's bread and butter for give or take three decades, and if he hadn't also been something of a big shot in the old quilled pen and printing press department, Plum's career as a lyricist for musical comedy alone would have rocketed him up to the hallowed ranks of the fabulous famous flibbedyjibbets.The book, and I read the hard cover version, published by the lads at \\"The Overlook Press\\", is not to be overlooked. It is a physically fine edition, a decent size, not so big you need your gentlemens' gentlemen to carry it for you, and not one of these flimsy five and dime jobs that self destruct after the first reading either. And did I say the fonts, paper quality and printing is a bang up job too? It even smells like a good book.And another thing too. Poor old Plum always managed, or so it now seems to me after reading all about it in \\"In His Own Words\\", to put his foot firmly in his mouth (Bertie style) whenever he was cornered by one of those journalist johnnies into inquisition by interview. The painful story of how old Plum, recently released by the Jerries from internment ...they considered him too old to worry about, kind of like an undersized trout in a patrolled pond, ...but before moustache face, Tojo and Musso were hit for six by Winston, Ike and Uncle Joe, ...is well known. Essentially a Yankee news hound chap wanted Plum to tell the folks back home via wireless how things were in his enforced jerrie internment stay. Anyhow old Plum spun them a humorous yarn, Bertie Wooster stuff, but quite accurate about playing cricket with the other fish and catching up on his writing. Just what he thought his audience would want to hear. Unfortunately stiff upper lips back home in the Old Blightey were not, shall we say, amused, they wanted Luftstalag 17 stuff with Plum digging tunnels and all that. For a while at least our hero was sent to Coventry, without actually ever visiting Coventry. In fact Old Plummy was probably afraid that if he tried to visit Coventry he would have ended up in Dartmoor. Well if you chaps want to read about that Mr. 1984 himself, Georgie Orwell has written all you'd ever want to know about the whole sordid episode. Still Day and Ring shed extra light.Well before I got so rudely interrupted by World War Two, I was telling you how Plum only opened his mouth in interviews to change feet. Well the same bother happened before WW2 when he was interviewed about his Hollywood career. Plum's humorous musings were received like a bally lead balloon by the puffins of Beverley Hills. He damned near had himself run out of town on a rail, at least blackballed from the club by members of the species studio tycoonicus. Anyhow as in all those Wooster books, alls well that ends well of course ...and, as in the damned embarassing business repeated just around closing time for WW number two, Plum did manage to get back into the everyone's good books in Hollywood after a brief enforced hiatus. And he did so just by being Plum. Anyhow it's a shame he didn't have Jeeves to look after him."},{"Title":"Wodehouse In His Own Words","review":"&quot;A collection of quotations from the Master's letters,essays and fiction loosely connected by witty,fact-filled commentary by Barry Day,to form a concise,bried biography...This belongs on the same shelf with &quot;Wodehouse Nuggets&quot; and &quot;The Wodehouse Companion&quot; - except that you will want to keep it by your bedside or carry it around in your pocket.

Horribly enough, this book was the &quot;first&quot; to describe that whole Prague scene. I say horribly, because this book is likable -- but the narrator does nothing unusual, thinks nothing daring -- he more or less transcribes banal journal entries into a long artless book. I could go on about the amatuerish writing style (a good editor would have cut the book to about the length of a Lonely Planet review) -- or about the lazy typesetting (full of typos), and the benefit a little fact checking would've had (it's &quot;Havlova&quot; not &quot;Havelova&quot;, &quot;vul&quot; is &quot;ox&quot; not &quot;bull&quot;, and so on....). It seems this book is the kind that would make a mother proud, but would be met with sneers and jeers by all other &quot;expats.&quot; A lot of them held off writing this kind of book because they were waiting to synthesize and compose artfully from their Czech experience. What we have here, for all its description, is a &quot;nice&quot; American doing &quot;exciting&quot; things in a foreign country. I thought it was hard to get travel writing published, but now I see it doesn't take a hell of a lot of work. The author does nothing original, thinks no original thoughts, and pretty much stole the fire from anyone else who might put out a &quot;real&quot; chronicle of the Prague experience. Too bad."},{"Title":"Pink Tanks and Velvet Hangovers","review":"The first reviewer got it right -- this is an artless and boring book. It totally fails to capture the excitement of the time it's purported to cover -- and contains a great many inaccuracies. The first &quot;half&quot; (I think it's actually less than half) of the book consists of entries from the author's own journal, which he obviously stopped keeping after a very brief period. The second part of the book picks up, chronologically, where the author's meagerly journal left off -- by summarizing the news and events of the period -- in rapid succession and without background information, personal or otherwise. As the author had ceased to keep his journal, this part of the book is sourced from archival stories from the Prague Post. Whether it is from that newspaper or from the author's own misperceptions that the numerous factual errors arise, it makes for a boring and inaccurate read overall."},{"Title":"Pink Tanks and Velvet Hangovers","review":"Because I would be spending a semester studying in Prague, I decided to pick up Douglas Lytle's book. I must say I was very pleased with the results. Lytle writes like a good friend, filling you in on the social and political climate of the country without ever coming off as boring professor. Lytle managed to change my attitude towards Prague (that being from a kid only concerned about partying and going out to someone who is actually concerned and interested in a foreign culture) and for that alone i am gratefull. Lytle is first and foremost a reporter, and that is often revealed in the way he tells his story. All in all, i would label the book essential to anyone planning on spending any significant time in the Czech Republic."},{"Title":"Pink Tanks and Velvet Hangovers","review":"I think the correct review lies somewhere between the worst and best review of this book. It never pretends to give an \\"artful\\" description of the Czech and Slovak transformation after Communism. It is simply a book of a journalist's notes (note the conclusion where he describes looking back on all of his notes from his years in Prague - he never hides this fact).Don't ignore this book simply because you are jealous the writer was published for writing something many of us can and wish we could do. If you are going to be in Prague for some time, it is an eye-opener, especially if you were not there during the transition period. There are probably some ex-pats who could have done it better, but they don't have a book published.The book is a little long. It is organized very haphazardly. There are many annoying typos. But it is a quick read and does contain some interesting bits. I thought some of his personal experiences were interesting and he made some good points. There were other times where I had no clue where he was going with his writing.Bottom line: this is not literary masterpiece, but how many travel journals really are?

Clearly, it is set in the 1950 era and accurately predicts what native Indians would become. This is based on their treatment by others and is far from fictional. The book is filled with black humour and is not a good read in bed at night - it kept me awake when I realised it was all true. At the time the book was written the Indians were becoming aggressive, but Hepworth's prediction that they would become educated and start actions to recover lands they considered stolen and demand better treatment from the government is right on the mark. The book is an historic view of an Indian Reservation and is valuable history. Albert Running up Hill, the principal Indian character goes through the phases of trying to fit into the Indian system, the white system, and finally turns to home again. The management of Indians by the Federal government is disgusting - the idea of cutting a children's surgical waiting list, which is in alphabetical order, down to a third of it's size by just &quot;drawing a line&quot; only emphasizes the aggressive way government bureaucrats operate. The local whites don't come off well in Hepworth's book either, and he has a realism about the Indians themselves who manipulate those whites who try to help them. His stories about the Reservation Priest and his antics on the matress in his ranch wagon shouldn't be a surprise today, although such antics on Reservations have come to light only recently; no one cared about them in the 50's or even at the time Hepworth wrote the book.The story is about Albert's struggle, failure, triumph, but more than anything it is a description of our life and times and shows segments of life we chose to ignore. Like many books about the horrors around us, Hepworth must have felt he had to write this book or die of shame."},{"Title":"Muslims' Place in the American Public Square: Hopes, Fears, and Aspirations","review":"Reading about Muslims in the American public square has always been an interesting topic. Although their presence on American shore presumably began long years before the coming of Columbus, the presence of Muslim in the American public square has only been perceived in the last 50 years. A number of major literatures such as The Muslim of America (1991) edited by Yvonne Y. Haddad, Islam in America: A Sourcebook (1992) edited by Kszegi, Michael A. and J. Gordon Melton, Muslims on the Americanization Path? (1998) edited by Yvonne Y. Haddad and John L. Esposito, Sulayman S. Nyang's Islam in the United States of America (1999), or Jane I. Smith's Islam in America (1999) have explained various aspects of Muslims in America, from the history of the coming of Muslims, to the contemporary issues of theology and the social and political aspirations of Muslims. The research on the topic of Muslim communities itself has became urgent particularly after the unprecedented 9/11 tragedy that impacted not only Muslims and American society in general, but also the whole Muslim world. The questions around hope, fear, and the aspirations of Muslims have been necessary to explain the massive changes in demography and the social circumstance of Muslims in the past few years. This is exactly the purpose of the publication of the book Muslims' Place in the American Public Square; Hope, Fear, and Aspirations (2004).The book, which is edited by Zahid H. Bukhari, Sulayman S. Nyang, Mumtaz Ahmad, and John L. Esposito, is an anthology of research conducted by fourteen scholars from various backgrounds and institutions sponsored by The Project MAPS (Muslims in American Public Square), the research project that is based at the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (CMCU), at Georgetown University, in Washington, DC. The authors of this book, all of them expert in Islamic studies and Muslim society, portray their perspective not only in terms of theoretical analysis but also in critical reflection. As it is also addressed as an effort to synthesize the bulk of literature published by Muslims and non-Muslims, this book has been challenging to read. This is one of the reasons why this book is significant to the on going study of Islam and Muslim societies. In other words, what the authors have expressed in this book is another stage of the development of American Muslim studies, adding up all the efforts and tasks that have been completed by previous literature.The first part of this book, which seems to be the primary message of the book, is addressed to explain the theoretical perspective of Muslims living in America. Four authors, Taha Jabir Al-Alwani, Omar Khalidi, Aminah Beverly McCloud, and M.A. Muqtedar Khan, share their views on how Muslims should live and address their aspirations in the American public square. Taha Jabir Al-Alwani, with his deep experience as a mufti and the president of the Fiqh Council of North America, proposed an idea that Muslims must create new ijtihad (independent reasoning), so that all the basic ethics and theology of Islam may be relevant to the current condition of Muslims. There is no doubt that American Muslims have found themselves under conditions and circumstances that are radically different from what existed at the time of the Prophet and from all the contemporary Muslim societies outside the country. What becomes a demand today is how to resolve the gap between the traditional formulation of Islamic theology and law and the current circumstances of Muslim communities living in America. In answering that question, Al-Alwani describes methodological principles of studying Al-Qur'an that may assist Muslims to understand the exact purpose of the Al-Qur'an. For Al-Alwani, the lives of Muslims as minorities need a new development of fiqh that is fully aware of their environment and their cultural and social surrounding. Al-Alwani does not agree with the reproduction of old fatwa in contemporary language or of using current vernacular. Instead, what is necessary for Muslims today is \\"original interpretations that respond to the problem of minorities in a way that is free of the negative effects that are usually associated with the fiqh of expediency or crises\\" (33).The more specific explanation of Muslims living in a pluralistic society is stated by Omar Khalidi. He elaborates the experience of Muslims living in certain areas such as Spain, India, Russia and the Balkans. After reviewing the classical thought of Islam and Muslim society from various scholars, he comes to the conclusion that Muslims can and should be able to live in harmony with predominantly non-Muslim environments. The old distinction of the land between dar al-Islam and dar al-hard, or the realms of peace and the realms of war, is no longer acceptable, for both are relative in its usage. Thus, in the context of Muslims in America today, there would be no other choice for Muslims except to live peacefully anywhere they have chosen to live in this country. Implicitly, Khalidi states that whatever the situation faced by Muslims, this country is much better to live in, given the unfortunate situation in almost the entire Muslim world today. To Khalidi, the next agenda that Muslims should be aware of is how to formulate their participation and their political program. The fact that American Muslims are diverse in ethnic and national background may, of course, make the task difficult. For this situation, Muslims should struggle in finding a balance between the necessity of their participation on the national agenda and their specific communal issues or local interests.Aminah Beverly McCloud and M.A. Muqtedar Khan, who write the two articles in the last part of the first topic, explore the problem of Muslim immigrants and their new environment in the United States. Restating the main idea of the first two chapters, McCloud urges that Muslims must engage in and involve themselves in their American communities, and at the same time put aside the different self-concerns of each Muslim community. McCloud reminds the leader that the long concern of Muslim immigrants toward their old countries is an unfinished passion, and useless, an activity that separates them from American community. Furthermore, she also argues that failure to understand their new community may create problems, and as a result, they might be considered ineffective citizens in this country.The very question of how to be effective citizens is exactly what Muqtedar Khan means by defining a so-called \`American Muslim identity.' Looking back to the classical antagonism of Samuel Huntington's clash of civilizations, Khan actually wants to build a new consciousness that Muslims in America are not the same condition as Muslims outside the Western world. Muslims living in America are American Muslims who definitely share the same faith with all fellows Muslims (Muslim ummah) but more focus on building community inside America. Khan explains that there are two images of America in Muslim minds today: \\"America the democracy,\\" and \\"America the colonial power.\\" Khan himself, to the best of my knowledge from reading his articles, seems to promote the first image. He is one among Muslims who considers America as their homeland. However, he also does not deny the fact that there is a group of Muslims who reject the idea of assimilation of Muslims into American society. He also laments that this group of Muslims has spent huge energy on harassing their fellow Muslims who try to bridge the gap between Islam and the West. Khan questions, \\"What does it mean to have a balanced view of the West? It means that we do not throw out the baby with the bath water\\" (108). Moreover, he argues; \\"Because Muslims are upset that the U.S. has chosen to be friends with Israel and not with the Arabs, just because the U.S. has committed crimes against Iraqi children, we must not reject democracy, human right, respect for freedom, and the rule of law\\" (108). It is time for Muslims to stop their uncritical prejudices toward America. Instead, Khan argues, American Muslims today should become \`the first hand' in interpreting what the West really is and should not support the opinion of the old divergence between Islam and the West made by the Muslims who have no experience living in American society.Another helpful part of this book is the study of Christian and American Muslim relation written by Jane I. Smith in chapter 7. Her well-known expertise on Christians-Muslims encounters has made this book rich with reflections on the subject. Smith concisely explores models of dialog or engagement that have characterized Christian-American Muslim relations. One model that she mentions in her explanation is \\"the theological exchange model,\\" the model that is feared by some Muslims as another effort of Christian evangelization of Muslims. Although many Muslim leaders tend to avoid it, this model is important given the fact that both Christians and Muslims still do not know the elements of others' faith. Muzammil Siddiqi, the former president of the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) is one of those who support this model. Another fascinating type of encounter between Muslims and Christians is \\"the ethical exchange model.\\" The advocates of this model, most notably Ismail al-Faruqi, believe that the arena for discussion between Muslims and Christians is not theology but ethics. The proponents of this model are convinced that Muslims and Christians can provide the common solution of various ethical problems that haunt American society. In brief, Smith mentions that there is no question that most Muslims who have chosen to participate in dialog have found it beneficial. However, she also explores several crucial problems of which Muslims should be aware. Despite the fact that many Muslims still continue to suspect that Christians have an agenda of converting them away from Islam, Muslims do not seem to have developed a conceptual framework for dialog. Quoting Imam Ahmad Chebli, with whom she corresponded, Smith writes \\"up to today we do not have any by-laws or constitution or guidelines for dialog. We just come together and decide to talk about this and that\\" (178). In addition, another problem comes up because of the lack of understanding among various Muslim communities, and as a result, \\"many Muslims are concerned that the dialogue is dominated by particular groups of Muslims\\" (180). The complex disparity between Muslims from South Asia, Arabs, and African American, Sunni and Shia, has forced the process of dialog to be sensitive to the different perspectives among Muslims, which is actually a good thing. However, this situation often creates another problem, as she notes, referring to Sheikh Ibrahim Nejm, \\"when immigrant and African American Muslims participate together in a dialog session, it often turns into a debate rather than a dialogue, or more specifically a subdebate within the overall conversation\\" (182). Over all, although Smith does not come up with a new idea for the development of interfaith dialog, her reflections in this book may become advantageous in directing where American Muslims must address their concerns and aspirations.What is also distinctive in the study of American Muslims is the relation of Islam to the Black experience that has become an inseparable experience of African American Muslims. In explaining the complex experience of African American Muslims, this book elucidates the matters broadly in the third part, where three scholars from three different backgrounds combine their arguments. One of the scholars, Sherman A. Jackson, an African American Muslim, describes Islam among African Americans and argues that Black religion has a central influence on the heart of African American Muslims. Black religion is the instrument in which the religious message of justice and equality is combined with the radical opposition to racial oppression as the ruin of slavery. This is the exceptional situation that has characterized African American Muslims, when compared to all immigrant Muslims from all over the world. Jackson also notes the general admiration for Noble Drew Ali and Elijah Muhammad who, he argues, rendered a \`psychological space' through which millions of African American would later convert, or specifically, \`reinvented' Islam, this despite the fact that the majority of Muslims would not consider Drew Ali and Elijah Muhammad as preaching the mainstream Islam. Had the Islam introduced to the African American been \`the mainstream immigrant' Islam from which the Black oppressed experience was absent, the African American would probably not have been interested in it.The last part of this book that may lift up its value and make it required reading not only for students, policy makers, or journalists, but also for Muslim leaders is written by Ilyas Ba-Yunus and Kassim Kone. In their research, the two authors questioned the existing literature of demography of American Muslims conducted by previous researchers. What they found and present in this book is fresh data on the social composition of Muslim communities and where they primarily live. They estimate that those of Arab origin are the largest group of Muslims in America, followed by those of African American and South Asian origin. Another smaller composition of Muslims varies among Muslims from Turkey, the Balkans, Indonesia, and Iran. In recent years, they also describe, Muslims are not only living in metropolitan areas such as New York City and Detroit, but are starting to spread into smaller towns and suburban areas. This situation confirms that American Muslims are not only crowding into the corners of metropolitan areas, but are also showing a growing interest in acquiring more professional jobs across the country.At the end of this book, Ihsan Bagby and Iqbal J. Unus, who conducted research on the presence of mosques and Muslim community organizations, conclude that the past majority of American Muslims have already become involved and have fully participated in the American public square and social activities. Iqbal J. Unus, who specifically focuses on the role of Muslims organization, states that the presence of Muslims in community organizations, including the leadership structure of the mosque, has changed what was the traditional organization. Muslim community organizations have transformed their instruments of decision making from unstructured systems to more transparent and accountable organizations, where membership and leadership are more structured.Having explained the content of the Muslims' Place in the American Public Square, it can be concluded that this book has shown how far Muslims have come in playing their role and in forming their identity in the plurality of American Society. As in the foregoing paragraph stated by the authors, the problems and responsibilities of Muslims still need more attention, ranging from the need to explore fiqh or theology of Islam in the context of American society and to grapple with the problem of divergence of Muslim communities, to the need to build a new identity for Muslims living in America. This book has also shown another major fact that Muslims can live and participate in the public square of a secular democratic country without sacrificing their faith as Muslims. Instead, the freedom of religion that is guaranteed by the Constitution has helped Muslim communities and all their religious institutions to flourish, a situation that is far better than what Muslims have experienced in the undemocratic regimes in their old countries. Last of all, this book is necessary, not only for Muslims living in America and the Western countries, but also for Muslims all over the world. What the book has shown is a sincere reflection for all Muslims living in the Muslim world to learn from their fellows living in the West."},{"Title":"The Definitive Guide to How Computers Do Math : Featuring the Virtual DIY Calculator","review":"The book is aimed at people starting out in computers; we experts know this stuff cold. But an interested 15 year old could get truly in-depth insight into the mysteries of computing from this volume.It's a very readable book laid out with easy-on-the-eyes formatting and a plethora of clear illustrations. The illustration of a LIFO stack just booms clarity. Chapters start with relevant and often amusing quotes; one of my favorites is Lewis Carroll's \\"The four branches of arithmetic: ambition, distraction, uglification, and derision.\\"Quickly page through the book and you'll be puzzled by its organization. The first 55 pages (out of 450) comprise its ostensible meat. The rest are labs for each chapter, a series of problems the authors pose to illustrate important concepts. They nudge you through the solutions - there are no proofs left to the confused student.The labs are very well-written accessible activities in which the authors take the reader along hand-in-hand. They're a bit insidious: work through them and the reader will become a reasonably competent assembly-language programmer, without realizing he's learning one of the more difficult aspects of programming. There's a perverse genius in covertly slipping assembly language into one's head without pain.The authors' sure hands guide one along each lab, with descriptions and demonstrations till the code that's required is almost anticlimactic: \\"of *course* it must be like this!\\"But how is one to do a lab? You need a computer, right? Well, sure, but the authors provide a DIY Calculator on CD, an interactive and sophisticated bit of code that runs on a PC. It sports the usual display and math functions, plus its own low-level programming language. And, it's extensible. The companion website (http://www.diycalculator.com/aboutdiy.shtml ) contains plenty of downloadable extension code, plus the calculator itself. Like open source advocates they hope the community will contribute to the set of routines.The web site also has a fabulous background to the field of computing (http://www.diycalculator.com/cool.shtml#PhyVer ) that, if you're a computer history buff, will suck you in and surely doom the schedule of whatever product you're working on now.Where too many computer books have a dreary chapter about number systems, \\"How Computers Do Math\\" cover the subject in an entertaining and very complete fashion.

Kennedy and the Struggle for Black Equality","review":"This book is one of the more objective books about President Kennedy. It explores his seemingly lackadaisical attitude in re civil rights. He is described as being charismatic, yet lacking in personal depth. He was excellent at taking written material, courtesy of his speech/script writers and giving an outstanding performance.This is not to discredit the man's obvious intelligence and ability to respond to the issues and questions of the day. His alliances with people who were known segregationists don't exactly point him in the direction of civil rights activists. His brother, then attorney general Robert Kennedy was the fire, the drive, the passion and commitment to civil rights.While the civil rights/racial equality issue is the main focus of this book, other issues during the New Frontier are also explored. This is a well written book that will certainly maintain the interest of readers."},{"Title":"The Bystander: John F. Kennedy and the Struggle for Black Equality","review":"Most of Kennedy's biographers fall into two camps; hagiographers like Goodwin and Schlesinger and dozens of others, or much more honest examinations of the character of the man like Thomas Reeves very good book. The hags have outnumbered the wags by at least ten to one, but this book is a good addition to the latter camp.This way-too-long book has many good examples of how JFK really did not have some burning commitment to civil rights (or much of anything else for that matter) and was really a fairly shallow man with good speech writers who could turn a phrase and have Kennedy deliver it with passion. His willingness to appoint segregationists such as William Cox to the federal bench and his friendships with Senate bigots such as Al Gore Sr. and Bill Clinton's hero, William Fulbright, shows him to be far less the advocate of civil rights than his hagiographers have made him out to be.Much of this book is focused on the civil rights for blacks movement, but there are some good insights into other issues that were front and center at the time."},{"Title":"The Bystander: John F. Kennedy and the Struggle for Black Equality","review":"An interesting look at the junior JFK and how he shaped his view of the Black community and his understanding of how to move up in politics."},{"Title":"The Bystander: John F. Kennedy and the Struggle for Black Equality","review":"This is solid history. It is a fair and careful account of JFK's failure to pursue a civil rights agenda. It is the very opposite of a hatchet job: the author makes every attempt to look at events from President Kennedy's standpoint, but concludes that JFK dropped the ball. This should not be surprising: JFK was the sort of politician who once gave an empassioned speech to farmers in West Virginia and then said to an aide with a grin \\"FFN\\" (meaning \\"f*ck the farmers after November\\").What's interesting about this book is the way the political Left has either ignored it or unfairly attacked it. Unable or unwilling to come to grips with its past, the Left provides no guidance for those who take up the torch. Enamored of their charismatic Presidents, Democrats make no demands on them, either while they are in office or afterwards, when they are of mere historical interest. The result is that they are willing to overlook the clay feet of their heroes and underrate the achievements of their Presidents with less charm but more substance.The tragedy of the Democrats is that with every election, they get more frustrated at their lack of success (even when they win), but are absolutely clueless why that is so. Their idolization of JFK (and lack of respect for honest and accomplished books like this) ought to show them why, but never will."},{"Title":"The Bystander: John F. Kennedy and the Struggle for Black Equality","review":"This was not an easy book to complete over a short period, but there are numerous pages of detailed information that need not be read for memorization. The writer is meticulous in documenting examples and events to base his reasons for writing this book.The writer's premise, as seen in the title of the book, is that President Kennedy did little to advance civil rights, or more fairly stated, he did far less than for what he is historically credited.There are several problems with the author's thesis. First, the issue of Kennedy's civil rights record has been discussed by civil rights historians for decades. I remember it from college in the 1970's. Therefore, there is nothing new in this lengthy text.Secondly, the author misrepresents Kennedy's civil rights record. In one of the more damning sections, the author discusses Kennedy's soft response to the murder of four school girls in Birmingham, Alabama on 15 September 1963.The author notes that the president did issue a statement condemning the action, but believes that Kennedy should have more aggressively attacked the murder. It is true that one cannot be too severe in condemning one of the most heinous crimes of this era, but the author's accusation should be considered in the context of what Kennedy did do after this incident. For example, on 19 September 1963, Kennedy met with Dr. King and other civil rights leaders to discuss the Birmingham crisis. On the 23rd, he met with Birmingham civic leaders and clergy leaders.In October, Kennedy obtained a renewal of the Civil Rights Commission. On another day, he met with Congressional leaders from both parties to agitate for an agreement on the Civil Rights Bill. The next day, he met with other legislative leaders to discuss civil rights legislation. On 29 October, he discusses civil rights legislation with his advisers. The next day, he addresses a Democratic Party Executive Committee Dinner in Philadelphia, with his primary topic is civil rights.During this same time after the Birmingham murders, Kennedy successfully negotiated a ratification of the first nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviets; he begins the push for a major tax reduction bill; approves the withdrawal of 1,000 American advisors from Vietnam; and dealt with the coup of the South Vietnam president. Two months after Birmingham, Kennedy was dead. So where is the criticism?The impatience for civil rights was and still is understandable. Kennedy did not enter office with this as his primary issue of domestic concern (tax cuts held this position) and he may have been pragmatic to a fault. The author, though, fails to appreciate other facts about the president. Even if Kennedy did not lead the way, his presence and comments about equality and justice in general did inspire many into civil rights action (e.g., James Meredith). This more than any of his many other civil rights accomplishments (and there are many to choose) earn him high honors."},{"Title":"The Bystander: John F. Kennedy and the Struggle for Black Equality","review":"I came to this book from the standpoint of an observer with a general interest in American politics and history rather than from a purely academic standpoint.I have enjoyed it immensely having found it both detailed and informative reflecting exhaustive research. Nick Bryant gives a real insight into how civil rights fitted into the wider political ambitions of the Kennedy machine. Would Kennedy once in office be as true to the civil rights cause as his pre-election manoeuvrings suggested and if so, when, and what would be the catalyst? It is this question that made the book a real page-turner."},{"Title":"Loci Communes 1543","review":"Marin Luther, Reformer, Husband, Theologian, Doctor of the Church and so much more. His writings, thinking, and volumes of work were tremendous, but often his thoughts and works were above the reach of the common folk of his day. Even many pastors today find his writings hard to connect to the person in the pew. Philipp Melanchthon was a student, companion, and colleague of Luther's and spent many of his days taking the brilliant writings and Tabletalks of Martin Luther and making them pastoral in nature, reachable for the common people of their day, and useful for teaching in lectures, sermons, and the home. History can attribute to Philipp Melanchthon the role of assimilating the works of Martin Luther and making them usable by every pastor and teacher of the Word of God. He had a pastor's heart, whereas Luther was a scholar. (See the excellent book \\"Pastor as Scholar and Scholar as Pastor\\" by John Piper and D.A. Carson). This book takes the great teachings and theological studies of Martin Luther and redevelops them for the Christian community. Truly, a resource every pastor and Bible needs (matched as a companion volume to the two volume work of Martin Chemnitz entitled, \\"Loci Theologici.\\")"},{"Title":"CHAMPION OF THE DEAD","review":"This is a great book for those who want a hands-on ancient Athens experience. If you're looking for literary immersion, which feeds you the sights, sounds and smells that make you feel you are actually in the Agora market place, the everyman's sparring gym and establishments that range from a brothel to most elite homes of the city, this is your book. Hatten is *extremely* knowledgeable of the setting, customs and period. Though his attention to detail may very briefly seem daunting for non-&quot;Greek geeks&quot;, like myself, this passes very quickly. The author clearly explains his references in a subtle, non-condescending type of way. What also makes this book intriguing is that the protagonist, Idas, is a metic (half-citizen), though well educated and a successful merchant. This status, however, allows him to acquaint and involve himself with a wide breadth of characters, from the privileged to servant class, which makes for very interesting reading.As for plot, Idas is a very honorable man, whose objective is to seek the killer of his boxing mentor and idol Lamachus, the Champion of Athens. In the process of his quest, Idas discovers that his hero was not quite as noble as his faade implied and wrestles with the ideas of both political and personal motives for the murder. I highly recommend this book, particularly for those who love historical fiction."},{"Title":"CHAMPION OF THE DEAD","review":"The cosmopolitan nature of Athens with its sea port of Piraeus provide the stage for open fights and the knife in the dark.

Inas is assisted by an old scholar, Thales, who strikes a bargain with Inas to serve as his house slave and helps the hero to understand the intrigues and politics at play.The drums of war can be heard in the distance...will an injustice in Athens set fire to the Peloponnese? Will the Furies challenge Athena?"},{"Title":"CHAMPION OF THE DEAD","review":"This book took me back to early days of summer reading, when life was full of meaning and potential, and each classic became a path to discovery. The history in this novel is rich and mysterious, an alien world to my own, but handled with such integrity that it became easy to adopt Idas as a hero.All those who are curious about the Greek culture will revel in the detailed descriptions. I am giving it four stars because of a slight verbal tightness at the start. It was a joyful and informative book."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci (vols. 1 & 2)","review":"Leonardo's curiosity and inventiveness are on display throughout this work.

The first is the enormous amount of references to manuscripts. In the reading they have annotations which point to the back where the manuscripts are listed, but this creates confusion while reading, since many of the references are not well known. The other downside is the lack of illustrations. Even though there are a couple integrated into the writing, Leonardo was known for his many sketches, and the lack of these leaves the reader with a sense of emptiness for Leonardo's thoughts.

If you ever wondered what Leonardo thought, then these are the books to get.

In those words are written of Leonardo's philisophical ideas, lives of where he lived and his surroundings, his theories on color, perspective, proportion, architecture, foliage, physiology and so many other things that the Great One was curious about. Througout the book and amidst the text are Leonardos sketches, thumbnail sketches, workings of famous pieces such as the Last Supper, some anatomical drawings - and in those pages you can see Leonardo's handwriting which he tended to write backwards. The value and reference is endless, especially for the artist.

There is little doubt he often took credit for those working under him, and showed a bent at making the Brady name linger in history as the first to photograph a war from beginning to end. But that question pushed aside, forget who took what pictures, unless arguing that particular point, and simply sit back and get blown away by the sheer numbers of photos! Over 500 pages (often with half a dozen or more photos per page) of portraits, landscapes and even some illustrations in colour plates, this is a wonderful companion to the writings of Bruce Catton or Henry Steele Commanger.Instead of just reading about the people and places that were the stage of the War Between the States, see them! Pictures of People, informal and formal portraits, pictures of encampments, riverboats, fortifications, bridges, of troops and the bloody aftermath of war. Brady and his contemporaries were often accused of 'stage' pictures, but it does not take away the power to move you. It was sad, 'the battles lost' often depicted Confederate dead, showing a distinct bias to further to belief the Union was invincible and the South doomed.Regardless of the taint or copyright/ownership of the period, regardless of the yellow journalism of staging the photos, you cannot deny the value to casual historians, to writer of the period or to people wishes to see these places and the people that created some of the bloodies battles in history.A wonderful collection."},{"Title":"MATHEW BRADY'S ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR.","review":"Matthew Brady's photos are fabulous, but the &quot;history&quot; by Benson Lossing is dreadful at best. It's evident that Lossing was a rabid Union sympathizer and not a soldier, and that he only interviewed high-ranking Unionists after the war for his &quot;research.&quot; Among the phony jewels: Lincoln's assassination was a massive plot led by Jefferson Davis; Union prisoners of war were deliberately mistreated while Confederates were well-fed and housed by their captors; Jefferson Davis was gently treated after his arrested and housed in (quote) comfortable quarters during his captivity instead of the rancid, wet cell that Northern and Southern people alike criticized; no atrocities were ever committed by Union generals such as Sherman. Don't even think of using this for your book report!"},{"Title":"MATHEW BRADY'S ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR.","review":"The most annoying this about this collection is the lack of index, which turned out to be incredibly annoying."},{"Title":"MATHEW BRADY'S ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR.","review":"I always enjoy collecting photos of the civil war, wherever they may be found.This book combines them to a great degree. Lossing's book is told from his personal perspective using first or second hand knowledge, acquired during his lifetime. This in itself is useful information but can be limited.We should rememeber that in his day open debates by politicians were attened by large audiences and widely covered ver batim in the press. So he could experience much first hand. He is a Union biased writer, of course.But because the story comes so soon after the war it cannot contain all of the authentic records which would make it more reliable. In that regard it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. I was intruiqed by two observations made by Lossing which have lead to further investigation. The first was that the legislators in England were ending slavery there and in the colonies by legislation,and that that legislation may have played a role in the southern colonists' desire to be free from England.It gives them as much a merchantile reason as the reasons offered by New Englanders. Was it a real role? That is a question I have not asked before now. A book does exist on the very subject by two law professors. The second suggestion is that the Southern sympathizers worked in tandem for 20 years to seperate the states from the Union becasue they viewed northerners as both boors and certainbly beneath them, and also becasue they wished that the consitutional guarantees of protection of slavery were eternal and should be preserved. I find that collusion theory of 20 years hard to accept . However, Lossing does quote from many southern legislative meetings to give a real sense of the fervor of the \\"hotheads\\" and their zeal to inflame their less powerful southen countrymen towards rebellion, or seperation- if you will. I believe there is good evidence that the south was not uniform in its opinion of the need for succession.Take West Virginia as a n example, and there are many others. Lessing's point that the population never directly voted for succession is a powerful argument to that end. I did not read the narratives of the war period itself, as this history is covered by so many other historians who have the advantage hindsight and better documentation on their side.Overall, there is much to thinking about in his story, a commercial enterprise for sure. The mass of photos are well presented.."},{"Title":"MATHEW BRADY'S ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR.","review":"Im not a big history buff, but my moth inlaw will love this as a present for her coffee table.

In this third novel in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series, Anne Perry seems to find her footing more effectively in Victorian England than in either of the two previous books, The Cater Street Hangman and Callander Square, and surpasses the usual costume mystery.A 17-year-old woman is raped and murdered . . . dying in the arms of her sister-in-law. Thomas Pitt is assigned to investigate. Matters are complicated by the victim having just returned from visiting Pitts' sister-in-law's house . . . making his brother-in-law a possible suspect.As in Callander Square, the investigation soon begins to take its toll on the haughty heads of the houses on Paragon Walk.Once again, Charlotte is able to work on the investigation by insinuating herself into the social lives of the walk's residents through her sister's introductions.The solution of the mystery is a fair one, built up logically from all of the clues.The story itself moves along fairly nicely, and the book can be read in one pleasant sitting if you are in a hurry. Or you can spread it out if you prefer.The book still lacks enough action, and the pace of the plot and character developments will strike most people as slow. As a result, this book will be best liked by those who are drawn to the verbal warfare that's often found in Victorian drawing room novels."},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"This is the third in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series. It's been two years since their marriage, and I like the way their relationship has grown. Charlotte's simple but happy life is seen here against her sister's more affluent lifestyle.

Makes me want to read the next one."},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"This is the third book in the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt series and it is up to Anne Perry's usual excellent standard. The plot is first-rate as are the characters. The only complaint I have about this book is that I would like to have found out more about Paul Alaric by the end of the book. I had the feeling throughout the book that we would eventually find out that he was not what he seemed but we never did. However, this didn't keep me from devouring the story and thoroughly enjoying it!"},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"If you like Victorian cozies and lovable characters, this book is for you. With the third in the Pitt series, the author, Anne Perry hits her stride. The story begins with a body in the morgue. The victim is slight, delicately featured, beautifully dressed, her arms bruised, her face barely touched by life. Fanny Nash is seventeen when she is stabbed and raped in Paragon Walk, a London neighborhood of impeccable pedigree, and the neighborhood, as luck would have it, of Charlotte's sister, Emily, and her husband, Lord Ashworth.Pitt is called in to to investigate. In so doing, he scrapes the surface of society--the inhabitants, their servants, their families--revealing their stories, their guilt, their secrets, their relationships with one another, their pompous ill regard for most everyone else. Ms Perry lays bare the hypocrisy at the heart of Victorian society, the theme at the heart of this intricately plotted, beautifully and accurately detailed novel. You won't want it to end, but end it does, just after the mystery is solved.A recurring character in the Pitt series, Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould, makes her first appearance in this novel. A favorite of many readers, this one included, she happens to be staying with Emily and George in their Paragon Walk townhouse. Beautifully attired, outspoken, witty, she serves, perhaps, as the author's point of view, but certainly as a delightful deus ex machina in this, as well as in subsequent novels in the series. One of her more envious characteristics is that she doesn't age. About \\"seventy or eighty\\" in Paragon Walk, she approaches seventy in Treason in Lisson Grove which takes place almost fifteen years later. Cumming-Gould, you go, girl!"},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"Fanny Nash, a young girl experiencing her first London social season, dies in her sister-in-law's arms in their home on fasionable Paragon Walk. Shy, childlike Fanny has been raped and stabbed. As Inspector Thomas Pitt begins investigating, the residents of Paragon Walk greet him with mixed feelings. They are terrified that a killer may be living among them; for as much as they want to believe a passing outsider committed the crime, they know that to be unlikely. Yet this investigation, like many others in Pitt's career, uncovers secrets that the Walk's folk definitely do not want known by anybody. It also creates conflicts where none existed before, and brings conflicts long hidden into the open. The only Paragon Walk resident who really wants Pitt there is his sister-in-law, Lady Emily Ashworth, who married as far above her birth as her sister Charlotte married below it in choosing Pitt. As they have before, Ellison sisters Charlotte and Emily combine forces and work as discreetly as they can (or imagine that they can) to satisfy their curiosity about the case. And, just maybe, to help Thomas solve it.Once again Anne Perry offers a penetrating analysis of Victorian culture by using the differing viewpoints of Charlotte and Thomas Pitt, as well as those of other characters, to illuminate that culture from differing social levels. The bored upper class and the often desperate lower classes have far more in common than either could imagine - and, as usual, when the mystery resolves it does so in a foreshadowed yet surprising way. This is the kind of book that forces me to keep reading far into the night!--Reviewed by Nina M.

I found the story line fun and I enjoy seeing Emily and Charlotte getting along. I think Emily could be a really good society sluth since she can think so well with them. As usual Thomas goes along and slowing but surely puts the pieces together. I knew though that Charlotte was going to be the one to solve it, either deducing it or being a potential victim.

But on the whole it was a good read."},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"Although I am a huge fan of Perry -- both the Pitt series and the darker William Monk series -- this one had such an obvious plot flaw from the very beginning I was disappointed.

Then her somewhat smart-mouthed brother disappears, to be found later stuffed up a chimney. Pitt has to solve the crimes before Society freaks out completely, while also trying to clear Emily's husband of her suspicions. While Perry once again is devastating in her depiction of the Victorian upper middle classes and their preoccupation with manners, clothing, and withdrawing room gossip, the mystery plot is not as satisfactory in its conclusion."},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"Third in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt Victorian mystery series revolving around Inspector Thomas Pitt and his very curious wife Charlotte.My TakeWhile a young girl is murdered, the emphasis is on how it will affect everyone else socially with a number of the neighbors putting all the blame on the girl. Well, obviously she must have had low morals to have invited rape! How do people actually twist their minds to believe something like this? They are like a snarling pack of dogs. Ooh, that's rather mean. To the dogs, anyway.Of course, the unlucky Frenchman living in the neighborhood is the object of all the ladies' interests but the first one at whom the neighbors point a finger. Everyone kept mentioning the Dilbridges' peculiar social tastes but no one ever comes out and explains what those tastes are. Why would Pitt avoid looking into this?Perry makes an interesting point that \\"Without the discipline of work, they had invented the discipline of etiquette\\". It's true, the upper classes' lives were so boring that they had to create something at which to work. What better than manners so they would have something to occupy their minds as well as a stick to poke at everyone else.Perry has another passage that I thought was very good on the definition of rape versus love. Charlotte points out that\\"A strong man, a man who is capable of caring, does not force a woman. He takes love as it is offered, knowing that that which is demanded has no meaning. The essence of strength is not in overpowering others, but in mastering oneself.\\" While Emily is thinking more of the physical act itself. That Selena's rape is more acceptable in Selena's mind because to lie willingly is wrong but to be a victim is an excuse and having the best of both worlds: innocent of the guilt and yet having the pleasure.I rather like discovering how Charlotte is adapting to her new life: learning to cook, getting on with the neighbors, dealing with her child on her own. She's doing a lovely job of it. Then there's Emily coping with George's infidelity; quite subtle and very effective.The StoryA young woman, Fanny Nash, comes staggering across the threshold of her brother's home. Raped and stabbed! The weeks go by and the police remain baffled and in the meantime, Charlotte spends more and more of her time attempting to help her sister Emily discover \\"who dun it\\" and in the process discovers more than she wanted to know about her husband and the neighbors in Paragon Walk while we can enjoy our distance from their rapier-like tongues.It's the discovery of another body that sets everything spinning to the ultimate conclusion after a few red herrings. There certainly was a great deal more going on underneath the surface than the Pitts or Lady Emily ever suspected!The CharactersInspector Thomas Pitt is as disheveled as ever while Charlotte is still attempting to conquer cooking. Their daughter, Jessamine, is teething. Together they meet George's Great Aunt Vespasia Cummings-Gold for the first time. I do like Aunt Vespasia! Mrs. Smith across the way helps Charlotte by watching Jessamine when Charlotte goes off sleuthing.A pregnant Lady Emily Ashworth begs Charlotte for help and support as Pitt investigates her own neighbors on Paragon Walk. Lord George Ashworth has his own secrets to keep.Fanny Nash is the 17-year-old half-sister of Diggory, Afton, and Fulton Nash. She lived with Diggory and his wife Jessamyn and was engaged to Algernon Burnon. The night Fanny was murdered, Lord and Lady Dilbridge were holding a party.

Have read everything she has written and am always waiting for her next one. Suspenseful, so Victorian, and captivating story"},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"Charlotte and Thomas Pitt are back investigating murder. This time a young woman has been raped and murdered in Paragon Walk, a fashionable London street that happens to be home to Charlotte's sister Emily. Charlotte and Emily decide to investigate. As Charlotte has married down and become a policeman's wife, Emily will have to dress Charlotte back up as the fashionable lady she once was.This book seemed to be more social interaction and less crime-solving. Charlotte and Emily spend most of their time attending social functions and gossiping. It seems that Perry really wanted to spend more time commenting on social life and customs than to write a mystery. Undoubtedly the bitchy social interaction is amusing. It's a backstabbing, every woman for herself arena, where Victorian manners and their transgressions are on full display. Still, I really wanted more mystery. I hope Perry returns to more mystery in the next volume of the series."},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"These Pitt books are in no way great literature. But they're fun to read and keep me turning the pages. I've read the first three and will probably, in time, read them all, in between reading other things. I enjoy the picture of Victorian London which they present, including descriptions of the gorgeous clothes the leisure-class ladies wore. Anne Perry always drops little hints about who the killer might be, which makes it fun."},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"love Anne Perry books and this one is a joy to add to my bookshelf! not a hardcover but hardly any wear at all!"},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"I am a huge fan of the Inspector Monk series which I honestly still prefer. However, the Pitt novels are equally good, well written and interesting in their period detail. My only slightly negative comment is the lack of detail regarding the Pitts themselvves, their relationship, etc. I can't feel as much empathy for Pitt as you do for Monk with his history. So if you enjoy this series do check out Inspector Monk as well - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"This is not Anne Perry at her best. The characters' motivations don't quite hold together, the plot is a bit shaky, there should have been some thorough editing/proof reading.But Anne Perry, even when not at the top of her form, is still eminently readable; her gift of words never fails to amuse, intrigue, entertain."},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"I really enjoy the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels. They are all easily read mysteries with a little victorian history thrown in. No graphic violence or language so anyone can read them without offense."},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"I like murder mysteries. I blame it on the fact that, at the age of eleven, I stumbled upon an Agatha Christie novel in my parents' basement on a rainy day and passed the afternoon completely engrossed by murder. Years later, it's still my favorite genre. I particularly enjoy reading mysteries that take place in another historical period, especially those with female protagonists. It seems then, that Anne Perry's \\"Paragon Walk\\" would fit all my needs. Unfortunately, it doesn't.\\"Paragon Walk\\" is the third novel in Perry's Charlotte and Thomas Pitt mystery series, and like the previous two, it focuses on a crime committed in an upscale London neighborhood. Young Fanny Nash has been found raped and murdered, and Inspector Pitt has been assigned the case. Not only is it in a fashionable neighborhood that thumbs their noses at a commoner like a policeman, but Pitt's sister-in-law, Lady Emily Ashworth, was one of the last people to see poor Fanny alive. With the unsolicited help of both Emily and Thomas's wife, Charlotte, the two ladies set out to find the killer, hoping against hope that the grisly deed has nothing to do with Emily's husband, George. Sadly for them, one crime quickly leads to another when Fanny's brother Fulbert goes missing. Shortly after, another woman is attacked on the streets, and the police are still no further to finding the killer. It seems that that task is going to fall to Emily and Charlotte.As many professional reviewers have pointed out, Perry's novels provide a unique look into the social customs of Victorian England. However, after the third one, I'm getting bored. This featured very little crime-solving and Thomas was almost one of the side characters. I would have loved to have seen more of George Ashworth's crotchety old Aunt Vespasia, who was, by far, the book's most interesting character. And I would really like to see a different plot. This is the third straight time Perry has used this same scenario - string of horrifying murders/crimes in an upscale London neighborhood, police shut out because of their social standing, the ladies uncovering the killer due to their social abilities - and it's getting old. These characters could be used in a variety of unique ways, and Perry seems set on simply writing the same novel over and over. And, once again, there are virtually no clues for the reader to follow and the killer is caught on pretty much the last page. I like resolution in my stories, a bit of falling action, the \\"what happened after...\\" bits that come in the closing of a book. These seem to simply stop.Overall, while \\"Paragon Walk\\" was certainly a decent book, it did become difficult for me to finish. There are simply too many characters, most of whom aren't fleshed out enough to make them memorable, and it is a plot I have seen twice before with her novels. I'm currently undecided as to whether or not I will tackle the series' fourth book."},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"Anne Perry's series about Charlotte and Thomas Pitt is the most refreshing series I have ever read. Charlotte is a lovable character, and I find myself thinking, &quot;What would Charlotte do in this situation?&quot; I love how she deals with the snobbish upper class in this Victorian murder mystery. The killer always surprises me at the end because he or she is never who I expect. I love to sit down and read these thoughtful, yet quick, mysteries. I can't wait to read the next one in the series!"},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"This is the third book in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels by Anne Perry and I am very glad to be able to give an enthusiastic five stars as my opinion of this offering.As a fan of these Victorian era mysteries I had wondered how Ms Perry was going to proceed with the investigative directions of Charlotte and Thomas. Now, after reading three, I feel that I have a better handle on which role will be played by each character and were they fit into the overall scheme of the books. The actual plot of the book has been very well described in other reviews. I enjoyed this title because it gave almost equal roles to Thomas, Charlotte and Emily. The residents of Paragon Walk were so fully developed and wonderfully rounded out that I began to think of them as real people. Perhaps there was a degree of closeness there which began to feel slightly artificial but it was a necessary part of the whole in order to make the ending believable. Neighbors in an upper class London street would probably not have been quite so much in each others pockets, but these were and the conclusion showed why that was so. I was able to see through two episodes which took place but never dreamed of the reason behind what the central dark portion of this case was all about.I found this an absorbing read. It held my interest and kept me wanting to find out what was going on and what was going to happen next. A distraction for me was Charlotte's sudden ability and desire to leave her child in the care of someone while she made many, many, many trips away from home to investigate the case with Emily. Did Pitt not have anything to say about her sudden abandonment of her home and child to investigate? (Now see, I wanted her to be more involved in book two and was slightly dissatisfied when she was not. Now that she is more involved in book three, I'm questioning if this would have been allowed by her husband. How is an author ever supposed to satisfy us all?) Another point, suddenly Aunt Vespasia (don't you just love that name? pure Victorian!) and Emily were manufacturing clothes right and left so that Charlotte could attend funerals and other functions with them. Did Pitt not mind? Did Charlotte not feel some sense of abandoning her decision to give up all that when she married \\"below her station\\" because she loved Pitt? I can't have it both ways but there was so much emphasis on clothes this time that it became an irritant to me.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading the fourth in the series, Resurrection Row. It looks as if the characters will take turns being front and center in the solving of the mysteries. This one was rushed quite a bit at the end and could have done with a lot more explanation of what happened after the solving of the case. Still liked it, though!"},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who were disappointed. I too will continue to read the rest of the series, because I really enjoyed Cater Street Hangman, the first in this series. I found that this was just hot as interesting as the first two books in this series. Neither was it as good as the one Monk book that I have read, which introduced me to Anne Perry's writing and made me want to read more."},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"While I enjoy Anne Perry novels, I am not impressed in the least with the kindle book editing. The book is filled with many grammar and spelling errors. Very disappointing. Makes me reconsider going back to paperbacks."},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"If you like historical details, and want to know about Victorian London, manners and mores, this is the book for you. If you like full drawn characters that you can relate to, I'd skip these. I love serials, and bought the first four. I wish I'd only bought the first two. When I got to the second book, Callander Square, there was nothing about the courtship or wedding, or the relationship. Anne Perry keeps telling me that Charlotte is independent, but I really only have her word for that, as marrying Thomas \\"beneath her station\\" seems to be the only independent thought she has. I'm disappointedin the characters, or lack of same, and disagree with other reviews that the writing is good. It is adequate. The mysteries are OK."},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"This was not her best book, atleast compared to the first two I read. It was just too watered down with society talk. If you've read the first two you don't need any more lessons on people of society vs. the working class.HOWEVER, I did discover the reasoning of why food is served after a funeral, or atleast it made the most sense of anything I've heard so far and just for that reason the book was worth reading. I'm looking forward to her 4th book in this series, I've become quite attached to these characters."},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"The problem is, this is probably a very good book if you want to read about Victorian hypocrisy and society codes, but as mysteries go, it's bad.The Monk series,however are very good,the Pitt- Charlotte series have no plot to speak of, and it gets booooring to read for the nth time about Pitt's compassion and societies'trivia. I'm sorry I bought it,fortunately,I bought more Monk books"},{"Title":"Paragon Walks","review":"Anne Perry has been one of my favorite authors for many, many years. I was delighted to see that the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series is available on Kindle. However, as I am re-reading the old favorites, I am very disappointed by the poor reproduction quality of the entire series. Many words are misspelled through obvious optical character recognition errors. The price of each book warrants at least a proofread of the content. My rating is based on this issue; a review of the writing and storyline would be much higher."},{"Title":"Scientific Writing: Easy When You Know How","review":"I have read the classic \\"How to write and publish a scientific paper\\" from Robert A. Day, before this one. I find Peat's book more usefull, because it drives you through the whole publication process. Structure of each section of a paper is widely described, and what is more important substructure within each section. The book also includes a lot of usefull web resources and information about specific publication guidelines depending on study design (CONSORT, QUORUM,...).The only thing I missed is the sense of humor of Day's Book, and maybe more examples about making good tables, charts and figures, although some general rules are included in the text.It's a great book, maybe one of the best about scientific writing."},{"Title":"Scientific Writing: Easy When You Know How","review":"3.5 starsThis book is heavily focused on writing clinical research including clinical research examples, with very little information specific to general research articles. Sections of the book focus on using the proper statistics (for clinical studies) data table design, and data organization, but had little to no information about generating other types of figures or writing non-clinical research articles.This book also includes useful information about submitting your article, writing and responding to peer review, and having an article rejected. These sections were really more about getting published than actually writing. The short section on writing a post graduate dissertation did not include enough information to really be useful. Also, this is not a good recourse for specifics about grant writing.The final sections of the book include information about actual writing, which didn't seem completely specific to scientific writing, but was all together useful. There are chapters on sentence structure, word choice, grammar, and punctuation. Each of these chapters contain numerous examples where example sentences are made more clear though the topic discussed in the chapter. Of course a lot of writing style even scientific writing is personal preference, so there are no hard and fast rules, but these sections give some good general advice and discuss many common word choice and grammar mistakes.Overall, I found a lot of good suggestions and advice in this book, but it was also very dense and a little boring.

You do not need to know calculus (although it would help) to understand all the concepts in this book. I highly recommend this book as a statistics workbook for other statistics book such as \\"Statistics for People who Hate Statistics\\". This book does not cover advanced statistics that require strong knowledge of calculus.Statistics is the principal language in business mathematics. Whenever there is a need to crunch a lot of data, statistics becomes central to the analysis of the data to make meaningful conclusions, decisions, and predictions. Because of exponential growth of data and data crunching capabilities brought on by the Information Technology revolution, the utility of statistics in the business world is greater than ever. If your organization utilizes data mining and analytics and Six Sigma, for example, your understanding of your business and your ability to make good strategic and tactical decisions will be greatly enhanced with the knowledge of statistics outlined in this book. Simply put, statistics is a powerful tool (not only for business).The book covers the following concepts:1)Analyzing Business Data2)Graphs3)Descriptive Measures4)Dispersion5)Probability6)Binomial, Normal, hypergeometric, and poission distribution7)Sampling and confidence intervals8)Hypotheses and testing them.9)Chi Square10)ANOVA11)Regression and correlation12)Business forecasting13)Decision analysis14)Statistical Process Control.My main problem with this book is its usability. There are many typos. For example, on page 127, one of the equation states \\"(30)(0.20)=60\\" when the answer clearly should have been \\"6.0\\". In addition, many questions are unnecessarily cumbersome adding to the frustration of learning statistics. For example, in the Chapter 10 \\"Testing Hypothesis\\", question 10.11 refers to q 10.10 which refers to q 10.9 which refers to q 10.3 which refers to q 10.2 which finally refers to q 10.1.

Whether you own just one copy of their Greatest Hits album, or you are a serious collector trying to obtain the entire back catalogue, or if you just fondly remember those video's the lads used to make which combined unrestrained hilarity with the darker side of Great Britain and the issues facing people in the late 70's through the 80's.\`Total Madness' is packed with some superb stories of how the band formed, their first gigs in and around the pubs of North London and their chaotic rehearsal sessions. It moves on to their signing for 2-Tone and Stiff, TV appearances, tours, before finally covering their demise in 1986 and reformation in 1992 culminating in Madstock in August of that year. Thrown in amongst all this literary nuttiness are some superb pictures covering the entire chronology of events.As if all this wasn't enough, the one thing that makes this book stand out is that it has been written by a true fan. George Marshall has established himself as one of the leading authorities on many Ska related disciplines, with varying books. \`Total Madness' opens with the words, \\"They say you should never meet your heroes as it is always a disappointment - but meeting Chris Foreman (guitarist) proved this to be the exception to the rule\\".If you are only a mild Madness fan when you pick up this book, you shall certainly be driven to go out and buy some of their work after reading this. George Marshall's infectious love of the band and the era they come from, quickly overtakes any lingering doubts you may have about trouble making skin-heads intent on right-wing politics and fighting.To sum up, this is the best book on Madness you will find, simply because it is 100% Madness, has great pictures and was written by a true Madness fan FOR Madness fans.Colin Galbraith"},{"Title":"Outlines of theology","review":"This book is a must for any Christian library, A.

When Terrans learned to travel the space lanes, Central Control assigned them to a special role that suited their aggressive temperament and also provided a safety valve for all other belligerents among the great confederacy. The Terrans became the mercenaries of the Galaxy. Arch Hordes served on the relatively primitive worlds and Mech Legions served on the relatively advanced worlds. However, even the Mechs weapons were less advanced than those available to the Galactic Patrol. Three hundred years passed before any challenge arose to this system.In this novel, Kana Karr, newly graduated Arch Swordsman Third Class, comes to Prime to receive his first assignment. Waiting in the hiring hall, he hears rumors of lost legions and refused assignments. Then, a senior Combatant, accompanied by a Galactic Agent, announces that the troubles on Nevers have been fully investigated, with the assistance of Central Control, and certified that the defeat there was due to local problems and that the rumors concerning this episode are not to be repeated by any of the Corps. Naturally, this stirs up even more rumors.Shortly thereafter, Karr is offered a position with Yorke's Horde and accepts the assignment. He is told to report to Dock Five at seventeen hours, so he goes to the transients' mess to eat. While there, he hears still more rumors. Then he goes to an information booth to learn the languages of Fronn, the planet where he is to serve, as well as any other facts available. When he returns the record-pak, he notices that a Mech scoops it up before the return belt can load it back into the machine.On the journey to Fronn, he bunks with Trig Hansu, a very experienced Swordtan. In fact, all the men headed to Yorke's Horde, except himself, are very experienced and, when they reach Secundus, he only finds two other S-Threes in the Horde. Although most of the man seem to be amiable, the other S-Threes warn him to avoid Zapan Bogate. However, when they reach Fronn, Bogate and one of his buddies, Sim, decides to crowd Karr a little. When Karr chops a clutching hand, Sim slaps him in formal challenge. Karr, however, has the choice of weapons and chooses bat sticks. Although Sim proves to be an expert swordsman, he is confused by the relative lightness of the stick. Furthermore, he uses it as a rapier, but Karr waits until he can draw it across Sim's forearm, so that the pain forces Sim to drop the stick, thereby conceding the duel. Of course, Sim is furious, but the other veterans rather respect Karr for using his knowledge of the planet in this manner.After a week of intensive drill to shake out any lingering effects of the space travel, they move out with their employer. As Karr is marching on point, they overtake a caravan of Venturi and he notices that one of the figures walks differently. His team reports his suspicions and keeps the caravan under observation until a troop of Llor cavalry flushes the suspicious wayfarer from the caravan, straight toward them. The troopers lasso the fugitive, but he sits up and fires a flamer at them. Immediately, the Combatants fire at the shooter. The robed figure proves to be a Llor, who had no business possessing a flamer, which are reserved for the Patrol. After seven Fronn days, they meet the forces of the enemy and are called to parlay, but the enemy ambush their employer and capture his men. When the Combatants talk to the enemy leader, they are told that the Terran way does not apply to Fronn.Now that their employer is dead, they head to an auxiliary starport in the hills to get off world. The port is Venturi, but these natives soon leave to go back to their islands, leaving the building to the Terrans. They are forced indoors by a cariolis storm, but find an unusual sight after the storm: a wrecked crawler with a Vegan onboard and boxes of flamers as cargo. Then they find a downed Patrol ship in a rocky valley with bodies in Patrol uniforms laid out as for inspection.This novel is an early Norton SF work. It has some of the signature images, including the Zacathans who crop up everywhere in the authors SF. However, in many ways it more resembles The Stars Are Ours, with Central Control as the repressive force. Nevertheless, it ends on a note of hope.Recommended for Norton fans and anyone who enjoys alien planets and peoples as well as competent young people coping with disaster.-Arthur W.

It still uses a standard 9X9 grid so it should be easy. So ho is the grid bigger if it is 9X9? Simple. Five 9X9 grids are arranged in an X-formation. The center grid shares each corner sub-grid with one of the other four 9X9 grids. So, sometimes, in order to solve one of these overlapping sub-grids you will have to look for clues in two different 9X9 grids.Other than occasionally having to look at two different 9X9 grids all of your favorite techniques for solving sudoku puzzles should still work. But if you are used to solving grids in only a few minutes, then be prepared to take a little longer to solve all five grids. Samurai sudoku offers a more complex challenge without the puzzler having to learn any new rules or character sets.One-hundred puzzles make up the book with one puzzle per page. The puzzle takes up almost the entire page and has been printed entirely in shiny bold. This can be a little annoying to look at due to the complexity of the grid but puzzlers should get used to it quickly. The puzzles increase in difficulty as the book progresses and all puzzles are symmetric. Solutions are given at the end of the book and are also in shiny bold. A good addition to the sudoku family."},{"Title":"100 Samurai Sudoku Puzzles","review":"I found this book to be really fun.

If you have already gotten into samurai sudoku, the book may be too easy."},{"Title":"100 Samurai Sudoku Puzzles","review":"Finally there is a book out with only Samurai Sudoku puzzles - 100 of them! The puzzles are all symmetric and the difficulty ranges from medium to really really tough. Even one of these puzzles takes quite some time to solve.

I would recommend this to anyone who likes Sudoku and want a bit of a challenge."},{"Title":"100 Samurai Sudoku Puzzles","review":"The way they have it set up, it's really hard to differentiate between the middle and the end sections. Also, the print is very small so if you have trouble seeing this is no the sudoku book for you. Also, I was expecting a challenge but finished the hardest puzzles in the book very quickly. Good for beginners, but not someone who's already gone through another Samurai Sudoku book."},{"Title":"100 Samurai Sudoku Puzzles","review":"A \\"samurai\\" sudoku puzzle consists of a central sudoku with its corners joining it to four additional sudokus, as shown in the cover illustration, a construction which can provide additional fun for the mid-level sudoku addict. The objective is to solve all five overlapping puzzles. In the more difficult puzzles, none of the corner puzzles can be solved in their entirety until additional information is provided as a result of solving part of the central sudoku, and that, in turn, depends on information from all four corner puzzles.In the early puzzles, the corner sudokus can be done in their entirety, before solving the central puzzle, and occasionally a central puzzle can be completed before the corners are completely filled, making these puzzles fairly easy. The options for a given box within a square are usually limited to pairs of numbers, reducing the challenges. By puzzle #7, however, the author introduces three options per box and the puzzles begin to be more time-consuming and difficult.As is sometimes the case with regular sudoku puzzles, however, it is occasionally possible to have more than one correct solution to a single sudoku puzzle. When this happens in a corner sudoku, it can prevent the whole samurai puzzle from being solved. Sometimes it is simply the reversal of a couple of numbers which causes the problem. Though the individual sudoku puzzle can be solved without any \\"errors,\\" this alternative, \\"correct\\" solution is wrong in the overall scheme of the whole samurai puzzle. Puzzle addicts may be hard pressed to figure out how to avoid this problem, even when warned that all puzzles should be done in tandem and not separately.I found nine occasions in which individual sudoku puzzles within the samurai puzzle had more than one solution--puzzles 12, 38, 46, 55, 65, 78, 79, 88, and 89. This was particularly frustrating in the more difficult and more time-consuming puzzles. The remaining 91 puzzles were clever and fun to do, however, and I've already bought, and look forward to doing, the next book in this series.

True, they are more time consuming -- safe to say possibly five times more time consuming! But you can always take a break between areas. They definitely don't all solve in the same direction -- sometimes you need to finish the four outer areas in order to have a chance at solving the inner one, other times the opposite is true. I like that the puzzles are arranged in consecutive difficulty as you advance through the book. I highly recommend this book to sudoku fanatics!"},{"Title":"100 Samurai Sudoku Puzzles","review":"I've been waiting for this one - for some reason there are very few Samurai Sudoku puzzles out there, maybe they are too big to fit in the books... (A Samurai Sudoku is five traditional Sudoku puzzles combined.) I've only solved a few so far but I can definitely say they are not too easy!"},{"Title":"100 Samurai Sudoku Puzzles","review":"Samurai Sudoku! Big. Intimidating. Multidimensional. Sudokus shooting out the corners of other sudokus.Guess what. It's a gimmick. You know how long it takes to do one of these giant sudokus? Slightly shorter than it would take to do five separate easy sudokus. That's right. It's actually easier. Once you get used to the concept, which shouldn't take long, you realize that the overlapping grids actually provide more information, more data for solving the sudoku. Not harder, easier. I suppose, in theory, one could construct a giant sudoku where the clues were distributed in such a way that it could only be solved in a very particular order, but that would make it challenging in a tedious sort of way, not necessarily a clever thinking-differently sort of way.For me, the biggest challenge of doing these giant sudokus was just altering my system of annotations, since there is more on the page, more things in the way, and my old system was getting things too muddled. Also, the squares have to be smaller, to fit more on a page, and so it just acts as a disincentive to scratching in notes.That's okay though. I'm not knocking the giant sudokus. If you like them, great. They are absorbing and fun to see how quickly you can breeze through them. But, in general, I like the old 9 by 9 advanced level sudokus. All the sudoku variations are interesting in theory but I find that, for me at least, they ultimately are not improvements.You know what would be the next step though, a serious step up? A 3D sudoku. I guess it would have to be on a computer so you could rotate it and solve the puzzle by breaking it down into various sagital and coronal slices. Has anyone thought of that yet? If not, I'm claiming it. You heard it hear, Uncle Stu, July 19th 2006."},{"Title":"100 Samurai Sudoku Puzzles","review":"This is a good book for those who want to try samurai. I noticed that some grids are still solvable without going into the overlap grids. Also, there are lots of numbers given as clues. I am a bit of a nut about sudoku - (my favourites are killer samurais where you also have to add up number cells within the sudoku grid). If you are already well experienced with samurai, you will find these puzzles quite easy - right up to the \\"hard\\" ones. The paper quality is excellent. The challenge I'm giving myself with this book is to use a minimal number of notations. I've done about half of them randomly over the book (including the last ones), and have not found any really tricky ones. So, take note of the guy who prefers single sudokus with advanced strategy needs. This book won't satisfy you lot! But for the rest of us, it's a pretty gentle exercise. It's good to be able to \\"breeze\\" thru one whole puzzle within a half hour. If you read my other reviews, you will see I have a favourite author who has designed many books on different sudoku variations, and if he says the puzzle is deadly, he means it!"},{"Title":"Sadhu Sundar Singh","review":"An excellent and inspirational book on the costs of following Christ.

Ghosh's treatment of violence in Calcutta and in Dhaka is valid even today, more than ten years after its publication. What has happened recently in Kosovo and in East Timor show that answers still evade the questions, which Ghosh poses about freedom, about the very real yet non-existing lines, which divide nations, people, and families.The story of the family and friends of the nameless narrator who for all his anonymity comes across as if he is the person looking at you quietly from across the table by the time the story telling is over and silence descends. Before that stage arrives the reader is catapulted to different places and times at breath taking tempo. The past, present and future combine and melt together erasing any kind of line of demarcation. Such lines are present mainly in the shadows they cast. There is no point of reference to hold on to. Thus the going away - the title of the first section of the novel - becomes coming home - the title of the second section. These two titles could easily have been exchanged.The narrator is very much like the chronicler Pimen in Pushkin's drama Boris Godonow. But unlike Pushkin's Pimen this one is not a passive witness to all that happens in his presence, and absence. The very soul of the happenings, he is the comma which separates yet connects the various clauses of life lived in Calcutta, London, Dhaka and elsewhere. The story starts about thirteen years before the birth of the narrator and ends on the night preceding his departure from London back to Delhi. He spends less than a year in London, researching for his doctorate work, but it is a London he knew very well even before he puts a step on its pavements. Two people have made London so very real to him - Tridib, the second son of his father's aunt, his real mentor and inspirer, and Ila his beautiful cousin who has traveled all over the world but has seen little compared to what the narrator has seen through his mental eye. London is also a very real place because of Tridib's and Ila's friends - Mrs. Price, her daughter May, and son Nick. Like London comes alive due to the stories related by Ila and Tridib, Dhaka comes alive because of all the stories of her childhood told to him by his incomparable grandmother who was born there. The tragedy is that though the narrator spends almost a year in London and thus has ample opportunity to come to terms with its role in his life, it is Dhaka which he never visits that affects him most by the violent drama that takes place on its roads, taking Tridib away as one of its most unfortunate victims.Violence has many faces in this novel - it is as much present in the marriage of Ila to Nick doomed to failure even before the &quot;yes&quot; word was spoken, as it is present on the riot torn streets of Calcutta or Dhaka. But the specialty of this novel is that this violence is very subtle till almost the end. When violence is dealt with, the idea is not to describe it explicitly like a voyeur but to look at it to comprehend its total senselessness. Thus the way &quot;violence&quot; is brought into the picture is extraordinarily sensitive: The narrator says, talking of the day riots tore Calcutta apart in 1964, &quot;I opened my mouth to answer and found I had nothing to say. All I could have told them was of the sound of voices running past the walls of my school, and of a glimpse of a mob in Park Circus.&quot; I have never experienced such a sound, but God, how these sentences get under the skin, how easy it is to hear that sound, how the heart beats faster on reading these sentences!Ghosh is also a humorous writer. It is serious humor. Single words hide a wealth of meaning, for example, the way Tridib's father is always referred to as Shaheb, Ila's mother as Queen Victoria, or the way the grandmother's sister always remains Mayadebi without any suffix denoting the relationship. Also look at this passage that describes how the grandmother reacts on discovering that her old Jethamoshai is living with a Muslim family in Dhaka is outstanding and must be read to enjoyThe main characters are very real, almost perfectly rounded. I specially love the grandmother. She is the grandmother many of us recognize. In her fierce moral standards, Spartan outlook of life, and intolerance of any nonsense - real and imagined, she is as real as any patriarch or matriarch worth the name. And there is this very loveable character of the narrator. It is that of a boy who warms your heart, it is that of a man who knows and has lost love - more than once in his life - and thus makes you feel like hugging him close to your heart.Some of the most important questions the novel probes are the various faces of violence and the extent to which its fiery arms reach under the guise of fighting for freedom. Ghosh's treatment of violence in Calcutta and in Dhaka is valid even today, more than ten years after its publication. What has happened recently in Kosovo and in East Timor show that answers still evade the modern world. On all scores, Ghosh's novel is excellent reading and would make a very impressive film. Excellent Must Read!"},{"Title":"Shadow Lines","review":"Rarely one comes across a book that moves one's emotion and intellect with it's powerful yet beautiful and extremely poignant language. The story effortlessly moves back and forth in time, portraying the contrast of the times and places of the two stages of the protagonist's life, beautifully bringning the evolution of a character in particular and humanity in general. The characters of this story are too real to be fictitious, who are all very complex and yet simple enough to be idnetifiable with our own experiences. The climax is amazing, unpredictable, and very touching, living fully upto the expectations raised in the building up of it, and more. It leaves the reader with a twich of nostalgia that one feels after coming across a beautiful creation. DON'T MISS IT."},{"Title":"Shadow Lines","review":"The new Indian English fiction of the eighties is free from the self-consciousness, shallow idealism, and sentimentalism that characterised the work of the older generation of novelists such as Raja Rao, R. K. Narayan or Mulk Raj Anand who started writing in the thirties. The fiction of the eighties takes a maturer view of Indian reality. There is freshness and vitality and the writ-ers betray remarkable confidence in tackling new themes, and experiment with new techniques and approaches to handle those themes. Amitav Ghosh, whose first novel, The Circle of Reason appeared in 1986, has strengthened the new English novel in more than one way. The Shadow Lines takes us into the mnemonic fund of a young narrator who as a wide-eyed adolescent hero-worshipped Tridib, an uncle, who fed him on his memories of his one visit to London during the war; and his grandmother who shared with him her nostalgic memories of East Bengal where she was born and spent her childhood. And then there is Ila (his cousin, for whom he nurtures a secret passion), who travels all over the world with her diplomat glob-trotting parents and occasionally comes home to tell a wonderstruck boy accounts of her peregrinations abroad. Their memories &quot;form a part of my secret map of the world, a map of which only I know the keys and coordinates, but which was not for that reason any more imaginary that the code of a safe to a banker.&quot; From the three whose memories form his own consciousness, he learns to see in different ways. Ila sees much but experiences little. With her superficial response to life, she only remem-bers how one airport differed from the other by its less or more conveniently located ladies'. Tridib teaches him to see with precision because he teaches the boy to see with imagination (&quot;we could not see without inventing what we saw&quot;). He evoked for the young boy &quot;the worlds to travel in and . . . eyes to see them with.&quot; The grandmother establishes to him the oneness of memory for according to her neither space nor time can divide it. The Shadow Lines spans three generations of the narrator's family spread over East Bengal and Calcutta; the English family-friends, the Prices, whose histories include the two Wars and the contemporary London. And the web of life in The Shadow Lines, which encompasses many countries, many religions, is a collage of memories, the narrator's own, and others', dusty photo-graphs, yellowing newspaper clippings, but nurtured above all by imagination. While nations, religions, war, violence and parti-tion divide people, memory does not. Imagination creates a world that cannot be divided, any more than nations break and float away when geographical boundaries are arbitrarily recreated. Life in The Shadow Lines loses its chronological logic. Past invades the present and enriches and transforms it, and in the process, strengthens the narrator's ability to encounter and even reshape his own future when it invades his present later. (In that sense one of the major concerns of the novel focuses on growth and experience and maturity.) The very structure of the novel--coil within coil opening up vistas of new worlds, new experiences--reflects this giddying whirl of life, memory and imagination. Ghosh's remarkably brilliant handling of his lin-guistic medium is one of his major achievements. He writes fluently, and his narratives moves with grace, ease and under-statement. Ghosh's evocation of the city of his birth and adolescent years, Calcutta, depicted in remarkably vivid details, is com-parable only with Anita Desai's re-creation of Bombay in Baumgartner's Bombay (1988). His experience as a social anthro-pologist at the Universities of Delhi and Oxford shows in his handling of the characters and the context in which they exist. He reveals a sense of history and a firm grasp of socio-cultural and historical material that underlies his narrative. He con-fesses to one of his earliest memories of Calcutta as that of a mob surrounding his house, a memory that he decided to &quot;exhume&quot; and confront after he witnessed the 1984 riots (the most trau-matic event in contemporary Indian history) which spread through the country after Indira Gandhi's assassination. The Shadow Lines takes in the war-devastated London, civil-strife in post-partition East Bengal, and the riot-hit Calcutta and projects a major critique of the psychological make-up of the contemporary man that thrives on violence."},{"Title":"Shadow Lines","review":"If I have to name the singlemost life altering reading experience, The Shadow Lines will be it. Given the present political situation, every Indian with even half a claim at intelligence must read this book. But despite its grounding in politics and history, the story is a most personal account of a little boy's life who drifts back and forth between Calcutta and Dhaka...and his journey where he encounters lines and barriers of all kinds, only to find that they're all but...shadow lines. Amitav Ghosh writes with a flair and a command over the language that most other authors can only dream of."},{"Title":"Shadow Lines","review":"This is a wonderful piece of work. I was off to a slow start - but after the few pages I got so engrossed in the book, I couldn't put it down till I had finished it. Events from different eras, and happening in different parts of the world are beautifully woven into a coherent narrative. I was really impressed by this unique style of traversing space and time in a non-linear fashion. The main characters are well etched out.The book would be best appreciated by those who have spent time in India (and know of its unique lifestyle!) and have also had a taste of the western world. However, it is a wonderfully told story, and I would recommend it to one and all."},{"Title":"Shadow Lines","review":"I loved this book. It involved me completely. The complex narrative, with its time shifts, is a tremendous achievement. The book is incisive and funny, yet touching, profound and humane. It depicts India and its paradoxes perfectly.

I found this the strongest part of this book. Read it."},{"Title":"Shadow Lines","review":"This is a book that never lets you put it down. A rivetting narration of a family saga. Ghosh's style of narration, where he goes back and forth, makes it even better. This book was my first one by Ghosh. Ever since I am a great fan of his and always looking out for his next one."},{"Title":"Shadow Lines","review":"I am currently taking a course about the Partition of South Asia into the two countries of India and Pakistan. This book is written about that Partition. However, throughout the entire book, the term Partition is never mentioned. This is because Ghosh has produced something incredible. It follows the life and growth of a young Indian boy/man, and throughout his journey, he discovers invaluable insights about life, love, and countries. Of the 8+ books read in the course about Partition, this book is by far the best. Of the books that I have read for fun, this book is my favorite.

I taught this text to college sophomores recently and realized too late just how difficult the text is. True, there are marvelous complexities and wonderfully wrought ironies and historical insights. But there are also pages of confusion with relatively little pay off. This text might well be taught in conjunction with a detailed Indian (or Pakistani or Bangladeshi) history. Without it (and without an immense amount of time), this book is better left for graduate study.That said, I will repeat what others have said ad nauseam: there is a large amount of difference between enjoyment and appreciation.

The title itself is an example of symbolism and realism. From the image conscious character of the grandmother to the riots that takes place in the streets, the author Gosh takes the reader on a fascinating journey of exploration. He takes apart the characters of the story while doing so to the human race. The title of the novel \`The Shadow Lines\\" is the best statement Gosh makes. To state that \\"The Shadow Lines,\\" or the lines that not only define our human shape but our inner struggles to choose between dark and light, and plays a major part of all human existence.

It examines and delves into national, familial and personal issues with equal delicacy and insight. &quot;Shadow Lines&quot; is a reference to the hazy lines of division between nations that are erected by human beings, the books talks about how easy it is to transcend them - this can cause confusion but also bring peace.The characters are people the readers can totally relate to, as are the circumstances and events in their lives. All of this is handled with the most expert writing skill and command over the English language.The book is thus, by far not only the most mature of Amitav Ghosh's writing, but also one of the greatest works of Indian fiction."},{"Title":"Shadow Lines","review":"I read this book for a graduate course in global English literature. It was one of the more enjoyable reads in that class. The novel is set in India and Pakistan both before and after Partition. It deals with the effects that Partition had on the cities of Calcutta and Dhaka. Ghosh's prose is clear and lucid. Told from the perspective of a young child, the novel has a lot to do with the power of story-telling and the connection of story-telling to identity. Ghosh addresses the issues of nationalism and transnationalism and of borders (both real and imagined). He forces the reader to deal with the connections between nationalism and violence."},{"Title":"Shadow Lines","review":"This is a very ambitious book. It is about how boundaries are formed and how identity is created, how notions of nationalism and nations are perpetuated and accepted. It is about journeys through time and through ages. It is about a longing for the past and about unrequited love. Every sentence is carefully crafted and full of metaphor and meaning. This is not a book. Its a journey."},{"Title":"Shadow Lines","review":"The novel \\"The Shadow Lines\\" by Amitav Gosh paints a picture of symbolism and realism that covers both time and space.

It is set in Calcutta, London and Dhaka, and tells the story of a Bengali and an English family and their involvement over some eighty years. Told as seen through the eyes of the narrator, whose name we never learn (perhaps this says something of his place in the story: to observe), the story opens in 1960 when he is just eight years old, and traces events that impacted on the family from the start of World War II to the late 1970s. Whilst this is ultimately a tragic tale which shows how international events can affect the population at an intimate level, the perspective of the young narrator makes for plenty of humour as well. The narrator's adulation for his older cousin, Tridib, and his infatuation with his cousin Ila, as well as his love for, and occasional exasperation with, his grandmother, all bring the characters to sparkling life. That the narrator could describe events where he was not present because he had absorbed the tales told and retold by others and made them his own, was a device I thought both clever and novel. \\"I could not persuade her that a place does not merely exist, that it has to be invented in one's imagination; that her practical, bustling London was no less invented than mine, neither more nor less true, only very far apart.\\" In a background of the Partition of India and Pakistan and later the creation of Bangladesh, the observations about borders (Shadow Lines) are particularly pertinent: \\"It's all very well, you're going away now, but suppose when you get there they decide to draw another line somewhere? What will you do then? Where will you move to?\\" A compelling story, beautifully told."},{"Title":"Shadow Lines","review":"I am now reading and enjoying the book which has a dream-like quality about it. I recommend it heartily.The Shadow Lines: A Novel"},{"Title":"Shadow Lines","review":"This book is very interesting and original in that it does not have a linear narrative. Rather, it is a book where the flow is almost a stream of consciousness. The narrator unpacks memory after memory as they occur to him and reveals the story in a very unusual way. At first I found this frustrating, but later I found it gave the book meaning, in explaining the power of memories to different individuals and the way in which one's perception based on their memories frames the way in which they perceive reality. This book like other Ghosh books have some basis in history covering England in the war years, Dhaka before the partition, and the Dhaka and Calcutta communal riots, but this one is less so than a couple others I've read. Like the Glass Palace, this book also involves interesting cultural interactions between East and West that always makes for an interesting read."},{"Title":"Shadow Lines","review":"It's true.

For more detailed discussion of the individual works herein, see reviews of the 3 separate books; no changes were made to include them here. They have few points in common, not even being 3 back-to-back books in publication order. While they're no worse here than taken separately, this omnibus edition provides no added value.THE LEAGUE OF FRIGHTENED MEN (1935) was the 2nd Wolfe book, and first appeared in installments that summer in _The Saturday Evening Post_ as FRIGHTENED MEN. Wolfe's strict schedule and so on weren't rigidly enforced until several books into the series, and Archie's character has rough edges that will be smoothed as he has time to develop.Years ago, before the Crash, a gang of young Harvard students crippled Paul Chapin in a hazing accident. Ever since, they've watched over him out of guilt, although he was never likeable; even his fiancee jumped at the excuse of his accident to break their engagement. (She even added insult to injury by marrying one of his tormentors, although she wouldn't see it that way - Chapin's *very* self-contained.) But in spite of the pitying non-friendship of the self-styled \\"League of Atonement\\", Chapin has managed to make a life and a career for himself; he's now a successful and controversial author.Now various accidents(?) have struck down apparently random members of the League, and they're finally giving Chapin some respect - they believe he's finally taking his revenge, and as a group, they want to engage Wolfe to make it stop. (Archie privately calls them the \\"League of the White Feather\\" rather than the name in the title of the book, being far from impressed. Handing someone a white feather used to be one way of accusing the person of cowardice.)AND BE A VILLAIN (1948) was the 13th Wolfe book, and the first of his recorded brushes with his nemesis, Arnold Zeck. The story would more logically be grouped with the other two Zeck books, and in fact this was done years after the publication of FULL HOUSE with the omnibus TRIPLE ZECK. AND BE A VILLAIN is one of the cases in which Wolfe drums up a little business rather than waiting for clients to come to him - in this instance, after Archie fills out Wolfe's form 1040.Archie always referred to this case in later years as \\"the Orchard case\\". Cyril Orchard died from drinking a poisoned glass as a guest on the Madeleine Fraser show - not only during a live broadcast, but during a live commercial for the product in question. *Ouch*. It's no wonder that when Wolfe sends Archie to Madeleine Fraser suggesting that she hire him, her network and the sponsors' council fall over themselves asking why he didn't come to them *first*. As usual when Wolfe has corporate entities as clients, they're facing a publicity disaster of magnitude one, and their *real* concern is to handle *that*; solving any murder or murders is a side issue. And as usual, this brings up potential conflicts of interest.CURTAINS FOR THREE (1951) was the 18th Wolfe book, but the individual stories were first published in magazines.\\"The Gun with Wings\\" (1948) was found beside the body of Albert Mion, one of the Met's top tenors, and a matching bullet was found through the roof of his mouth - an apparent suicide. His widow and her would-be fiancee - the Gazette's music critic - can't help suspecting each other of murder, and want Wolfe to uncover the truth. Some of the characters' attitudes make this a period piece.\\"Bullet for One\\" (1948) is a case saddled with timetables: the victim was shot while riding through Central Park, and was seen by a mounted patrolman only half an hour before his horse came in riderless. Leavening the usual dryness of timetables, however, we have not only a snakepit of motives among the 6 main suspects, but Cramer's reaction to Wolfe within range of a high-profile case, and the mounted patrolman, who can give Archie a run for his money in the smart-aleck department.\\"Disguise for Murder\\", a.k.a. \\"The Twisted Scarf\\", \\"The Affair of the Twisted Scarf\\" (1950) is one of several occasions when a murder takes place not only on the premises of Wolfe's brownstone, but in the office. In this instance, the victim was one of the few personable young women who came to call when Wolfe opened the plant rooms to the Manhattan Flower Club for an afternoon. Not only did Archie notice Cynthia before her death - she asked for a meeting with Wolfe, frightened after recognizing someone she thought was a murderer among the other guests. Finding her dead after she trusted him to help her made this a bit personal for Archie; Cramer's sealing the office as a crime scene made it personal for *Wolfe*. :)"},{"Title":"Abrakfox: A collection of commercial fun n' magic : including the memories and magic of Duke Stern","review":"It contains a few good tricks and illusions; but, it also has a lot of \\"fluff\\" stories about Kerrell Fox himself. It is sort of an autobiography with some of his illusions thrown in."},{"Title":"Intertidal Life","review":"I loved this book. It is the story of a woman who moves to the Gulf Islands (off the coast of British Columbia) with her two little girls. She is a writer, a mother, a woman separated from her husband and dealing with jealousies, past memories, and all the emotional baggage of a marriage that has gone sour. Audrey Thomas writes beautifully of the surroundings, the quiet pleasures of island life, as well as the relationships with a few of her women friends who prove to be less than trustworthy. Thomas does an excellent job conveying the pretentiousnessand hypocrissy of so-called artists and intellectuals. Her main character was a woman I genuinely liked.Audrey Thomas is, in my opinion, a highly underrated Canadian author."},{"Title":"Mirror of Remembrance","review":"I bought this when going to Tx. for a vacation... it was so funny that I laughed SO hard that I cried...

Since brains leave no fossils, few areas in psychology are more pregnant with fantasy than conjectures about the development of human intelligence. In spite of this substantial handicap (at least from my empirical perspective), I found this collection to contain some tasty morsels. Rather than discuss each contribution, I will simply note those I found palatable.Bjorklund and Kipp contribute a fascinating extension of the social cognition hypothesis in chapter three. They locate the origin of human intelligence in inhibition. The capacities to not respond in a social context, to control sexual and aggressive instincts, to parent offspring, and to deceive are all attributable to inhibition. In fact, they even explain theory of mind as a product of inhibitory abilities. I found this chapter particularly refreshing because the speculations are well-founded on the empirical work in neuroscience and cognitive psychology.Byrne, in chapter five, provides a short introduction to the primate origins of intelligence. He questions social complexity as the prime mover of human intelligence, noting that the organization of actions into hierarchical, goal-oriented programs may have been of greater importance.Calvin (chapter six) explains how intra-generational climatic changes may have fueled the growth in human intelligence. By providing an environmental context that selected for group cooperation and precision throwing, rapid climatic change may have fueled the development of syntax, first in the argument-structure schemes necessary to deal with violators of reciprocal altruism, and secondly in novel hand-arm sequencing necessary for precise throws.Flanagan, Hardcastle, and Nahmias deconstruct arguments that suggest that human intelligence is an evolutionary adaptation in chapter nine. They find that it is more likely that intelligence is a spandrel, or inevitable byproduct of adaptations.Jerison provides an interesting look at brain evolution from the perspective of comparative psychology in chapter nine. First he finds the origin of the mammalian cortex in the detailed non-visual sensory processing required for nocturnal existence. Secondly, he finds an adaptive use for this cortex in social predation. Since hominid olfaction had largely ossified, language, cognition, communication, and consciousness, were enabled by happy coincidence of cortex and society.Finally, I cannot fail to mention Plotkin&#65533;s discussion of evolution as a hierarchy of skeptical induction engines primarily because of his creative inclusion of human culture. In this view, the evolution of intelligence cannot be explained apart from the inclusion of cultural influences.I may still have more questions than answers related to the evolution of human intelligence, but I believe that my questions are significantly more insightful and complete after reading this collection. I recommend it for those desiring a sophisticated and comprehensive overview of the competing perspectives."},{"Title":"Golden Slumbers Audio","review":"When my children were small, I think we wore out at least three of these tapes.

Now in the new millenium I play the tape every night by my son's crib.

There are no toys connected with the songs that will be marketed to your children. No TV show. No videotapes or DVD to buy. Just an album of beautiful, authentic music that will provide priceless memories.The sound quality is what you'd expect from an album recorded in the 1950s, or perhaps a little worse, but that in no way detracts from the charm of the record - it might even enhance it. My two-year-old now *asks* for the \\"lullabye tape\\" every night.It's worth noting that the original record came with a spiral-bound book that included stories and lyrics. Unfortunately the tape lacks that book. I only wish this album was available on CD!The album is nicely multicultural, but the majority of the songs are in English (in some cases somewhat archaic English). I suspect that there were one or two changes between the record and the new tape version, but I haven't had a chance to compare them properly.

Yet, this is exactly what occurred when Emile Guillaumin sat down to write &quot;The Life of a Simple Man.&quot; This poignant tale, set in the early 1800's, follows the life of a man beset by poverty, hardship, and the caprice of the landed classes. What shows through, however, is the strength of character, the determination, and the simple wisdom of a people who built the French nation. A wonderful, literate read that I highly recommend to anyone interested in this period or in the autobiographical experiences of a people whose voice is only rarely heard."},{"Title":"The Life of a Simple Man","review":"One of the best books I have ever read in my entire life.

It not only recounts history, it foresees the history of others; the path that they are yet to walk. Of tremenduous value for me has been the parallel found between the France of those years and the Latin America of today. Having traveled extensively in the latter, I have learned that Latin America is for the most part 200 years behind if compared with the France described in this book. More interesting than that is the fact that despite distances and differences in cultures, we are so much more alike than we give credit. I wonder how many Tienons there are in Latin America today relieving the life of this metayer.

Pretty."},{"Title":"Escardy Gap","review":"\\"...a writer without an idea is just about the dumbest, most desperate creature in the world. From dawn to dusk he is haunted, hounded, and hunted by invisible demons. Nothing contents him, nothing comforts him. There are no satisfactions, no consolations for him. None. Not a one.\\"Narrator, from Escardy GapEnervated by a lengthy battle with writer's block, the narrator of Escardy Gap stomps around his apartment in a fruitless search for inspiration. He tries to write, but can only turn out clich&eacute;s. Seeking stimulation from the work of other authors, he finds only frustration when confronted with their excellence. Just when he's ready to give up, his typewriter literally starts to mock him. Spurred by its taunts, he looks deep inside himself for a story, praying he will find one. Suddenly, he has a vision of a train arriving at the station of a small town. Sensing a story, he sits down to type.Thus begins one of the best, most provocative books of the last few years. \\"Best\\" due to its energy, exuberance and charm, \\"provocative\\" because of its thoughtful treatment of the relationship between imagination and reality.The setting is a quintessential example of small town, nineteen fifties America called Escardy Gap, a town that combines the qualities of the narrator's home town and \\"every fictional town\\" he ever lived in through books. Think Greentown, Riverdale, Smallville \\"without the flying boy\\", and Castle Rock \\"as it might have been forty years ago\\". The players are the colorful citizens of Escardy Gap and the shadowy members of a performing troupe known as the Company.The Company arrives one fine summer day, traveling on a \\"monster of a train\\". A decidedly odd lot, they are nonetheless quickly accepted by the trusting, good natured folk who inhabit Escardy Gap. All are pleased by this unexpected surprise, except Josh Knight, a young man who learns that the Company harbors deadly secrets.Professing poverty, the members of the Company ask for a night's shelter in return for a performance. The townsfolk readily agree, inviting these strange people into their homes. The Company uses this intimate access to launch a campaign of terror against the town. One citizen's remains are strewn throughout the branches of a tree in the middle of town. Josh's grandfather is killed when Jeremiah Rackstraw, the leader of the Company, writes the word \\"DEAD\\" across his forehead. Another literally dissolves into a puddle after smoking a new brand of tobacco provided by his guest.Only Josh, the Mayor (a former actor), and Doc (the kindly town physician) stand between the Company and the total destruction of the town. They set out in search of help, only to find themselves trapped in a tunnel which opens in New York City's Central Park. They are rescued from the tunnel by the book's narrator, who finds that the line between his everyday reality and the reality he created is rapidly blurring.While the novel owes an obvious debt to Bradbury's Something Wicked this Way Comes, it owes an equal amount to books like Clive Barker's Books of Blood. In fact, Escardy Gap is a tribute to all things horror, constantly tipping its hat to the authors and icons which make the genre great. The authors are not content to merely pay homage, however, and manage to put an original spin on the material. They carefully nurture a plot thread, the significance of which only becomes apparent in the last chapter of the book. The authors' solution to their self created problem is both elegant and satisfying.To say I was impressed by Crowther and Lovegrove's storytelling is an understatement. This remarkable story is told clearly, authoritatively, with a wonderful richness of detail. Escardy Gap rarely fails to enthrall--the authors' obvious love for their characters and the genre shines through on every page. I was especially taken with a vivid chapter in the middle of the book, wherein the members of the Company gather to discuss their fiendish endeavors. The stuff Messrs. Crowther and Lovegrove treat as asides could provide fodder for a dozen novels.Visit Escardy Gap if you dare."},{"Title":"Escardy Gap","review":"I recommend this novel if for no other reason than to revel in the sheer joy of its language. Crowther and Lovegrove clearly had fun writing this book, and I had a great time reading it."},{"Title":"Escardy Gap","review":"I found this novel to be very tough to rate. The first 200 pages were forgetable; too many cliches, too much over-the-top characterization, too many characters, and too many bad guys. But then, the plot started to take hold. We delve down into the major characters and begin to see them grow. The quirky plot device of getting the &quot;main&quot; character (the author who is writing this tale) actually into the novel seemed contrived at first and almost hokey but somehow, they pull it off. My interest level definitely perked up and I rode the final pages of the book like a wave. When I finished the last chapter, I wanted to give it 5 stars but must cut back to only 4 because of the long drawn-out build-up in the beginning. The gory parts (and there are a lot of them) are very gory but often original.

And nothing offends me more than pretentious writing, unless it is a writer who writes about having writer's block. This author does both.First we have the hackneyed plot: the too-good virgin town is paid a visit from Hell by a too-bad evil train, whose occupants proceed to trash the place by preying upon the townspeople's &quot;secret&quot; flaws. (With two exceptions, EVERYBODY dies, including the train, which is disembowled in a squishy blood-and-guts scene that goes on just as long and just as disbelievingly as the story itself.) But the characters don't simply play their roles; they psychoanalyze them. For pages upon end.Then we have the fact that the townspeople have no good reason to be so good, AND the evils have no good reason to be so evil, AND both parties actually say so! So we have... no real plot, no real story, every cliche you can think of, and no reason for any of it to exist.Which, I guess, is why I found the book for $2 in one of those stores where books go to die. This dawg deserved its fate."},{"Title":"Escardy Gap","review":"Okay, I'll admit it. I bought this book because of the cool train on the cover. So sue me. Luckily I ended up with a very unique horror novel. It starts out very much like most of Ray Bradbury's nostalgic work.

The work is pervaded by a Beckett-like sense of the despair of living and relating inside a paper/language city (the anxiety of reference), untranslatability, unspeakability. In what one might by now consider a small tradition among younger innovative writers (thinking of Pamala Lu's A Novel) her \\"characters\\" are named only by their initals, n and b. A character named \\"?\\" also shows up, and one named M. Some of the syntactical complexity, tweaked narrative, and antique vocabulary reminded me periodically of Taylor Brady's book Microclimates. Since n could be Natalie, or could perhaps (in my reading) also function as \\"neither\\" versus b for \\"both\\" in the classic neither-both logical construction, the prose poems neatly bring forward the question of whether there are other models for narrative besides fiction--what's narrative in logic, what's narrative in linguistic analysis, etc. ? There's also a rich undercurrent of transgressive sexuality and feminisms, a foregrounding of the body, with attendant radical gender questions going on (\\"Who will speak for the body?\\" etc.). The prosody is less line by line or word by word than a rhythm back and forth between intelligible content, the appearence of such content, and elusive collapses. Stephens also has a good essay in Biting the Error: Writers Explore Narrative, also from Coach House."},{"Title":"Lives of the English Poets","review":"Samuel Johnson finished an illustrious literary career with a series of biographies of the major English poets up until his time. The series was initiated by bookpublishers, who were interested in preserving their copyrights by publishing new editions of each poet's works, with Johnson's prefaces. Eventually, the prefaces themselves were collected and printed separately from the poems.Johnson's effort was an attempt at establishing a canon for his day, and he hoped forever. Nowadays, we do not read all of these poets with the same enthusiasm that Johnson did, but his analyses of Milton, Pope, Dryden et al are frequently read to this day. His criticism is outstanding, and the attention which he brings to each poet will make you think twice before disregarding poets we have now forgotten.This specific edition is a reprint of the 1905 Oxford edition, edited by George Birkbeck Hill. Hill's editorial work on Boswell's Life Of Johnson is the edition typically cited in later works (any footnote citing a six volume Boswell is referring to Hill's effort) and his Johnson Miscellanies is a favorite collection of contemporaneous recollections of Johnson. He brings similar value to this edition of &quot;The Lives Of The Poets.&quot; At least until such time as the Yale Edition of the Works of Samuel Johnson publishes The Lives Of The Poets, this will *remain* the standard edition."},{"Title":"Lives of the English Poets","review":"Let Us Now Praise Famous MenLives of the English Poets is probably the only work of Johnson's likely to be read today beyond academic circles. Despite the fact that he was in his sixty-eighth year when he began the task of writing the lives of fifty-two poets of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, his \`little Lives and little Prefaces' display a wealth of sparkle and critical insight. We can almost feel Johnson enjoying his fusion of precise fact and carefully weighed opinion, not to say personal prejudice. Even if some of the poets are dull, Johnson here is never dull. It was the kind of undertaking for which Johnson by nature and temperament was ideally suited; that is it required meticulous research, a slavish dedication to ploughing through many minor and often inferior works and a lively interest in the vagaries of human conduct. As with the seven-year compilation of his Dictionary, here again in the Lives one feels Johnson's underlying need to provide a touchstone, an element of stability, as well as a service to the nation and posterity. Lives of the Poets is not merely a memorial to fifty-two English poets, but a memorial to Johnson himself.Perhaps more than any other writer Johnson is conscious of the passing of time, of the futility of human effort in the face of the eternal, of the vanity of human wishes. \`Nothing is more evident than that the decays of age must terminate in death,' he writes in The Idler in 1759: 'The life which made my own life pleasant is at an end, and the gates of death are shut upon my prospects.' All that a mere human can do in the face of such vast emptiness is to hope and pray, and commemorate the passing of those who have gone before. Johnson's letters, diaries, sermons and essays are replete with such threnodies as we find in his sermon on his wife's death in 1752. This lament on Tetty's death, delivered not at her funeral service, which he did not attend, and not published in his lifetime, is more a meditation on mortality than a celebration of her life. Thus the undelivered sermon warns the phantom congregation: \`Let those who entered this place unaffected and indifferent, and those whose only purpose was to behold this funeral spectacle, consider, that she, whom they thus behold with negligence, and pass by, was lately partaker of the same nature with themselves; and that they likewise are hastening to their end, and must soon, by others equally negligent, be buried and forgotten!'Although Johnson declares that \`Nothing excites a man to write but necessity,' and that \`No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money,' the fact that he was prepared to accepted a mere two hundred guineas for the massive undertaking of the Lives suggests that he wrote because he loved writing biography for its own sake, rather than for purely mercenary motives. True, for most of his life he was dogged by poverty and his pen was ever his fortune; however, we never find him haggling and he relished celebrating the lives of those, like Savage, of a carefree disposition, rather than, for instance, the puritanical Milton. That Johnson, who enjoyed the company of ordinary as well as extraordinary men, was more likely to befriend a poor man than a rich one is typified in his generous bequest to his servant, Frank Barber.Indeed, Johnson finds that the celebration of great men is frequently misplaced. In The Adventurer (No 99, 1753-4) he refuses \`to vindicate the sanguinary projects of heroes and conquerors, and would wish rather to diminish the reputation of their success.' He goes on to vilify Caesar, Catiline, Xerxes, Alexander the Great and Peter the Great, wishing them \`huddled together in obscurity or detestation.' And in \`The Vanity' he tells us \`Great Xerxes comes to seize the certain prey/And starves exhausted regions in his way.' His contempt for vain memorials is epitomised in Rasselas, in Imlac's contempt for the Pyramids, \`which appear \`to have been erected only with that hunger of the imagination which preys incessantly upon life.'However, Imlac may well be voicing only one side of Johnson's view of memorials. The Lives of the Poets are testimony to the author's need to record meticulously the thoughts, feelings and tempers of the poets in their everyday doings. These are the best kind of memorials for him: sincere tributes in words, rather than graven images. For, irrespective of public esteem, a man's thoughts and words are for Johnson always worth preserving. \`In a man's letters . . . his soul lies naked.' And, as Boswell believed when pursuing him for copy for the biography, \`he was secretly pleased to find so much of the fruit of his mind preserved.' One suspects that it is the flamboyant and insincere lying epitaphs of \`great' men that incur his displeasure. In a similar way he deplores the fulsome dedications and panegyrics common at the time - though often essential for patronage. Of Richard Savage's dedications he declares, \`his compliments are constrained and violent, heaped together without the grace of order, or the decency of introduction: he seems to have written his panegyrics for the perusal only of his patrons, and to imagine that he had no other task than to pamper them with praises however gross, and that flattery would make its way to the heart without the assistance of elegance or invention.'It often seems that for Johnson a man's own words and deeds are his best memorial. Hence his passion for recording the exact details of the lives he commemorated and his need to keep, as far as possible, to the original words of Shakespeare in his edition of the Works. And in his advice to biographers he reminds them that \`chronology is the eye of history' for \`every Man's life is of importance to himself. Do not omit painful casualties or unpleasing passages, they make the variegation of existence.'And some there be, which have no memorialWe may wonder why Johnson included in his Lives such minor figures, both in quality and quantity of output, as Halifax and Thomas Parnell. Indeed he commences his Life of Parnell with hesitation and reluctance: \`The Life of Dr Parnell is a task which I should very willingly decline.' He then goes on to commend not Parnell himself but his previous biographer Oliver Goldsmith, \`a man of such variety of powers, and such felicity of performance, that he always seemed to do best that which he was doing; a man who had the art of being minute without tediousness, and general without confusion; whose language was copious without exuberance, exact without constraint, and easy without weakness.' Thus the typical Johnsonian rhetoric; but what about the eponymous Parnell, known latterly as the Father of the Graveyard Poets? In a work that, in the Everyman edition, devotes 100 pages to Pope and 83 pages to Dryden, it is perhaps fitting that Parnell should be allocated a mere two pages, giving the bare outline of his life and works. After all, Parnell only published nine poems in his lifetime. But then why then include him at all?In his debates with Boswell over the moral qualities of the various poets in the Lives and the possible dangers of celebrating those whose habits were vicious, Boswell recalls Johnson's remark that \`Addison and Parnell drank too freely.' But Addison, eminent politician and editor of the Spectator, is awarded a more than respectable 42 pages; Parnell \`too much a lover of the bottle' must be satisfied with just a couple. Clearly, then, it seems not to be his addiction to alcohol, but the paucity of his output that results in Parnell's curtailed biography. Yet Boswell himself was puzzled by his mentor's omission of the Latin epitaph in his Life of Parnell:Qui sacerdos pariter et poeta,Utrusque partes ita implevit,Ut neque sacerdoti suavitas poet,Nec poet sacerdotis sanctitas, deessset.'Johnson can of course turn a neat Latin quatrain, but he is reluctant to indulge in pious and lying epitaphs for the undeserving. As with Stepney, who \`apparently professed himself a poet' and whose juvenile compositions \`make grey authors blush', so here: \`The general character of Parnell is not great extent of comprehension, or fertility of mind. Of the little that appears, still less is his own.' In fact, much of Johnson's Life of Parnell is taken up with exposing the subject's borrowings and plagiarisms. He is nevertheless noted in the great work, not commended, but, rather, remembered as a man for having lived at all.Occasionally one feels that, as regards his own family, Johnson, rather than celebrating their lives, would rather wipe their names from the slate of memory. This is certainly true of his brother Nathaniel, and, to a lesser extent, of his wife Tetty. Having run up debts, failed in business and been found to have cheated customers, Nathaniel was to his brother a pariah, fit only for transportation to America. Death spared him this ignominy, but even before Natty's funeral, Johnson had set out for London with his tragedy Mahomet and Irene in his pocket. To Mary Prouse who later wrote to him seeking information about Natty, he merely confessed that \`he was my near relation.' He wanted no memory of and no memorial to his failed brother.Johnson's comparative neglect of his mother has been remarked on by many of his biographers, but even more striking is his attitude to his wife, Tetty, whom he praised and effusively prayed for only after her death. The fact that he did not attend her funeral has been already noted, but the distance between the couple was not simply one of a twenty-year age gap and for some time the separation of their respective locations. Mrs Johnson (formerly Porter, ne&eacute; Jervis) was a rich, plump widow with three children, who came to the marriage with a dowry of 600. The marriage was obviously one of convenience and in a sense no marriage at all. He confided to Boswell, \`My wife told me I might lye with as many women as I pleased, provided I loved her alone.' Put simply, Johnson had a predilection for younger girls and needed an independent life in the city; Tetty sought a support, a companion and a man of literary promise to flatter her vanity. In this she was disappointed and, after a life of addiction to the bottle, died an opium addict. As with Nathaniel, she needed and received no engraved memorial - not until some thirty years later in Johnson's final days.\`I have often thought that there has rarely passed a life of which a judicious and faithful narrative would not be useful,' Johnson declares in his Rambler essay, No 60. Indeed, we continually find Johnson celebrating the humble as opposed to the great, the ordinary as opposed to the extraordinary, and the natural against the supernatural. He is a great retriever of scraps that others would barely deign to notice. The drudgery of compiling catalogues is as important to him as the study of literary history. Little things count. Typically, he refers modestly to his finest work as \`little Lives and little Prefaces.' Johnson is forever engaged on the dual task of preservation and annotation of works and lives that he would not willingly let die. Were it not for Johnson we would hardly know of that man of fashion \`ostentatiously splendid in dress' William Walsh, whose main claim to fame lies in his acquaintance with Dryden and Pope, and whose work \`seldom rises higher than to be pretty.'Whatever its value as literary criticism, Lives of the English Poets remains a great work of preservation and celebration. Johnson can hardly bear to think of a man's passing without a word of commemoration. \`It is unpleasing to think how many names, once celebrated, are since forgotten,' he says, taking time out from his earnest biography of Dryden and lamenting that \`Of Newcastle's works nothing is now known but his Treatise on Horsemanship.' And his account of Edmund Smith (of whose life \`little is known; and that little claims no praise but what can be given to intellectual excellence, seldom employed to any virtuous purpose') concludes with an encomium to his friend and boyhood mentor Gilbert Walmsley. There being so little to commend in the work or character of Smith, Johnson indulges himself in an ubi sunt of his boyhood hero: \`At this man's table I enjoyed many cheerful and instructive hours, with companions such as are not often found; with one who has lengthened, and one who has gladdened life; with Dr James, whose skill in physic will be long remembered; and with David Garrick, whom I hoped to have gratified with this character of our common friend: but what are the hopes of man! I am disappointed by that stroke of death, which has eclipsed the gaiety of nations, and impoverished the public stock of harmless pleasure.'But their name liveth for evermoreAt the end of his life Johnson wrote epitaphs for his father, his mother and his brother. He directed that these be engraved on \`deep, massy and hard stone' and placed in St Michael's Church in Lichfield. Writing to Lucy Porter the week before his death he tells her of the stone he had laid over her mother's grave in Bromley. The Latin inscription, translated for Lucy, celebrates Tetty as \`a Woman of beauty, elegance, ingenuity and piety.' Boswell had described her as \`very fat, with a bosom of more than ordinary protuberance, with swelled cheeks, of a florid red, produced by thick painting, and increased by the liberal use of cordials, flaring and fantastic in her dress, and affected both in her speech and her general behaviour.' Of course, an epitaph's function is to memorialise the dead, rather than to tell the truth. Mendacity is permitted and to a large extent expected. But a biographer has totally other obligations, as Johnson points out in Rambler, No 60: \`If we owe regard to the memory of the dead, there is yet more respect to be paid to knowledge, to virtue, and to truth.' Samuel Johnson's own life and work are surely perpetual reminders of this obligation."},{"Title":"Lives of the English Poets","review":"Samuel Johnson was writing to order, filling a request from booksellers to bring together great English poetry, prefaced by an interpretive biography of each poet. As Boswell wrote to Johnson, \\"Is not the charm of this publication chiefly owing to the magnum nomen in front of it?\\" To which question the answer is clear: yes, but not only the name of Samuel Johnson but the almost unfailing delights of the incisive, compassionate, deeply moral, and splendidly furnished mind within in.The several books on the poets are the collected introductory biographies, some of which are extensive including a critical review of the poet's chief works such as Milton and some of which are written in flames, briefly, such as Rochestor (Wilmot). The poets often are obscure to us now, but live in Johnson's pages. Many of their lives were blasted by poverty, to which Johnson---himself often impoverished---brings compassion for their failings and indignation for those who failed him.Throughout the essays shines Johnson's wide and deep knowledge; the man must have rarely slept for reading and writing. His consistent criterion for good poetry is that it give delight. I began reading Johnson to learn more why in Elizabeth Gaskell's \\"Cranford\\" he was so disliked by the Dickens' loving Captain Brown and so liked by a character meant to be somewhat unlikable.Reading these lives has been a revelation not that one dislikes Dickens more but in appreciating Johnson. Here as an instance is the introductory sentence to the life of one Edmund Smith (1168-1710):'Edmund Smith is one of those lucky writers, who have without much labour, attained high reputation,and who are mentioned with reverence rather for the possession than the exertion of uncommon abilities.\\"There, in one readable sentence, fine in its cadence and propitious in its choice of words, is knowledge of the man, his status, and his story....told in the next pages at a seasonable length.Purchase,read, and for a while, walk with Boswell, listening to a great man who earned fully his great name."},{"Title":"Lives of the English Poets","review":"The fifty- two lives written about were taken by Johnson to represent the best of English poetry. His prejudices express themselves often, and he makes egregious errors, for instance in panning Milton's Lycidas. But Johnson is a powerful figure often insightful , and usually interesting. The lives have been superseded in a basic sense by longer more scholarly studies, but they still have their readers, largely I expect, among graduate students of English literature."},{"Title":"Lives of the English Poets","review":"One poet reviewed in this book is Savage.

This book is as it's titled is for biologists and it is understandable. This book could have saved me from the frustration of 'not knowing' the proper terminology in project design. There is a easier, concise way to say something about 'what I wanted to do in the field.'I am finally satisfied in my quest for an understandable design and data analysis book! I would have liked to have had the information this text has before I had to jump into writing proposals - even if the proposals were only for course work. (I have recommended this book to my professor to use in future courses and to fellow grad students.) I highly recommend this book!! A second choice would be \\"Vegetation Description and Data Analysis: A Practical Approach\\" by Kent and Coker. These books combined have made my project design understandable. (The latter is a bit harder to find - I had mine shipped over from India) Again can't recommend this one enough - Thank you so much G. P. Quinn!!"},{"Title":"Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists","review":"This is a review by Celia Lombardi and myself was published in Ecology 83:810-812 (2003).UNCERTAIN INTENT, UNCERTAIN RESULTThe percentage of statistical analyses in the ecological literature that are incorrect or inappropriate is high. Thesis advisors, journal editors, textbook writers and statistics professors have not done their job well. So new books on design and analysis are always approached with great hope.This hefty volume by two of Australia's more quantitatively sophisticated ecologists is written for biologists and environmental scientists. All examples are ecological and almost all from the published literature. Readers are presumed to have had one or two semesters of introductory statistics. It begins with a detailed, nine-page table of contents and ends with an extensive bibliography that lists, among others, many useful recent works on controversial statistical issues. There are indeed very good sections on some topics. By its end, however, it is apparent that this volume is not one that will reverse the tide of statistical malpractice.The intent of the book is not completely clear, and its title is misleading. This is not a book one would select for a course in experimental design sensu stricto, i.e. the design of manipulative experiments. The authors state that the book's \\"approach is to encourage readers to understand the models underlying the most common experimental designs\\" (p. xv) and that its \\"emphasis is on manipulative experiments\\" (p.157).But they also state, \\"Our emphasis here is on dealing with biological data - how to design sampling [our emphasis] programs that represent the best use of our resources ...\\" (p. xv). The book is, in fact, as much about observational studies as experimental ones. Scattered throughout it are 71 \`boxes' that present worked examples from actual investigations. Of these boxes, 70 percent deal with observational studies and only 30 percent with manipulative experiments. Seven chapters (6, 13-18), constituting 35 percent of the text, deal exclusively or almost exclusively with statistical analysis of observational studies; and reference to observational studies is frequent in other chapters.On the other hand, sampling design is formally covered in three pages of text, while about 91 pages are devoted to experimental design. Even within these 91 pages, however 39 percent of the \`boxed' examples concern observational studies!The blurring of the distinction between observational and experimental studies may reflect, in part, a desire to cover a very broad array of topics in a single course - and this text may have been designed for such a course. We believe that a strong, modern (post)graduate program in ecology or the environmental sciences, however, needs to offer separate courses in sampling design and experimental design. These are subject matters where both the primary literature and textbooks are riddled with error. Students cannot be expected to sort the wheat from the chaff easily on their own. Independent study does not suffice - not that we recommend blind faith in professors either.The subject matter is apportioned roughly as follows: scientific method (8 pp.), graphical exploration of data (14 pp.), statistical analysis (379 pp.), study design (94 pp.), and presentation of results (16 pp.). The authors have a website for the book at [...]. Here they present the raw data files for all worked examples in the book, materials for instructors, an erratum sheet, and a link to the website for their own course.The brief section on the scientific method is useful for its summary of the different positions of a number of philosophers and scientists on the topic, its citation of several key recent works not yet well known, and its recognition that both inductive and deductive approaches are critical to the advance of science. The latter view, disparaged by rigid Popperians, has been especially well articulated and defended in the excellent treatise by Ford (2000). One weakness in this section is its promulgation of the widespread confusion between the research hypotheses and statistical hypotheses (null and alternative) (p. 5).A tremendous range of topics is covered. Critical review of many of the more fundamental ones discovers problems.For their chapters on design, the authors have adopted a confusing and superfluous terminology from the social and behavioral sciences. This perhaps reflects a negative influence of Winer et al. (1991) whom they cite favorably in many places. The term subject is at the core of this terminology. But subject has never been a statistical concept. On one page it is used to mean block, on another to mean experimental unit, on another to mean evaluation unit, and so on. An early demise of the term is to be hoped for. On p. 265 they refer to crossover designs as \\"subject x treatment designs\\" and to designs where experimental units are monitored on two or more occasions as \\"subject x trial designs.\\" Thirty two pages later there is a section titled \\"Crossover designs,\\" but it does not mention that these are the same ones earlier termed \\"subject x treatment designs.\\" On p. 266 they describe a simple randomized complete block design study of differences in frog abundance on burned versus unburned plots that was monitored in each of three years; later they refer to year as the treatment factor in this study and burn condition as a \\"within subjects\\" factor (p. 273).Other confusions relating to design are present. The sampling units in observational studies they sometimes term \\"experimental units\\" (p.265), a term best used only for manipulative experiments. They claim that \\"[t]he most common situation in biological experiments [with randomized complete blocks designs is where]...the blocks used in the experiment are a random sample from a larger population of blocks\\" (p. 273), whereas in fact this is a very uncommon situation. They describe one study as having a split-plot design whereas it actually has a randomized complete block design with two levels of blocking and a single treatment factor (p. 303). They strongly recommend against unequal replication (p. 42, 69, 187) and fractional factorial designs (p. 261) on grounds of difficulties they may pose to analysis; yet strong arguments for both often can be made on the grounds of objectives, ethics, cost considerations, and logistics - and we should not let the tail wag the dog. Easy statistical analysis is a secondary objective.Pseudoreplication (sensu Hurlbert 1984) is briefly discussed and defined as a design problem characterized by the taking of multiple samples from experimental units where there is only one experimental unit per treatment (p. 159). In fact, pseudoreplication is not a design error but rather an error of statistical analysis and interpretation. And it does not refer to absence of treatment replication. Sacrificial pseudoreplication is one of the commonest types (Hurlbert and White 1993, Lombardi and Hurlbert 1996, Garcia-Berthou and Hurlbert 1999) and by definition is possible only where there are multiple experimental units per treatment. On three occasions, analyses constituting pseudoreplication - simple (p. 354) or temporal (pp. 224, 242) - are inadvertently presented as examples of the correct way to do things. The two cases of temporal pseudoreplication also can be viewed as examples of pseudofactorialism (Hurlbert and White 1993). In a section on \\"pooling\\" the authors argue, in effect, that sacrificial pseudoreplication is acceptable procedure so long as the power to detect the real differences among experimental units is low (p. 260). Their motive is a desire for greater power than is conferred by the experimental design and data. They forget that this is accomplished by biasing P values, hopefully but not necessarily, in a downward direction, i.e. by exaggerating the evidence for a treatment effect and the precision of the estimate of its magnitude. An important recent reference on this topic is Jenkins (2002).This volume perpetuates, or at least leaves weakly evaluated, many widespread but unjustifiable conventions of statistical analysis. Let's start with fundamentals. The authors acknowledge that \\"[t]here is no reason why all tests have to be done with a significance level fixed at 0.05\\" (p. 53) but do not acknowledge that there is no need in most research situations to specify any &#945; value whatsoever. Evaluation of evidence is not a black-and-white matter. Clear interpretation and good writing will dispense with the habit and crutch of calling certain results \\"significant.\\" The authors do at least advocate the reporting of exact P values, at least when these are > 0.001 (p. 34, 496).There is confusion as to how a P value is to be defined and interpreted. The authors incorrectly state that P \\"is the probability of a result occurring by chance in the long run if H0 is true...\\" (p. 35). Early on they seem to argue that a high P value constitutes evidence that the alternative hypothesis (HA) is \\"incorrect\\" (p. 4), but later they correctly recognize that it argues only for suspension of judgment as to the correctness of HA versus H0 (p. 35).Their assessment of the validity of one-tailed testing is ambivalent and inconclusive (p. 37). They confuse the issue of what might be predicted with that of what would be of interest. They cite approvingly one of their own studies that justified one-tailed testing with the claim that a result in the direction opposite that predicted would have been ignored. Use of one-tailed tests indicates statistical misunderstanding at several levels. It reflects the black-and-white thinking of fixed significance levels, confusion between the testing of research hypotheses and the testing of statistical hypotheses, and failure to recognize that, applied to a given data set, a one-tailed test yielding a P = 0.04 (or 0.96) and a two-tailed test yielding a P = 0.08 are two exactly equivalent summaries of the same information and should lead to identical conclusions as to what the evidence shows (Kimmel 1957, Pillemer 1991, Lombardi and Hurlbert 1995 and in manuscript).The issue of multiple testing and type I error is raised at many points in the book and considered a \\"most difficult\\" one by the authors (p. 48), though it should not be. They correctly state that a \\"Type I error is when we mistakenly reject a correct HO\\" (p. 42) and that \\"most common HOs in biology, and other sciences, are always false\\" (p.53). But then, instead of taking the next logical step and concluding that type I errors are likely to be very rare and can simply be evaluated as an unlikely possibility on a test-by-test basis, the authors revert to the antediluvian \`alpha paranoia' of many of our statistical forefathers. They state, erroneously, that \\"[a]s the number of tests increases, so does the probability of making at least one Type I error among the collection of tests\\" (p. 49) and that \\"[t]he probability of at least one Type I error among the family of ten tests [being carried out in a hypothetical example], if each test is conducted at &#945; equals 0.05 and the comparisons are independent of each other, is 0.40\\" (p. 196). Without knowing how many, if any, of the null hypotheses being tested are true, it is not possible to calculate the probability of making one or more Type I errors. For most investigations that probability is likely to be zero.The authors recognize that the many conventional procedures available \\"to keep the [maximum] family-wise Type I error rate [possible] at some [fixed] reasonable level\\" (p. 49) are problematic. They require arbitrary decisions as to what constitutes a \\"family\\" of tests and as to what the family-wise &#945; should be set at; and if conventionally low values of &#945; are used, power will be greatly reduced. With respect to \\"planned comparisons\\" they thus conclude: \\"Our broad recommendation is that the default position should be no adjustment for multiple testing [our emphasis] if the tests present clearly defined and separate hypotheses\\" (p. 197). To emphasize the import of this helpful recommendation, they might have pointed out how widely it is ignored by authors, reviewers, and editors.For \\"unplanned comparisons\\" (which is something of a strawman category) the authors feel that procedures entailing fixed family-wise Type I error rates may often be appropriate (p. 199ff). They present no clear rationale, however. Having co-authored a very thorough comparison of such procedures several years ago (Day and Quinn 1989), Quinn perhaps is not yet ready to face the music: there is no legitimate employment for the games of Mssrs. Bonferroni, Duncan, Dunnet, Ryan, Scheff&eacute;, Student-Neuman-Keuls, and Tukey! The attention given to those games is distracting and makes it less likely the reader will absorb the full significance of the \\"broad recommendation\\" quoted above. Good, feet-on-the ground advice on this topic may be had from Mead (1988:309-315) and Carmer and Walker (1982).Somewhat related issues are raised in the author's discussions of repeated measures designs. They recommend Greenhouse-Geiser-adjusted error degrees of freedom for testing for time and time x treatment effects in such studies (p. 282), but use unadjusted error degrees of freedom in examples they present (p. 336, 357). Nowhere do they acknowledge that separate date-by-date analyses - without correction for \`multiple testing' - is a perfectly valid, simpler, more informative, and less error-prone approach to such data. Why create giant ANOVA tables for the trivial purpose of proving that, by golly, response variables and treatment effects do not remain constant over time!?In discussing meta-analyses, the authors specify that these must employ \\"a measure of effect size...that incorporates the variance of the effect\\" (p. 51). They cite favorably four books and review articles that advocate this decades-old conventional wisdom. Yet, the illogic and defects of such standardized indices of effect size in most situations are clear (Hurlbert 1994, Abelson 1997, Petraitis 1998). Repair of the damage that has been done to the intelligibility of meta-analyses in most disciplines by blind use of the usual standardized indices would require a book longer than that under review.A final topic where issue may be taken with statements in this volume is that of data transformation. The authors accurately state on p. 64 that \\"[t]he most common transformation is the log transformation ...\\" But one page later they claim that \\"[t]he most common type of transformation useful for biological data is the power transformation, which transforms Y to Yp, where p is greater than zero. For data with right skew, the square root transformation, where p = 0.5, is applicable particularly for data that are counts (Poisson distributed) ...\\" (p. 65). In fact, the square root transformation will almost always be a bad choice, as count or other types of abundance data will rarely even approximately conform to a Poisson distribution; nature is patchy. The square root transformation will often lead to problems like that evident in their Fig. 9.7 (p. 253), where the mean minus one standard error or standard deviation takes one into negative values for limpet density. Log transformation of data does not permit such illogical results. When a data set contains zeros, use of log transformation requires addition of some constant to all values in the set; the authors mention four different options for selecting that constant (p. 65) but no advice as to which is correct.Our focus on its problems notwithstanding, it is evident that a great deal of scholarship has gone into this book and that there is much good advice in it. Production of a definitive and flawless volume covering such a wide subject matter seems not yet to be feasible, however. The existing statistics books and primary literature still contain too much misinformation on too many topics. Correction of this will require a Herculean effort - many critical, narrowly focused reviews by many scholars over some period of time - before broad syntheses become a manageable task for one or two authors. The present authors, for example, repeatedly indicate their reliance on Winer et al. (1991), Sokal and Rohlf (1995), and Underwood (1997). We have referred to the confusing terminology promulgated, albeit not invented, by Winer et al. Underwood's book contains many of the same problems pointed out in this volume (Hurlbert 1997). And Sokal and Rohlf is less highly regarded by statisticians than it is by biologists; Mead (1982) complained of the \\"cookbook\\" quality of the first edition and noted that \\"it is referenced much more frequently than any other book by biologists whose statistics, in papers I referee, are incorrect.\\" New construction evidently requires deeper digging and the repair or replacement of old foundations.ReferencesAbelson, R.P. 1997.

Rather than distill and interpret from his primary sources, Rae has let the people speak for themselves in diaries, letters, newspaper accounts, and book excerpts. The book is divided into eleven chapters and &quot;follows the general progression of life from the cradle to the grave.&quot;Beginning with &quot;Arrivals,&quot; Rae documents the immigrant experience from Indian legends to slaves and indentured servants. An aristocratic young mother escapes from Revolutionary France, and Minnesota appeals for settlers. &quot;Physicians who expect to live by the practice of their profession will find Minnesota a poor field for a location.&quot;Captain John Smith concludes his account of the Jamestown Massacre, &quot;Thus you have heard the particulars...which...some say will be good for the Plantation, because now we have just cause to destroy them [Indians] by all meanes possible.&quot;&quot;Upbringing&quot; includes prescriptions for good behavior and proper schooling as well as W.E.B. Du Bois' touching account of teaching rural black children and a young Crow Indian learning to &quot;count coup.&quot;&quot;Pairing&quot; offers anecdotes from farmers, city dandies, pioneers, Puritans and slaves as well as the British actress Fanny Kemble's wrenching account of her efforts to preserve a slave family from being sold apart, and Benjamin Franklin's amusing story of a failed courtship. Also featured are punishments for adulterers and divorce practices among the Indians.In &quot;Working&quot; an isolated fur trapper immobilized by a broken ankle awaits rescue with harrowing visits from winter, hostile Indians and hungry wolves. Mark Twain describes an Illinois farmer's wife whose day begins before dawn and who concludes, &quot;I have never had a vacation, but if I should be allowed one I should surely be pleased to spend it in an art gallery.&quot;&quot;Housing&quot; offers advice from &quot;The American Frugal Housewife,&quot; a captive woman's description of moving camp among the Sioux, a cowboy's hilarious attempts to winter in a dug-out, and the prodigious diarist George Temptleton Strong's account of a New York fire.&quot;Eating&quot; explores high living and low, from starving in Jamestown and Jack London's experience of prison food, to Ward McAllister's tips on serving dinner to the cream of New York society. Children's games, parties, Custer hunting buffalo and Reverend Increase Mather's views on dancing paint a picture of &quot;Playing&quot; before the advent of television.The variety of American &quot;Praying&quot; takes in Cotton Mather's justification of the Salem witch trials, practices among slaves, spirit possession among Shakers and at revival meetings, and the various prejudices felt by one religion for another.&quot;Erring&quot; encompasses gun duels in the wild west, sodomy among the Pilgrims, an execution for theft during the California gold rush carried out by the jury, and the visceral brutality of the Ku Klux Klan.In &quot;Ailing,&quot; a sick German woman in 1862 was advised by her doctor to speak English as &quot;German was a very heavy language for one as weak as she was. In &quot;Departing,&quot; Frederick Law Olmstead describes a Negro burial and Louisa May Alcott tells of the death of her sister.Noel Rae's America is a land teeming with differences, the ugly and brutish as well as the brave and conscientious. This is history with personality.The wide range of Rae's accomplishment is breathtaking.

I pulled it out in an attempt to research events in a certain year, 1847, and I have to literally page through the entire book because of the way it's arranged (by subject matter). It'd be a great book to bring camping and just sit there and read, but for research purposes it's well nigh impossible.

I find it easier to read every year - yes, you should read it once a year (from cover to cover). Most prefer Kunzli or O'Reilly's editions, but I like Boericke.This little edition published in India is great for keeping in your handbag and carrying with you to read and re-read at your leisure.

It is fun, touching, and original. I love the characters, and am looking forward to more work from Timothy James Beck."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"This book is funny, with engaging characters and a hilarious story line, I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"Finished the book in a day because it was such an enjoyable read.Mr. Beck has created a wonderful character in Daniel and bestowed a colourful life on him as Daniel evolved from a small town nobody into a New Yorker somebody who finally found emotional satisfaction through friendship and love. The side characters are a joy to identify with. The author does such a great job in his description of New York gay and drag queen life that it is convincing, a joy to read yet touching and sad. The only critism I have is the love story of Danial and Blaine is a trifle short. But then it may be because I wished the book could have been thicker. I will definitely buy the second book, \\"He is the One\\" by Mr Beck..."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"I just finished this book yesterday. I bought it at the same time I bought Ben Tyler's \\"Hunk House\\" and of the two (despite Tyler's book being his second) this one definitely won.The plot of the book and the character development were spotty, but the main character was definitely well developed. While the premise could have been anything, I think the author did a good job of fleshing out some issues that are real to many of us - changing careers, transitioning from the end of one relationship to the beginning of a new one, etc.My major disappointments in the book were some of the plot choices (the token AIDS carrier, the snappy/bitchy dialogue and one-liners) and the cheeseball expression of love between the main character and his love interest. The only gay author I've ever read who was able to capture the expression of love between two fictional characters is Joseph Olshan in \\"The Nightswimmer\\" - the scene in this novel is, again, somewhat trite and cavity-inducing.Either way, I did enjoy this book and look forward to the author's further literary exploits. Worth the read - but wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"Daniel is a thirty years old guy like many in New York. He flew from a small town in Wiscounsin hoping to become an actor at Broadway; during high school he was the classical misfit, not actually out as gay but nevertheless the target of those guys who considered themself normal. As often in those cases, losing himself in daydreams was the only way to survive and playing a role on stage was another way to escape reality. In a small town, Daniel's ability to perform was something special, but in New York City he was only one other daydreamer; Daniel left his small town since he didn't fit there, but it's not better in New York City. Young and alone, Daniel was starting towards the path of selling himself, more for being noticed (and having enough to eat) than really for money. Who saved Daniel from that sad destiny, was his makeshift family, full of wonderful characters like Bette Midler, Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, all in drags. In his small town, when Daniel thought to himself as gay, he never once imagined himself in drag, but then he realized that it was another way to play a role, on stage, but also in life. On stage Daniel wore glitters and satin, out of the stage he had still a mask. His own was 2Di4, a female impersonator of Lady Diana; and it worked for many years till the day the real Lady D died in a car accident. Daniel was not only playing a role, 2Di4 was also his life, and losing his source of inspiration was like losing again himself.At thirty Daniel is again at the starting point, the last 12 years lost forever. More or less at the same time, he also finds out that his lover Jeremy is cheating on him with a common friend, Robert. So Daniel takes a whole turn on his life: he moves to Hell's Kitchen in a small apartment with a little garden and he spends the summer planting seeds and trees in that garden, another way to delay. At the end of the summer, the garden is a little eden, and Daniel has not yet decided what to do with his life. His friends, mostly drag queens, want for him to perform again, but he has not that in him. He meets Sheila, a young girl coincidentally from his same small town, who is temporarly living with Blaine, another fellow townfolk. Blaine is actually Mr 5.33, the same man Daniel is spying from his garden every day coming home and doing an impromptu and unwilling little striptease for the neighbor. At first Daniel befriends Sheila for the chance to meet Blaine, but then he finds out that he really likes the girl; Sheila's relationship with Blaine is strange, but from the beginning it's clear that it's not love, at least no more. Sheila also convinces Blaine to hire Daniel as Personal Assistant; Daniel has no real skill for the work, but he learns looking at DVD like Working Girl and From 9 to 5. The job allows him to get nearer to Blaine, and to discover some of the man's secrets.Meanwhile, Daniel's ex, Jeremy, is regretting is choice to leave and wants to come back home to Daniel, and also Jeremy's new lover, Robert, is making a move on Daniel... from not having no one and being dumped, Daniel has now three possible lovers in line. Quite an ego burst. And the real good thing is that now all of the are interesting in Daniel, the real one, and not the face 2Di4 he was on stage. What Daniel didn't do 12 years ago, and what he delayed misguising as a female, he is doing now: he is coming out, from the closet, from the small town, from the dresses he used to hide. He is no more living on the shadow of someone else, replaying on stage her mistakes, Daniel is now doing them all by himself.Even if there is a nice and tender love story between Daniel and Blaine, the story is mainly focused on Daniel. Blaine is all in all a good character and a nice man. He made some big mistakes in his life, but now he is trying to straighten (no pun inteded) them. Maybe at the very beginning, he is not so straightforward (again, no pun inteded) with Daniel, but it's really a question of few days. After that, he becomes the perfect possible boyfriend, comprehensive and caring, sweet and tender. But still, his character remains quite in second line in comparison to Daniel.The love story between them is sweet, tender and very normal. A classical office romance, with a little of teasing and nice development. There is not detailed sex, when they do it (and they do it), the author chose the \\"and afterward...\\" tactic, means that we leave the characters just before the main course, to rejoin them at the afterward. No bad, the story is funny and light enough to fullfill the gap."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"Ok after much thinking and soul searching I had to drop a star from the rest of the books. This being the team of Timothy James Beck's first book (team of 4 writers) the flow did not match book 2 or 3. That being said this was not a bad book. It is a good book to read but read it FIRST. I read book 2 first without knowing it was a series and LOVE #2 but going back and reading book 1 was kind of strange as I was peering into the past.All of the bad being said I just LOVE the characters and how developed the writers make them. They are not just characters in a book but they become like your friends. You just know how they are feeling as they discover themselves and finally admit to their own being and sexuality. If you read this book then be sure to pick up the rest. You will love where the stories take you."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"So, I admit to being a bit of a snob. Not that I am in to high art, but I always liked to think of myself as above the new glut of mass market gay paperbacks. This series of books, and you should read all three, proves me wrong. They are well written and highly entertaining. I was compelled to move on from one book to the next, and was disappointed when I hit the end of the series.Then came the real mindblower. It turns out that the author of the book is actually authorS! Four of them who write together via mail. I wish I had known this before hand, as I would have looked for changes in voice - in retrospect, it all feels seamless. I found it really funny when some reviewers commented that the 'author' was authentic and must have lived this life himself.Go for it, and have a good time. The story steps out of stereotypes - these are not the drag queens you have heard about before. But you will recognize the pining for 'that' man, whether you pine for men or women, gay or straight. And pay attention to all the characters, as they come up in the rest of the series - again, read all of them!"},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"I really am not sure what the other readers actually read when they gave it 5 stars. Basically the book starts out quite well and the main character is developed in way that you like him. However, after about the first hundred pages Daniel becomes so introspective that I felt I was a fly in the wall at a session with his therapist.I found myself either totally daydream even as I read or skipping a few pages until the novel actually got back to a story.About half way through the book I really lost interest when Daniel, after quitting his drag routine is given a job by his love interest. Not only is this highly improbable for someone who didn't even know how to turn on a computer and with only a high school diploma, but it is also ethically questionable.There are no real conflicts in this story to keep you through the almost 400 pages. The main conflict was would Blaine find out about Daniel's past career as a drag queen. Who cares. Believe me, I'm the biggest proponent of gay novels and feel it is important to support our own. However, when the work in quaestion is so insipid and blatantly sappy it really irks me.I really wanted to like this book, but unfortunately it did nothing for me. Do yourself a favor stay away.P.S. - For a while there I was reading this book to help me fall asleep. that is how boring."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"I just read the second book by this author \\"He's the One\\" and very much enjoyed it, that said...This was a good book. I can't rave about it but there isn't anything much about it which would keep me from using the word \\"Good\\" to describe it. My main reasons for not saying it was a great book are that the characters were well done and I liked them but just didn't seem to be developed quite enough. Basically it's a book about a Drag Queen who is near the top of his game in the business doing Princess Di impersonations yet after Di's Death he decides to leave the business and move onto something new. MEanwhile he has also been scoping out his studly new neighbor, Is he? Isn't he? The thing was, while the story peaked my intrest in all of these characters it never really developed them enough for me to really lose myself in the book. The straight girl friend of the neighbor was well done and the ex boyfriend who was only there for a few pages was done well enough to see where he was coming from. but other characters seemed to change personalities. All in all an enjoyable read but unlike others, one I probably won't read again. On a final note, the author may have read Interview with the vampire one too many times as the main character AGONIZED over everything throughout this novel. His second book is much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"I've been wanting to read this book for a while now and finally got to it. I found it interesting and totally entertaining...for a gay fiction novel, which is usually not my thing.The book brought out emotions in me that have been dormant for a while.As a former NewYorker, I highly recommend it....Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"Even after a first reading, this books may seem rather formulaic, but after a second reading, the reader actually recognizes the pathos and agony involved in a modern romance. Certainly, its a gay romance, but what else can you compare to? Most Straight Romances involve the same pain, the same uncertainty, the same doubt. Its nice to read that the characters which we truly come to care about actually get what we wish for. It's the ultimate dream. Every Gay Man and WomAN SHOULD OWN THIS nOVEL. It should rank with Eric Marcus, and other gay authors"},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"How many gay-themed fluff novels about devastatingly attractive gay men in their 30s living in New York are there on the market? This is another of that genre. Written, in fact, by four authors (two named Timothy, one named James, and one named Rebecca), it's a fine beach-read and most entertaining. I realized this early on, so was not disappointed, and will read more of their output in time. But it's purely entertainment, not \\"lit-ra-chah,\\" and if viewed as such, will be quite satisfying to the reader. If, however, you're looking for something more pithy, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"I liked this book for its plot, and kept reading because I wanted to find out what happened to the characters. But, the writing is pretty superficial, and the characters never seem truly human. Even for what's meant as comedy, the writer could have spent less time developing the main character and his love interest through the plot. Instead, we get long expository passages about the characters' backgrounds and feelings. I skimmed those, and didn't really feel I missed much."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"A couple of years ago a friend gave meWhen You Don't See Meand I loved it to bits. I've since readSomeone Like Youby the same authors, which I liked but felt was a good deal less well written than 'When you don't see me'.This one, sadly is far less enjoyable than either of those books, although in itself, there is plenty to enjoy. The world of the New York drag queens offers bathos, pathos, drama and humour, and Daniel's angst over having to give up his Princess 2Di4 in the wake of Princess Diana's sudden death, is an interesting and unique way to tie the story together.Unfortunately that story is incapable of being properly restrained. It's dragged down by way too much info dumping, which could have been avoided by a more linear style of story telling, and by sudden swings in plot and revelation which negate much of the impact of what came before. Frankly, I lost track of who was in love with whom in the Daniel/Jeremy/Robert entanglements, and utterly confused by one minute Jeremy being a cheating dirtbag, but the next minute he's just a sad lost soul in love. Same with Daniel. We start off the story with Daniel living his dream in New York to escape the narrow Wisconsin small town mind set and homophobic parents - a past which sounds cold and loveless. But suddenly, there's a best friend! Who never appears in the story! ANd sisters! And parents who aren't that narrow minded after all!Oy. And Blaine's attraction, apart from the physical, escaped me. His first date with Daniel should have been enough warning for Daniel stay *away* from this amoral sexual predator, but no, Daniel throws commonsense to the wind and it all works out fine.The drag queens are the only really rounded characters in the story. Everyone else, from the helpful ex-girlfriend of Daniel's squidge de jour, to that squidge de jour's estranged and demonised wife, to Blaine, the corporate slave with a heart of gold (sort of and he's a bit of a misogynist too), to Aunt Jen, are stereotypes who don't seem to have a life of any kind outside self-centered Daniel's existence. Ken calls Daniel self-absorbed at times, and boy is he ever.There are four authors behind this pen name, and while when that collaboration works, it's fabulous, when it doesn't, it's a hot mess.It entertained and enlightened, hence the rating, but it could have been so very much better."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"This book was actually kind of boring. Nothing really happened throughout, not what I would call much of a novel. There's a lot of yada yada, but virtually no action.Do you like romances? This is, I believe, a romance, but of a little bit different genre than the usual romance, since it deals with same-sex love.Daniel Stephenson, the narrator of this dry saga, seems just like the author's alter ego. In that sense, it seems like an autobiography, and maybe it is.Daniel moves from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and finds an extended family among the gay crowd of New York City. He finds a job as a female impersonator but loses it when the lady in question, Princess Diana Spencer, dies in a car accident (1997).Daniel relocates to get a new lease on life in addition to his new property lease. He spots his dream man through a window across the way, and, guess what, Blaine is gay, too. And, Blaine has a good job, so he hires Daniel to be his assistant in a big advertising corporation.This is the whole story, believe it or not. The big suspense is whether or not Blaine is going to discover that Daniel was once a female impersonator.I read this book to try to understand homosexuality better. It didn't help a lot in that regard, but I am convinced now that these men really do fall in love with each other.One thing about Timothy James Beck, he's definitely authentic. He had to live what Daniel lives through in this book, in order to write it. You may like it.I found the book just really dull and had to speed read almost everything after the first half, when I realized nothing was going to happen.Diximus."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"The love story is a neglected genre in gay fiction. And it's even rarer to read a gay love story that features believable characters and situations. The author of It Had To Be You must be congratulated for creating a story full of the quirky kind of incidents and complications which are so typical of real life. Truth is always stranger than fiction, but in this case, the fiction is enhanced by the addition of just the kind of strangeness readers can recognize from their own lives or the lives of people they know. Daniel, the main character, transcends the stereotype of the drag queen, becoming a living breathing human being. Blaine, the object of his often ambivalent desires, undergoes a series of transformations from nameless hunk to sensitive and vulnerable nice guy as his character is revealed more fully during the course of the novel. There are no cardboard cutouts here. Daniel's fellow drag artistes are nicely drawn, and so are the several female characters in the book. The somewhat meandering plot closely follows the contours of real experience and mirrors Daniel's all too believable confusion as he tries to change his life and find true love. There are no gratuitous laughs here, just chuckles of recognition. This is a sweet natured story, a little heavy on backstory and exposition, but always entertaining, and the characters are people you'd like to have as friends. I hope Mr. Beck is working on another novel. If he's not, he should be."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"When I read \\"He's the One,\\" by Timothy James Beck, there was a character introduced that I was dying to learn more about: Daniel Stephenson. He had a realistic past, I identified with him a lot more than the main protagonist of \\"He's the One,\\" and moreover, he was just a wonderfully developed secondary character with some great stuff in his written past.Now I know why.Turns out that \\"It Had to be You,\\" is the story of Daniel Stephenson, getting up to just about the point where he's in in \\"He's the One.\\" This was great, even if I did already know the ending as I'd read them out of order. Daniel is an easy-to-identify-with character for me (no buff jock, just a slim guy; no massively successful job, just an entry level second-attempt-at-a-career). He's still hurt over the betrayal of his last boyfriend, still a little damaged over the revelation that yet another friend is slowly dying of AIDS, and just about ripe for falling head over heels with the hunky guy across the street. Basically, he's a knight in slightly tarnished and dented armor (or at least a sequined gown).The trouble being that the guy across the street lives with a woman, seems about as straight as they come, and probably won't react well to Daniel's previous career as a female impersonator who mostly did Lady 2Di4, a Princess Diana tribute. Uh oh.The wit is just as sharp in this one as in \\"He's the One,\\" - and just as often nicely balanced with some poignancy that doesn't over-sweeten to saccharine levels. And I must say I am now a firm fan of all things Timothy James Beck. I really hope to see more books out of him.'Nathan"},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"Overall, Beck has created a main character who is easy to identify with. Daniel Stephenson, the main character is thrown obstacle after obstacle on his way to finding true love and a new career. I couldn't wait to see what would happen to him next and was continually surprised by the outcome. Most of the time, I found myself laughing outloud at Daniel's quirky reactions to these situations he's been dealt. There were a few time that I felt the back story was a little lengthy, but it didn't stand in the way of the overall enjoyment this novel provided. I can definitely say I look forward to Beck's future endeavors."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"After reading He's the One by Timothy James Beck, I simply had to read the other two books by said author. It Had to Be You was the first book written about the identical group of friends. I enjoyed both books immensely, but probably would have enjoyed this one more if I had read it first. I already knew how it would conclude, because He's the One picks following the familiar characters approximately a year later.Timothy James Beck is incredibly talented when creating characters the reader cares about. I feel as if I know this group of New Yorker's well enough to consider them friends of my own. The love story between Daniel and Blaine is as endearing as the relationships between both the group of gay friends and that of Daniel and Sheila.However, if there was on thing I did not fully appreciate about the book, it had to be the cover. The photos of the two handsome men on the cover did not at all meet the visualizations I made of the characters as I was reading. I fell the publisher would have been better off to let us the readers picture in our mind the perfectly chiseled good looks of Blaine and the masculine beauty of Daniel.Because the first two books in the series were so enjoyable, I will begin to read I'm your Man as soon as I post this. I simply can't wait to see what adventures happen to these individuals next."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"It is great to actually look at the world through someone else's eyes. And this is what Timothy James Beck does. Daniel is a great protagonist and by the very first page, we are welcomed to see his world and step into his quite large high heels.The novel is peppered with so many wonderful characters: the closeted love interest Blaine, the fresh-from-the-farm ingenue Sheila, the drag diva-in-training Martin and the dowager drag queen Ken. But it's not enough. You are left wanting more, needing them to live and breathe like Daniel does.But it is a wonderful debut, reminding me of Rettenmund's Boy Culture as well as McLaughlin's Glamorpuss. I wonder what his second book, He's The One, has in store?"},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"Timothy James Beck's &quot;It Had To Be You&quot; has to be my favorite gay novel published this year. Many apartment hunters know that real estate is all about location, location, location and many gay novels follow that same rule, getting bogged down in the details of the setting. When Daniel Stephenson, Beck's main character, &quot;tossed the tiara&quot; and got a life by relocating to a new apartment in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, I not only cheered him on, but wanted to move there myself when I finished the book. Beck does such an amazing job of describing the locations used in Manhattan that I often felt transported to the lobby of Club Chaos, the streets of Hell's Kitchen or a lively brunch with Daniel and his larger than life Aunt Jen. Not only is Daniel Stephenson an introspective and endearing main character, but like the aforementioned Aunt Jen, Beck surrounds him with a cast of enjoyable supporting characters. Paternal best friend Ken, jocular and scathing Martin, caustic club owning Andy, lesbian financial vegan Gretchen, youthful and vibrant Sheila and the enigmatic stud Blaine make up a realistic and fresh &quot;family&quot; for Daniel. And who wouldn't want to be Aunt Jen's favorite nephew? Beck's characters are not the cookie cutter-stereotypes usually found in gay novels. Being gay is not always equated with camp. Lesbians are not flannel wearing man-haters. And straight people are certainly not the enemy. People are people in Beck's book, which is why the characters remain realistic. It Had To Be You is a charming journey for any reader, straight or gay, male or female, as it explores the modern definition of family, the rollercoaster ride of love and shows us positive ways to deal with the idiosyncrasies of life. Timothy James Beck is on my top shelf, along with Joe Keenan, Felice Picano, Ethan Mordden, Matthew Rettenmund and Christian McLaughlin. And I hope Beck's career grows and blossoms like a flower in Daniel Stephenson's garden."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"Timothy James Beck's first novel in the series of now three is an entertaining and heavily character-developed piece of gay fiction. The author (or authors I should say as TJB is actually a writing team of three) shows us the gay culture in NYC through the eyes of Daniel who evolves in to a more fully aware self-confident individual who I'm getting to like more and more. I actually read this book after He's the One, the second of the trilogy. It was interesting to read the back-story after you already know the characters. The story is told in a credible manner with the best theme being that of the development of the characters, yet again. This likely won't keep you up at night reading in to the early hours of the morning, but does make a good attempt at some light hearted humor and a story that makes gay readers feel good about themselves and sense the possibilities that surround us every day."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"This was the most entertaining story I have read in ages! An excellent mix of lighthearted humor, touching drama, and a keen look into the modern gay world, told through the eyes of a very likeable and engaging character. The dialogue in this book cannot be surpassed...it flows as easily from the page into your heart as any conversation you might have with your dearest friends. Mr. Beck has given the reader a veritable &quot;bag&quot; of unforgettable characters, ranging from the eccentric to the down-to-earth, all woven into a very charming story that I found impossible to put down. I recommend this book to all people...however, I would add that it is a must-read for those in, or those touched by the gay community. The detailed and enveloping descriptions of gay life in the city, the drag scene, and the interwoven relationships between all of the characters...the extended &quot;family&quot; that so many gay people have come to rely on, is so accurate and heartwarming that I actually felt at-home within this wonderful story. My congratulations to Beck for an impressive and endearing tale that was an absolute pleasure to read."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"I really love this book. I have a best friend who does drag and was thinking about giving it all up. This book made me understand what she was going through. PLUS I think everyone can feel like Daniel. We also all want a Blaine in our life. This is the first in a series I would suggest them to everyone."},{"Title":"It Had to Be You","review":"This morning, one of my girl friends called to discuss plans for the day. When she asked what I was doing, I hesitantly admitted that I was reading one of my gay romance novels, as I was in a \\"happy romance mood.\\" (YUCK!) But this book was so good, that I had to admit it.This first novel by Beck takes us through life with Daniel Stephenson, a young man from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, who ran away to Manhattan to follow his dreams. When we first meet Daniel, he's working in his refuge, a small garden off his apartment in Hell's Kitchen. He is lamenting the lack of direction in his life. At the forefront of his worries is that fact that after Princess Diana's death, he walked (or more appropriately ran) away from his life as Princess 2Di4, a drag queen of his own creation based upon Diana's life. Additionally, he is not quite sure that he has moved on after breaking up with his ex, Jeremy. The only thing holding him together are his close friends, his garden, and . . . \\"Five thirty-three\\" - the guy he watches from afar.As with Beck's second novel, this is more than a love story. It's amazing how often I found myself understanding the emotions Daniel was going through regarding his future. Should he keep performing as 2Di4, when his heart wasn't there? Would his friends reject him? Was this just one more thing his family would latch onto to make him uncomfortable? Was he ready for a real relationship after the problems in his past? All these questions and more have swirled in my head, as they probably have in others. So although I have no comprehension of his struggles giving up his act as 2Di4 (I'm just not the dress-up kind of guy), I readily relate to his worries and concerns about the future.What makes this story even better is that Daniel's friends are also explored fairly well, so we're not just left with random names dropped throughout the story. Whether it be Daniel's old friends, Ken and Martin, who worked with him in the drag shows, or new ones like Sheila (an aspiring model) and Blaine (his new interest). They all add to Daniel's story, making us see him through their eyes and words as well. My only wish is that Beck would write stories about all of them as well, just so I can feed my desire to hear more about these men and women.You know, after reading \\"He's the One,\\" and writing an Amazon review, I received a note from Beck, suggesting that I convince my boyfriend to buy this for me as well. That message was prophetic. He and I stopped in a book store after our Valentine's Day special dinner, and he bought this book for me. I'm here to tell you it was a wonderful gift. I anxiously await Beck's next novel, \\"I'm Your Man\\" later this year, at which time I will get my special guy to buy it for me as well! (Shhh, don't tell.) Until then, I may have to reread these a time or two. Hope you'll do the same!"},{"Title":"The Abortionist: A Woman against the Law","review":"This book was phenomenal. Before I read it, I had no idea this story was so close to home, either (set in Portland, Oregon.) This book gives a very clear look at what life was like for women before Roe v Wade, and before women were allowed to have control over their reproduction. For anyone who wants to make abortion illegal on either a federal or a state level, all they have to do is read this book. Those laws hurt women more than they help. I encourage anyone to read this."},{"Title":"The Abortionist: A Woman against the Law","review":"I found \\"The Abortionist\\" to be oddly biased in the extreme. The book is very well-researched with regard to the history of illegal, and therefore clandestine, abortions in America, pre-Roe vs. Wade. However, the author seems to rank the various reigning members of the abortion subculture of the time period in what, to me, was a highly strange manner. For example, Ruth, a chiropractor/abortionist wielding a metal instrument, is almost held up as an altruistic folk hero in the book, whereas a businessman named Rankin, who attempted to find trained and licensed MEDICAL DOCTORS to perform abortions, rather than chiropractors like Ruth, is depicted in an exaggeratedly harsh and derogatory manner. Since Ruth managed to earn several million dollars from her illegal abortion fees, I personally fail to see how a non-medical chiropractor like her could be considered a \\"better person\\" or more in tune with the needs of desperate pregnant women than a man who tried to get medical personnel involved. Had I been around then and in need of such a service, I'd have wanted to see a real doctor - not some fake one. All of this made for a very disconcerting read."},{"Title":"The Abortionist: A Woman against the Law","review":"I actually liked this book, for the most part, but I was led to believe that this would be a book about a female abortionist; what I read was a book mostly devoted to the *era* in which she practiced. I really wanted to get to know Ruth as a person, not just Ruth as abortionist. This book doesn't give you too many glimpses of her life - the majority of this \\"biography\\" is about abortion syndicates and trials. I would be tempted to read her daughter's memoir (autobiography?) but if it's written the way she's quoted in the book, I doubt I'd read the whole thing."},{"Title":"The Abortionist: A Woman against the Law","review":"This book chronicles the life and work of a woman flying just below the radar of the legal system of the time. It's a difficult subject, and the book addresses it in a straightforward way. Some readers may find the treatment too frank. But it's well written, and if you can manage the subject matter, a riveting story."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"The inimitable and dapper Lucifer Fox, doyenne of Edwardian London society. He's handsome, debonair, and admittedly bisexual, and also lives at Number Nine Downing Street, \\"because someone has to.\\" Lucifer is an artist by day, and a cold, calculating killer, by night, a ruthless assassin for the British government. So it comes as no surprise, that in the opening chapter The Vesuvius Club, we see him casually disposing of an enemy of the State.When Professors Verdigris and Sash, two prominent scientists are discovered murdered, Mr. Joshua Reynolds, a dwarf in the employ of The Royal Academy of Arts, entrusts Lucifer with the task of finding the perpetrator. The scientists chosen field was something rather bewildering, to do with the molten core of the earth. They ended up forming some sort of research team and traveling to Italy. His search for their killers isn't as easy as Lucifer first thought, and as the trail thickens, our intrepid hero finds himself in danger of his life.Author, Mark Gatiss peppers his narrative with eccentric Edwardian characters, \\"whey faced poets, frayed-cuffed artists; all the splendid flotsam of bohemian London life.\\" Lucifer is equally at home in both London's Imperial grandeur as he is in the underworld of crazed vice that seethes beneath. He's a man who is geographically at the very beating heart of the Empire, yet as much as an outcast as the greatest of his calling has been.Lucifer's search for the missing scientists eventually takes him to Naples, where he meets Charlie Jackpot, a young hunk, who also becomes his lover and servant. Charlie introduces him to the Vesuvius Club, a den of iniquity that in reality is a front for a sinister and catastrophic plan to destroy the world.Gatiss has become popular writing the popular Dr. Who novels, and their trademark structure is evident here. Each chapter carefully plotted with a huge revelation and climax at the end of each. Layer by layer, character by character, mystery by mystery, the insidious and theatrical plot is revealed, more clues unveiled, all leading to the same, and irrevocable conclusion that the scientists have most likely met an untimely end, and that only Lucifer can possibly save the world.Gatiss deliciously portrays a society roiling with pimps, tarts, and harlots, and where Edwardian sexual ambiguity reigns supreme. There's evenings of flagrant debauch, especially at the Vesuvius Club, where the primary protagonists are deceitful and amoral, taking pleasure at the prospect of doing harm to other, especially to Charlie and Lucifer. Other cast members prove surprisingly resourceful, although frequently compromised.Gatiss also has an impressive command of idiom, capturing the sycophantic nature of the era in all its self-congratulatory grandeur. Full of dotty and eccentric characters with names like Everard Supple, Miss Fullalove, Jocelyn Poop, and Bella Pock, the author has created a world of thrilling ancient antiquity and combined this with all the excitement of a turn-of the century Dickensian thriller. Mike Leonard November 05."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"I rarely give out five stars but this stylish, aloofly decadent novella is worth it. A tongue in cheek look borrowed from Wilde and partly from Flemming's delightful Bond. Lucifer Box is the perfect Victorian gentlemen, with their respect for values and morals-only upheld in the most hypocritical sense, devastatingly beautiful and leading the most successful dual personality since The importance of being Earnest. A bit of fluff certainly, blending all genres into one from horror-gothic, romance, drama and tragedy. With an exaggerated air for the melodramatic, Gatiss leads us on the most addictive journey around England and the 'continent'. One can almost smell the orchids and feel the sweltering heat of Italy and see the finely cut suits of Mr. Box as he fights 'the forces of evil' impecabbly cut and dressed with a dashing mysterious femme fatale hanging off his arm. Mr. Box explores all that is truely 'Victorian' (in the most underworld, revealing meaning) in a laugh out loud, yet charismatically seductive way. Read it. Well done Gatiss, a true tour de force."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"Since the plot has been sufficiently covered, I'll just say that I picked this book up on a whim and I'm so utterly glad I did. I believe one of the reviews said it best in that one *despairs* when they see the pages disappearing behind them. Fantastically likeable protaginist, deliciously melodramtic plot, and a extrodinarily satisfying sending up of the Bond Girl. I've finished it but I can't bring myself to put it back on the shelf, so it's also proving itself to be quite re-readable. Honestly one of the most enjoyable books I've read in ages."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"This is, without doubt, the weirdest book that I've ever read. Try to imagine a mixture of James Bond, complete with a government license to kill, a cast of characters with Dickensian names like Jocelyn Poop and Tom Bowler, and an Oscar Wilde dandy, complete with an orchid in his button hole(except that this one is openly bi-sexual), and immerse the whole scene in the foggy, filthy London of the early 20th century, complete with cab chases and bawdy houses. Then take a massive step away from that into a sci-fi scenario of Naples at the foot of Mt.Vesuvius, and home to a brothel and opium den which caters to the most depraved tastes and is peopled, in the background, by zombies, serving a crazed master who plans to ignite the volcano, seeking revenge for a supposedly wronged father. The writing is rather elegant but the subject matter reminds me of the old serials one saw at the pictures on a Saturday afternoon, where the backgrounds were quite obviously made of papiermache. It was all a bit much for this reader!"},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"I sort of won a free edition of this book through a Simon & Schuster UK LiveJournal giveaway. I'm so grateful for my wicked good luck, I'm writing a review! If it encourages anyone to pick up this novel (which you should do), I hope you enjoy it as much as I did (and I'm sure you will).Lucifer Box is a socialite and a portraitist with dashing good looks, but he's also one of Britain's most witty secret agents working for His Majesty's Government. The Vesuvius Club is a first-person narrative of Edwardian high society with a behind-the-scenes (most secret) look at the people churning the cogs that make the world go \`round.This early 20th century who-dunnit tale is punctuated with black ink illustrations that are, appropriately enough, as grotesque and disturbing as some of the weird and dangerous goings-on in the novel itself. Lucifer mixes business with pleasure as he works to pay off a debt of indiscretion known only to him and his boss, Joshua Reynolds. The novel opens with a dazzling display of an artistry of the most deadly variety: a ruse to lure the Honourable Everard Supple into complacency and entrapment exercised by Mr. Box's indulgent talent for portraiture and a taste for fine dining. Soon after the messy deed is executed and with souvenir in hand, Lucifer makes his drunken way to the men's lavatory inside the Royal Academy of Art. A good sit and few minutes of waiting reveals a ludicrous meeting between Lucifer and Joshua Reynolds in a headquarters of the \\"Get Smart\\" variety. Cleverly (Or stupidly. Lucifer never mentions if the loos actually work) hidden between the stalls, JR assigns Lucifer's next assignment: Two highly respected scientists have died within a day of each other and the estimable Jocelyn Poop (agent to His Majesty and directly employed under Joshua), hot on their trail of evidence, has gone missing.It's up to Lucifer to discover the connection between Poop's disappearance and the mysterious death of the two geologists. To bring all matters to justice begins an investigative journey of near-fatal carriage chases and harrowing, death-defying encounters. Lucifer must contend with all manner of sundry folk and hired help, opium dens, volcanoes, and pleasure domes, all while courting the lovely Bella Pok. And let no one (man or woman), however delectable, stand in his way. There is no task too difficult, no road too winding, no mountain too high, and no partner too unwilling to prevent Lucifer from discovering the horrific truths behind the mysterious Vesuvius Club and the vengeful motivations of a very injured and abandoned human being.Imagine Artemis Fowl without magic, fairies, trolls and the usual fantastic iterations. Let him simmer until he grows very much into an adult. He remains egotistical and enjoys the finer things in life--no discretions made. Mix in a little of the mysteriousness of James Bond and detective work of Sherlock Holmes and this modest concoction reveals itself in Mark Gatiss's magnificently pleasant and serpentine plot of murder, revenge, sex, and scandal.Mark Gatiss spins a delightfully refreshing mystery with witty prose, engaging characters, fantastic names, and a playful atmosphere. Lucifer's world is an indulgent one with plush velvets, immaculately tailored garments, fine cigarettes, and devilish secrets. The Vesuvius Club is hilarious and horrific--a fantastic blend of the elements that make for an engrossing and thrilling read full of surprises that kept me reading well into the night. At 240 pages the only crime Gatiss commits is leaving us with such a short installment of Lucifer's witty and instructive inner dialogue. The good news? There's already a second Lucifer Box novel available to whet one's appetite until the third installment arrives later this month."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"You know this is going to be a saucy book from the very first line: \\"I have always been an appalling judge of character.

I love his style and that indefinable something about his personality. He's just so adorable. So delving into this audiobook, read by the author, was inevitable. And this book delivers in everything I was expecting from a novel by Mr. Gatiss. It's sharply witty, a touch macabre and grotesque, and a thorough romp. The absurd names he gives his characters is already a hint that this story is just a fun ride that should not be taken too seriously. It starts off a little rambly, as the reader gets to experience a few days in the life of Lucifer Box as he does a little research into his assignment and has to deal with the consequences of his very active social life. But when circumstances snowball and the need to solve the mystery of the missing agent becomes urgent, the story picks up it's pace.With the twists and turns of the plot, the story also becomes more bizarre and less believable. Lucifer gets into some ridiculous scrapes, and the eventual resolution plays on all the tropes of the maniacal uber-villain. The resolution does come at you fast, with about a dozen things happening at once which made for a very compelling listen. It's a light and fun story with broad, comical characterizations, a charmingly egotistical dandy as narrator and multiple plot threads that are resolved neatly in the end."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"I loved this book, and Lucifer Box! A complex and delightfully absurd novel set in the early 20th Century, it sets up the series, of which there are two more book... I am about to order the second one now. Mark Gatiss is, of course, an experienced writer with two Dr. Who episodes and a couple of Sherlock Holmes episodes to his credit. Clearly he had loads of fun with this one."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"This is funny and witty and stylish and did I mention funny. Mark Gatiss has a great sense of humour, very tongue in cheek and he knows how to make up the best character's name in history.But don't be fooled by the apparent triviality of it all, this book also has a serious plot and lots of twists that will keep you on edge all along.With likable and charismatic characters, this is definitely a must read."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"I was very impressed with 'The Vesuvius Club', the 1st Lucifer Box story written by Mark Gatiss. You are going to be in a for a treat when the 2nd line of the title is \\"A Bit of Fluff\\". Kids - from that point on, hold fast, hold tight!The first pages suck you in with the colorful descriptions of Box's Edwardian bohemian world. You are truly transported to Box's studio where he is entertaining his latest client, because, after all, Lucifer Box is a portraitist. An artist...a calculating assassin in the service of His Majesty's Government. The whole story is told from Box's point of view and is an absolute thrill ride as our hero escapes attempts on his own life as quickly as he dispatches those set against him. Another point is Lucifer Box is very...flexible and enjoys the beauty of both the male & female physique.I won't reveal any of the plot, because it is just too delicious! But the names of the characters ( Everard Supple, Jocelyn Poop, Cretaceous Unmann, Bella Pok, Charlie Jackpot) harkens back to the wonderful days of Ian Fleming writing James Bond - and a plotline not unlike those villians. An enjoyable romp - get your hands on the book and fall in love with dear, gorgeous, murderous Lucifer Box!"},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"Naughty, bawdy, silly, witty, over-the-top.Just a few ways to describe Mark Gatiss's rollicking caper - which I enjoyed enormously.Sure, it can be described as Sherlock Holmes meets James Bond (if they'd been brave enough to cast the estimable, dishy Rupert Everett in the role), but it seems to share more DNA with a lesser known British export, The Assassination Bureau, a film starring Oliver Reed and Diana Rigg. Like The Vesuvius Club it's an anachronistic mash-up of Edwardian starch, wild espionage spoof and hippie era sex comedy. In a word - delightful.What I enjoyed most about the whole affair was that, at the heart of it, narrator and ostensible \\"hero\\" Lucifer Box, is rather a pompous ass. I suspect author Mark Gatiss is taking sly aim at the English class system, using the preening, egotistical Box as the perfect model of (in the parlance of Monty Python) the upper-class twit. Time and again, we see that Box's mission would fail utterly without the help of his \\"domestics,\\" the servants and underlings who aide him nearly every step of the way - whether it be with investigating, researching, alluding capture or fisticuffs. Unlike with Holmes, there isn't a lot of deduction going on here, as every revelation seems to come to Box by chance or after the fact entirely. Despite all that, he continues to trumpet his virtues throughout. The only area in which he doesn't appear to overestimate his abilities, is in his powers of attraction, as evidenced by his multitude of conquests - both male and female. A fact that adds a delicous level of subversiveness to the proceedings.This is a terrific, light romp - outlandish, funny, sexy - even a bit suspenseful and surprising. Perfect for a hot, lazy day at the beach."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"One of the more fascinating things about the cleverly written The Vesuvius Club by Mark Gatiss is that the story's protagonist, Lucifer Box, is a renaissance man extraordinaire. Forget that the story takes place in Edwardian England, or even that Lucifer is a second-rate portraitist and secret agent; note, rather, how his inhibitions and peccadilloes know no gender. That the reader will start the adventure around Box's womanly indiscretions and lead somewhere...else...is simply the sheer flippancy of such a piece of fluff, as subtitled by Gatiss. Box is perhaps an anachronistic anomaly, parading around and performing his HMS duties in a spirit of glam that would make David Bowie proud.Said somewhere else covers a time and place when audiences weren't surrounded with formulaic, contrived villains trying to conquer and/or destroy the world. No, The Vesuvius Club is something different. Box's work for His Majesty's Service is more of a satire of what Bond and Bourne were combating when things were simpler, when your average villains had something smaller and more bizarre in their sights, like say, a volcano. Apart from the setting, Gatiss excels in his descriptions of eerily misty London cemeteries and runaway hansoms, hazy and writhing opium dens and slightly off antagonists. From London to Naples, the reader is carried swiftly in bewilderment in an overly witty, bizarre, and humorous adventure."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"Mark Gatiss as a writer represents a wonderful mix of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sax Rhomer and Monty Python. Part of the fun of the book is discovering the plot, so I won't divulge too much. You just need to know the action takes place in Edwardian England, where Lucifer Box is not only a revered painter and danddy. But, also a very active spy for King Edward's secret services, fighting his way from London to Naples to uncover a secret society plotting nothing less than the end of the modern world. There are many twists and turns, with witty dialogue Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond would have been jealous of. The plot is very fanciful and moves briskly, but Gatiss never lets a dull moment slip in. The humor is fresh and very British. There are some very kinky moments, but those are treated with taste and a sense of fun that is just irresisitible. Let's hope this is the beginning of a long series of novels. Just like James Bond, Lucifer Box will return in \\"The Devil in Amber\\" already published. Be there, before Hollywood jumps on the Lucifer Box bandwagon. Maybe Mark Gatiss has created here the Indiana Jones of the 21st Century. No small feat for a hero rubbing shoulders wth Oscar Wilde and the toast of early 20th Century London.

After debriefing his handler in a public bathroom he is asked to investigate the death of Jocelyn Poop, a diplomat in Naples who spies for England.Poop sent a wire before his death mentioning two scientists studying volcanic activity, dying within days of each other in what looks like natural causes but the coincidence of these deaths so close is very suspicious. The funeral parlor that performed the burial is based in England and Naples. Lucifer visits and opens the coffin of one of the scientists but the body is gone. The other scientist's body is also missing. Believing the answer is in Naples, Lucifer travels there only to encounter THE VESUVIUS CLUB a secret organization that plans to destroy that part of the world unless Lucifer can kill the leaders and stop the ticking time bomb.This is a tongue in cheek version of James Bond only more earthy, decedent and reminiscent of the last depraved days of the Roman Empire. The protagonist is a very naughty man who is a hedonist at heart and gets his jollies from knowing he is one of the saviors of the British Empire. This is not a book to be taken seriously but a work to be enjoyed for its earthly humor, fun characters, and fine setting.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"This starts OK with our enjoyable scarlet pimpernel dilettante character being frightfully sophisticated, and Gatiss generally does a good job playing with the irony of, say, the hero being far more concerned with tiny blood splatters ruining his linen suit than with the horribly dismembered corpse confronting him. Moreover he soon captured the feel of Conan-Doyle's turn of the century Europe, civilised private clubs of ludicrous pretentiousness and excess lounging among disease ridden hovels. After a chapter or two I was looking forward to a thriller with a comic edge in an interesting historical setting populated by charmingly eccentric/exotic/appalling characters.Alas, having completed the book I can now recommend you stop reading fairly early and just enjoy the promise. It peaked about ten pages in, and by halfway had become a chore. We soon lose the sophistication and descend into James Bond (circa Roger Moore) farce. The sex couldn't be any more gratuitous. In fact it's beyond gratuity and yet another story with an immoral - Gatiss goes to some pains to affront/instruct anyone who might be as contemptible as to not advocate promiscuous bisexuality.It fails on so many levels. The lead character, billed as the ultimate cunning spy, only once does something arguably clever (with plaster of paris) while far more consistently acting stupidly. Marlowe-like he just bowls on into known highly dangerous places without a plan, but in contrast he has no wit or core nobility to excuse this. Alternatively he blithely exucutes an unsuspecting, unarmed man as he dines, having his staff clean up the body: did I miss what was particularly dashing and entertaining here? The villains are lifted straight from Batman (TV, not film), as is the absurd climax (and don't even start me on the groan-inducing, forehead smacking twist revelation at the end). Maybe, just maybe, some of this could have been successful as wry satire, but Gatiss seems to want us to glorify this derivative mess as some sort of \`plot'.Stephen Fry praises the book for its depravity, something I can't enjoy in either his or Gatiss' work: however even in some of his seedy books I must grudgingly acknowledge that Fry does show some superb turns of wit. I feel no compunction to acknowledge any such thing in The Vesuvius Club; indeed, if there was no homosexuality in this book I feel pretty certain Fry wouldn't have found much wit to praise in it either."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"This is one of the most bizarre novels I've ever read. The novel starts off very well--witty, light, very British, and poised to be a good historical mystery/thriller. However, almost exactly halfway through, the author introduces mysterious purple gasses, a race of half robot, half zombie people, and an Austin Powers type plan to destroy all of Italy (remember Dr. Evil's Preparation H, with the chain-reaction volcanic eruptions? Yeah, that one). I'm still wondering how the setting switched from turn of the (19th) century England to sci-fi Italy, as well as how the fantastically technical doomsday plan was supposed to be carried out without the aid of modern machinery and computers. I just don't understand how a book can end so very far away from where it began.I would only recommend this book as a joke gift or as an example to use when studying plot trends or shifting genres and things like that."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"I had pretty high hopes for this book because the synopsis makes it sound like everything you could ever ask for in a novel...espionage, intrigue, secret societies bent on world domination, a roguish anti-hero. Unfortunately, I couldn't even make it all the way through. It just got too ridiculous, and the plot was so simplistic it was like watching a cartoon. Another peeve of mine is that it was written in the first person with the main character Lucifer narrating, and he got on my nerves SO MUCH. He's thoroughly obnoxious, and was constantly making these little asides to the reader about how naughty and/or fabulous he feels himself to be. Plus, you can tell the author is trying SO hard to be witty and funny and he goes so over-the-top that it's like nails on a chalkboard."},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","review":"I haven't made it past the fifth chapter in the book and I honestly dread picking it up again.

Given that the book is 398 pages total, according to my abacus that's 8.2% floggers, 4% Turk's Heads, and 35.4% other projects; and the first third of the book covers all the techniques you might possibly need to build everything (and then some). I've no idea what more Mr. Edmundson was looking for, and suspect that Demonia, LeatherMan, Eros Boutique, Il Bolero, and NorthBound Leather wouldn't know either, but perhaps he just wants help remodelling his kitchen. :-)Personally, I thought the book was fantastic. As mentioned above, it's encyclopedic, and coming from a toy conoisseur like me, that's saying something. About the only criticism I can think of is that there's SO much stuff in there that, despite a reasonably clear layout, it feels a bit overwhelming. If you have any interest in bondage toys, though, and (like me) covet BDSM gear beyond what your wallet can keep up with, you should definitely try this book."},{"Title":"The Better Built Bondage Book: A Complete Guide to Making Your Own Sex Toys, Furniture and BDSM Equipment","review":"I am always looking for plans and \\"how to\\" information when it comes to BDSM equipment and technique this is one of the most thurough books I have seen out there. For the price, there is certainly a lot of information crammed into 398 pages.One individual commented on the lack of constuction technique; and all I can say here is, this is a just a concise book of \\"How to\\" not a guide on wood working or leather craft. There are books and videos on the market that delv into those areas and I sincerely do not think the intent of the book is to teach the finer points of construction but rather a simplistic guide to building what you need.

Of the 398 marked paged (i.e. the ones with numbers) it seemed half the book was dedicated to woodworking, leather working, and rope techniques as well as some standard BDSM safety and practice standards you'll find on any BDSM information website. That being wordily said, This book is wonderful for someone who has NEVER picked up a hammer or screwdriver in they're life. It explains fundamentals of laying out designs, and the above mentioned techniques, however half of the plans and projects look like junk, though in the authors defense he did design the majority of the furniture to be easily portable. If I did it over with the knowledge of the books quality yes I'd get it again, for the reason of it does teach how to properly lay out plans and the majority of the leather craft projects look decent. so three stars from me though I'm not a beginner so half the book was wasted on needless information for me.

This is THE book for the crafty kinkster and those who want to be!"},{"Title":"The Better Built Bondage Book: A Complete Guide to Making Your Own Sex Toys, Furniture and BDSM Equipment","review":"This book is wonderful in many ways. First, it contains many great designs for bondage/dungeon gear that one can build for far less money than buying the items commercially. Secondly, it contains a great deal of valuable knowledge and instruction on the many areas involved in building/making these items: carpentry, leatherwork, hardware use, etc. It is a great book for that information alone. Thirdly, there is also a bit of information about BDSM practices and safety as well.The book is divided into seven chapters:IntroductionMaterialsTechniquesSkillsQuickiesProjectsPlansThere is also a glossary and index of toys.There is quite a bit of good advice and information about BDSM in general, and I would consider this book a good starting place for exploring, especially for the DIY (Do It Yourself, also called \\"Makers\\" in some crowds) type person. There are recommendations for additional reading and study, and I heartily agree with the author's choice of information sources.There is information on knots and cords, sanding, sawing, using hammers and screwdrivers, choosing hardware, lumber, upholstery, \\"pervertibles,\\" (everyday items which can be converted for BDSM or sex play), measuring, whip design, and much, much more.The part of the book deals with leatherwork gives a lot of good information for making leather items like whips, collars, and straps that look as good or better than commercial items.There is very limited information in some areas, such as e-stim or electrical play, which I would like to see expanded. The section on re-engineering a remote-controlled toy car control to run a vibrator wirelessly is priceless, and is the only electrical project in the book.Safety is clearly and sanely dealt with, and the impact of properly designing and building furniture and devices which could cause harm if badly done is driven home quite strongly. (As I like to point out, BDSM is to vanilla sex as technical rock climbing is to walking in the woods - greater risk and more reward. People who have a difficult time understanding BDSM might find it helpful to think in those terms. BDSM practiced safely is far less dangerous than climbing.)All in all an outstanding book, highly recommended for those interested in the topic."},{"Title":"The Better Built Bondage Book: A Complete Guide to Making Your Own Sex Toys, Furniture and BDSM Equipment","review":"I had heard good things, but even so, I was impressed by the BBBB. It covers an exceptionally wide variety of projects, enough to keep even the most dedicated toymaker busy for quite some time.Furthermore, the book is clear and easy to follow. The plans, in particular, are excellent. I subscribe to more than one glossy woodworking magazine with more ambiguity in their plans. One feature that I particularly liked was the way the author laid out measurements. As any craftsman knows, some measurements are more important than others: for example, the height and width of a drawer are dictated by the opening it must fit into, but the depth of the drawer is not so critical. All the detailed plans in the book not only show the measurements, but plainly show which measurements are important, and which can vary to suit.As far as I am concerned, this book is the yardstick against which all similar books must be measured."},{"Title":"The Better Built Bondage Book: A Complete Guide to Making Your Own Sex Toys, Furniture and BDSM Equipment","review":"If you are into the lifestyle and want to make your own things to use in the dungeon, then this is a great book.

Hegel is surely one of the most notable figures in German Philosophy. His 'Philosophy of Mind' (also known as 'The Philosophy of Spirit') is the third part of an encyclopaedia work showing, in essence, the dialectical 'nature' of the world as a Notion. In his earlier works in this triad (The 'Logic' and 'The Philosophy of Nature') Hegel dealt with, first, the logically necessary principle of explanation for the world and then, secondly, the essence of nature as prior to the development of the Mind. This work deals with the nature of Mind as it goes from subjectivity to objectivity through the stages Anthropological, Phenomenological and Psychological, producing Absolute Spirit, a notion that is then used by Hegel to explain the moral and legal. This is not an easier book to read; the language is convoluted and it may take several readings to gleam anything useful from it. This is partially due to the difficulty of translating German terms to the English and also partially due to the writing style of Hegel himself. However I do recommend that the reader persevere, as it is a very rewarding book to read. You need not agree entirely with what Hegel says to appreciate his philosophy and see the import of what he is trying to do; explain everything from a position of logical necessity. The accompanying Zusatz is also of great use, as it gives more concrete examples used in the actual lectures Hegel based this work upon. All in all, a momentuous book in the history of Philosophy itself and worth reading for the depth and breadth of ideas contained within it."},{"Title":"Hegel's Philosophy of mind","review":"This work is seminal. Every philosophy after Hegel is either a reaction to him or a footnote. His method has achieved scientific verification in the past century in the areas of developmental psychology (Margaret Mahler), in historicism, in embryological development, and theology (Tillich). It shows that wisdom is timeless and although written 200 years ago, Hegel's truth is valid and not subject to fashions as they so often are in philosophy.This said, I have to say it is not rewarding to read this book unless you have familiarity with German idealism through Kant. Also, a thorough reading of Hegel's Logic is a prerequiste. Few people will understand this book without reading it in the original German as Hegel himself reframes the German language into a new way of thinking. I think all great philosophies shape the language they speak in profound ways. That is why it is so difficult to understand Hegel in English translation. You would have to create a whole new philosophy along Hegelian lines made for the English thinker. This is the daunting task of all translators. There obviously are concepts in Western thought that are portable across &quot;platforms&quot; and this is why translating Hegel happens at all in English. However the way concepts are used, the &quot;process&quot; of the concepts -- the &quot;syntagms&quot; -- is not entirely the same in both languages.I wrote my master's thesis in philosophy on this work. At that time I could think Hegelian with the best of them but have lost the skill. Now I can't even understand what I wrote 20 years after the fact without going back to school. I have not been speaking Hegelian since then. A pity.So, to get the most out of it, read this book in a structured environment where one has easy access to help. It will change your life as it has mine."},{"Title":"Hegel's Philosophy of mind","review":"An advanced course in Hegel is probably the course which shuttled me forward toward a career in philosophy (and, eventually, theology). It is partly the responsibility of Hegel's thought and part my teacher (look up books by DG Leahy if you are interested in the first real new philosophy of the 21st century). Anyway, back to Hegel's &quot;Mind.&quot; In this work, Hegel has created a tour-de-force in systematic philosophy following Kant.though Kant has adopted the dualism of Plato, Hegel's synthesizing of Kant's ideas has resulted in an amazingly complex but understandable and brilliant work. Hegel proposes that the Mind is the second moment in a three-fold syllogism, following Nature but preceeding Logic (Reason). Here, Hegel explores the nuances of the Mind. Though the other two volumes of the three volume set are important, it seems Mind contains all the ideas of the other two.If you enjoy hard German philosophy and have a penchant for the absolute idea, read Hegel as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"Alexander the Great","review":"Doherty lost me completely at page 8 when he states that Phillip II is the one who moved the capital of Macedon to Pella from Aigai, when in fact it was Archelaus some 50 years prior. Such a whopper of an error on something so simple boggles my mind. I made myself read the rest of the book, but have a headache from all the eye rolling.Rather than waste my time explaining the many, many errrors I will say that perhaps Mr. Doherty should stick to fiction. This is a lurid and poorly researched book. Sadly, many people will read it and go away thinking that his version of events is historically accurate."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great","review":"Paul Doherty is the consummate professional when it comes to writing historical novels. I for one do not know how he can be so prolific with his offering of books and yet make sure that each of them is well researched. Whether they be 13th, 14th, or fifteenth century they are always true to the period. He also writes about Ancient Egypt and now he has taken to writing about Alexander the Great. Paul Doherty has the rare talent of making you feel as though you are there, be it medieval England, or battling with Alexander. The sounds and smells of the period seem to waft from the pages of his books.With this non-fiction book Doherty proves that he is much more than just a story-teller, but uses his scholarly background to good advantage. In this book he attempt to unravel some of the mystery surrounding Alexander's death a the extremely young age of 33, in the month of May in 323 BC. Alexander complained of feeling ill while in Babylon. Within 10 days he was dead. A military genius and master tactician who had swept all before him.But how did he die. Paul Doherty looks at the circumstances and scans the possibilities of the great man's death. Some say he was poisoned. It is written in the history books that he lay sweating beside a pool in the palace of the Persian Kings. Had he suffered a heart attack or an overwhelming attacking of malaria. Was he a drunk and an alcoholic? All these things are possibilities. What about the warning Alexander received not to enter Babylon? The author recounts the last days before Alexander's death."},{"Title":"The Exorcist (BFI Modern Classics)","review":"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK WRITEN ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HORROR, &quot;THE EXORCIST.&quot; IT SHOWS MANY PHOTOS AND GREAT INFORMATION ON THE MOVIE, TRAILERS, AND MORE!

In its particulars, this book belongs onthe same shelf as Orson Welles 58-page objection to the studio'smangling of &quot;Touch of Evil.&quot;I was fascinated with theinsights of the artistic conflicts between the director and the authorof the original book upon which the movie is based. He devotes justthe right amount of analysis to the legal fights surrounding theproper credits for Mercedes McCambridge, the 'voice' of the demon, andthe stunt double for the possessed girl, including the famousexorcised 'spider' crawl. He does not allude to the portrayal ofTeilhard de Chardin by Max von Syndow, but does justify his owninsights concerning a homoerotic element not intended by either theauthor or the director, but present within this cinematicclassic.One need not have a personal belief in demonic possession,and the ability of priests to 'exorcise' multiple personalities, totruly enjoy both the movie, and Kermode's medical school Anatomy 301dissection of one of the 100 best movies.

On the one level, it's nice to have a serious book that considers so many angles on the film, the director, and the source material.However, this is now the 3rd edition of this book in about five years. Actually, this is called the 'Revised 2nd Edition'. I bought the first two, now why should I plunk down more money?Mark Kermode is apparently obsessed with this film, maybe a bit too much. As if two books and a part in numerous Exorcist documentaries were not enough for him, we have another edition of the book. Take it easy, Mr. Kermode, it's one movie. I would rather have another BFI book on another Friedkin film (French Connection, Sorcerer, To Live and Die in LA, etc.)If you don't have either of the two previous editions, I would highly recommend this. I'm guessing the update was primarily to address The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen (one of the most shameless movie titles ever), which of course, included scenes Kermose certainly had seen, and written about in the first two books.

Also, if you like this you should definitely rent or buy the new video re-release. It contains a new documentary and the original trailers. It is even better seen in letterbox.

In this one, they take on the horror film \\"The Exorcist\\".Overall, this is a thoughtful analysis that gave me a better understanding of the movie. However, since the book is short (116 pages, about 30 of them pictures), it is not a deep analysis.The author mostly argures that the movie is more than a mere shockfest. Instead, it shows good's triumph over evil, making \\"The Exorcist\\" a deeply spiritual movie. I had realized this on some level, though I never left \\"The Exorcist\\" with the same warm fuzzies I got watching, say, \\"The Bells of St. Mary\\". Some of the scenes that emphasized more of the \\"good\\" were edited out by the director and years later restored in the anniversary version of the movie.Other than that, there is some background on the real-life exorcism that inspired the novel, some interesting trivia, for instance other considerations for the role of the possessed gir's mother (Shirley McClaine, Anne Bancroft). Some symbolism and foreshadowing are also pointed out.Otherwise, the book doesn't go much deeper. For instance, there were obvious \\"homages\\" to Hitchcock in the movie that even I picked up, that weren't in the book. Some, but not many, explanations on choices of camera angles, lighting, etc. And, i don't think the author supported his description of the movie as a \\"deeply\\" textured film....more a \\"moderately\\" textured film.Time is spent describing scenes cut for the original release, but later restored for the anniversary re-release. These descriptions are lenghty and slow, as it was assumed the reader had no conception of the scenes, since the book was written before the restoration. The \\"revised 2nd edition\\" refers mostly to an epilogue at the end of the book that talks a bit about the restoration and the transcript of a discussion between William Peter Blatty and William Friedkin on the restoration.The book still makes an overall quick read and enriches the viewing experience for the casual viewer and movie fan. However, it's not a study of the film, for film students.

Moving with electrifying pace, \\"Music\\" invites the reader to explore seen and unseen worlds -- steel mills, barrio streets, yearnings of the heart -- and compels engagement through a series of engrossing characters. Thematically rich, the novel ultimately belongs to those who believe that working-class people are capable of transforming themselves, and in so doing, change a nation.It is not surprising that the author has received inspiration from John Steinbeck, Theodore Dreiser and James T. Farrell. Following in the footsteps of these men, Rodriguez uses social realism, industrial conflict and immigration as the backdrops to his exploration of the Salcido family's physical and spiritual journey. From the patriarch Procopio's determination to seek a better life in the United States to his granddaughter Azucena's struggle with her Chicana identity, \\"Music\\" unrelentingly analyzes the possibilities and costs of Americanization, the impact of large-scale industries and the human dynamics of families operating under the most severe psychological pressures.Courage abounds in \\"Music.\\" There is the courage of Porcopio, who uproots himself from Mexico and steadfastly creates a new life for his American-born children as a steelworker in the ironically named Nazareth mill. His son, Johnny, exemplifies the courage of sacrifice and commitment; a self-reformed streetwise tough, Johnny rejects the Social Darwinism imposed by the mill. Instead, he opts for social reform and personal integrity. His quiet, unwavering commitment to equality and dignity in the workplace is iconic. Johnny's daughter, Azucena, demonstrates a different type of courage. Assimilated but rootless, spiritually impoverished and angry, Azucena's life spirals out of control. Yet, in acts of nearly invisible strength, she summons a rekindled ethnic awareness to save her own life.This is not a tidy book. Characters have genuine flaws, and their defects often impede their growth. The miseries of alcohol and drug addiction, poverty and gang warfare often destroy otherwise decent people. It is to Rodriguez' credit that he perceives these indices of social degradation as the outcroppings of a capitalistic society; the Nazareth steel mill is naturalistically indifferent to the sufferings of its workers and the city of Los Angeles takes little action to stop young Mexican-Americans from killing each other. \\"Music\\" shows how people, faced with seemingly insurmountable odds, can muster the strength to challenge social evil. If there is any justice gained by people like Johnny and his resourceful, wise wife Aracely, it is imperfect and hard-earned.Three generations ago, the Joad family captured the national imagination in John Steinbeck's \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\" Luis J. Rodriguez inspiring, gritty \\"Music of the Mill\\" will remind us that novelists can create works that remind us that liberty, equality and justice are forged by people like the Salcidos. In honoring their struggle, Rodriguez refines our national purpose."},{"Title":"Music of the Mill: A Novel","review":"Heavily based on the author's own experiences working at Bethlehem Steel and running with L.A. barrio street gangsters, this multigenerational novel often sags under the weight of its sociopolitical message. I'm a big fan of the novel as social history and of social realism -- and when the book sticks to those elements, it largely succeeds. However, it often slips into awkward didactic lectures about capitalism and social justice.In the first third of the book, we meet teenage Procopio Salcido in the 1940s, as he leaves his drought-ridden Mexican state for a better life in the U.S., eventually making his way to L.A. and landing a job at a huge steel mill. The story of his journey, especially his involvement with striking miners in Arizona, is quite compelling. Similarly, the initial descriptions of the mighty mill at work, and the racial divisions between the men who work there, are fascinating.The middle third of the book follows Procopio's tearaway son Johnny, who, as a teenager, becomes involved with a local Chicano street gang. After a stint in jail, he joins his father and brothers at the mill, and embarks on his own journey. This builds up to the central plotline -- Johnny's leadership of a multiethnic coalition to challenge the good-old-boy racist union leadership in the early '70s. The various cultural divisions are all handled fairly well, as is Johnny's slowly growing interest in Communism. The constant threat of an industrial \\"accident\\" engineered by the scheming racists who wish to maintain their (im)balance of power at the plant looms large throughout.Set in the late '80s, the final third of the book revolves around Johnny's daughter Azucena, whom we see veer from good girl to drug addicted teenage mother. This parallels the collapse of big steel in the U.S., the closure of the plant, and the ensuing unemployment and social devastation. Her journey from gangbanger arm candy to indigenous culture activist and torch song singer is both less interesting and more cliched in many ways than the previous histories of Procopio and Johnny.As social history, some of this is quite interesting. The sections that take place in the steel mill itself are excellent recreations of a lost time and place, and vividly evoke the blood, sweat, and stoicism of heavy industrial work. However, one has to slog through so many heavy handed explanations of class and racial oppression that most readers will probably not find it worth the energy it takes. It's a shame, because although I am personally sympathetic to the broad progressive message of the book, I can't bring myself to recommend it."},{"Title":"Music of the Mill: A Novel","review":"Mr. Rodriguez attempts (with mixed results) to relate the story of three generations of one Mexican American family's life in working class Los Angeles. The center of the story is the steel mill which has provided the family with an income until its closure.Having grown up in Los Angeles, I enjoyed the descriptions of places and events which I can recall. The final section of the novel weakens slightly, but only because it seems to cover as much ground with a shorter amount of words. ***Get Ry Cooder's CD \\"Chavez Ravine\\" and play it as a soundtrack! ***"},{"Title":"The Artificial Kid (Context (San Francisco).)","review":"I'd have to say the artificial kid is my favorite Sterling Book.

With Sterling I gave it the entire book and what a waste of good ink. I enjoy reading junk mail more than this dribble. I typically enjoy Sterling and think he has done well for the craft - but this is a stinker. The Kid is uni-dimensional, Moses-Moses never reaches his potential to impact the story and Twice-borne rounds out a crew that never really endears the reader to struggle to the next page. The plot wanders around from one disjointed event to another without interest or credibility. I secretly hoped for a flock of flying talking dogs to carry them away from the floating island - anything to add some reality and substance to the plot.

Sorry Bru everyone has a bad hair day once in a while."},{"Title":"The Artificial Kid (Context (San Francisco).)","review":"I found this book in the library, of all places, back when I was in junior high school in 1982. Crouched between all that hoary Silverberg and Simak that I didn't want to read, it said &quot;Psssst!&quot;. I haven't been the same since. The Kid jumped out and smacked me across the forehead with his lush, tweaked-out postpunk setting and sweeping, interconnected plot. A little bit of old-world pangalacticism, a little futuristic DIY chopsocky, a bunch of toungues in cheeks, and loads of high-tech wetware polymers and lurching biomasses, from before wetware polymers and lurching biomasses were cool. And all the while, Sterling's trademark core of optimism shines through.It's taken the world about ten years to catch up to this baby, and it's about damn time.

While his second novel isn't nearly as polished as his later classic \\"Schisimatrix\\", it does explore in embroyonic form, some of the same issues of identity and what it means to be human, that he did quite remarkably well in his mid 1980s work. I couldn't help but laugh as I worked my way through the pages of Sterling's early novel, observing that it's nearly as funny as some of Harlan Ellison's best satirical short fiction. For anyone who wishes to understand Sterling's development as a leading member of the cyberpunk literary movement, then this early novel of his is required reading."},{"Title":"The Artificial Kid (Context (San Francisco).)","review":"This is such a strange, imaginative, interesting novel -- it's sad that it was out of print for ages, and then Wired Books brought it back, only to let it fall back out of print!

I like Neuromancer from William Gibson, Snow Crash and Diamond Age from Neal Stephenson, and Diaspora and just about everything else from Greg Egan.But I can't recommend \\"Artificial Kid\\" by Bruce Sterling. The ideas behind the story are good. His descriptions are visibly good, but it reads neither like a good story, nor like a tech manual.The problem isn't isolated to this book either. \\"Difference Engine\\" also reads slowly. I can't even pinpoint exactly what it is, other than Bruce Sterling's writings are VERY slow to read and hard to stay focussed on the story. It's almost as if the acting is poor. Dialog, inner and outer, just seems adolescent."},{"Title":"The Artificial Kid (Context (San Francisco).)","review":"Sterling's The Artificial Kid works best as an adventure story with intense action, whose closest relatives would be Japanese anime pictures. He also tries to make this a novel of ideas (longevity, personality worship, identity politics), but they remain largely undeveloped. Nevertheless, its an entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Artificial Kid (Context (San Francisco).)","review":"This was actually Sterling's second novel. Involution Ocean was the first. Most people forget Involution Ocean because it was not cyberpunk. The Artificial Kid is okay, but weak for Sterling. His later works were much more imaginative. The Sterling completist must get this one. For others it is a good read but don't expect a classic."},{"Title":"The Artificial Kid (Context (San Francisco).)","review":"This is the book which got me hooked on Bruce Sterling. A less poundingly gritty world than Gibson's and more playful as a result. It brings together aspects of fame and change - and the adolescent desire to seek one while shunning the other - in an enjoyable combination. The focus is still the action which let me read (and re-read) it for the escapist element."},{"Title":"The Artificial Kid (Context (San Francisco).)","review":"A wealthy man indulges in a sociological experiment, but creating hisown personal corporate society.

The Kid himself is a great character and his friends were all pretty original as well. For the first few chapters it looks like it might be a highly entertaining adventure. After that it gets sort of bogged down and takes a new direction, but on the whole I found it worth the effort. I liked the various warring clans, the individual combatants, the follicle mites and the whole concept of televised (or the equivalent) combat art.Things I didn't like about the book (don't worry, nothing really revealing here): the Flying Island, Crossbow and the Chairman's transformation, a climax you wouldn't exactly call exciting.

I remember when Jill Freedman got to the precinct, we were somewhat apprehensive about the idea of a civilian going on patrol with us and with a camera. It was a time when the Times Square area, especially W42nd St., was not the DisneyWorld it is today but more like Tombstone of old. I became a writer myself (books and short story available on Amazon) and have been mulling the idea of doing a book about those days since few remember how bad the area was anymore and the job we did to make it the garden spot it is today.

Soon you get to know all the players: her husband, her son, the cats, the dogs, the cows, et al. Each one of the stories will elicit some sort of response from the reader, leaving you laughing with acknowledgement at the foibles of humanity, or crying with the sadness that comes from being all too human. I have my favorites, as you will by the time you finish Dancing Skeletons. But what is so remarkable is that Debby has been through much and hasn't yet lost her sense of humor. In this world, we know how valuable that is. I'm not just a friend who is showing support for another author. Trust me. Debby's book is well worth buying.

Open it and out spills photographs of berries and garden settings for simple, cool meals and treats with berries.I love books like this. It reminds me of that thrill that bubbles in the heart when the first blip of green lines the edges of naked, cold tree limbs, when shoots pop their way out of just unhardened soil, when life is renewed again in nature. It's an exciting moment. \\"Berries\\" is like that--full of beauty and grace and poetry in pictures.Kathryn Kleinman captures berries and berry products in two types of photographs: the sharp focus to depict the lush color of the fruit, the prickle of the stems, the fuzziness of the leaves. The other type is grainy, hinting at the antique quality of canning, vinegars, dessert glassware, special jelly jars and serving spoons. One of the most unusual of these is a still life with a wooden bowl of mushrooms, a basket of blackberries, a scattering of huckleberries, some plums, red onions and a pod of garlic. The senses are seared by the odd combination and teased into considering a dish with these ingredients.Another shows a dull blue and gray basket of blueberries, a bottle of port, a spray of lavender, sitting next to a handful of mushrooms, upturned and mysterious.

This book assumes the reader has a working understanding of microcontroller and DSP fundamentals and also a comprehension of programming methodologies. Although the book does discuss media processing systems in general, it often grounds the discussion in concrete examples, and uses the Blackfin processor family as a basis for examples and architectural discussion. An overview of the book follows by chapter:1. Embedded Media Processing - Introduces the concept of embedded media processing and describes how it presents new design challenges. There is an architectural discussion of the Blackfin processor that serves as a foundation for further discussions in the book.2. Memory Systems - Provides a combination of information and examples to shed some light on the wide array of current and upcoming memory technologies. Specifically, the book talks about what types of memory to use and how to connect them in a system.3. Direct Memory Access (DMA) - Describes DMA and relates why it is crucial in an embedded multimedia system. There are numerous examples of how the DMA controller can intelligently move data to save extra passes through the system.4. System Resource Partitioning and Code Optimization - This chapter focuses on processor architectural features that are crucial to understand when developing a complex multimedia system. These features include event generation and handling, instruction pipelines, native addressing modes, and specialized instructions. There are many compiler tips and tricks to make the process of porting existing C/C++ code to an embedded processor as painless as possible.5. Basics of Embedded Audio Processing - The starting point for any embedded system that requires audio processing. The basics of the human auditory system are presented along with sampling theory. Next the book describes how to connect your embedded processor to audio converters or other inputs and outputs. Discussions of audio building blocks, basic programming techniques, fundamental algorithms, and audio and speech compression standards are included.6. Basics of Embedded Image and Video Processing - The \\"need to know\\" video basics are here without getting bogged down by format variations, geographic differences, legacy formats, etc. There is a discussion of video sources and displays that include the basic processing steps in an image pipeline. The chapter includes an example video application - analysis and design.7. Media Processing Frameworks - Targets the problem of how to port media algorithms from larger processors where memory and bandwidth are \\"free\\" to embedded systems that don't have unlimited resources. Describes a variety of programming frameworks that allow you to optimize performance for a given application without needlessly increasing the complexity of the programming model. Benchmarking techniques are described that will help the reader adapt a framework to fit a target application.8. Power Management for Embedded Systems - Acquaints the reader with the many facets of power management on high-performance processors. Included is a detailed discussion of Dynamic Power Management, which is a suite of processor functionality that allows flexible voltage and frequency tuning to meet performance goals while maximizing power savings. Next voltage regulation is covered, starting with an overview of linear regulators and proceeding to step-down switching regulators. Included are recommendations for component selection to aid in circuit design.9. Application Examples - The final chapter picks a few key areas of media processing and delves into the details on the implementation of an algorithm, framework, or system. In doing so, the book leverages the knowledge base of the previous chapters with the intent of showing how the concepts tie together into coherent entities that you can apply to your own embedded media projects.The book includes a CD-ROM which contains VisualDSP++ Test Drive from Analog Devices. This is a fully functional 90-day trial of the VisualDSP++ 4.0 integrated development and debug environment for Blackfin processors. The book also has a companion website that has lots of useful information on embedded media processing includng notes, code examples, white papers, and updates made for the book's second printing.This book is well-illustrated, clear, and detailed in its coverage of this useful but not well understood topic. I highly recommend it to anyone anticipating building an embedded system in which the processing of audio, video, or image data shall occur."},{"Title":"Embedded Media Processing (Embedded Technology)","review":"I bought this book a couple of years ago and only now got to it. First thing I noticed upon pulling it off the shelf was that it had been published by Newnes. Having bought and seen a number of books from this publisher, I don't consider them a decent outfit (they, CMP, and Wordware are the publishing houses whose imprint on a book, for me, means putting it back on the shelf w/o further ado; taught by a consistently disappointing experience, I never buy their books), so I wondered why I did buy this one. The subject is of interest to me, but still... well, I figured it and found it amazing: due to the color scheme of the covers, this book looks like an Intel Press book (Intel Press itself is nothing to write home about, but they certainly are better than Newnes by two orders of magnitude). I got confused! :-) You got me, friends.Moving on, to the book itself: it is totally what you'd expect from Newnes, and that is, it's superficial to the point of uselesness, BUT it is obviously designed to look solid -- and that is achieved by way of picking a \\"hot\\" topic and then mentioning all the correct matters in the table of contents and chapters. This is what you'd notice upon a quick perusal in the bookstore, so they made it look good so you'd buy it. But when you get to read it, all these nice and appropriate chapters turn out to be disjointed, chaotic, and superficial. As well, sometimes, even incorrect: for example it is claimed that the sampling rate must be equal to or higher than double the maximum frequency that is to be captured (Nyquist theorem). This is incorrect, equal won't do: it must be _more_ than twice, period. Small thing? Yes, it's nitpicking perhaps, but it's a very well-known thing, so how come the authors don't know?The book isn't well written either (which is quite in the Newnes style): this means that, while someone familiar with the subject matter will be able to figure out what the authors' verbal muddle means, a more innocent student will immediately be lost -- yet surely it's the newbie who's the target audience here. This is typical for Newnes/CMP and the like publishers, whose publishing process apparently consists in contracting some industry participant (ostensibly qualified by the fact of working in it), getting him to produce the required page count by the necessary date, and then printing the drivel as is, w/o any editing whatsoever.Bottom line: this shoddy book is produced with a complete lack of good faith; the only effort the publisher put in was to make it _look_ like it's interesting (including the visual resemblance to Intel Press books). It's a complete and utter waste of time, not recommended. Btw, it used to be noticeably cheaper than what I see on this page: did the prices go noticeably up recently?

I enjoyed this very much and will keep in my people in British History section."},{"Title":"Royal Panoply: Brief Lives of the English Monarchs","review":"The material in Royal Panoply by Carolly Erickson is condensed, concise and just what I wanted for a quick reference of the English monarchs. I first saw the book in paperback form, and it immediately went on my must-have list. Surprisingly, the paperback version is better than the hard copy. The beautiful colored portrait of each of monarch is next to their bio in the paperback version--not so in the hard copy. Even so, I am exceedingly pleased with the book. The paperback version gets five stars."},{"Title":"Royal Panoply: Brief Lives of the English Monarchs","review":"How wonderfully a-propos to have finished reviewing this book just in time for our Historical Fiction Bloggers Round Table Event!I'd love to start off this review by giving you an all-around basic idea about what the book is about, but there's a lot more to this read than meets the eye. Unlike many of the other books that I enjoy for the pure pleasure of reading, Royal Panoply served much more than just this purpose.Besides its impressive array of English monarchs beginning with William I all the way to Elizabeth II, this book features impressive details that go beyond simply describing royal lives, conquests and fates. Carolly Erickson takes into particular consideration the fact that it may be a reader's first encounter with any or most of these royals. At the beginning of every new sovereign, the author minutely goes back into the life of his or her predecessor to work us up until the particular heir in question. It's only when you're reading and trying to keep track of this incredible genealogy that you come to appreciate this very necessary task so eloquently re-capped.This sort of going back and then taking you forward into the history also helped me see the historical figure from different perspectives. This, added dimension to the characters, as well as the period highlighted. And, as we all have our favorites, it's a special treat when you can read about each of these family dynasties in subsequent order. However, if you prefer to just pick, sort and choose who you'd like to read about, this book offers you the option of doing just that; it can be just as useful and interesting when read in no particular order. The author's re-capping method at the beginning of every new chapter served that purpose wonderfully.It is also possible to use this book as a reference manual when you want to look up a specific monarch, or simply for refreshing your memory while on a different book dealing with a particular historical figure. I was delighted to be able to use this book in precisely that way. I began by reading it through, but then found myself going back to it for reference and research purposes as well.I should however point out that Royal Panoply does not qualify, in my opinion, as an all-around-in-depth bibliography of English monarchs- the obvious reasons being length, accuracies and misses that could not all be contained in one book. This is especially true when one considers the volumes that could (are-were) written for each one. That being said, it remains that this fabulous book is incredibly interesting and definitely a jumpstart to whetting your appetite for reading and learning more about the richness of the English monarchy...Another added bonus- This is a book that never entirely leaves you; being a reference as well as a bibliography selection of sorts, it actually can remain open indefinitely...Useful, interesting and a delight to read. A definite history buff must-have.Beautiful photos as well."},{"Title":"Royal Panoply: Brief Lives of the English Monarchs","review":"I initially read this cover to cover and found it to be, for the most part, very informative. Some kings I already knew quite a bit about (like Henry VIII), and thought their descriptions were a little lacking, others I knew nothing about (like James I), and found the synopsis of their reigns to be very informative.Keep in mind, these are just short overviews of each monarchs reign. Some details are left out, or quickly explained, but you get this gist of what each king and queen accomplished during his or her time on the throne. This book will also be very helpful in the future as a quick reference guide to kings/queens I may happen upon in future novels. Instead of trying to guess or remember who did what and when, I can just check this book and get a quick refresher. A very handy and helpful book to have!"},{"Title":"Royal Panoply: Brief Lives of the English Monarchs","review":"As a lay person, I found this book a fascinating glimpse into the lives of the British Monarchy. Most of my exposure to them has been through plays or movies, touching on a short vignette or period of time. Having recently seen \\"Henry V,\\" I was interested in reading what happened to him after Agincourt. And \\"The Lion in the Winter\\" was a majestic play that left me wondering which of Elinor's sons would become king. This book is easy reading and a delicious look at the royalty."},{"Title":"Royal Panoply: Brief Lives of the English Monarchs","review":"I missunderstood what this was about. I thought that it was about monarchs that had \\"brief\\" reigns. Instead it gives a brief overview of every English monarch. Actually quite boring."},{"Title":"Royal Panoply: Brief Lives of the English Monarchs","review":"Dr. Carolly Erickson is a prolific author of historical fictin as well as excellent nonfiction works. Her area of expertise is in medieval and Renaissance literature. Nevertheless, she does a good job of survey all the English kings and queens from William the Conqeror in 1066 to the reign of Elizabeth II.Along the way the reader will read of countless murders, cabals, plagues, wars, adulteries and dynastic battles for power.There is nothing new here for the serious British historian;the book is written for a popular audience in need of gettingthe basics of British history in their heads. The book would bean excellent resource for courses in English history and literature. It is well illustrated and is a worthy addition to the library. It can be read from cover to cover or a particularmonarch can be studied to coincide with the reader's interest.No matter how many biographies and history of England I have read this book is valuable because it:a. Refreshed my memory on key events that have become murky.b. Reminded me of how the fight for constitutional liberty ina democratic nation was a hard, bitter and complex struggle.Well done and worthy of your time and money!"},{"Title":"Royal Panoply: Brief Lives of the English Monarchs","review":"This is a fun, entertaining overview of the English Monarchs from William 1 thru Elizabeth 2. A nice addition to your library - especially for those anglophiles like me. There are interesting tid bits you don't get in the usual dry biographies. It does cover a lot of ground, but attempts to focus on the person. There is even a little epilogue that reviews historical turning points for England. I would have liked to see information on monarchs prior to William and/or the monarchs of Scotland.......maybe that is fodder for another book."},{"Title":"Royal Panoply: Brief Lives of the English Monarchs","review":"\\"Royal Panoply\\" is an indispensible book for anyone wanting a good, well-written overview of the British monarchy. From William the Conquerer to Elizabeth II, author Carolly Erickson covers the good, the bad and the plain incompetent. It is all of English Royal history in one volume.Carolly Erickson began her career writing about the Tudors and the Stuarts, so it is not surprising that she is at her best when writing about those reigns. Her brief analysis of those characters who limned the golden age of the English renaissance are the best in the book. She is on less sure, and more gossipy, ground in the chapters on the more modern kings and queens of Great Britain.Erickson's later writing has suffered in comparison with her first efforts at historical biography, especially \\"The First Elizabeth\\" and \\"Great Harry.\\" She has even condescended to write historical fiction, a \\"hidden\\" journal of Marie Antoinette.With this valuable volume in hand, the eager student of English history will find fascinating facts and tidbits on all of England's Majesties."},{"Title":"Royal Panoply: Brief Lives of the English Monarchs","review":"I was excited. A brief summary of each and every English monarch. A little information about their reign, the highs and lows, a general overview.Unfortunately Ms Erickson seems to feel that history can be judgmental. She's also extrapolated from the record to slip in her own views of what's going on. I bought a history book that turned out to be part history and part fiction. Sorry, but I prefer my history straight.For those who enjoy history lite, this may be the book for you. For the rest, keep searching. Royal Panoply doesn't hold a candle to the record prepared by Sir Winston Churchill, and while I would like a briefer version of his History, focussed specifically on the monarchy, this particular title just isn't up to that task.In future I'll look at what else the author has published, and stay away from those who've strayed into historical fiction."},{"Title":"Royal Panoply: Brief Lives of the English Monarchs","review":"Starting with William the Conqueror and finishing with Elizabeth II and including every English monarch in between, Carolyn Erickson provides an intriguing overview of the royals and their spouses in a chronological fascinating sweep. Each ruler receives somewhere in the range of seven to twelve pages regardless of historical importance or length on the throne. By going chronological, the reference is easy to read and follow, but repetition also occurs as death marks the end of an era (chapter) and the beginning of the next reign (next chapter). The epigraph that starts each royal provides an interesting perspective on that personage and is especially fascinating with the more famous as the audience sees a somewhat differing view than the textbooks or romance novels. Still the lack of analysis of overarching trends takes somewhat away from a fine look that will elate those who prefer their look at the English monarchy based on facts not tabloids.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Royal Panoply: Brief Lives of the English Monarchs","review":"This book is a great way to learn about the not as popular monarchs from the line of British rulers. It is also a nice look at the ones that you do know well.

A great book for getting a basic idea of the highlights of each reign and popularly held opinions regarding each monarch and his/her life plus a few less well-known tidbits (to me) (little facts like when George I came to rule England all the general public knew of him was that he was a German general who had locked his beautiful wife in a tower for twenty years and killed her lover after he discovered evidence of an adulterous affair).There are times however, when I felt that Erickson oversimplified some of the individuals or took a stand on an event or a personality without substantiating it (you know, statements like: Pomp and Circumstance IV loathed High and Mighty for his superior graces and popularity with the people). Just a little evidence or an allusion to evidence would have made it a much more authoritative work for me. That said, I still enjoyed the book. Hey, and now I can recite the British royal line all the way from William the Conqueror to Elizabeth II!

It is suitable to pick up and just read one chapter if required or even use as a reference book for historical facts."},{"Title":"Royal Panoply: Brief Lives of the English Monarchs","review":"This is a nice overview, especially for an audience, such as myself, who is largely ignorant of English/British history, and the kings and queens who ruled for over 900 years. The book starts with William the Conquer and ends with the present queen. The writing is clear and well presented. It is aimed for a general audience, rather than for scholars of English/British history. Each king or queen is allotted about 9 pages, so this is not an in depth study. The focus is mostly on their behavior and idiosyncrasies, as opposed to the context of the greater European history of the time. However, the book did succeed in giving me a nice overview of the kings and queens and this did fill in a lot about English/British history. I also use it as reference book when I am reading other histories of the time.My only reservation, and the reason why I am not giving the book five-stars, is a lack of genealogy charts that would have clarified the relationships between rulers. Without this I found myself continually having to go back in order to determine how the various rules were related to each other."},{"Title":"Royal Panoply: Brief Lives of the English Monarchs","review":"I bought this book hoping to fill in some gaps in my knowledge of lesser-known monarchs, and to get a better sense of the overall epic of ascendancy to the English throne. On the latter the book was quite valuable. On the former it was less than helpful.The problem is the author's limited capacity for objective presentation of historical fact. First, the author's sources are a mystery, as she didn't bother to include cites, references, or even a bibliography. Second, she devoted far too much time wallowing in the more salacious stories about England's monarchs, without any indication that such stories usually are derived from the writings of either contemporary enemies or later chroniclers with less than honorable agendas. This is not to say such stories do not have historical value. Many may be absolutely true. But these are generally not established facts -- unless one is to believe this author.This book confidently asserts that homosexuality pervaded English courts from William II on. No qualifying, no doubt; supposition is fact. This affair here, that affair there; they happened, move on. Mary Stuart definitely conspired to murder Lord Darnley. Bothwell definitely killed him. Like I said, stuff like this might be true, but most of it is also highly debatable. In the end I found myself treating everything in this book with suspicion. There's simply too much historical rumor-mongering blithely presented as fact."},{"Title":"Dark Descent: Diving and the Deadly Allure of the Empress of Ireland","review":"Dark Descent: Diving and the Deadly Allure of the Empress of Ireland is a book for everyone! I am definitely not a member of the diving community, though if I were I would love the book as a guide to equipment and techniques. I am, in fact, alternately revolted and fascinated by extreme sports and the people who practice them, a combination of feelings that compels me to seek understanding in books like Dark Descent. This page-turner of a book goes a long way towards providing enlightenment and does it in a most interesting way. Deep wreck divers are tourists! McMurray's abbreviated yet complete rendering of the Canadian ocean liner Empress of Ireland's history and the tragedy of her 1914 sinking on a routine voyage from Quebec City to Liverpool reads like a Michelin guide to an excitinghistorical site. Immediately one feels that reading about it isn't enough. One is compelled to visit. The bulk of the book is a history of tourism, a very difficult kind of tourism, to one of these sites. In tightly written, chronological chapters, McMurray describes all the expeditions to the Empress, as they illuminate the technical progress of diving and, more importantly to this reader, the motivations of the divers and the rivalries and sportsmanlike competition between them. Though the retrieval of artifacts provides a financial incentivefor early explorers of the wreck, diving continues after the government of Canada declares the wreck off limits to salvage. Why? All tourism involves a certain amount of discomfort and risk, and it is really these that make the tourist feel as if he or she has a special connection to the past, somehow more real than the experience of reading a book or watching a program on the History Channel. In such moments of actively reaching for connection, we feel most alive. That is why we travel, why we climb mountains. The chapters of this book describe this feeling of being fully alive, fully connected to the past, as it is experienced in a unique way by each of a series of explorers over the last ninety years. As the author says so well, in describing one of his own dives on the Empress, \\"I told myself I was really here. It was touching a powerful story, bearing witness to a profound and heart-wrenching tragedy.\\" For a reader not yet ready to make that ultimate trip to the bottom of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, this book provides the next best thing to actually touching this story. Dark Descent is a great read!"},{"Title":"Dark Descent: Diving and the Deadly Allure of the Empress of Ireland","review":"I first learned about the \\"Empress of Ireland\\" disaster through Clive Cussler's book \\"Night Probe!\\" I eventually found out more about the vessel and her untimely end.The history is well-documented here by McMurray. Outbound in the St. Lawrence River, the Empress is badly holed by a fully-loaded collier and sinks within 15 minutes, killing more than a thousand.This disaster was generally overshadowed by the outbreak of World War I and the ship was largely forgotten. But once she was found, she became a magnet for the curious and those with ulterior motives.Much like what happened to the Titanic, the Empress has been stripped of much of her gear, her inner treasures, and sadly some of her bodies. A section of the \\"boneyard\\" has reportedly been plundered by some rather morbid and sick-minded individuals.McMurray goes into great detail on the many expeditions and dives, the work by some to protect the wreck and what has been found, as well as those who've lost their lives diving on her.While the Empress may be in the St. Lawrence, it's a dive for only the best, as this book carefully explains.This is probably the most comprehensive history of the Empress of Ireland and updates all that has happened since she went down in May 1914. It is at times dense and a slow read, but you can't take away its entertaining, yet sobering qualities."},{"Title":"Dark Descent: Diving and the Deadly Allure of the Empress of Ireland","review":"The sinking of the Empress of Ireland after a collision in the St. Lawrence Seaway is one of the most tragic shipwreck stories of all time. The author does a fine job of chronicling the numerous expeditions to this wreck, the dangers of diving it ( not for beginners) and the actual story of the 1914 tragedy. Mr. McMurray himself has dived this wreck and his first hand knowlege is evident in this well researched and equally well written book. This is a must have for the historian and the diver.The Wreck Hunters: Dive to the Wreck of the USS Bass"},{"Title":"Dark Descent: Diving and the Deadly Allure of the Empress of Ireland","review":"Make no mistake, this is as complete a work on the ship \\"Empress of Ireland\\" as one might wish to find. The story of the tragedy itself is told in fascinating detail and the individual accounts of personal loss, survival and even the death of a professional salvage diver in the days following the demise of this once great ship reveal a level of research which is both thorough and complete.It all happened in 1914, only two years after the loss of the Titanic but also only a few months before Europe would be plunged into a conflict which would become known as the Great War, or the War to end all Wars. How curious, therefore, that the story of the Titanic lives on - and on, and that that of the Empress of Ireland seems to have become lost alongside the wreck itself.Anyone wanting to know anything at all about the Empress of Ireland need hardly look further than this book - which is, indeed a job well done. My only criticism is reserved for the standard of reproduced photographs - some of which are no bigger than postage stamps and many of which are not clear.First class reference material for historians, anyone with an interest and, especially, those contemplating diving the wreck itself. Read the book first, you might just change your mind.NM"},{"Title":"Dark Descent: Diving and the Deadly Allure of the Empress of Ireland","review":"I enjoyed the first book, Deep Descent and found it a good reference book for my technical diving students. This book was equally as good. It combines the history of the wreck as well as the history of the diving that has taken place on the wreck. It also includes some excellent information on the diving fatalities that have occured on this wreck. If you want to learn from the mistakes of others this book will help."},{"Title":"Dark Descent: Diving and the Deadly Allure of the Empress of Ireland","review":"It is really hard to find a good and well written book on diving. This is a great book. I couldn't set it down. Felt like it was there and in the moment. Made me want to postpone diving the Doria to dive the Empress. Exelent Book. If you like this book then you should check out Fatal Depth, and Deep Descent. Both also great books."},{"Title":"Dark Descent: Diving and the Deadly Allure of the Empress of Ireland","review":"Beautifully written! McMurray shares with us his passion for the Empress and all of her history. He shares with us her majestic beauty above the sea, as well as beneath the sea. I never knew of the Empress of Ireland until reading this book, and I will visit her site one day. McMurray not only writes about the Empress and the divers that love her, but he makes the reader want to be included in that world, too. Thank you Mr. McMurray for writing such a touching story."},{"Title":"Dark Descent: Diving and the Deadly Allure of the Empress of Ireland","review":"While the book reads quickly, it is no page-turner. Unlike Shadow Divers or The Last Dive, the descriptions of the dives were not gripping. I did find the local politics of controlling the dive site to be interesting, but only a diver would.The reason the book is not a page-turner is that there is no spine to the story. True, there is a central theme to the book, namely, the Empress of Ireland, but that is a ship, not a person. Stories about objects simply can't evoke much emotion from readers unless the object is anthropromorphized (think Pinocchio). Hollywood has made a number of movies about cars, guns, hotel rooms, and other things that pass from one person to another and what happens to those people while in possession of the thing, and those movies all suffer from the same problem: they are episodic in nature. There is nothing inherently bad about being episodic, but a book of short stories usually can't sustain your interest in the same way as a novel can.So Dark Descent is good reportage of a series of incidents involving the Empress of Ireland, but I think it of interest mainly to divers. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend unless the friend was a diver or an armchair technical diver."},{"Title":"Dark Descent: Diving and the Deadly Allure of the Empress of Ireland","review":"A good book, a great book, actually. Although I'm more impressed with The Last Attempt, The true Story of Freediving Champion Audrey Mestre and the Mystery of her death\\" by Carlos Serra.That book gave me goose bumps, especially on the way the whole story develops and the twist in the end. Expect something like The Sixth Sense with Bruce Willis, because the final point about Audrey's death is in your face throughout the narrative but hard to see until it's told by the author. Amazing book The Last Attempt!"},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"Patricia McKillip has gained a reputation as one of the few truly original fantasy authors out there. With her exquisitely ethereal prose and haunting stories, she is on top form in \\"In the Forests of Serre.\\" Princes, princesses, witches and wizards, firebirds and black jewels are all spun together by a master.Prince Ronan of Serre lost his wife and child, and now he tries to die by going off to fight in wars for his tyrant father. When returning from a battle, he accidently kills a chicken belonging to the witch Brume; the old woman curses him, but Ronan doesn't take it seriously. Yet when he returns home, his father reveals that he's betrothed Ronan (the only heir) to Princess Sidonie of Dacia, a small but magical kingdom. While Ronan broods about this, he sees a beautiful firebird pass by the castle, and is enspelled by it.Princess Sidonie is no happier about being married off in a barbaric land, but she has to marry Ronan to keep Dacia from being invaded. She travels to Serre with a wizard, and encounters Ronan wandering in the forest without knowing who he is. When she comes to Serre, she finds that her future husband has vanished -- Ronan is searching for the firebird, because he can't find his way home until he gives it to Brume. But things have become more complicated -- because a wizard has taken Ronan's identity...Like all McKillip's books, this novel is deceptively simple and intriguingly written. She uses simple concepts (witch, wizards, scribe, prince, princess, firebird, a country's magic, and talking animals) and spins her unique prose around them. This is not a book for people who like all the usual elements used in the same old way.McKillip's prose is detailed and lush, bringing to mind the best of medieval tapestries and Loreena McKennitt music; when Ronan is in the woods, McKillip describes moths clinging to him, and spiderwebs covering rips in his clothes. The dialogue is more flowing and natural than in some of her other books; the sentences are longer and less flowery. At the same time, her descriptions of things like transformation into a firebird are exquisite.Ronan is a slightly less vivid character at the beginning, compared to his faded mother and half-nuts father; he becomes more interesting as he stops moping and starts obsessing on the firebird. Princess Sidonie is a likable heroine, not gung-ho but very interesting and determined. The wizard Gyre adds an element of mystery to the plot, while the witch Brume will creep you out.Venture into \\"Forests of Serre,\\" where \\"nothing is predictable.\\" It's haunting, beautiful and magical, not just for fans of fantasy."},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"Reading &quot;In the Forests of Serre&quot; is like walking into someone else's dream. You enter a rich forest of metaphor, sometimes only partially glimpsed but always beautiful. A standard fairy-tale plot is overgrown with jeweled birds and foxes with little golden crowns--Kinuko Y. Craft's cover art is a perfect match for McKillip's writing--but the story's end might still come as a surprise.The prince and princess both have some growing up to do through the labyrinthine course of the book. I picked the wrong villain, someone very like the villain in McKillip's &quot;Song for a Basilisk&quot; but who is redeemed in this book by his love for the kingdom of Serre.Speaking of villains, see if you can guess whose heart was enclosed in a casket inside the ribcage of a dragon---you also need guess where it went after the wizards Gyre and Unciel opened the casket. Many hearts go missing throughout the story and not all of them are returned to their true owners.The Baba Yaga-like witch, Brume and her walking hovel, and her chickens, and her stewpot full of human bones form a striking counterpoint to the beautiful firebird-woman who flies through the Forest of Serre and steals men's hearts with her song. Are either or both of them evil? Are they two faces of the same wild magic? McKillip doesn't give a direct answer to these questions (at least none that I could discern) so you'll have to decide for yourself as you read her story. Both Prince Ronan and Princess Sidonie have to face their own worst fears in Brume's hut, and they are different people when they finally emerge.The firebird seems to enter and escape the Crone's hut at will--another of McKillip's symbols for death and rebirth, or change?Incidentally, only the men in this story are seduced by the nameless firebird.&quot;In the Forests of Serre&quot; is one of McKillip's loveliest and most mysterious fantasies. Even if you don't care for all of that la-de-da love-lost-and-found stuff, or for the book's dense symbolism, you might still enjoy the goings-on of the Wizard Unciel and his bumbling-but-honest scribe Euan Ash. None of this author's characters do quite what you expect of them.I'm not even sure there was a villain."},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"In the Forests of Serre is a fantasy novel with a Slavic style. Prince Ronan has lost his wife and child and, after burning their bodies on the funeral byre and scattering their ashes in the river, he has ridden away to war with rebels in southern Serre, hoping to die in battle. His father, King Fergus, sends a messenger and a troop of soldiers to order him to come home. Ronan obeys his father, returning with the wounded warriors and escorted by the troop of soldiers. As he crosses a wasteland, his horse steps on a white hen. Ronan is soon made aware by the witch Brume that the crushed bird is hers and she bids him to pluck the chicken for her pot and invites him and his companion to enter her house and drink the broth. Ronan refuses her bidding and invitation three times and is then informed that he will have a bad day.When Ronan reaches his home, the king wastes no time telling him that he will marry Princess Sidonie in four days. Although Ronan tries to demur from this wedding, saying that he is still grieving his lost wife and child, the king refuses to delay the wedding and, when Ronan continues to deny his command, the king puts Ronan under guard prior to the ceremony. Ronan's mother is sympathetic but is powerless to change the king's plans.While Ronan is in his guarded room, he sees the Firebird in the forest and hears her singing. Ronan leaves his room, walks down the staircase and, while the guards are following him at a slower pace, slips out of the castle gates and down the cliff to the forest. There he follows the Firebird, running and running, then standing still to watch and listen, and then running again. He is soon lost in the woods, enthralled by the beauty and song of the Firebird. As he follows, the prince is asked by various distressed animals to help them with their troubles, which he does in an absent-minded way.In Dacia, Princess Sidonie is told of the impending marriage and runs to Unciel, a formerly powerful wizard, to convince him to urge her father to change his mind. The king is relentless, however, and soon persuades Sidonie and Unciel that the marriage must occur to preclude an invasion of Dacia by King Fergus. Unciel suggests that a wizard should accompany the marriage party to protect against the wild magic of Serre. He is still too weak and powerless from a long and strenuous battle against a mighty foe to provide such protection, but he calls upon the wizard Gyre, who owes him a favor, to accompany Sidonie's party.After many long and hard weeks of travel, Princess Sidonie and her escorts finally enter the forests of Serre. While playing with her bow and arrows in the forest, Sidonie comes upon a wild and ragged looking man following the Firebird. She talks to the confused and somewhat incoherent man for a while and gives her bow to him as he starts to run after the Firebird. When they reach the Castle in Serre, Sidonie soon determines that the deshelved man must have been Prince Ronan.This novel is a story of wizards and witches, princes and princesses, kindness and cruelty, and warm passion versus cold intellect. The witch Brume is devious, but can sometimes be fooled. King Fergus is powerful and determined, but has only limited perception. The story is full of light and mystery and ends with a hint of still other secrets not quite seen.Highly recommended for McKillip fans and anyone else who enjoys adult fairy tales written with a light and fanciful touch."},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"Although the Forests of Serre is not my favorite McKillip book, her stories are always a pleasure to read, and this is no exception. Her lyrical prose creates vivid pictures (I love the image of the witch running off with her house of bones!) and the story is beautiful and wonderfully strange, bringing to mind a fairy tale by the Grimms. I was a little disappointed, however, by the lack of intensity in the story and felt that characterization was sacrificed for story development. The characters don't seem fully realized and Sidonie especially seems like a caricature, as the beautiful, golden princess. Still, definitely worth reading for McKillip and fairy tale fans!"},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"Patricia A. McKillip once more takes us into her intricate and ornate imagination with \\"In the Forests of Serre\\", which has the feeling of an old fairytale that McKillip has discovered in some old book and fleshed-out for us in her unique style of writing. Combining several components from various myths and legends, (predominantly the Firebird and a witch who bears more than a passing resemblance to the Russian Baba Yaga), \\"In the Forests of Serre\\" is a book that McKillip's fans will find to their liking.In the Forests of Serre are many creatures of enchantment, both beautiful and deadly, predominantly the Mother of All Witches: Brume, who lives in a moving house of bones. It is one of her white chickens that Prince Ronan of Serre kills on his way home from the wars and so is cursed. For Ronan however, the threat of bad fortune is meaningless - he's already lost his wife and infant son to death: what could possibly be worse?As it turns out, an arranged marriage. In his absence, his tyrannical father has organised a marriage to Princess Sidonie of Dacia, attracted to the small kingdom's promise of magic and power. Though Sidonie is a reluctant bride, she realises the threat posed toward her home - if King Ferus cannot have Dacia through marriage, he will take it by force. The court wizard Unciel is sympathetic to her plight, and has arranged his young acquaintance Gyre to accompany the princess to her new home in Serre. But Gyre has his own agenda concerning the magic in Serre, and the hidden past between himself and Unciel has not yet reached its conclusion...And then Ronan is captivated by the sight of the Firebird, which reveals to him its secret, beautiful face. Without a second thought, Ronan escapes into the forests, which is only the first of many comings and goings into the Forests of Serre, which are traversed by almost all of our characters throughout the course of the novel. Each time something new is discovered, something is lost, something precious switches hands or is left behind. By the time the story ends each of the characters (even the far away Unciel and his new scribe Euan Ash, who is working to piece together his history) have all their secrets revealed.The characters are not especially vivid, especially when compared to others that appear in McKillip's previous books, but their dilemmas and mysteries are interesting - from Ronan's earth-shattering grief, to Sidonie's entrapment between two countries, to Gyre and Unciel's shadowed past together.The forest itself is gorgeously written in McKillip's distinctive use of language and imagery, and Kinuko Y. Craft's beautiful cover illustration once more embodies the atmosphere of the book. Filled with meaning and symbolism, this is a treat for any fantasy lover, especially those that are already fans of McKillip's work. Although at times it can be a bit needlessly complicated (I kept loosing track of who was in the forest and why, since there are so many coming and goings), and perhaps not the best McKillip novel out there, it was still an intriguing and fascinating read."},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"In the Forests of Serre was my first McKillip novel and after reading it I was hooked! I'll admit that it is a bit confusing and you have to think quite a bit before you figure out what it is about. However, it is definitely worth reading and you will probably find yourself grabbing every single one of her books that you can lay a hand on afterwards!It alternates point of view between several characters: Prince Ronan, Princess Sidonie, the wizard Gyre, and Euan Ashe, a scribe. The story begins with Prince Ronan returning from a military campain in the south of Serre. On his way back to the palace, he accidently runs over a white hen which belongs to the elusive witch, Brume. When he refuses to enter her house (for good reason; the witch is known to eat anyone who does), she lays a curse on him that he will have a very bad day, and be forced to wander in the forest until he finds her again.He returns home and finds his father, King Ferus, in a rage that his sone went off to fight without his permission. He tells Ronan that a Princess from Dacia (a smaller neighboring country with a reputation for magic) is coming and that he will have to marry her. Ronan is obviously upset by this, the more so because his own wife and child died in childbirth. Ever since then he has been trying to be killed.Ronan wants to escape, but doesn't know what to do. He happens to glance out the window and sees a bird made of fire perched in the forest. (This is the mystical firebird, which gives anyone who follows it his heart's desire.) The bird calls to Ronan and he flees the castle, following the bird into the forests of Serre.Meanwhile, in Dacia, Princess Sidonie is not exactly thrilled with the match either. She must marry Ronan to prevent a disastrous war between Serre and Dacia. Since Dacia had lost most of it's magic in the last generation. She runs to the wizard Unciel for guidance, but eventually she determines to go and make the best of it. Unciel puts a wizard named Gyre in charge of watching the princess in the dangerous and unpredictable forests of Serre.Arggh, this story is hard to explain! So much happens and there is so much that is only implied, but has so much impact on the story. Well, I'll just give you a brief idea. Sidonie makes it through the forests to the palace only to find Ronan missing. Ronan has been wandering in the forest, following the firebird, but no one knows where he is. He does find the witch, but she won't release him until he captures the firebird and brings it to her. To Ronan this is unthinkable, because he has lost his heart to the firebird.Somehow, Gyre decides he wants to take over Serre and become Ronan. So he captures Ronan and turns him into a firebird. Then Gyre takes Ronan's shape and leaves the real Ronan at the witch's house. Now he can go home. He makes it to the palace and is about to marry Sidonie before he says something that gives him away. Ferus blows him out the tower window in a blast of fire. However, this doesn't kill Gyre. Ronan manages to free himself from Brume, and agrees to bring Gyre to her in return, but he has to leave his heart with her as a guarantee.Gyre is lured to Brume's cottage by the firebird and Ronan forgets his heart and goes home. When Sidonie finds him completely heartless (no pun intended) and discovers why, she sneaks out of the palace to find Brume and get Ronan's heart. Ronan's mother sends him out after her, and long story short, Ronan, Sidonie and Gyre all find themselves thrown together in Brume's cottage. Gyre appears to have realized how evil he was becoming. They are only free when Gyre gives the firebird's egg to Brume. Apparently they are somehow connected.The story ends with Gyre going off on his travels alone, as before. Ronan realizes that what he really needed was something (or someone) to live for. It seems like he and Sidonie have a chance for a happy ending after all.Another thing is that it is rather unclear why we keep having flashbacks to Unciel and Euan. Somehow, in an amazingly intricate way, they are all connected, but it is very foggy. I still don't really understand all of it, but it was so delicately embroidered together that it was a joy to read. However, if you like action-packed, clear-cut, black and white fantasy, this is not for you. This book is all about the grey areas. What does it really mean to have a heart? To be evil or kind? To be dreaming or awake? How can you really tell what is real and what is not? I mean, at the end, you're not even sure Brume is bad! I highly recommend it to all fantasy lovers, but be prepared to have a lot to think about after reading this.If for nothing else, read this book for McKillip's graceful prose and her gorgeous descriptions. It is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read!"},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"Do you know the value your heart?

There are the usual wonderful extended metaphors, the droll, yet humane humor, and the rich characterizations that pervade her growing oeurve. While readers would also enjoy the Adult Fairy Tale series, edited by Terri Windling, and the Fairy Tales for Adults anthologies from Windling and Datlow (to which I believe McKillip contributes), no other author does it as well at McKillip. Virtuoso reading!"},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"In The Forests of Serre, McKillip has released yet another beautifully crafted story. I love her work so well, that I simply buy whatever she puts out immediately. Again, I was not dissapointed. Drawing me in swiftly, I would argue that this is one of her best so far. &quot;Ombria in Shadow&quot; left me desiring something, though it too was a lovely tale, but Forests has more than made up for it. Deceptively simple, her work will leave you pondering afterward. In a class far above most fantasy, I could argue that it be sold in the Literature section, rather than fastasy, as it is fantastic in more than genre."},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"Each novel is more incredible than the last; this one shimmers with stories--with the tales, the need to tell them, and the unexpected ways they come true."},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"Once upon a time in the kingdom of Serre, the heir to the throne Prince Ronan went to war in the hopes that he would be killed in battle. He lost his wife and child and saw no reason to go on living but fate had something else planned for him. On his return home from battle his horse stepped on a witch's chicken and she cursed him. When he returned home, his father informed him that he arranged for the prince to marry Princess Sidonie of Dacia, a kingdom known for its powerful sorceress.The prince is ensorcelled by a firebird and follows it into the forest where he meets the princess and the Gyre sorcerer who accompanies her from her land. No introductions occur and the princess resumes her journey only to find that her bridegroom is not at the palace awaiting her. Gyre searches for him, but when he encounters the prince he changes him into a firebird and assumes the appearance of Ronan. Gyre intends to take over the prince's role because Roman doesn't want it and the sorcerer does.Patricia A. McKillip weaves her usual magic to create a spellbinding tale of two star-crossed lovers who find that fate is not always unkind. The adventures they partake in change them in subtle ways, making them more aware of the needs of the other and wanting to give that person their heart's desire. Readers will remember the irascible witch in this tale who lives in a house of bones, has big feet and is more and less than she seems.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"This would more like be a 3 1/2 or a 4 even on most people's scales, but I judge a little harder...A very enjoyable book by McKillip but far from her best work. The prose is as lyrical as ever, like reading poetry that scuplt vivid images of foriegn, strange worlds. The story itself is born from the dustings of the typical fairy tale, with some unique twists thrown in for good measure, and a fascination for a firebird. The characters never become emotionally involving however, and a few seem a little stiff halfway through but as with every book of hers that I've read so far, this one is also worth checking out, if only for its lyrical beauty."},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"I have only discovered Ms. McKillip this week, and probably like all Kindle owners, read about a book a day. While I find the author and her books delightful: I've even went on to purchase one paperback as a gift for a friend, and a hardback for my coffee table. I find myself searching through other favorite authors, such as Juliette Marieller, Charles de Lint, Lois Buchold McMaster, to name just a few, to find a less expensive story to read. I know the author has nothing to do with setting the price of the book, so I don't blame her, but I can't read a $12 book a day, or at least I won't. Too bad for me, I guess."},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"For some reason I didn't find this one as compelling as Alphabet of Thorn. It was a good story. I liked way characters weren't always what they seemed, but there was something \\"difficult\\" about the story that I can't quite place. Perhaps it had to do with the believability of the actions of two of the main characters. Like Alphabet, it had a sort of abrupt ending as well, though not as abrupt as Alphabet, but somehow Alphabet was still more satisfying. McKillip's writing was as beautiful as ever, though; she really has a very poetic style. I noted repetition of the phrase \\"In the forest of Serre,\\" which is an effective way to set a fairy-tale tone."},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"Occasionally I feel the desire to escape into lyrical fantasy, and, remembering the experience of reading this author's Riddlemaster series as an adolescent, seek out Patricia McKillip's latest book in the library.Unfortunately I am not finding the magic I used to find in her books. Is it me that's changed or has McKillip's well of inspiration begun to run dry? I suspect a bit of both.Many have commented on McKillip's use of language. Yes, it is dreamy, fantastical and often achieves lyrical effect. However, I feel that too much focus is now going into the writing (the trees) and not enough into the development of imaginative story (the forest). The tale in this book is fractured and never achieves narrative drive. Indeed there are really only glimmers of story, held together in a kaleidoscopic prose.And to address the writing itself. McKillip's lexicon is not un-naturally broad. Rather her writing can seem strange and unworldly through odd grammatical effects such as her almost adjectival use of nouns and her occasional use of unusual words. I suspect she is something of a word-raven, seeking in dictionaries and thesauruses for strange words whose color she fancies. Like particular narrative effects, she sometimes repeats her use of an unusual word. An example of this repetition is the word 'sough' (rhymes with bough) in these two sentences:\\"Her voice was the hollow sough of windblown reeds.\\" (p 2)\\"Finally a restless night wind blew the candle out, stranded them in the soughing dark.\\" (p 120)I think the first use is much more effective than the second.Then there is the archaic word 'limn' which basically means illuminate:\\"Scars underlined one eye, limned one jaw;\\" (p 4)\\"Staring at the void limned by moonlight into the shape of the wizard's face\\" (p158)Here the two applications of this word are different enough to justify the repetition.One twinned narrative effect I noticed is the description of first the mother's and then the daughter's eyes:\\"her eyes were the cold color of dawn at the end of a sleepless night\\" (p 96)\\"...her grave eyes, which, he suddenly saw, were the color of the hour he loved best, when the last haunting moments of day shifted towards the deepest purples of twilight\\" (p 132)This repetition can sometimes be powerful but in this story it felt like being lost in a wood where all the trees start to appear the same.Finally, an example of a word use that simply fails - the use of the word 'riffle' in this sentence - \\"So did the proctor, riffling at his bald head and looking mystified.\\" (p 17) To my mind, riffling requires something to riffle, such as playing cards or sheaves of wheat and is not possible with a smooth skinned pate.There is some imaginative naming of the wizards characters in the story, with Unciel recalling the majuscule form \\"uncial\\" and Gyre directly conjuring the image of a vortical power. However the characters themselves never really came alive and their motivations were either too simplistic or, in the case of the young wizard Gyre, narratively conflicting.So in summary, if McKillip is seeking to cast magic with her storytelling, my experience was that while the writing somewhat drugged my senses, the underlying power of the story was in the end insufficient to place me under it's spell."},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"This book was worth reading. It was extremely creative. The problem with it was that the story seemed to drag on and contridict itself. For about the first sixty or seventy pages I was confused. It would have made a wonderful book for small children if it more stright forward."},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"I'm not an avid reader, however, I enjoyed this book. McKillip's writing style weaves stories as wonderful as the cover art. Her ornate details wrap you into the story itself. Like being next to Ronan as he realizes his boot is gone and he's wandering around half-mad with a frog in his hand, and hearing the toad correct him. Wonderful story.

The adventure is over with a happily ever after."},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"Set in a world where stories and dreams become real, In the Forests of Serre is a beautifully told fairy tale, complete with a beautiful (and strong) princess, a cursed broken-hearted prince, a wily wizard and an ogre of a king. The story draws you in, and just as Gyre fell in love with the magic of Serre, it's easy to be transported there for a time while reading McKillip's lovely prose.Well drawn characters and a steady pace keep the story going to a magical end.

McKillip, another fairytale retold directed preferably to young adults. According to my Google research there are several versions and adaptations of this Russian tale involving the firebird, but the premise is always the same: this creature beyond wonderful, with all its supreme beauty, mystery and unreachability, symbolizes, invariably, a demand. But in In The Forests Of Serre there isn't only a prince, wandering through the forest trying to catch a bird of fire, while a beautiful princess makes her appearance at the end of story as the prize for the hunter and they both live happily everafter. No, in In The Forests Of Serre, we do have a prince wandering the forest deluded by the firebird's excellence, and its singing, but also and especially, we have a poor guy disturbed by the recent deaths both of his wife and newborn baby. And as if that wasn't enough, Ronan, the prince, is caught in the enchantment of the old witch who inhabits a hut made of human bones in the forest, and the tasks he has to complete to get out of it seem unattainable. And if at the beginning Ronan had nothing to continue to live for, this meeting with Brume, the witch, will, against all odds, make him wake to life and smell the morning air, because Sidonie, the beautiful princess, enters in action, and they are a funny duet to watch. Among other characters, I have to praise the wizard Gyre, who starts by having a neutral role, then awakens the wrath (or consent) of the reader, as that third person who threats a possible love story, only to win our good thoughts again both with his intangibility, like the firebird itself, which is always appropriate in these cases where innocent princes and princesses need help to escape from evil witches; and with his pragmatism, which I dare to set as hilarious. With an extremely beautiful, coherent, satirical and addictive writing style, McKillip is definitely a keeper.With an extremely beautiful, coherent, satirical and addictive writing style, McKillip is definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"UC_In The Forests Of Serre (Mckillip, Patricia a)","review":"Here's a real find!

As with everything by McKillip, the language is pure bliss -luxurious and finely woven, seducing the mind like the best poetry. Yet, beyond even that, is an underlying sense of the wisdom which pervades this novel -wisdom that attends suffering and forebearance, kindness and charity.I think the few complaints about characterisation stem from a failure to appreciate McKillip's deliberate homage to the allegorical nature of the traditional fairy tale.

It's based very much on fact, and manages to illustrate the causes the war from both sides of the issue -- what it meant in personal terms. The story is told in 1st person by Nick Canfield, a fictional newspaper correspondent. He's a native New Yorker, but married to a Southern woman, and as the country moves inexorably toward war, the couple is living in Baltimore -- a compromise between them. Eventually, Canfield is forced to choose between his moral integrity or the love of his wife and the comforts her family can provide. In a dramatic scene at Fort Sumter, he makes his decision.But that's just the beginning. Canfield goes to work for the New York Herald (he refuses to work for the radical Republican Horace Greeley!) and covers many battles in the Eastern Theater, including the almost comical confusion at 1st Manassas, the haunting tragedy of Antietam, the bitter Union loss at Fredericksburg. But this isn't just a tour of the battlefields. Canfield is deeply affected by the carnage and disillusioned by the politics surrounding the military effort. For a while, he clings sadly to the belief that once the war is over, his life will go back to &quot;normal.&quot; It never does. Even civilians are deeply impacted, compelled to ponder the high price of their lofty principles.After the pivotal battles of Gettysburg and Vicksburg, Canfield is sent to the West to travel with Sherman's armies -- risking the general's wrath and certain arrest if he's discovered. However, he also provides us with a on-the-ground view of the Atlanta Campaign and the March through Georgia and the Carolinas, never minimizing or apologizing for the damage done. Here, too, the question comes up: How much objectivity can an &quot;embedded&quot; journalist maintain on the battlefield?This story paints a well-rounded picture of the war from the point of view of those who lived through it. It includes a love story, but it's not a silly romance, nor just a mindless action/adventure story. All of the characters are carefully drawn, often flawed, sometimes heroic, almost always unforgettable. Because the book is fiction, it gives the reader a multi-dimensional sense of the social context of the time, and exactly what was at stake for ordinary citizens caught up in the terrible conflict.I love this book!"},{"Title":"All Out of Heart: A Journalist's Memoir of the Civil War","review":"No official embedding here. During the Civil War, Union generals distrusted correspondents and looked upon them with suspicion. One general publicly announced that he would shoot them as spies if he found them sniffing around his camps. Despite the scorn, disrespect, and severe personal hardship, Canfield managed to keep a steady stream of war news flowing to his newspaper, while at the same time recording in his memoirs his personal views of the decisions, events and men who managed the bloody campaigns. No stranger to the significance and ramifications of the war, he championed the Union cause, despite being married to a southern woman, and struggling with the consequences. Here is a book that captures the personal torments of the era, as well as the blood, sweat and smell of its battles. Here are the lines between the headlines. In the tradition of MacKinlay Kantor and Bruce Catton, Canfield envelops the reader in the language and ambience of the times. This is a book you will live as well as read."},{"Title":"All Out of Heart: A Journalist's Memoir of the Civil War","review":"Incredibly unique and insightful perspective of the Civil War by one who apparently suffered through its professional and personal ramifications. While covering the war from the Union side, and siding with its cause, he was married to a southern woman. That, coupled with the fact that the Yankee Generals didn't cotton to the idea of having reporters around ( they looked upon them as spies ) made life very difficult for the reporters in the field. One Union general openly threatened to shoot them as spies if he caught them sniffing around his camp. Not only is this book historically accurate ( &quot; historically correct &quot; knit pickers will have a challenge with this one ), but the language, atmosphere and ambience of the times captured by Canfield makes you feel as if you are a fly on the walls of the tents of those who lived it. Move over MacKinlay Kantor and Bruce Catton, Nicholas Canfield's memoir has arrived."},{"Title":"All Out of Heart: A Journalist's Memoir of the Civil War","review":"I have always been a civil war buff and Nick Canfield's All Out of Heart, brought me back to a time and place I can only visit in books."},{"Title":"Encyclopaedia of World Women","review":"About the Book :Encyclopedia of World Women presents a very fascinating study and equally a fascinating subject like woman who imbibes both the masculine and feminine character-traits and is, therefore, like a man bi-sexual. She manifests these fraits, of course, disproportionately. Either she is disproportionately masculine in her mode of behavior and hence unwomanly or disproportionately feminine and as a result unmanly. An average woman displaying these traits proportionately - is mere a fiction. Extremism, therefore, is a defining factor of women. One of the manifestations of extremism is her power over good or evil that makes her kind or cruel and she is quite consistent in her these extreme postures.

I also purchased the study guide from the publisher, and it too contained a few too many typographical errors. Further, I found some of the examples in the practice problems to be inappropriate, given the weak explanation in the preceding chapter section's lesson.One positive comment I do have is that the approach or theme that the author uses from the very start of the book (using the &quot;simple society&quot;) definitely indicates that the author made a sincere effort to reach his less-experienced undergrad audience.

The prose is poetic in its telling of what the protagonists feel and taste and smell and see, the dialogue flowing and smooth, and the terror huge and real.With a wonderful introduction by author Jack Ketchum, he mentions that Lebbon's stories have \\"teeth\\", and indeed they do; trust me, you will feel the bite. Also notable to me was the use of Caniglia's \\"On The Edge Of Paradise\\" artwork used for the jacket cover, and preceding each story is another horrendously beautiful sketch of Caniglia, whom I think is one of the most talented modern day artists.There are six tales here in this collection, and I will give a brief summary of each.White - Some people called it \\"The Doom\\", others called it \\"The Ruin\\", but either way it spelled a change in the world as we know it. Seven people find themselves trapped in a large manor house, each having initially gone there to get away from the haunts of their past. When the snow came, it didn't stop, and now everything is completely frozen, as the snow piles up higher and higher. There is no working transportation to take them back to the town 10 miles away, so they wait for the snow to stop.Tension grows as one by one, each admit to having seen something in the snow; a deer perhaps, or a seagull or a cat, flitting just outside their peripheral vision. The only thing they know for sure, is that it's white. The story begins with the first death, and will lead us through to the conclusion, with the things that dart and flutter just outside our vision.From Bad Flesh - One of my favorites. After The Ruin, diseases of different sorts are spread throughout the world, with names like Numb-Skull, TGD, and QS. Our protagonist Gabe has what is just referred to as The Sickness, and his friend Della tells him of a man named String who lives on the island of Malakki near Greece who could possibly have a cure for his deadly illness. So Gabe travels to Malakki, where the dead are piled up in the harbor like cordwood and the Lordships still do their fly-by's. Here he meets Jade, a beautiful woman, who saves him from an insane crowd and promises to take him to String.Their journey up into the mountains is hellish and gripping in its intensity, revealing horrors to Gabe that he had not thought humans capable of. They reach the little village where String lives, surrounded by a glass moat, and Gabe and Jade are welcomed into the village. Who is String, and where does he come from? What is the secret to his cure? How does he have this power? Will Gabe receive the cure? Lebbon will suck you into this tale and not leave you disappointed in the end.Hell - Not necessarily my favorite, but I think only because I was spoiled by Edward Lee's vision of hell in his book City Infernal. Lebbon's vision of hell is just as disturbing though, as voyeurs take a tram journey through hell, watching the horrors through the shaded windows while strapped into their comfortable seats; all to prove that \\"things could be worse in their own life\\".After Nolan's wife dies, his daughter Laura suddenly goes missing; and imagining her under the sway of some religious cult, Nolan takes the tram into hell to search for her. When he sees her actually inside hell, strung up upon a barbed wire fence, he fights the demons who control the tram with the help of Chele, a woman who lost her son, and manages to escape the tram and enter hell itself. Together they save Laura from the fence, but now they are stuck in hell, and don't know the way out.The First Law - Incredibly creepy story of five survivors adrift in a lifeboat after their ship is torpedoed during the war. Their lifeboat has been aimlessly drifting for five days, and the five men are sunburned and dehydrated when the oceans currents pull them straight to a strange island. Right at the start, one of them behaves very strangely, and although there is fresh water and the signs of available food about, something about the island is just...not right. This is the creepiest tale of unseen monsters and inexplicable tragedies with such an overbearing sense of dread and ruin, that this story alone makes the price of the book worthwhile. Follow our survivors to the end of their journey, and you will not leave unshaken by the horrid revelations and hidden terror prevalent on this strange island that does not belong to the normal world.The Origin of Truth - The scientists have done it again, and this time they have unleashed millions of \\"nanos\\", microscopic man made organisms that stripped any type of matter down to the atoms and used it to replicate themselves. The entire world was being eaten, bit by bit. Doug flees the city with his wife Lucy-Anne and daughter Gemma, spilling out from the city along with everyone else. They wind out taking refuge in Scotland with Lucy-Anne's mad uncle Peter, to wait out the last days together. Very well told apocalypse tale, original and deeply moving.Mannequin Man and the Plastic Bitch - Can Artificials love? Tom had once belonged to The Baker, and long ago that eccentric man had implanted a rogue program into Tom to allow him to love. Years later, after The Baker is dead, Tom falls in love with a hooker named Honey, an Artificial herself.He must steal her away from her pimp, Hot Chocolate Bob, who follows them through the city and into the underground. But surprisingly, Honey doesn't want to leave right away, insisting on visiting a club called The Slaughterhouse first, to see her friend Doug Skin and get him to release her. Very interesting tale of a futuristic landscape where \\"chop-shops\\" are common, sort of a plastic surgery gone awry trend where people can add or remove body parts, or make themselves ten feet tall, or intensify their vision, or become a human spider. Anything goes.Honey and Tom try to find love in all this, but if Tom is the only Artificial that really has love, will he be able to share it? Great story, don't miss out on this fast paced futuristic horror story that will make you feel for those who are incapable of it.Don't miss out on this masterful collection of stories. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"White and Other Tales of Ruin","review":"I am very excited that they finally put this book on Kindle. It is not the easiest book to find in print and I have owned 6 copies so far. Each one has been lent out until it is in tatters. As to the book itself... It's what Mr. Saul's books could be if his stories weren't so predictable. It's what Mr. King would write if he could get over the deus ex endings. In short, it's horror, done to absolute perfection."},{"Title":"White and Other Tales of Ruin","review":"What most people, myself included, forget is that even though there may be monsters, demons and boogeymen, horror is really just a mirror. Hold up any frightening tale or poem, examine it and what you get is the heart of mankind. The only difference between the works is the mirror's clarity. Though all creators have their way with us, a really great author is not only able to tell a story, but can simultaneously reflect our own hearts. Tim Lebbon is not only an author, but he's also a great writer.Each plot is brutal and repugnant, yet beautiful and inspiring. All are distinctively original and as addictive as candy, but twice as dangerous. Perfect! The atmosphere suffocates you with the feel of madness and desperation. Weighing you down with a sense of complete annihilation. Lebbon's style of writing is intimate, refined and above all else -cryptic. Instead of laying it all on the line, he gives you only enough to provide the blueprints, allowing the reader to create and build around their own aversions and fears.The characters are by far Lebbon's true gift. Besides giving his cast flesh and bone, he grants them emotional depth and fallibility. Creating players that you can identify with, envision in your life and just simply, understand. Each one seeming to represent an aspect of the author and the people close to him or at least that's the image you get while reading. Each character is written as though the familiarity were expected, and should be received without question."},{"Title":"White and Other Tales of Ruin","review":"My first experience with British author Tim Lebbon was a mixed one. My voracious appetite for apocalyptic tales virtually insured I would visit his writings one day. It seems that every book this author has written involves the collapse of civilization followed by horrific incidents, or at least that is what I have gathered from reading plot synopses of his various novels and short stories. When I finally decided to shell out some bucks for one of his books, I decided to pick up &quot;White and Other Tales of Ruin,&quot; figuring that a collection of six short stories about the end of the world would give me a rather comprehensive view of what this guy is all about. The experience started on a positive note: none other than Jack Ketchum, of &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; and &quot;Red&quot; fame, wrote an enthusiastic introduction for this compilation. Ketchum claims that Lebbon represents the cream of the crop of new young writers, a man who has &quot;done his homework&quot; and has a lot to offer fans of the horror genre. Since I am a fan of Ketchum's work, I took this as the best sort of endorsement, and eagerly dove into the first story. By the time I reached the end of the book, I was less enamored with the introduction's effusive praise. There are good stories here, but a few are rather pedestrian.&quot;White&quot; introduces the reader to Lebbon's concept of &quot;The Ruin,&quot; a series of catastrophic global events leading to the gradual extermination of humanity. Details are vague, but we do get a sense that limited nuclear exchanges matched with several devastating viruses have claimed, and continue to claim, the lives of several billion people. Even worse, nature itself is changing in dangerous ways. The Ruin will reemerge in other Lebbon stories, but &quot;White&quot; focuses on the terrible effects of the calamity on a small group of people trapped in a decaying manor along the English seacoast. Heavy snows and an ominous new life form roaming the countryside insure the characters will have their hands full just trying to stay alive. Told through the eyes of one of the trapped souls, a man who lost his beloved wife to one of the viruses some time before, &quot;White&quot; is Lebbon's attempt at writing a siege story. It's a keeper, full of cloying atmosphere, suspense, and occasional touches of gore.&quot;From Bad Flesh&quot; is another Ruin tale, this time about an English man suffering from a grotesque plague seeking a cure on a remote Greek island. In his quest to find a witch doctor named String, this poor chap runs into a beautiful young woman with several secrets, witnesses many atrocities on the island, and learns how a cure can sometimes come with a terrible price. &quot;From Bad Flesh&quot; is a by the numbers story, one where I saw the ending coming long before it knocked on the door. If you cannot see the conclusion to this one in advance, you haven't been keeping up on your horror reading. Not a bad tale, considering several scenes of unpleasantness thrown into the mix, but far from spectacular.&quot;Hell&quot; was the weakest contribution to the book. A man whose daughter mysteriously leaves one day literally visits the underworld in an attempt to feel better about his loss. It's one of those &quot;you think you got it bad? Check out these poor blokes&quot; stories. The guy witnesses staged genocides and mass sufferings through the windows of his Hell tour bus (!), all a part of a carefully orchestrated therapy program. When he sees his daughter in one of the landscapes, he escapes from the bus and makes his own personal journey through the nightmares. Will he rescue his offspring? Will they escape from Hell before demons turn them into hamburger? Maybe, but getting to the end of this story was quite tedious. I never knew where Lebbon was going with this unsatisfying tale.&quot;The First Law&quot; and &quot;The Origin of Truth&quot; are somewhat better. The former is a story about some sailors stranded on a terrible island after a submarine sinks their boat. They find out that their newfound land harbors a nature so pure that it cannot tolerate the presence of human interlopers. I liked the story solely because it turns the conventional idea of shipwrecked people finding sanctuary on a deserted island on its head. The latter story relates the horrors of nanotechnology run amok through the eyes of a young family. As the world collapses into its component molecules under the relentless march of replicating miniature robots, the family flees north in an effort to stave off the inevitable. Lebbon plays with your head as he has the young girl, Gemma, begin channeling advanced scientific theories from seemingly out of nowhere. Perhaps this girl can save humanity? Or perhaps not. Whatever the case, you'll feel for these characters by the end of the story.The last story deals with a depressing future where humans interact with artificial androids. It's a technological and polluted world filled with bored souls looking for a good time through &quot;chopping.&quot; Think body modification and piercing carried to insane levels (adding extra legs, arms, and other body parts), and you'll get the idea. The story can be nasty at times, but it is really about the restorative powers of love. Sounds weird, huh? Well, it is. It is also arguably the best story in the book. According to the endnotes, Lebbon wrote it just for this collection. &quot;White and Other Tales of Ruin&quot; is a good way to spend a day or two, a good read for those interested in new horror, but nothing here trumps &quot;Swan Song&quot; or &quot;The Stand,&quot; the two books that are the best apocalyptic horror has to offer."},{"Title":"White and Other Tales of Ruin","review":"While I won't cover the six tales in this book because they are beautifully treated by another reviewer, Schtinky, on this page, I do have to say that Lebbon's view of the world comes through vibrantly in his short stories. In White, we see a clean variant of the world as it is blanketed in a coat that it cannot shed, and slowly but surely the world seems to peel away and become a distant memory for those involved. This beauty turns the people involved towards more and more desperate actions, and this desperation reveals that there is not only a heavy snowfall raging against the face of the world but that there is something - bizarre - moving just out of sight.Definitely a great read.In From Bad flesh, the end is not a pretty picture but is instead a terrible thing that people desperately hope to cure. It is filled with images of that desperation and of the way that people feed upon people in lurid captions captured against the backdrop of The Sickness, and this motion toward a cure leads to - to what? Much like White, something sits just out-of-sight, making the reader squint and hope their eyes can collect all the details hidden amidst the pages.Also an amazing read.And the list goes on and on.When I saw this little gem waiting for me in a package I unwrapped with care, I silently thanked a horror goddess for introducing me to tee ad and Lebbon for collecting pieces of short fiction. In my opinion this is Lebbon's strongpoint; although Lebbon has crafted many a book with many a catchy inkling, Lebbon excels at the idea behind the books and paints them beautifully when he is less worried about pages and more worried about content. You can really see this in White and Other Tales of Ruin; here you have ideas that all come together in interesting ways, and you have some really strong tales crafted by a really powerful pen. Basically you have six tales of beauty, all coated in the word \\"ruin\\" and wrapped in the skin of a Caniglia painting; from the inside-out you have something that says \\"read me\\" and, like Alice and the choices she made in Wonderland, you would be served to also follow those directions. I say that and then more, telling a person who wants to read something good to relish the read, because many of the tales are not only written well but are also things hat prompt a reader to keep on reading. This is because each tale has its own type of beauty rendered in the landscape it paints, with \\"White\\" literally blanketing everything like doom-flavored candy and \\"Bad Flesh\\" making you wonder what type of treat you'll get when you roll it off your tongue.If you have a eye for short stories and a love for well-written horror, then you should enjoy your journey into Lebbon's backyard. I', a bit biased because I not only enjoy his work but also because I enjoy short stories, thinking that many lengthier works are oftentimes attempts to pad details and not really deliver the goods.And in White and Other Tales you don't have that problem. Te problem you have is that the ending will come and you will sit and think on it, letting the thing you've just ingested settled at least fifteen minutes before jumping back into that pool of thought.Personally I loved the read and thought that even the cover art was that good."},{"Title":"White and Other Tales of Ruin","review":"Turning and turning in the widening gyreThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhereThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;The best lack all conviction, while the worstAre full of passionate intensity.W. B. YeatsOne wonders whether \\"The Second Coming,\\" excerpted above, is among Tim Lebbon's personal favorites. Its sentiments permeate much of his work, including the six stellar novellas that have been collected in White and Other Tales of Ruin.Ruin is defined as \\"total disintegration, either physical, moral, social or economic.\\" The concept is pervasive throughout these cautionary tales of quest and survival. Tales dealing with quests include \\"Hell,\\" a modern day Inferno, detailing a man's search for his missing daughter, \`Mannequin Man and the Plastic B**ch,\\" in which a synthetic man's love for another artificial life form may prove to be strong enough to change the world, and \\"From Bad Flesh,\\" in which the protagonist seeks a cure for the virulent disease that is slowly killing him. Interestingly, \\"the Ruin,\\" Lebbon's term for \\"an ambiguous nasty fate that has befallen society,\\" provides the depressing backdrop for this tale.\\"The Ruin\\" also precedes the events chronicled in \\"White,\\" the story of a group of friends under siege by forces they can't comprehend. Other tales of survival include \\"The First Law,\\" in which shipwrecked sailors are attacked by an island that has evolved into a sentient entity, and the poignant \\"The Origin of the Truth,\\" in which nanotechnology has gone awry, threatening to wipe the entire planet clean.There's a tension in each of these novellas, a tension arising from the conflicting emotions of hope and despair. Lebbon himself addresses this tension in his story notes to \\"Mannequin Man.\\" He muses,\\"And still, however different the worlds may be, the Ruin is always there. The ills of society, perhaps. The inevitable future. The slide into chaos and decay which humanity faces as a race. Cynical and pessimistic maybe...but what better places to tell stories about the triumph of the human spirit?\\"What better places, indeed?"},{"Title":"Television Cartoon Shows: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, 1949 Through 2003 The Shows A-L","review":"I received the book today, and was quite impressed with it.Wish I had the money to buy the two volume set.

In the midst of World War II British intelligence created a whole new intelligence operation: CHERUB. CHERUB has one extremely important qualification: you must be 17 years of age, or younger. They reason that adults would never suspect children of being spies, so if they train the children well enough, they will can gather information which adults would find decidedly harder to discover.James Choke wasn't really your typical pre-teen. He's smart, but also a troublemaker, having strong potential to get in fights with other students. His mother heads a ring of shoplifters, so even though she never does the actual work she pulls in quite a bit of money. This means James also has unlimited access to the newest gadgets: his room is stuffed with them. Along with his little sister, he leads a fairly happy life...until his ex-stepdad (father to James' sister) shows back up, trying to weasel money from James' mom. She ends up accidentally overdosing on medication and alcohol and dies.James is sent to a children's home and his sister ends up with James' stepdad. At the home James falls in with the wrong crowd and starts down a path that will quickly lead to jail time. Before that that come true though, he catches the eye of CHERUB. James has much of what they look for, above average intelligence, young, and parentless. They take him on as their newest recruit.The Recruit seems primarily aimed at boys ages 10-13, and seems like it would be appealing to fans of the Alex Rider and The 39 clues (note: I have not read these series, I'm basing my assumption on what I've heard about them). James owns the coolest toys, and as part of Cherub training gets to learn some different forms of martial arts.Do I think a 12 year old boy would like it? Maybe. To some, James will be a super cool hero who gets to go on exciting missions. However, even though it came out in 2004 in already feels dated. There are references to technology from the early 2000's that many teenage boys would roll their eyes at. Celebrities are referenced who would barely make a blip on the radar. It serves as a good testament as to why writers should avoid, as much as possible, referencing specific brands/names of celebrities, as those quickly date the novel (unless those directly affect the storyline, which isn't the case here).There's also a lot of time before James starts his first mission. Since this is the first book in the series, a large part of the story sets up how he came to be recruited and covers his training. Parts of this are interesting, but it means the actual mission isn't as deep/detailed as the later books are sure to be.As an adult, there are some elements which worried me as well. Several characters smoke, and many drink alcohol (including James who gets drunk at a party at CHERUB). Now, I normally don't mind if a character drinks alcohol. I also don't mind if a character is an alcoholic/drunk if it is needed for their characters. What I don't appreciate is that the drinking in this novel is performed by underage children (some as young as 11/12) and is presented lightly, almost as a cool thing to do. Also, some of it occurs at the CHERUB facility. An older girl mentions they could get in trouble for letting James drink because of he's so much younger, but the indication is that CHERUB doesn't care if the older kids drink (even though they are still underage (even though the novel is set in Britain, where my quick research indicates the drinking age is lower than the US).For me, Muchamore tried too hard to make James a cool kid. Besides an anger problem, which doesn't play a huge role for much of the book, he doesn't have many other deep flaws. This makes me wonder how much room there is for James to grow as character. He reads, at the beginning, too much like the kid who has everything, which isn't a character that is usually interesting, especially since he doesn't really end up losing everything as he still has a cool life with CHERUB.One of the things I did like is that spy element felt more realistic than other stories involving teen spies. They don't have outrageously unbelievable technology, and they don't go scaling walls and driving expensive cars. The missions they go on (from what I could tell) sound much more realistic.I think the story has some potential, and given the numerous sequels, it seems to have been at least mildly popular. Given my overall disappointed in this book, however, I don't plan on trying the sequels. What will make them more effective though, is if they add more depth to James' character and are able to create extremely realistic missions that challenge the characters.2/5 stars"},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"The main character, James is supposed to be 11, and most of the other characters are under 17.All them are constantly engaging in illegal behavior... smoking, drinking, vandelism.There a tremendous amount of verbal bullying by adults and kids. There is also a lot of physical bullying between the kids.There is also many instances of crude, rude and inappropriate behavior.The main character, James also engages in what I consider an age inappropriate physical relationship with a girl, sneaking into her bedroom for long and apparently intense makeout sessions.All of the above the author seems to imply is \\"cool\\"The adults in the book either ignore or even endorse both the illegal behavior as well as the age-inappropriate behavior.I guess most of the above would have a certain appeal to a immature age level (especially boys) but there are way better books with this kind of plot where teenage kids are spys.Try the Alex Rider series or the H.I.V.E books."},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"My ten year old son loves this series so much that he can't put these books down.

I enrolled in a children's literature course as a freshman in college, and have been hooked every since. I was browsing on Amazon, looking for another good read, when I stumbled upon Cherub: the Recruit. It looked interesting enough, so I thought I would give it a go.This book was fantastic in its pacing; I never wanted to put it down, even when it was time to go to work or to sleep; this book resulted in several late nights for me. The beginning of the book deals with James's troubled home life, ensuing tragedy, and his recruitment into Cherub. The beginning and middle of the book were the strongest spots of storytelling; they kept you hooked and interested, generating a healthy sympathy and concern for the protagonist. I particularly loved the 100 days of training; it was very intense and suspenseful.The characters were also well written and conceived, and the author caught a realistic sense of the insecurities young adults face in their social lives. The way most characters reacted to situations were realistic, and took me back to my dreaded middle school days. Still, the book's references to pop culture (PlayStation 2 and clothing brands) were a bit outdated, dating the book and hurting the reader's ability to stay in the world created by the author. Most of the dialogue was great, even funny at times, but there were also several \\"rough\\" conversations that felt forced, particularly towards the end of the book.The third \\"act\\" of the book involves James's first mission. While I did not hate this part, it definitely fell short of the first two acts, creating a sense of disappointment in the overall story development. Basically, James's actions help to thwart some terrible plot, and he is rewarded for such actions. The problem is, the actions are not terribly heroic, and there is a play for drama where there really is none; it felt cheap, and I know the author could have constructed a more \\"fun\\" mission for James to cut his teeth on.Despite the disappointing third act and outdated popular culture references, I would still recommend this book. I believe children will find it entertaining, while also relating to it. Do keep in mind that this book is part of series due to the current trend in children's literature right now, which is to write a long series, and hope to score big (think Harry Potter money). Because of this, your children may want (or need) you to purchase all of the books, but encouraging children to read is important, even if I do not believe in extending a series entirely for profit. Therefore, I say take the plunge, accept the mission, and earn that Navy shirt."},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"A.fabulous book for reluctant readers, it held my attention and the relationships the characters built felt genuine, I'm hooked and already ordered book 2."},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"My 13 year old son and his friends are racing through the Cherub series.

This is a great book and I give it 4.9 stars.Boys 12-15(The -.01 because some of the words used, I would not want someone under 12 reading it."},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"I have seen these books in bookstores for quite some time. When I finally read the first book, 'The Recruit' it was not what I expected, but I was not disappointed. I'm not a fan of spy adventures as a rule, but I do enjoy Youth Fiction and this had all the elements of a book that children and young people will enjoy. This is the kind of book that boys who are reluctant readers (cliche, I know), will enjoy, but it's also a book that a teacher wont have qualms about recommending to students. It's well written, the characterisation is excellent and the plot lines are well thought out.What I particularly liked was the way the child and teenage characters are portrayed. They're gritty and at times unsympathetic, but they are real teenagers, and I say this as someone who teaches high school English. Some adults/parents may not like this darker aspect but I thought it was very refreshing to see a YA author who didn't sugar coat their characters.Another good thing about this series is there are so many books, so once you've started reading, or your child/student has and they come back wanting more you can point to a whole shelf of them.Lastly, the spy adventure aspect. It wasn't as James Bond as I had expected, which is due to my own naivete. This is a far more realistic look at what intelligence agencies do (or at least it seems more believable).The Recruit is a great start to an impressive and original series, which I would highly recommend to anyone who likes engaging characters, intelligent plots, and good quality writing. If nothing else read it for a clear-eyed portrayal of adolescents."},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"I'm 14 and read the entire series (12 books) over the summer last year.

Trust me, get the first book and within a couple of months you will have finished the series.PS: I don't know if publishers would be looking at the reviews, but I really wish you would make this series kindle compatible. The only books published on kindle are twilight-type books, which don't appeal to boys my age....."},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"The book is in the announced condition.It arrived in time.Thus everything was perfect.Thank you very much for all."},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"If you want a book that's full of on-the-edge humour, action, and is NOT about elves and dragons, than CHERUB might just be the series you're looking for.I give it a five star rating because CHERUB is a crazy book series that's full of guy humour and stuff teenagers are bound to love. Although most of the humour and content is intended for guys, a girl would have fun reading it just the same.The first book, entitled The Recruit, introduces the main character, James. James is your typical kid who plays video games and foot ball and never does his homework. When one day, his mom dies, he is taken to live in a children's home. He soon escapes, getting involved in gangs, smoking, shoplifting and vandalism. After getting arrested, James is taken back to the children's home where he was secretly drugged during the night and taken to the secret base of government spy group, CHERUB. The story quickly unfolds into an explosive mission!It may sound cheesy but it's actually really, really believable! I was addicted after reading the first two chapters!Full of swear words and Pg-13 content, make no mistake CHERUB is a series teens will love. I think the reason why a lot of kids don't like reading, is that most stories seem so fake and child proofed; CHERUB is the exact opposite. It is so on the edge, it has a \\"not suitable for young readers\\" label on the back of the newer copies! You'll also find it in the 13+ section at Chapters bookstore. I guarantee that if you're an 11-16 year old who loves action, fights, and stuff that's really cool, you will love this series.Each book is about a different undercover mission that James and his fellow agents go on. You can really relate to the characters and they all seem like real teens. There's a book about drug dealing, there's one about a prison break, terrorism, even murder. James gets into a relationship with a new girl in every book too:) .And trust me, they all really rock (the books I mean!).Buy the first book! It's only $9.95! You will be addicted.Just to let you know this series is not intended for younger kids. I wouldn't let someone younger than 11 read it."},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"James Choke isn't a typical 11-year old. His mom is probably the fattest mom he's ever seen, and she's a top-flight black market dealer to boot. Sure, he can get anybody in school anything they want for half off, but he can't escape his mom's looming shadow. In the space of one day, though, his luck turns incredibly sour: he's kicked out of school for fighting a girl, gets his butt kicked by the girl's brother, has to deal with his sister's dad who's around for another handout, and his mother dies from drinking while on medication. While in a depressing children's home, he's recruited for a spy agency that's so secret no one even knows what the initials stand for. After getting a hold on his life, choosing to go the way of the spy, and undergoing a grueling 100-day course, he's sent off to infiltrate a hippie community that's planning a violent demonstration. In the middle of that, he meets the girl of his dreams whose father is a cop that doesn't like him.Robert Muchamore is, according to the author information, a private investigator working in London. The CHERUB series, four books so far, are making their way from Great Britain to the United States.James Choke is a great character whose appeal fluctuates between being a colassal screw-up with out-of-control emotions and a kid just trying to survive who cares deeply about his little sister. He's just clever enough to get himself out of life-threatening situations, but then to get himself constantly in hot water with the authority figures at the spy school. Young readers will root for him and empathize with his problems because, spy work aside, they're not so very far from those of most adolescents.There is a small warning with this book. The language may be more explicit than some parents are comfortable with, pushing the book definitely into the teen arena, but featuring a 12-year old hero (he has a birthday during the course of the novel). Also, his reasoning seems to be on par with a fifteen or sixteen-year old.THE RECRUIT sets up the series nicely. Lots of action, lots of character, and plenty of spy background. A timeline dossier is also included, showing the author has thought about the special MI-5 department he's developed. Fans of Alex Rider will probably enjoy these books. There's more dialogue, but the situations are a little more edgy and adult."},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"I had never heard anything about this book when I chose to read it a couple of days ago. I saw it as a related item to another book I was looking at, and decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. This book tells the story of an 11 year old spy, but this is not a story filled with gadget filled missions, it tells of what sometimes felt like a too coarse world with plenty of struggles. It is a grimy life for James, the main character, filled with tragedy, vandalism, and intense physical training. However, it is also a world with friends, perseverance, and some romance.It is hard to give a feel for this book without either making it sound like a very unoriginal and corny spy novel, which it is not, or giving away the whole plot, which is either very boring for people who have read it, or obnoxious for those who have not. It had a very imperfect main character who struggles throughout the book to figure out who he wants to be in his life. I found it refreshing to have an imperfect main character, and also found the other characters to be relatively two dimensional. The issues the novel explores were interesting, though some parts, like the excessive bullying, seemed a bit over the top and unrealistic.I really enjoyed the book, in fact, once I started reading it, I did not put it down until the end of the day when I had finished it, but I must admit that the writing was nothing extraordinary. It was enjoyable for a light read, but the coarse language and the some awkward sentences meant that it was not as good as the story could have led it to be. The foul language and sometimes unsettling situations are something to think about before giving this book to a younger reader. In the edition that I read (it looked like the one pictured here), I spotted about four typos, and to me that seemed a bit sloppy for a published book. However, despite all of that, I really enjoyed following James through his first novel. It was a page-turner from beginning to end, and not one to be missed for teens, or anyone older who enjoy exciting, relatively realistic, adventures of espionage. I will certainly be looking for the sequels."},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"My 9 year old nephew loves these so I bought the first one to take a look. On the back cover is a warning \\"not suitable for younger readers\\" which I took to be a marketing thing (what better way to get your book read by younger readers wanting to read something that makes them seem older!) However, having read the book I feel the warning should be taken somewhat seriously.This is unfortunate though as the story would be ideal for younger readers, and indeed young teens too. It is quite reminiscent of Anthony Horowitz - a perfect scenario for boys. Who would not want to be chosen as a Cherub agent, enlisted by British Secret services for those missions that adults cannot manage?The scenario is perfect and should make for a great and readable series. The first story was a good adventure - maybe staying a little too long on the basic training, but still one that younger readers will love, and older readers can appreciate. I fully intend to buy the next book in the series.But the writing occasionally lets the book down. As a father, there is language in the book and some messages from the book that I would not want to put in front of younger readers, and I will not be recommending it to anyone under the age of 11. Its not terrible, and some of my problem with the language just marks me out as an old fogy!

Of course, I have never seen anyone bullied at my school so this seemed like a bit of a foreign topic. Robert Muchamore seems to know more about video games than he should. For example the only games that were on a jet were old n64 games. Plus, if your queezy dont read this book. James, at one point must kill a chicken. He does and blood and well, chicken waste sprays everywhere. There is a bit of romance but nothing to extreme.

I picked it up on a whim, and I'm so glad I did. I was hooked on the series after just reading the first couple of chapters.James is a troubled teen who has been through a lot. He has a lot stacked against him, a bad home life, bullies at school, and others to make his life miserable.

James's life is turned upside down and backwards because James has to go through 100 days of MI5 bootcamp, and it's not fun. Then after all is said and done, James is ready for his fist mission. That's all I really want to say on the plot.This is a fantastic read. The writing style of Muchamore is fantastic. It flows at a natural pace and keeps the reader hooked through snappy and dialogue, great settings, and the ability to keep the reader hooked form the first page, to the last page, and wanting to go out as fast as they can to get the next book.

When a girl in his class makes fun of his overweight mother, he retaliates. The girl's face is cut open and James is expelled from school. Before he can tell his mom what happens, he discovers her dead in her armchair. James is sent to Nebraska Home because his stepfather and the father of his sister Lauren, don't want him. James joins a dangerous gang and gets caught stealing beers. He spends the night in a cell and wakes up in the morning in a completely different location.James has been relocated to the campus of CHERUB, an agency that trains children to become spies for the British government. After passing a series of tests which included karate and mathematics, James is offered a place at CHERUB, which he readily takes. After changing his name to James Adams, he begins the difficult task of learning how to swim. Once he successfully swims 50 meters, he starts Basic Training.Basic Training is designed to work the trainees to the point of physical and mental exhaustion so when they go on missions as a CHERUB agent, they can perform at a higher level. James's partner, Kerry, has already been through basic training before. She was kicked out halfway through due to a knee injury, and knows all the shortcuts on the obstacle course. She and James overcome their differences and become a well-oiled machine. After a grueling 100 days of physical labor, exhaustion, extreme cold, an instructor that seems to enjoy torturing the trainees, and a trip to sunny Malaysia, James and Kerry pass Basic Training and become CHERUB agents.After waiting around at the CHERUB campus while all his friends go on missions, James is finally given an assignment with his swim instructor, Amy. They are going to uncover any information concerning the Hippie town, Fort Harmony, and an environmentalist/ terrorist group, Help Earth!

Each chapter ends with so many cliff hangers that you just don't want to put the book down for a minute. Robert Muchamore does such a good job describing that you can literally see ever detail, of every person and ever thing they do.The Recruit is one of the best books that I have read in a long time. There is some much action that I got addicted to the book right at the beginning. I recommend this book to readers that love to get lost in their book and forget things around them-Brian Frericks"},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"This is the first book in the Cherub series that has my 13-year-old son riveted the second time through!"},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"Review Written by my son Cullen age 8This is the second book in the CHERUB series.CHERUB is not real but boy or girl you will wish that it were true.CHERUB is very realistic and at the end of the day, who would ever suspect that children could be spying on them?The characters are very real and down to earth and everyone will be able to connect to them, sympathise with them and laugh with them.CHERUB is exciting and fast paced you are into the story from the first page right up to the very last page and you will NOT want to put it down.CHERUB is very funny and should come with a warning on the front cover; WARNING \\"You WILL Laugh Out Loud\\"!There are lots of twists and turns and shocks, as the author Robert Muchamore reveals more information and depth about the main characters.The subjects covered are very real worldwide worries, from Chemical Warfare to Drug Trafficking, and covers real everyday worries, such as coping with the death of a parent, to asking out a person who you fancy.Robert Muchamore is definitely in touch with his young fans and is very open and loves to speak with you and get your ideas and views, you can talk to him on his FORUM at www.cherubcampus.com.

His mom is probably the fattest woman around and to top it off, she's a black market dealer. He's got a half-sister, whose father is a piece of work and doesn't care of anything except money and his next beer. Today, his luck has turned for the worse: he's kicked out of school for injuring a girl, gets his beat up by the girl's brother, has to deal with his sister's dad who's around for another handout, and his mother dies from drinking while on medication.While in an orphanage, he's recruited for a spy agency that's so secret no one even knows what the initials stand for. After getting choosing to join as a recruit and undergoing a grueling 100-day course, surviving only with the help of his partner, he's sent off to infiltrate a hippie commune that's planning a violent demonstration.James is a great character whose appeal is being a real-life adolescent, with big problems who is given an unexpected second chance. He still manages to find trouble wherever he goes - but who is going to believe that a kid is spying on them? This is an adventure of epic proportions, clever and edgy, but it does have adult situations and language (so not for younger readers - probably 12 and up is the appropriate age range). I think this is a great action/adventure story that both boys and girls will thoroughly enjoy!The CHERUB Series: The Recruit (1), Class A (2), Maximum Security (3), The Killing (4), Divine Madness (5), Man vs. Beast (6), The Fall (7), Mad Dogs (8), The Sleepwalker (9), Dark Sun (9.5), The General (10), Brigands MC (11), Shadow Wave (12)"},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"I read 2 other series for boys and was not impressed. Even with all the action and explosions, I didn't care. I ordered this expecting a similar reaction but was completely surprised at how vital and compelling the characters were. Robert Muchamore tells a rousing tale well but just as importantly, the characters come alive and I was drawn into their world. Well done, you, Robert."},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"The beginning of this book is well written and creates a main character that you really feel you can root for - James Adams has a mother who is ill, then dies, a temper he can't control when things don't go his way and a little sister he has to look after.He's recruited for a supposedly 'top secret' team of British child spies (which the author just about manages to make believable). The concept is a good one, but the more the book goes on, the more it becomes clear that the jeopardy facing the characters is not real or intense. A training exercise can't ever be as exciting as a real mission.That's generally the problem with this series as a whole. There are a lot of scenes of training and general life on the 'cherub' campus, but very quickly these descends into a teenage life that is probably less interesting than the lives of many of the readers.This book does have that strong first half, making it the best in the series, so it's worth reading for that.Also, I would say this series is not very suitable for readers younger than 14 because of some unnecessary adult content. There are other action and spy books out there that are better for readers under that age (and just plain better as well!)"},{"Title":"Recruit (Cherub) (Bk. 1)","review":"The book C.H.E.R.U.B. does have an interesting plot, starting out with the main characters \\"Mum\\" dyeing, then being separated from his sister. After which he joins a secret organization that gives the book its name. This leads me to one of the things that I like and dislike about C.H.E.R.U.B. The first thing I like is that the plot is fast-paced and never really slows down. Always showing you new things and giving you new characters. Although the pace is fast, it is actually a little too fast, it never really exploits something's to it's full potential, for example he gets over his mother dyeing, his sister being taken away, in almost three days. Also the book is not very descriptive, lowering the reading level a notch or two.If I were to recommend this to someone I would recommend this book to younger males, maybe of the ages twelve and under, because the reading level is lower. Also I would recommend it to that age group because the main character is around eleven to twelve. Also it would be bad of me not to mention how this book compares to the Alex Rider Series and I would say that it is much better than C.H.E.R.U.B.So this book is not bad, but it is not that good either."},{"Title":"Solution: A fascinating breakthrough from illusion to reality to transcendental being!","review":"Michael Giletto has found what many seek.

These involve trade liberalisation, capital account liberalisation, devaluation, budget cuts, higher interest rates and privatisation.Yet the World Bank's 1993 study, East Asian Miracle, admitted, \\"Most high-performing Asian economies began industrialization with a protectionist orientation.\\" Its 1994 study admitted, \\"Import substitution, if done too rapidly, will reduce the profitability of domestic firms competing with imports.\\" Yet the World Bank keeps on enforcing trade liberalisation.As a result, most developing countries have experienced de-industrialisation. Trade liberalisation has done the most damage to the poorest countries, like Ghana, Zimbabwe and Haiti. But others have suffered deindustrialisation too - Chile, Brazil, in fact most of Latin America. In Mexico, Jamaica, Ghana, Colombia, Uruguay and Paraguay, manufactured exports grew fast, and dependence on foreign markets grew, yet industry did not advance.Other countries' industries grew with little export growth because they liberalised their trade only after they reached a certain level of industrialisation and as part of a long-term industrial policy. Those countries that liberalised rapidly and indiscriminately did badly.The \`reform' programmes also failed to increase investment, particularly in manufacturing. Investment fell from 1979-81's level even when there was lots of foreign direct investment, as in Latin America. Private investors preferred to invest in real estate, and the World Bank enforced deep cuts in public spending.Shafaeddin cites Rowthorn and Ramaswamy's claim, \\"de-industrialisation is simply the natural outcome of successful economic development and is generally associated with rising living standards.\\" Recent events are challenging this complacent assumption.Shafaeddin concludes that the \`reform' programmes are \`likely to lead to the destruction of the existing industries'. They will lock poorer countries into producing and exporting primary goods, simple processing and at best assembly operation or other labour-intensive work with little or no prospect for industrial advance."},{"Title":"The Famous Dutch Kitchen Restaurant Cookbook: Family-Style Diner Delights from the Heart of Pennsylvania (Roadfood Cookbook)","review":"This is just a fun book to own.

I love this book & have used many of the recipes."},{"Title":"The Famous Dutch Kitchen Restaurant Cookbook: Family-Style Diner Delights from the Heart of Pennsylvania (Roadfood Cookbook)","review":"The reason I gave this book just one star is because I don't want potential buyers to be misled into buying this book thinking they will be getting authentic Penna. Dutch recipes. The recipes in this book are for diner or family restaurant food, not for real Amish or Mennonite dishes. I should know. I grew up in Penna. Dutch country, and I have many Mennonite and Brethren relatives who cook the real Penna. Dutch way. In fact, despite the fact that the owners of this restaurant call it the Dutch Kitchen, it's not even located in Penna. Dutch country. (Maybe if it was they'd know we are Penna. Germans, not Dutch.) The restaurant is in Frackville, which is in what we in Penna. refer to as the Coal Region. The people in that area are mostly descendents of immigrant miners who came to Penna. much later than the Penna. Germans, and they have a much different food tradition. I knew even before I got to the recipes that something was amiss when the authors started talking about tortellini soup and city chicken in the introduction. Believe me, Amish people are not sitting down to a bowl of tortellini soup at their barn raisings. If you want real Penna. Dutch (German) recipes buy a copy of the Mennonite Community Cookbook by Mary Emma Showalter, which is so ubiquitous in Penna. German homes that it is simply referred to as THE Mennonite cookbook. I'm not saying the recipes in the Famous Dutch Kitchen cookbook aren't good; I'm saying they aren't the Amish recipes some of the other people who reviewed this book thought they were.

Full of wonderful recipes and tips.

Aside from the fact that this book has just been published, I got a copy to review because I grew up on the same kind of Pennsylvania Dutch cooking described in this book. Thus, I was sure I was doubly qualified to evaluate this volume.The value of this book to a reader will be directly proportional to the degree to which they really like diner food of eastern Pennsylvania. Like many other local cookbooks, the food is simply not as interesting as you will find in just about any cookbook by a professional culinary journalist such as Patricia Wells; top rated restaurant chef such as Tom Colicchio or Alfred Portale; or TV program host such as Sara Moulton or Tyler Florence.All the recipes for non-Pennsylvania Dutch specialities are pale imitations of, for example, Italian or New England specialities. The recipes rely very heavily on canned products and the amount of butter used in many of the recipes would make a French chef blanche. Oddly enough, some recipes occasionally use margarine instead of butter for no apparent reason.One example of a classic recipe done with an inferior recipe is the offering for creamed chipped beef. This book's recipe adds no spices whatsoever. A very good recipe in Craig Claiborne's New York Times cookbook uses a technique that is much more familiar to cooks who are used to making roux and bechamel sauces. It also suggests adding nutmeg, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne.Another classic with an inferior recipe is the cole slaw recipe. It is just one of a long string of vegetable and vegetable / protein salads where mayonnaise is a major ingredient. James Beard gives a far superior recipe for cole slaw with no mayonnaise. I am entirely familiar with the fact that there are hundreds of variations on cole slaw. I am only indicating that the version offered here is not the best.All recipe instructions are fairly simple because so many of the dishes are fairly simple, relying on rich ingredients such as butter, mayonnaise, half and half, cream, or canned soups for their punch. The instructions for preparing most vegetables is to \`chop' them, where most cookbooks would specify a quarter inch dice or smaller. Some recipes call for grating onions by a food processor. Most other writers would suggest a dice, as the food processor can turn onions into slime.Most of my comments are really not relevant to true Pennsylvania Dutch specialities, as the book is pretty true to my experience of this style of cooking. The recipes for the famous \`Dutch' relishes such as chow-chow are pretty close (although my experience is that the green beans are usually cut, while the authors put them in whole). The recipes for breakfast sticky buns are as good or better than I have seen from similar local sources, but not as good as the Julia Child book on baking.One really surprising exception to the very ordinary type of recipe to be found here is the pancake recipe. This is one of the very few places where I have seen people take the trouble to separate yolks from whites and whip the whites and fold them into the rest of the batter. I am impressed.If you want an ethnologic picture of central Pennsylvania diner fare, you cannot find any better source than this book. It is also a reasonably good book of Pennsylvania Dutch recipes, but it leaves out several classics such as stuffed pig stomach and apple dumplings. If you are fond of the authors' series of Roadfood books, you do not want to miss this offering. It's picture of coal region life, as someone who lives on the outskirts of this area should know, is excellent.If you want a good Pennsylvania Dutch cookbook, I recommend you pass on this book and get a book by Betty Groff, Mary Showalter, or Phyllis Pellman Good.Recommended with qualifications. I give it four stars rather than three because of its relatively low list price."},{"Title":"Dictionary of Cliches","review":"I haven't read Partidge's \\"Dictionary of Cliches\\" (the four stars is for the concept), but I just ordered a more comprehensive similar book called \\"The Facts on File Dictionary of Cliches\\" by Christine Ammer. Partridge cites 2,000 examples. By contrast, Ammer lists twice as many. No matter which book you choose, such a dictionary is indispensable to anyone who loves words, cares about the language, writes or edits for a living or has aspirations to write the Great American Novel. I spent the last 14 years as a professional copy editor and am now engaged in writing a first novel. I am meticulous to the point of anal-retentiveness, but cliches still creep into my writing -- so surreptitiously that they sometimes slip past me. I would speculate that every writer has exactly the same problem. A dictionary like Ammer's or Partridge's is the equivalent of a can of Raid to ferret out those miscreants and kill them dead. In answer to the earlier reviewer, even smart people can lapse into falling back on cliches. Because they are so insidious and widespread, they are at the forefront of our minds whenever we write just about anything. A dictionary of cliches can help keep you vigilant and on your guard."},{"Title":"Dictionary of Cliches","review":"As always, Eric Partridge does a first class job putting this book together.

Leaving a prosperous career behind, Hadley is in search of more enlightening and meaningful experiences than her lush New York life affords her. She does very little in the way of planning, throws caution to the wind and hopes for the best. While the first part of her Asian adventure is quite comfortable and even luxurious at times, she dives headfirst into the adventure she covets when she hitches a ride aboard a sailboat with a small, all-male American crew. Her stories of her experiences sailing to remote destinations throughout Southeast and Southwest Asia and the Mediterranean are exhilarating and fascinating. Hadley's writing style is a bit haughty, however her stories are so interesting that this small flaw is hardly noticeable. Not the best travel memoir I have ever read, but an interesting tale by a gutsy traveler who was before her time."},{"Title":"Give Me the World","review":"FIVE STARS. This book is one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in a long time. A travel memoir so vibrant and alive, it's hard to believe it was written fifty years ago, by a writer who was then in her twenties. So much fun to read - impossible to put down."},{"Title":"Give Me the World","review":"Every so often one reads a book that absolutely captures their heart and from the moment a person picks up that particular book they are lost in the pages. The fiction writer Jasper Fforde might refer to that as \\"reading into a book.\\" This is one of those books. I was searching for a travel book for my reading group and nothing stood out and then I randomly found this book one day. I read the first four pages and felt such pangs of excitement. I wanted to read more right then and there. (I couldn't of course because I had to go back to work) I bought the book as quickly as I could and jumped in. Leila Hadley knows how to engage the reader and you get the distinct pleasure of watching her mature in \\"Give Me the World\\". In the beginning it is almost as if she is running away with her child when she decides to go to Asia. They enjoy a fairly comfortable existence and she ventures carefully into the scenery. She is almost slumming it a bit initially. It is when she reaches Bangkok that she begins to change and when she meets the crew of the 'California' she blossoms. Some of my new favorite characters come from this book. Her son Kippy stands out as this quiet solid figure who seems to go easily with any new plan.This book also gives a wonderful glimpse into another time and another world. I think it is important to take that context into mind when reading the book when she mentions various characters and the way some people spoke of each other.The book makes me want to run off and see more of the world. One of the things the author mentions speaks to my heart that after traveling one feels listless and not refreshed like one anticipates. It is one of the most true comments I have ever run across in travel writing. It is almost mourning the adventure.I will encourage everyone I meet to read this book."},{"Title":"Give Me the World","review":"Travel books have never, ever interested me--when I hear that one is particularly good, I tend to think, \\"Yeah, that was THEIR experience, but there's no way it can translate . . . \\" My thinking has always been that you yourself have to be somewhere, live somewhere, to really know what it's like or else what's the point?My views on this changed when my sister gave me a copy of Leila Hadley's extraordinary \\"Give Me the World.\\" A travel book in name only, this work by a great-great-great-great-granddaughter of author James Boswell is more a journey of self-discovery than it is about the places she visits--but the writing is so fierce, so fine, so rich and complex, that as a travelogue it is still head and shoulders above 90% of what else is out there cluttering the travel book bookshelves. Case in point:Of trying to learn Siamese: \\"Learning to recognize such simple signs as DANGER, WOMEN and EXIT was as difficult as memorizing the patterns in filigreed silver.\\"Of the Siamese attitude towards life: \\"Although Siamese, as good Buddhists, do not believe in taking life, they see nothing wrong in rescuing a fish from drowning. If the creatures die on the bank or in a net, it is probably from exhaustion due to their long immersion, they say, and surely there can be no harm in eating them.\\"Of Bangkok's reputation as a den of iniquity: \\"To make sure that one missed nothing of Bangkok's [physical] wonderland, the Siamese had thoughtfully provided a 'Baedeker' . . . in the preface [it noted], 'This pocket book is somewhat inevitable to be kept ready at the hands.' \\"Of her opium den experience: \\"I thought ahead to the times when, back in New York, I would say, 'By the way, I once had an interesting experience in an opium den' or even, 'Opium? Why, of course, I smoked it in Bangkok.' \\"Of the difference between western and Malayan clothing: \\" . . . the people not in western costume looked out of place and a little garish, like partygoers in evening clothes coming home at breakfast time.\\"Of cooking on board a small boat: \\" . . . breakfast was a tempestuous affair. Vic darted about the lounge scaling coffee mugs at us, swearing at the stove, in a pother that the biscuits were burned on the bottom and raw on top, rattling and banging pans, and all the while keeping up a running flow of conversation about an article one of the men's adventure pulps had ordered him to rewrite, about the things he wanted to do--all the wildly impractical things like walking from Cairo to Morocco, chartering a dhow to explore the Baluchistan coast, leading an archaeological expedition to Alaska, and then his talk coursed off onto the subject of women and their extraordinary behavior.\\"On jellyfish: \\"We were almost abreast of the muddy current when a myriad of filmy jellyfish streamed past the hull. They were beautiful things, delicately colored--some like fragile bladders of Venetian blown glass, some like the pinky-fawn undersides of toadstools with pearly streamers.\\"On steering the boat at dawn: \\"The dawn watch. It was one of those chance rewards of travel, a magic moment, untranslatable from its time and place, a moment which lives on perpetually, with all its colors made fast. Just then there was no sign of dawn. The masts were still black against the luminous darkness of the sky, the sails grey in the starlight. There was a thrilling flush of wind against my skin.\\"On the Taj Mahal: \\"It shimmered. It glowed. It had the magical property of not looking man-made. Its marble walls had the tender radiance of seashells, petals and moonlit snow.\\"I could go on and on (and already have!), but really, you have to read the book to get more of this gorgeous prose and see a sheltered girl--yes, a girl, despite her twenty-five years and her six-year old son--blossom into a woman of the world as she makes her way around it.

The best part of the book was Leila Hadley's descriptive narrative, she made scenery and events come alive. Descriptions were never trite, nor were they striving too hard to be original. The author showed a gifted intelligence in how she described what she saw and felt on this brave and adventurous trip around the world. It was also interesting that she took this trip with her little boy in the 1950s, showing an independence that wasn't the norm those days.

Dissatisfied with her life as a public relations executive in New York, \\"which seemed to claim from me barely more than an acceptance\\" she had expected departure to confer immediate elation. It doesn't and tossing off the smart scarlet coat \\"that still wasn't paid for,\\" she frets that \\"all my preconceived ideas would turn out the same way, flattening with experience into dim shadows.\\"She needn't have worried. Relaxing into the unstructured languor of shipboard life, invigorated by Kippy, \\"artless, untroubled and reacting in accord to a single heart and a single mind,\\" her sense of wonder blossoms. Hadley has a gift for description, for making the sights, sounds and smells she perceives come alive in the reader's mind.In Manila and then Hong Kong, everything fascinates her - the rooms, the people, the sights, the food. She remarks guiltlessly on the service. \\"I felt too light-headed and too comfortable to reflect philosophically on the social implications of cheap labor\\" and marvels at the oddities in the food market. \\"Centuries of famine and overpopulation have driven the Chinese to experimental extremes in nourishment....Nevertheless...I prefer Chinese food to French - it's prettier, the flavor is more subtle, and it's much less fattening.\\" Treated to a restaurant banquet, she gamely tries everything. \\"Until I had almost eaten the last of them, I didn't realize that the lima beans were newborn mice coated with honey.\\"Hadley is easy with people (most of the boors she runs across are Americans), with a blithe expectation of mutual respect which seems to work. Though most helpful acquaintances are men the prospect of inappropriate sexual advances is scarcely mentioned except for one tongue-in-cheek, \\"as I was protected by a small child instead of a husband.\\"It's one of those ugly Americans who, in Bangkok, introduces her to the California, a schooner which seizes her imagination and becomes the real soul of her trip. \\"How wonderful to travel with uncertainty...to come slowly and quietly to places where there were things you did not know.\\" After three and half years the four American crewmembers are a close unit and want no part of a woman's disruptive influence. Though Hadley begs and pleads for them to take her to Singapore, they refuse.But when she and Kippy show up at the docks in Singapore, they capitulate. Hadley has a rare gift for visceral communication. With her we feel the efficient organization of the boat, the camaraderie among the crew, the damp, the lousy food, the accumulation of grime and salt on skin, the harsh rasp of a moldy cigarette, the heart-soaring joy of being aboard.She takes a keen interest in getting to know the crew, surprised at how their disparate personalities contribute to shipboard harmony. Kippy's easy acceptance of everything new, from a delightful shower of squid to the draconian rule that he remain silent during all meals, charms without resorting to cuteness.The difficulties of everyday tasks, from using the head to preparing a meal are described with good-natured humor and her description of their attempts to teach her to sail are hilarious. Coming into an anchorage one day, the crew takes down the sails. \\"I smiled to myself, because I finally knew what the Genny meant. It was the general term aboard for the Genoa jib, which I thought was a beautiful name for a sail.\\"In each port Hadley takes everything in, letting sights, sounds and smells sink into her. Kippy finds sightseeing with his mother boring but will tag behind the crew endlessly. Hadley conveys the bustle and crowds and smells of Eastern markets, the Tamil's annual painful penance day, the luxury of a bath.On her customary dawn watch she reflects: \\"On land there was such an infinite variety of people and things over which my consciousness could flow, but now all my consciousness and senses were suddenly confined and focused on the minute area of a schooner...a universe that I could walk around in seconds.\\"In Ceylon her stint was over, to be resumed again in Beirut, five months later after an interlude amid the wonder and squalor of India. Though she is dazzled by a meeting with Indira Gandhi, it's Kippy's amah, Lucy, who becomes the complex embodiment of India. The quirks, customs and personalities of individuals and the happenstance of traveling, whether it be the aftermath of a violent dust storm or the intricacies of bargaining or the play of light on the Taj Mahal, hold her attention in the moment.Though Hadley is open to people and seems to expect (and get) the best from locals, she does not hesitate to vent disapproval or dislike. But when she gets to Beirut and meets the usurper George, the fussy provisional addition to the California crew, she pounces. Describing his British tropic regimentals, she conveys a prig. \\"He was talking to the colonel in French and emitting little neighing laughs at the colonels remarks.\\"Unabashedly jealous, Hadley's rancor is checked only by occasional defensiveness and, later, by the need for harmony aboard. Hilariously funny, her behavior for the first time emphasizes her youth and, perversely, her femininity as George is always prodding her to dress up and try new hairstyles. And then there's the meeting with the American destroyer in Rhodes which rings perfectly true and perfectly evokes one of the better \`50s comedy movies.All too soon, the trip comes to an end. Hadley had expected to return to New York fresh and eager but feels instead as if \\"I had suffered metamorphosis in reverse, a butterfly become a caterpillar.\\"\\"Like love, travel is absorbing. Everything else withdraws to make room for its emotional demands and the expansion of one's senses.\\"And she has one more surprise in store for the reader, a shock, which on reflection, seems perfectly in character."},{"Title":"Selected Odes of Pablo Neruda (Latin American Literature and Culture)","review":"this one is a good choice.

Wodehouse fan. The most hilarious of his novels somehow leaves me with no desire whatever to pick up another one. I enjoy his short stories, but somehow I don't really want to track down those I've never read. I'm sure there are many people like me. They, too, should read the Golf Omnibus before they die.-And furthermore, I don't play golf. Nor will I. But I like the *idea* of golf. Golf, in its true form, is the epitome of Romanticism in sport. It's the game of the Quest. If this game, the game Wodehouse writes about, became extinct long ago; well that makes his book all the more valuable.I'm certain this is funnier than anything else that P.G. Wodehouse wrote (read \\"Rodney has a Relapse\\" and keep a straight face - I defy you). How could it not be? He was writing about something that was (a) unbelievably silly, and (b) as far as he could tell, the most important thing in the world."},{"Title":"The Golf Omnibus","review":"Wodehouse loved the game, and it shows in his writing. While golfers with a sense of tradition will appreciate many of the sometimes-obscure references, one need not be a golfer to appreciate the elegance of these short stories.

But the golf stories rank among his very best, even for someone who doesn't know a bogie from a birdie. &quot;The Coming of Gowf,&quot; &quot;The Purification of Rodney Spelvin,&quot; and most others in this volume fall in the stack I read over and over. Ranging more widely, I find this applies to every sport Plum takes a pen to, from Rugger to Cricket. Another subject he has a sixth sense for is animals. I avoided for a long time the PGW Bestiary, but if the stories of Geofrey the cat (sp.?) or Ukridge and the dogs, or the cats re: Claude and Eustace's initiation, or for that matter, the ubiquitous broken-down steeds that broke gents with sporting blood are always putting a spot on--if these were the only stories Wodehouse ever wrote, those fortunate enough to find them would still be devouring the full repertoire. Fortunately, there seems to be a PGW renaissance, with everything being reprinted (such as this omnibus). So now my &quot;best stories list&quot; runs: Jeeves, Drones, Mulliner, animals, golf, but the list reads just as well from the bottom up."},{"Title":"The Golf Omnibus","review":"As a lover of golf and a professional writer, I recommend this book to anyone, especially those who love the game.Forget that every plot is identical. Wodehouse's genius is in his phrasing, his irony and his outrageousness. He is a master of caricature and timing.Wait for that day of rain or snow, curl up by the window and lose yourself in the dreamy fantasy world of golf. You will simply laugh out loud."},{"Title":"The Golf Omnibus","review":"Wow - This guy is a very concise and accurate writer. I was literally laughing as I read it and for several days afterward.It is a solid read with much punch to it."},{"Title":"The Golf Omnibus","review":"Great literature is supposed to bring you an appreciation of something you hadn't considered before. Wodehouse's golf stories did it for me like few others. None are terribly subtle--most are told by the Oldest Member, who on the first half-page collars a helpless younger golfer and tells him a story that turns out to be worth staying for. The narration is slightly sarcastic, and there are only two types of stories at heart: guy and girl made for each other get married because of golf, or guy uses golf to avoid girl unfit for him. There's always a subplot of a bad golfer breaking 100 or two longtime rivals in an 18 hole match, but nothing seems to get reused.Despite using upper-crust characters in his stories, Wodehouse's work exhibits only a fake pretension. Plus there are cool names and recurring characters such as the golf champ Sandy McHoots. It's a bit more comprehensible than some Yoknapathawpa nonsense. A love triangle through three stories features a poet who(gasp) recites his poetry while people focus loses a golferess to a golfer, almost regains her, and then tries to learn golf courting her sister. Nobody is evil, although some people deserve--and get--a good comic socking.But what makes Wodehouse appealing is how his characters are comically obsessed with golf. I have better things to be obsessed with, but I was able to connect with this and recognize how Wodehouse laughs at them. After I stopped laughing.I've never read a collection of stories more insightful, easy to follow and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Golf Omnibus","review":"The manner in which Wodehouse has developed the characters in the stories is indeed amazing. One hilarius feature I noticed in many of the stories is the attempt made by the victim (listener) to escape from the oldest member's clutches whenever he begins to narrate a story.Wodehouse is at the top of his form in this one.

DeGruchy have done a great service to those seeking a better understanding of this great theologian and pastor. Bonhoeffer began writing just as Hitler and the Nazis began their rise to power; his life ended by hanging in a concentration camp just days before the Allies arrived. Although his works stand as a powerful argument against the German church's surrender to the terror of Nazism, they are just as powerful and relevant today. The authors are noted Bonhoeffer scholars who share not only a deep respect for the man but a desire to help others understand and appreciate him. Each chapter is well-researched and scholarly, but readable and fascinating. The English-language bibliography is a great resource for further reading and research. This book is a must for everyone interested in learning more about one of this century's greatest theologians."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Dietrich Bonhoeffer (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"Save your money.

This book purports to be a series of diverse explorations of a great theologian and martyr. It is nothing of the sort. We hear nothing from reformed evangelicals who regard Bonhoeffer as virtually apostate. Instead we have a collection of essays written by those who claim to pass as Lutherans and Anglicans (there is I believe one Roman Catholic) whose next claim to fame after violating the kerygma of Christianity will no doubt be to announce with pride that they are baptizing Dolphins. Consider the statement &quot; People like Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi illustrate what Bonhoeffer means (p 118) All one has to do is to read the first page of Bonhoeffer's Ethics to realize that hypothetically however much he may have admired them they represent exactly the OPPOSITE of what Bonhoeffer means. Bonhoeffer is a LUTHERAN and a conservative one at that but these writers are using Bonhoeffer to suit their own agendas (which they concede has often been done) Don't read this book--read The Ethics or Act and Being--notice the influence of Barth. Bonhoffer deserves better than to be left in the hands of the &quot;Honest to God&quot; people. It might also be good to have a look at what Luther said as well."},{"Title":"Tales from the Mohaves. (Civilization of the American Indian (Paperback))","review":"This a collection of fairly simple but fascinating myths and stories from the Mohave Indians, collected by Herman Grey (who is himself a Mohave, of the Beaver Clan). Together with the classic novel of late 19th century Mohave life, Crazy Weather, by Charles McNichols, it provides a strong sense of Mohave tradition and culture.One of the unique features of Mohave stories (and Mohave life in general) is the central role played by dreams. As it says in the preface to this book: &quot;The Mohave clings to his belief in dreams as a basis for everyday life. Not only all shamanistic power, but all myths, songs, bravery, fortune in battle, and good fortune in gambling derive from dreams. Every special event is dreamed. Knowledge is not a thing to be learned, a Mohave will say, but something to be acquired by each person through his dreaming.... Dreams, then, are the foundation of Mohave life. Dreams are always stated as if they had been cast in mythological modes. In no other tribes are activities so controlled by this psychic state. In no other Indian culture is daily life so completely reflected in myths and songs.&quot;Some of the stories are legendary and illustrate the Mohave concepts of their relationship with nature, while others are based on actual historical events, such as an ill-fated raid by the Mohave and Apaches on the Pimas to the south.If you're interested in Mohave traditions, American Indian cultures in general, or in the region of the lower Colorado River and its history and cultures, I think you'll appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Tales from the Mohaves.

Plus it is a great way to introduce the genre of mystery and suspense and teach the children what qualities a book must have to actually be a mystery.

If I were Wroe I would withdraw it as it might dissuade readers from discovering her other wonderful works. I've read some fabulous books over the past few months, several of which have kept me glued to my seat: Nigel Randell's THE WHITE HEADHUNTER, the story of a 19-year-old who was captured by cannibals before becoming one himself; Simon Baatz's FOR THE THRILL OF IT, two boy assassins of around 15 who spoke a dozen languages between them (one of which was Sanskrit!), the absolutely hilarious DREYFUS AFFAIR by Peter Lefcourt and Wroe's totally remarkable PERKIN, another incredible story about the lad who pretended to be one of the sons of Edward IV, supposedly murdered in the Tower by Richard III. The king at the time, Henry VII, spent thousands of pounds--millions in today's money--trying to locate him. There had been some great Henrys in English history, the amazing Henry II (my all-time favorite), father of the no less amazing Richard Coeur de Lion and husband to the equally amazing Eleanor d'Aquitaine, and Henry V of Agincourt fame. This Henry, the VII, far less amazing, had spent, as I said, a fortune hunting down the impostor, Perkin, but like l'Avare he stashed away the rest of his loot until the country's coffers were literally overflowing with gold. It took Henry VIII little time to dilapidate it all before finding other resources (to keep his libido red hot) like robbing monasteries, even if it meant founding of church of his own. The king's sheep followed him then as they do their betters today (Vegas, any one?)--strange for a Democracy, but of lesser interest than a boy cannibal, boy assassins, a gay baseball player and a boy impostor.

Mrs. Parshall and Mrs. Perry touch on pertinent topics that all women need to discuss, and they do it with humor, love and profound Scriptural truth.Reading this book is like sitting underneath the warm wing of a mama bird, nestled closely to the heart of a mom who loves Christ Jesus. And reading the letters from the daughter is like seeing those often-unasked questions verbalized from the hearts of this younger generation, with a sincere, intelligent wisdom.Perry and Parshall have beautifully crafted the love story of a King towards His precious princesses, through the use of fairy tales and as you read this, you can't help but feel the warm soothing love of the One who adores you more than anyone else.I laughed and cried through this whole book and couldn't put it down until the very last page. And the ending just left me in tears because it was so wonderful. You have to get this book for yourself and for anyone else you love because, dreams really do come true; for you are truly loved by One who calls you His own."},{"Title":"When the Fairy Dust Settles: A Mother and Her Daughter Discuss What Really Matters","review":"\\"When the Fairy Dust Settles\\" reads like a modern-day book of Proverbs, this one written as a mother-daughter conversation. As Solomon in Proverbs shares his real-life wisdom with his son, so Janet Parshall dialogues with her adult daughter Sarah Parshall Perry about reconciling childhood dreams with reality--living with adventurous integrity when the fairy dust settles.The book of Proverbs brilliantly and practically addresses issues that many parents blush to discuss with their children. Likewise, mother Janet and daughter Sarah discuss five core issues that really matter: beauty, self-worth, relationships, sex, and treasures (money and materialism). What makes the book so powerful is the way these relevant topics are presented--conversationally in story form. The authors beautifully weave together the biblical narrative, the narrative of beloved fairy tales, and the narrative of modern life.Unlike some Christian books on the topic, \\"When the Fairy Dust Settles\\" does not settle for a fairy tale view of life. Listen to their heart-felt summary: \\"As young girls we all believed in fairy tales. We dreamed of happily-ever-afters, sure that our futures were blessed. And had to deal with the real world and what happens when the fairy dust settles.\\"A Pollyanna philosophy of life says, \\"This life's a fairy tale.\\" An Existentialist life philosophy says, \\"This life is all there is, and it is cruel and harsh.\\" A Christian theology of life, as cogently presented by Parshall and Perry, says, \\"This life is not all there is. Face what happens when the fairy dust settles in light of the eternally true tale of a King who sent His Prince to pursue, woe, win, and renew His princess.\\"Each of the five sections contain three chapters with each chapter offering an exchange of love letters interacting about topics that every mother and daughter wish they could discuss. But don't let that \\"love letter\\" stuff fool you. They don't always agree, but they do always disagree respectfully. And they always write with thought-provoking poignancy.If you're a mother of a daughter, buy two copies. Read them together. Then write your own proverbial love letters to each other, sharing honestly about living after the fairy dust settles.If you're a husband and the father of a daughter, buy three copies. The one you read could help you to understand the women in your life better than you could ever imagine.After you buy the book, and read the fifteen chapters, be sure not to miss the conclusion: \\"The Final Fairy Tale.\\" Without understanding the final fairy tale, you really can't understand how Janet and Sarah interpret the reality we call \\"life.\\"Reviewer: Dr. Robert W. Kellemen is the author of \\"Soul Physicians\\" and \\"Spiritual Friends.\\" Bob is also a Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor, a seminary professor and department chair, and a public high school wrestling coach. Oh, he also happens to be a husband and the father of a daughter and a son, and the owner of three copies of \\"When the Fairy Dust Settles.\\""},{"Title":"Wulf the Saxon;: A story of the Norman conquest","review":"I received this book to read as a school assignment. After I read the first ten pages, I thought it was going to be pretty boring. I mean, how interesting is a book about getting in a quarrel about tripping over someone's feet. I wondered how Henty managed to write a book that goes on for 360 pages with really small print that kept going on like that. Then, I decided to read a little more. The second chapter wasn't quite as bad so I read a little more, until it got so interesting I didn't want to stop!G. A. Henty wrote a scores of historical fiction stories about the Middle Ages and other time periods, including Ancient Civilizations, the Renaissance, and even journeys to the new world. At the turn of the century, he was a renowned author, especially among high-school boys. I am surprised that he has been almost completely forgotten today. Henty is a marvelous author who wrote exciting, historically accurate, action-adventure books.Wulf is a Saxon thane who is under the command of Earl Harold of Wessex. He is always by Harold's side, ready for adventure with his right-hand man Osgod and his best friend Beorn. They fight the Welsh, the Bretons, Vikings, and finally the Normans under the command of the Duke of Normandy, a.k.a. William the Conqueror at the final conflict at Hastings.If all Henty's books are like this one, I'm going to ask my parents to order the whole set! The only downside to investing your time in this book is the beginning is a little slow. But after that, It's Great! I can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Wulf the Saxon;: A story of the Norman conquest","review":"the straightforward manor and general tone of writing is a style I enjoy. it is an easy read, and the author was a master at bringing a section of history and a historical figure to life. after a wikipedia search on the historic figure the main characters revolve around I found many of the historic anecdotes and snippets of info historians argue over have been fleshed out well and good by the author."},{"Title":"Wulf the Saxon;: A story of the Norman conquest","review":"I am a fan of G.A. Henty and have read and listened to many of his stories. I love how he bring history to life. This is my favorite of his book. I love the time period (Norman conquest) and the actual historical details. I also like that he does not ignore fashion of the day and spends some time describing what people wore in pretty good detail (maybe 12 year old boys don't like this?). Worth every penny!"},{"Title":"Wulf the Saxon;: A story of the Norman conquest","review":"Wulf the Saxon gives a wonderful glimpse into the life of the Saxon monks, thanes, lords and peasants in the early eleventh century, as well as into the homes of Norman lords. The story is interesting and well written, filled with historical characters and events. The only thing that slightly annoyed me is that Henty seemed to go out of his way to give Wulf opportunities to distinguish himself.I particularly appreciated the pureness of Edith and Harold's relationship, and their honorable behavior when he had to marry Ealdgyth. I also really appreciated the respect Harold shows to all men, and how Duke William is portrayed as being no worse than most rulers of that time (though many of his actions are clearly shown as wrong) and as having a few admirable qualities. I highly recommend Wulf the Saxon to anyone older than thirteen who desires to learn more about the Norman Conquest or King Harold."},{"Title":"Wulf the Saxon;: A story of the Norman conquest","review":"OK, the language is old-fashioned, but this is a ripping good yarn: there are shipwrecks, escapes, warfare, a castle seige, spying, and intrigue.

All Henty's novels are free, give one a try."},{"Title":"Wulf the Saxon;: A story of the Norman conquest","review":"Interesting story in an authentic historical setting.

It seems that the writer belabored some points and had a habit of going into too much detail, which slowed the story down.

Having said all that, I did like the book."},{"Title":"Wulf the Saxon;: A story of the Norman conquest","review":"I enjoyed the book overall and felt it was entertaining in so far as it presented a view of the world as it might have been during this time following the structure of the historic past. But, it was a bit difficult to read with many stylistic and grammatical errors (just a pet peeve of mine that made it hard for me to read things smoothly). Also the story line was good but I felt it wrapped up sort of too well and quickly at the end. Still, the nature of the book seemed to be to steep the reader in the past and it did this well.

There are many fine books on the subject but by far, Airborne and Allergenic Pollen of North America, by Dr. Walter H. Lewis, is hands down the best.The writing here is complex but easily understandable. The material and research in the book are deep and break considerable new ground. Today, as allergies continue to skyrocket, as deaths from asthma grow larger every year, I find it hard to understand how this book has gone out of print!This may not be a book for the average lay person but for any serious student of allergies, horticulture, and pollen, this is a must read. I'd think that every allergist would want to own a copy of Airborne and Allergenic Pollen of North America.The lead author, Dr. Lewis, is considered by his peers in biology to be THE medical botanist. He is after all, also the author of the seminal work, Medical Botany, from Wiley&amp; Sons publishers. But unlike many who write about allergy, Lewis also knows a great deal about plants. He is, among many other things, the Senior Botanist at the Missouri Botanical Gardens.I can not recommend this wonderful book highly enough."},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"Just visited Chaco Canyon, so it really resonated!

Very informative about our Native Americans."},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"Lots of historical facts in this book but fiction made it fun too! Like a series with continuing characters. Would recommend!"},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"We love anything the Gears write and this triology was the best thing the Gears have ever done. Waiting for the next book."},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"This is really part two, so do yourself a favor and read part one, the Visitant, first. And if you don't like stories that move back and forth in time, don't bother to read this at all. Personally, I like the way the Gears set their stories to move between the archeological excavation site and the time when the ancient people lived. In this story, archeologist Dusty Stewart uncovers a ceremonial chamber, a kiva, filled with charred remains of children. He can sense the evil there. Back during the ancients' time, people are fighting over religious beliefs. People are doing terrible things to each other and we know from other archeological digs that it is going to get worse before it gets better. I always enjoy the way the Gears bring ancient times to life with vivid descriptions of food, clothing, and living conditions. Good read."},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"First, this book shoudl be read as the second in a series as it would be a difficult read without the background of book 1, \\"The Visitant.\\" Second it helps to have an interest in the Anasazi mystery (what happened to them?), history of the early Southwest, or Southwest Indians. The Gears have an archeology background as well as a well-founded literary ability having published more than 20 books primarily about the early North Americans. Many of the descriptions and conversations have a poetical feeling. The only reason I might rate this lower is that it is not a book to be read a few pages at a time. These are all long (600 pp.)and complex with many references to the past. This leads to my suggestion to read their \\"People of Silence\\" which covers the era of the collapse of the \\"Fisrt-People.\\" Preferably, you would read this one first.Basically this book is an attempt to offer one explanation of why the flourishing Chacoan Cuture expanded for several hundred years in NW New Mexico then within 100 years vanished.Basically this is a the story of how the First-People, the ruling Chacoans, who were nearly made extinct in uprisings, attempted to make a comeback. The Story revolves around War Chief Browser and his deputy Catkin who try to solve a large number of serial murders. Intermixed is the modern mysteries of archeologists solving the same mysteries at sites in and around Chaco. Many of the ancient murder sites are based upon modern archeology sites.The book provides insight in how the people lived in the mid-1200s and how climate changes impacted and probably help destroy an entire civilization."},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"The Summoning God picks right up where The Visitant left off, continuing with the same characters. It also continues the past/present storyline device which I think works very well with this type of historical fiction.I love the Stone Ghost character, however in this book another of my favorite characters, Catkin is underused.Overall the storyline keeps you intrigued and guessing. It left me eager to pick up the third book, which I guess is all you can ask from a series book. I would definitely recommend this book. Add a star if you are an Archaeology buff."},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"I am a big fan of the &quot;Gears&quot;. Having read all their books, I really was looking forward to a series. I have not been disappointed. The Visitant and this one fell right into place, although they could do without the modern day chapters. They are weak and not really that good. If the authors were just to skip them it would be great. I look forward to the next in the series."},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"Yeesh, what \\"A reader\\" said. Was a professional editor employed in the publication of this book? Repetitive, unbelieveable physical descriptions of the characters and their actions irritated me enough to detract from the intriguing device of an Anasazi murder mystery. No-one's hair actually looks like a \\"glistening black serpent\\", no matter how many times you repeat it.And yeah, the story jumps around too much and introduces too many characters and situations. You'd need to keep notes to follow what is going on.....and I was irritated enough by the poor writing to lose interest in keeping it all straight.To continue damning with faint praise, this book's wannabe-Indian authors aren't too insistently \\"Indian good, modern world bad\\" nativist, although it's in there. I've encountered worse. Still annoying, though.If you are interested in native American/First Nations mysteries, give Tony Hillerman a try. Better written, with more believeable characters."},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"The anasazi series by the Gears is fantastic! History comes alive, and I like the parallels written into the modern day story as well! Well done!"},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"This second book in the Ansazi mystery series is as thrlling and exciting as The Visitant. I for one happen to love the mix of old and new story lines that thread through the book. In fact, the murders and even the pehistoric lifestyle and characters are so well written that it didn't feel like I was reading history. The story is probably one of the most violent and graphic of all the Gear's books, but that was what it was really like back then. If you like heart-stopping action and a really well-crafted mystery this is the book for you. Be prepared though to be hooked, as it looks like there are more to come in this series since this book does leave unsettled things as did the last one."},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"This second book in the Anasazi Mysteries series continues the expert mixing of past and present, science and myth,excellent archeological, anthropological and historical detail with the myths and mysteries of life in a 13th century Native American pueblo. Contemporary archeologist Dusty Stewart and physical anthropologist Maureen Cole attempt to decipher the evidence of an ancient Anasazi kiva containing scattered charred bones of children and skinned bones of elderly women while Katsina chief, Browser, his female warrior companion, Catkin and his uncle, holy man, Stone Ghost,seek to solve the mystery of the ruthless murders of children and two Matrons of two of the villages. The 13th century Native Americans struggle with ghosts of the dead and the witch Two Hearts while Dusty and Maureen try to come to grips with their own ghosts and their difference in approach to Native American culture. Parallel to these struggles are struggles of the heart and of culture, family and tradition exemplified in the complex relationships between Browser and Catkin;Straighthorn and Redcrop; Dusty and Maureen. There are various kinds of mystery--scientific, relational, religious and real. There is murder and terror and much to excite a &quot;good read.&quot; One also comes to &quot;care&quot; for the characters and thus you want to follow their paths to success or defeat. One also has an errie feeling that the cultural disruption, cruelty and the holy wars of the 13th century have frightening parallels to our own time. This tale is one that will delight fans of Kay Scarpetta as well as those of Hillerman while also pleasing those interssted in history, archeology, anthropology and Native American culture. I, for one, look forward to Book 3."},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"Intertwining contemporary archaeology with an Anasazi mystery is a good premise. Unfortunately, the authors fail to execute it well.Repetitious descriptions deaden the writing, making it flat and formulaic. No less than three times, Catkin's black braid is described as a \\"glistening serpent lying across her back.\\" Too often, moonlight \\"gilds\\" or \\"sheaths\\" her \\"upturned nose,\\" \\"beautiful oval face,\\" and lots of others things. I lost track of how many times yellow cottonwood leaves glinted or glimmered in the autumn sun or swirled somewhere (down paths, on the river, over the kiva edge, etc.) We are reminded ad nauseum of the glints in Dusty's blond beard and hair, of the chin-length black bangs plastered to Browser's face by sweat, of his knee-length war shirt whipping against brush or bushes. Concerning Elder Stone Ghost, \\"Thin white hair blew around his face as he looked up at Browser.\\" A mere three lines later we read, \\"Thin white hair blew around [Browser's] uncle's wrinkled face. Sloppy! Where was the editor when the authors needed him/her?Gestures are recycled until they become tedious. People tuck stray hairs behind their ears or under their hats again and again. Lots of brows draw together lots of times. There is much cupping of coffee cups, sipping of coffee, gripping of war clubs in hard fists, and clasping of capes. The result is unintentionally comic and Chaplin-esque. These characters come across more like marionettes than full-blooded people.The problems are not merely stylistic. Early on, too much information is thrown at the reader, confusing him/her: a mummy hanging from a rock, copper bells apparently left as bait, a murderous female, a little girl tagging along with her, somebody in a wolf kachina mask, a vicious pack of white-caped warriors, a woman with her eyes gouged out, beheaded bodies in a kiva, the heads in a grove, a necklace that seems important....Whew! The narrative would have been more coherent and the pacing better if these details had been doled out more slowly, one at a time. Easing into a good mystery should be like worming into a ripe apple: the deeper you dig, the darker and juicier it gets.Sexual tension between Dusty and Maureen is a central conflict in the novel's contemporary portion. However, their unresolved mutual attraction/revulsion soon became frustrating, if not downright annoying. When are these two going to hop in the sack together? Or at least confront their obvious feelings for each other? I know, I know...this fat novel is one in a series of fat novels, and the authors want to keep things simmering. Maybe we'll find out if anything happens between Dusty and Maureen several thousand pages hence. Want to wait that long? I don't.Hopefully someday somebody will give prehistoric Southwestern peoples the fictional treatment they deserve. But not today...."},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"The Gears have again managed the literary device of paralleling two stories 750 years apart into one chilling message. How man reacts to environmental changes(even those that are partially his own doing)can be violent and brutal. We watch as the Anastazi people are torn apart and begin to prey on one and other as they seek to appease Gods they believe to be dissatisfied. Cults, sacrafices and war tear apart a culture that had no North American peer.The story again follows Browser and Catkin as they try to make sense of a series of mass Murders. Great history, mysticism and a grizzly thriller rolled into one!"},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"In the thirteenth century, the site today known as Pueblo Animos was called Longtrail Village. Its residents converted to the new Katsina religion. Times were harsh as war and pestilence swept across the Anasazi people forcing bands to merge into large numbers for safety.Twenty-first century archeologist Dusty Stewart and physical anthropologist Maureen Cole explore the untouched Pueblo Animos. They discover a massacre of at least forty children under the age of six, the skinning of females, and some evidence of cannibalism. The empathic Dusty feels the past horrors that have engulfed this sight.In 1263, enemies attack the village. Browser, war chief of the Katsina, desperately wants to save his people, but wonders if witches are involved. As the murderers become bolder, Browser realizes that victory today only delays the inevitable decimation of his people.Maureen concludes that the evil of the past is influencing Dusty. She steps outside the comfort of science to seek help from a local expert, a shaman. As past and present meet, Maureen and Dusty will be freed from the chains that bind them.Chapters fluidly alternate between the past and the present, but the Gears manage to maintain a sense of continuity in the story line. That enables THE SUMMONING GOD to turn into a fascinating reading experience. The everyday details of the Anasazi culture seem genuine and add to the overall historical subplot. The relationship between Dusty and Maureen is an intriguing blend of distrust, unwanted attraction, and passion (more often with the sight than with each other). Though not easily categorized, fans that want something different will fully relish this tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"Simply put I was disappointed......when I finished the book that is! As always the Gears have kept me captive - I hated to see the book end and lament that I have about a year to wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"This book was a local book club selection. The group rated it twos (mostly) and threes on a five point scale (1 =lowest; 5 = highest). Several people disliked the book so much they did not finish reading it and could not vote. The general consensus was, it was interesting in parts, but the author really needed a good editor."},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"Just finished reading the Summoning God. This one took place around the Four Corners area. Again, I encountered some of the same problems: overwriting (Purple Prose:), weird grammatical rules, and I know they have no clue what New Mexican food really is. Maybe I'll send them a cookbook or link or something. But these were nothing - in fact a person could even have fun with it.The switching back and forth was still there. Dusty and Maureen were warming up to each other; how sweet. But there was too much unnecessary stuff in those chapters that I didn't care about. They were at their best when they digging up bones or looking under the microscope. Those parts were what kept me going.What I found more difficult to deal with is the unforgiving violence in the story against elderly women and the emphasis on violence towards children. Yes, I know this is a work of fiction. And I know that period was harsh and violent. It was driven home by the Gears, I'll hardly forget it.I think some of the stuff the Gears came up with to explain the warfare was a bit of a stretch. I loved Catkin but I think she took a back seat in this story. Browser wasn't quite focused for a chief but I liked him. Never gave Springbank a single thought. Loved Redcrop and Straighthorn. Overall I did enjoy the story although I didn't love it. Probably why I gave the book three stars. But I will read the next one. I'll review it too."},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"I got this triogy after seeing a lot of other reviews at first all I cared about was the indian half of the books. but I read the other modern half and liked it just as much. The entire triogy was great."},{"Title":"The Summoning God","review":"Let's face it - these are \\"beach\\" books and probably written to get a movie deal. These books are certainly better than anything Michael Crichton has had to offer since Jurassic Park. The Gears' don't quite have that movie-script writing style down, (which is actually commendable and appreciated). I enjoyed the first two books, despite the overly redundant and contrived character descriptions, the clues and red herrings, and really bad editing in the first book, The Visitant. The transitions between the past and present are an interesting device, but certainly not innovative. I also prefer the past mystery to the present day storyline. I look forward to reading the latest book hoping that there are actually some answers to - what some people purport to be sheer genius - the clues and red herrings throughout the two books. (If you are really compulsive, go back and find them. The construction of the clues and motivations don't add up as perfectly as one reviewer commented, so these books lost points on the \\"confusion\\" spectrum.) This is NOT, and I repeat, NOT a Classic Novel and there are far superior books in this genre. However, if you are on vacation or sitting in the airport wasting time, these are great and very enjoyable books to pass time."},{"Title":"How to Name a Hurricane (Camino del Sol)","review":"I'll admit I don't read a lot of short stories--I'm a more of a novel kind of guy. But I was totally won over and completely captivated by Rane Arroyo's first collection of fiction. His short stories are about gay and bisexual Latino men and their lovers, ex-lovers, future lovers and the families they all come from. Some of his written words made me laugh out loud; others made me incredibly sad. And being from the Windy City myself, I loved his references to various Chicago places like the bar, Little Jim's, and the vegetarian restaurant, The Chicago Diner--both of which are still in business on Halsted Street. But what I found most intriguing about Mr. Arroyo's stories was his experimentation with different writing styles. \\"The Blackie Soto Mystery Series\\" is a hilarious descriptive list of a series of mysteries about Blackie and his two friends who have wild adventures while solving crimes--kind of a gay Latino Hardy Boys. And \\"Rat Poison: The Book of Marcus Mar\\" tells the tale--in 101 sentences--of a young man committing suicide--I found it disturbing, sad and beautifully written. Other stories are told as monologues, in verse, and even as cyberspace emails. \\"How to Name a Hurricane\\" is a quick, wonderful read that you will have a difficult time putting down once you begin. I highly recommend that you check it out."},{"Title":"He-Motions: Even Strong Men Struggle","review":"I purchased this book for my husband. it is really uplifting.

I think I have to order the DVD in order to obtain the inspiration I was seeking."},{"Title":"He-Motions: Even Strong Men Struggle","review":"I appreciated the way the merchandise arrived just in time for the holiday season."},{"Title":"He-Motions: Even Strong Men Struggle","review":"A recent Dallas Morning News column profiling T.D. Jakes quoted a University of Houston sociology professor saying that Jakes is \\"incredible in how he's able to diagnose people's pain. He has an uncanny ability to put a finger on the human condition.\\" Jakes' new book He-Motions illustrates the verity of the professor's statement. In He-Motions, Jakes nails the issues and challenges Christian men face today in trying to fulfill their many roles and pursue their dreams.Jakes writes from his heart and soul as a pastor, father, husband and entrepreneur. In the opening pages, he describes his motivation for writing: \\"I want to share what I've learned. I want to cut through so much of the junk imposed on men today and talk heart to heart about what it means to be a man, not in some touchy-feely group hug kind of way but in an honest, soul-bearing way, which also respects men and honors the women who love them and whom they love.\\"Jakes thoroughly succeeds in fulfilling his desire for this book. Not only does he address male readers, but he also targets female readers who hope to gain insights about men. Jakes' no-holds barred writing offers refreshing candor for those wanting an honest assessment of who they are and where they are in life.Jakes writes about his childhood, his ministry, his family and his ups and downs in life-always tying stories to life lessons for readers. It does not take the reader long to discern that Jakes possesses a vast breadth of wisdom and understanding about the inner workings of men in our culture.Jakes writes that \\"a man must value himself.\\" He-Motions can help readers make great strides in finding value in themselves-regardless of their circumstances. He encourages men to refuse to become discouraged but to keep moving toward their destiny while simultaneously enjoying the splendid moments of life's journey.The book is written as if Jakes is in the room having a one-on-one talk with the reader. If it was in fact such a talk, it would surely involve laughing, weeping, praying and dreaming. One such example of the conversational style is when Jakes writes about balancing family and career.He writes, \\"I'm here to tell you that if you don't contain your work life and segregate it from your home life, then your career will consume the marriage like a campfire blazing outside of its circle of rocks and roaring into a life-threatening forest fire.\\"There is not an area of discussion where Jakes lets men off the hook. He writes authoritatively about power, money and sex. In the financial arena, Jakes commands readers, \\"Stop asking God to bless an area where you refuse to obey His Word for your life.\\"In one relationship area after another, Jakes' writing leads the reader to self-examination, awareness, forgiveness and improvement. His writing on subjects such as a man's relationships with his father, children, wife, other men, time, money and God is honest and down to earth. It is also practical, as are the questions for men and women at the end of each chapter.Throughout the book, Jakes references the life of David to shed light on the above relationships from a Biblical perspective.Jakes encourages readers that \\"someone needs to know who you are and where you are at all times in your walk and life.\\" This book could be an effective tool to use in a discussion or accountability group to help people grow stronger relationships. I encourage men and women to take advantage of the wisdom and insights Jakes shares in this book."},{"Title":"He-Motions: Even Strong Men Struggle","review":"Real honesty, real answers, a real man!

There are alot of men struggling internally out there and the women in their lives have no clue as to what is going on or how we feel about things. Too often it is stated that men don't understand women, well that saying can also be reversed. In order for us to move on from our past we must understand it, why it happened, how it happened, how to overcome it, etc. This book is a tool for those who really want to understand somethings going on in their lives, or plaguing their past.

Life is a struggle for men and women, but women seem to shake it off because we will cry and scream. Men tend to grow bitter and hold on to past hurts in a different type of resentment.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a big TD Jakes fan, I think he's definitely an anointed prophet from God, and he's a fantastic minister. But being a great minister doesn't necessarily make a person a great writer. He's blessed w/ an uncanny ability to preach and teach on healing and deliverance from life's painful experiences, but when it comes to putting this thoughts on paper, he just doesn't seem to be able to get his points across clearly, directly and succinctly. For example, he doesn't stay focused on the subject at hand because of his excessive use of metaphors, hyperbole and superfluous information throughout this book. A good writer uses metaphors only to set an example or to illustrate a significant point in order to paint a clear picture in the reader's mind, not use them in every other sentence. For a while there, I wasn't sure if I was reading a book by TD Jakes or Dr. Seuss.Another problem I have w/ this book is that it seems like it is addressing little boys or, at best, men who have failed at every kind of human relationship possible - i.e., husband/wife, son/father, father/son, male/male friends, male/female friends, etc. He does however, provide a great outline on man's various relationships (with himself, with God, with his children, etc.), but his delivery is so out of focus. In fact, he even devotes an entire chapter smack in the middle of the book about money and finances. What does that have to do w/ how I deal w/ my \\"He-Motions\\"? Besides, he's already written a book a few years ago entitled \\"The Greatest Investment-Faith, Family & Finance\\", therefore it was unnecessary to bring up the subject of money/finance again in \\"He-Motions\\".The info contained in this book is just too elementary for me. He doesn't offer any real soultions on dealing w/ my \\"He-Motions\\", and the examples he provides just don't deal w/ anything that I have ever dealt with personnally. I was really expecting something much deeper and substantive. But all I got here was a bunch of fluff. C'mon Bishop, enough of the lame stories and metaphors, give us some substance.

However, he feels that his luck is changing when he meets hairdresser Dana Waverleigh, though she is the mother of two children and the ex of three husbands. Max believes he has met his forever love who will forgive his workaholic transgressions unlike his two former spouses.However, Dana is not seeing Max exclusively as her former boyfriend, Jack Nizhl, expects her to use her body to gain insider information from her new beau on a crime investigation that involves both of them and a drug using maniac. Will Max see the light of how Dana, though she is blackmailed into her clandestine activities, is using him or will he continue to see the world through the rose colored head that reacts to her stimulus without thinking?DYING FOR DANA is a delightful relationship investigative tale that works because of how well Jim Patton escorts the readers inside the heads of the key cast members. Fans will comprehend the dichotomy that makes up Max, a superstar in the courtroom and a zero in his personal life. Dana is even more complex as she is a nice person, but her choice in men is haunting her because she likes Max. Fans also see inside the two thugs, Jack and his maniac partner.

I have read it over and over, as it is a marvelous selection of Jeeves short stories, including classics like \\"The Purity of the Turf\\", the story I give to anyone new to Jeeves and Bertie. If it were available as an ebook, I'd buy that too. Essential for Jeeves fans. I regret that it isn't currently in print; I have bought used copies for gifts because it's just the best one to give."},{"Title":"The World of Jeeves","review":"P.G. Wodehouse shows why Jeeves and Wooster are his most loved characters by readers in his compilation of short stories entitled The World of Jeeves. You will fall immediately in love with all of Wodehouse's characters; all of whom I know no one like, but I completely understand their personalities. Bertie Wooster is a person you wish you could be sometimes because of the lavish lifestyle he lives and his social Einstein for a valet, Jeeves. Jeeves is the person everyone wishes they knew because of his cunning in escaping from pickles. Bertie's Aunt Agatha is the member of the extended family that everyone has who they love to hate. It seams like she always has someone new to stay with Bertie or a new woman to potentially settle Bertie down with in married life. Whether it's Cyril Bassington Bassington or Wilmot Malvern who overstay there welcome (and especially in Motty's case), Jeeves always finds a way to get them moving on their way out of Bertie's flat. This however does lead to the only flaw in the book. Although it is exciting in every story to see how Jeeves solves the problem, it can get somewhat repetitive because you know that Jeeves will eventually solve it and everything will turn out fine in the end. But to anyone looking for something that is actually fun to read; a getaway from the serious literature out there, especially about the 1920's such as F. Scott Fittzgerald, then this is the book for you. Fitzgerald chooses to take the wealthy class during the 1920's seriously while Wodehouse chooses to make fun of their pinstripe suit wearing and obscure sock, hat, and tie styles, which is far more fun to read about."},{"Title":"The World of Jeeves","review":"my 11 yr old son saw a couple of the BBC series of Wooster & Jeeves and got interested in it. i have this book, but didn't want him dragging it all over and getting it worn out. so we bought this used one. it's condition was as advertised. very happy with the purchase."},{"Title":"The World of Jeeves","review":"Bertie and Jeeves know just how to take your mind off hypocritical House and Senate impeachment hearings and sexual overkill.THE WORLD OF JEEVES has brisk dialogue, well paced tales of British leisure class misdoings punctuated by the brilliant people skills of the Gentleman's Gentleman who always saves the day.

The interaction between Bertie Wooster and his gentleman's gentleman, Jeeves, always bring the smile to one's face. The problem is, once one has read a handful of the over thirty stories in this collection alone, everything else is simply repetition.Wodehouse's characters are two dimensional at best. These stories are definitely intended as very light reading, as a glance through the \\"other books written by\\" page in this volume suggests: There are 93 books by this author. 93! That doesn't include the omnibuses.Wodehouse's writing is complete fluff, yet charming fluff at that. I certainly couldn't read more than two or three of these short stories at a sitting. This is definitely library or used book material."},{"Title":"The World of Jeeves","review":"What better introduction to the wonders of P.G. Wodehouse's writing than a collection of stories about the adventures of Bertie Wooster and his repeated rescue by Jeeves?

Banks, Tuppy Glossop and his uncle Sir Roderick, Bertie's aunts Agatha and Dahlia, and, in &quot;Jeeves and the Old School Chum&quot;, Rosie's friend Laura Pyke.If you like to laugh and like good literature, this collection is for you.

This collection of short stories is the pinancle of parody of the stereotypical British elite, as seen though the eyes \\"the perfect manservant\\" to a \\"1920's bachelor on the run\\".I admit that I was biased when I began this book, at the incessant recommendation of my siblings. I was certain that I would not enjoy it, and resisted its wickedly incisive humor with all my might as I turned page after page ... after page. I finally gave in to Wodehouse's unbeatable combination of an incredibly accurate, ironic, insightful view of the world and an always well-turned phrase. I dare you to spend an evening with it - you'll find yourself hooked! The good news is that there are many more fine \\"Jeeves\\" stories to enjoy after these.You really should enjoy at least one Wodehouse \\"Jeeves\\" book - at this is the perfect place to begin, if you ask me.Do enjoy - Cheerio!"},{"Title":"The World of Jeeves","review":"This book is another great example of the writing of P.G. Wodehouse. In this collection of short stories we find Bertie Wooster getting out of many a problem with the help of his trustworthy butler Jeeves. Along the way there are mean-spirited Aunts, eccentric Uncles, and many other recurring characters. This collection is the perfect remedy for the blues. The stories make you laugh so much. This is a book that is hard to put down. The stories are relatively short but there is so much in them. Wodehouse's mastery of dialogue is well-evident and so is his incredible skill in describing characters. I recommend this book highly. It is an excellent collection."},{"Title":"The World of Jeeves","review":"This is one of the best Wodehouse collections available, especially because it is the beginning of the whole series of Jeeves stories. All the novels come after these stories, except for the last two &quot;Yuletide Spirit&quot; and &quot;Greasy Bird&quot;. Not all the stories are equal, but those introducing familiar characters like Aunt Agatha, Roderick Glossop and Bingo Little are among the best things in Wodehouse. His noted gift for brilliant farce and striking similes are there even in some of his earliest publishings. The only caveat: be wary of starting this if you're afraid of getting quickly addicted. But if you do, not to worry: there are literally dozens more books by the man where this came from."},{"Title":"The World of Jeeves","review":"As the only complete collection of all the Jeeves stories in one volume, this book is indispensable for the Wodehouse fan. As others have mentioned, the stories are funny and light. But read them slowly and savor them, because no one -- and I mean NO one -- can construct a sentence like Wodehouse can."},{"Title":"The World of Jeeves","review":"All the Jeeves short stories in one place. What more do you need to know?"},{"Title":"The World of Jeeves","review":"Since I have an older version of this collection, I am not sure it is the same one, as there are only 17 stories collected in this one (published in 1967). Each story centers around some silly escapade that Bertie Wooster finds himself drawn into that eventually leads him to seek the help of Jeeves, his inimitable valet. \\"The World of Jeeves\\" is a funny, sometimes laugh-out-loud collection of stories that is only tainted by the fact that they are all together in one volume, which leads to some redundancy.Most of the stories unfold like this: Bertie Wooster takes it upon himself to try out some new fashion that Jeeves disapproves of. Bertie then finds himself in a mess, either of his one making or by trying to help one of his friends. Bertie then asks Jeeves for assistance and Jeeves either helps or doesn't help until Bertie gives into his valet's wishes. A good number of the stories focus on Bertie's hapless friend, Bingo, who is constantly falling in love and falling out of favor with his rich uncle. Trying to help Bingo leads him to meet a strange collection of characters - romance authors, communists, church fair gamblers - and to meet with many scrapes to his mind, body, and soul. Some standouts are \\"The Great Sermon Handicap\\" in which a group of men bet on which pastor can give the longest sermon; \\"The Delayed Exit of Claude and Eustace\\" in which Bertie cannot get his two worthless cousins onboard a boat for Africa; and \\"The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy\\" in which readers get to see the softer side of Jeeves as he helps one of Bertie's friends remember the name of and find a love he lost years ago.P.G. Wodehouse was a gifted comic writer. Although the Jeeves and Wooster stories definitely show their age with certain expressions and the very world in which they inhabited, the stories are still charming and delightful. This is not a collection that should necessarily be read straight through at one time, as the stories are remarkably similar and one gets tired of certain wishy-washy and hapless characters. However, one thing that readers never tire of is Jeeves."},{"Title":"The World of Jeeves","review":"Yes, folks, that's precisely what this collection is (see review title, preceding this review). But then, virtually ALL the Bertie and Jeeves stories in one place? How could it be anything else?Wodehouse (pron. \\"woodhouse\\", BTW) handled the English language with much more than deft, humor-steeped authority; rather, he transformed it into a drug affecting the pleasure centers of the brain. Don't ask me how--I've thoroughly analyzed his work and so far detected only ink and paper. What's more, considering WH's books have been crossing international lines since the 1920s, I'm sure the authorities would've noticed any funny chemical business by now.If anyone finds these wonderful stories \\"repetitive\\"--as I believe one reviewer here has, but I understand he was having a bad hair day so that probably didn't count--may I point out: That's just the point. Wodehouse, in his genius, could take the same basic plot (well meaning bon vivant tries to help friends out of social jams; makes things much worse for everyone, including himself; appeals to brilliant valet for help; valet modestly extricates all) and use and reuse it as a vehicle for his unmatched wit.So yes, if you focus exclusively on their plots, these stories will fail. But then you may not be much fun at parties either, which IMHO would be well above the Wodehouse-plot problem on the Urgent Attention Needed scale.To sum up: What ho! If you haven't this tome in your stacks, pull your socks up, ankle forthwith to your credit card, and procure one of these essential volumes o' mirth before they go the way of the noble spat."},{"Title":"The World of Jeeves","review":"In his introduction to this omnibus volume, P G Wodehouse advises against reading the whole volume at a single sitting (at more than 200,000 words, you would be unlikely to succeed). He suggests one story after each meal of the day, with a final story in bed. I recommend no more than two a day. Besides making the pleasures of the book last longer, that should avert irritation that the plot of so many of the stories is essentially the same: viz Jeeves expresses disapproval of some gaudy item of Bertie Wooster's apparel; Bertie stands firm; Bertie encounters a personal problem, usually of a social nature; Jeeves is called upon for a solution; it works splendidly; Jeeves is rewarded by being allowed to dispose of the offending garment.There are variations: it may be that Jeeves did or did not want to go somewhere; that Bertie first tries to solve a problem himself - and has to be rescued from the consequences of that; or Jeeves' solution might at first appear not to be working but, details of the full scheme having been temporarily withheld from Bertie and ourselves, all is well in the end; and occasionally Jeeves' reward is a cash handout or a longer holiday.Jeeves is fabled not only for his wondrous solutions to tricky problems, but for efficiency in his role as Gentleman's Personal Gentleman and loyalty to his master. He has no objection to Bertie being none too bright, considering intelligence in an employer a disadvantage. With the exception only of the story Bertie Changes His Mind, which is narrated by Jeeves, all this is communicated by Bertie himself. It is in Bertie's narrations that we see the genius of Wodehouse; without in any way damaging the image of Bertie as a well-meaning but thoroughly twittish aristocratic dodo, he is represented as having himself written-up these jolly pranks where so many of the jokes are at his own expense. Jeeves' writing style is dull by comparison - though his story of Bertie's nocturnal adventure in the grounds of a girls' school does eventually take-off.The cast list is confined mainly to a small circle of chums, a couple of aunts - one fearsome, one much more sympathetic, though still quite a character - and a Sir Roderick Glossop and his overbearing daughter (who regards herself as marriageable, whilst Bertie and most of his acquaintances do not). But the limited circle is not a criticism. Rather than introduce a new character, who will inevitably relate to Bertie and Jeeves in much the same way as those in other stories, why not give an established personage another run? That approach allows for some character development; Young Bingo, for instance, progressing from a bachelor much given to falling disastrously in love with any passing young woman, however unsuitable, to the successful courtship of a novelist working as a waitress to gather colour for her next work, followed in due time by the happy couple welcoming Bertie and Jeeves as houseguests at their country seat.There's a lot of harmless fun in all this; and if you think Wodehouse's style simplistic, just have a go yourself. In all likelihood, your effort will not only fall way short of Bertie's, but serve also to make Jeeves look pretty good in yet another respect."},{"Title":"The World of Jeeves","review":"P.G. Wodehouse was such a fantastic and prolific writer, his stories always entertain. These are some of the best--in my opinion, the best!--of the \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\" series.

This collection should provide the Wodehouse fan with many hours of pleasurable reading and provide the impetus to read further stories of his. (I have not read any of his Blandings stories, yet.)

The \\"hero\\" is Sampson Greice, an obvious stand-in for Hymam Rickover, who pushes ahead various innovations that will make obsolete the diesel-electric submarines of two world wars and take the US Navy into the next century. The story is largely told through the eyes of Lt. Joy, a former destroyer sailor now consigned to submarines. In the years immediately following the end of WWII, Joy finds himself reluctantly aboard Greice's aging submarine, but manages to make something of a transition to the otherworldly ways of the \\"Silent Service\\". Through other crewmen, Joy learns the two marks that have made Greice an outcast among other officers: his unconventional ideas about the next generation of submarines (subs with steam engines? subs armed with missiles? Subs with vertical launch tubes?) and the fact that he's pretty much hated by his superiors. After a complicated string of events - thankfully depicted from within the sub - Joy gets his dolphins, yet is nearly killed in a catastrophe that all but destroys the sub and virtually ends Greice's career. Joy, once a man willing to follow a crowd, nevertheless matures, tracks Greice down to an obscure Naval Research command, and joins his crusade to bring the navy into the next century (even as the present century wasn't quite half over).\\"Blow\\" is fun - probably more now than it was when first written. In an era with cookie-cutter \\"Pat Robinson\\" novels, it's refreshing to find something as old as \\"Blow\\" which has a very period feel to it. Apart from the fact that it is a novel, it's still historically suspect. While Admiral Rickover was outspoken on many issues, Greice speaks barely a word for the first half of the story - and much of what we know of him comes from his enemies. Unlike the real Rickover, Greice actually has experience with subs as fighting machines. That said, the book also gives short shrift to Greice's resilience - after the tragedy early in the book, we lose sight of him and don't meet up with him again until he's ensconced in the command that will create the first generation of SSN's. How Greice managed that bit of career resurrection is not quite explored, and we see little of subs themselves once he goes to work on the nuclear navy.That said, \\"Blow\\" is still a must-read, a biting near-satire of the technothriller before that term ever really existed. \\"Blow\\" gives us insecure and in-over-their-heads submariners in dangerous ships instead of the typical mechanized officers in cutting-edge submarines.

(\\"The Best Novel of the Navy Since the Caine Mutiny\\")","review":"\\"Blow Negative\\" is an absolutely fabulous read. It is a fictionalized story (it does not track actual history all that closely) of Hyman Rickover, the father of the US nuclear submarine. Sampson H. Greice, the protagonist, is really not much like Rickover excepting that both in \\"Blow Negative,\\" and in real life, one man with a vision was pitted against most of the US Naval military establishment. The Navy, in common with all military institutions, is inherently conservative (and rightly so, since lives, and possibly the survival of the nation, are at stake) and the creation of the nuclear navy was not an easy birth.The real story here is one of military politics. Captain Sampson H. Greice is a maverick naval officer with a sky-high IQ and a personality that is, well, different. But he has a vision--that submarines should be powered by a nuclear reactor that can run virtually forever, without the need of oxygen. As we all know in the modern world, this revolutionized submarines for all time. But in the 1950s when this idea was introduced, then-Captain Rickover faced furious opposition from the Naval establishment.\\"Blow Negative\\" is a very funny story and a wonderful read. It reads true-to-life as far as the nature and attitudes of professional military officers and sailors too! This novel moves at an excellent clip, engages the reader at every turn, and never stalls. I have read very few books that gave a \\"feel\\" for the military the way this novel does. While the hero of the book, Sampson H. Greice is different in many ways from Adm. Hyman Rickover, the basic qualities of the two men are similar, and both were heroes.You will not find a more engaging read about men and submarines."},{"Title":"Blow Negative !

They make me think of the Arts and Crafts/Craftsman era of the early 20th century which was strongly influenced by the Japanese aesthetic. There is a mix of techniques, so you can either find something that you can do easily because you know how, or something new to try. Several designs use hexagonal elements, but some are nothing but rectangles, and a number have sashiko elements (patterns for which are in the back). They are certainly not what we think of as \\"traditional\\" quilt blocks.A great addition to my library."},{"Title":"Quilting with Japanese Fabrics","review":"I loved this book because the auther works beautiful fabrics in a way I would so love to do.

Marvelous photos-- I wish there were more detailed close-up shots of the finished quilts. Design ideas are coming together for me since reading it. The encouraging directions are a valuable and practical part of \\"Quilting with Japanese Fabrics.\\" And, you can also use non-Japanese fabrics.I am very happy to add this book to my growing Japanese quilting collection. Also in my \\"collection\\" of two books is Susan Briscoe's Japanese block quilting book (See my glowing review.)"},{"Title":"Quilting with Japanese Fabrics","review":"No class I have ever taken has done me as much good as Kitty Pippen's books.

English lyrics are *not* provided under the music.Each song includes a brief description including original key, where/when/why the song was written/published/performed, and information on the poem.Music engraving is clean and crisp. Two selections have parts for obligatto instruments. These are included below the vocal line *and* on a separate page.Paper weight and binding appear to be quite good. This is a large book (1.5 inch spine), so it will be interesting to see how it lasts through the years."},{"Title":"Franz Schubert - 100 Songs: The Vocal Library","review":"I am a music student and I absolutly love Schubert. He is my favorite to sing. So, I decided it would be a great idea to buy a book of his music. I originally was looking at volume 1 from the Kagen Collection of 200 Schubert Songs until I found this one. Not only is it about $25 cheaper, it has a better selection. The songs from Wintereisse and his other song cycles that are rarely heard are omitted and replaced with with more of his more popular music. Not only does my high voice edition include Der Hirt auf dem Felsen, but it also has the clarinet part below the piano staff and on separate pieces of paper with just the clarinet part.The book also includes very insightful notes on the date of composition, original keys, and performance and/or history notes about the song and its relation to Schubert's life. Translations are also provided under the notes and not under the german text, which I like much more.My only critiques are that, for one, it does not include Ave Maria, which I find to be very popular and famous. Not a huge loss, but I would have liked to see it, but certainly not a deal-breaker. The other thing is that I'm not sure how long the spine will last. The book is over 500 pages and in paperback. I feel the spine may start to fall apart rather quickly. It also doesn't stay open on a piano very well because it's so thick. I will end up having the book stripped of it's spine and collated in order to stay open and expand the life of the spine.I am very happy with this book and I think it is worth every cent to buy. Any person who enjoys the music of Schubert will fall in love with this book!"},{"Title":"Franz Schubert - 100 Songs: The Vocal Library","review":"This vocal library collection features popular songs from the cycles, but doesn't include the rarely performed. It's a great collection to introduce Schubert--it has standard songs and a good mix without purchasing the entire Kagen series."},{"Title":"SWEET DREAMS, IRENE","review":"Once again Irene Kelly, veteran reporter for the News Express, in the fictional Southern California town of Las Piernas, investigates some serious crime. One of Irene's flaws, unfortunately, is stubbornness which borders on the extreme. As intelligent as she is, she frequently acts on impulse and winds up doing what she has been specifically told not to do, often with life-threatening results. Frank Harriman, a homicide detective with La Piernas Police Department, is Irene's boyfriend and emotional support system.Jacob Henderson, teenaged son of a district attorney candidate, comes to Irene claiming his father's opponent intends to use smear tactics and claim he is involved in a Satanic cult. A photograph was taken of the boy at a coven gathering, but he was there to convince a young girl, his friend Gethsemane (Sammy), to leave with him. Irene talks to the troubled girl, who substantiates Jacob's story. She tells the reporter that the cult is Wiccan, not Satanist. There are disturbing signs of cult activity in town, most of which seem to have a connection to a local runway shelter, which is sponsored by Frank's neighbor and dear friend, 80 year-old Althea Fremont. That same evening, Halloween, Mrs. Fremont is murdered and Satanic ritual symbols are left on her door. Irene begins to suspect there is more to this coven than meets the eye. Then Sammy disappears and a human heart is left on Irene's doorstep. Danger to Irene escalates when there are no indications she will back-off the case. This is a darker, edgier novel then the previous one, with some grim, brutal torture scenes. To come out of this alive, Irene will have to face-down the devil.\\"Sweet Dreams, Irene\\" is non-stop drama, thrills and chills. However, the narrative is not as taut as I expected it to be, having read two of the author's other books. The primary focus here is on Irene's relationship with Frank - which I actually enjoy. They are both fascinating, well developed characters and the chemistry between them is electric. As usual, Ms. Burke surrounds Irene with a number of interesting and memorable friends and family members, characters who add to the depth and richness of the novel. Our heroine does less investigating than usual here, and, more or less, stumbles into trouble and onto clues rather than initiating the action. This is novel #2 in the series, and the author is just beginning to develop the background storyline and characters. Her writing becomes much tighter, and her plots more well defined, in future books. But this one is well worth the read - so don't miss it.JANA"},{"Title":"SWEET DREAMS, IRENE","review":"This is the second volume in the Irene Kelly/Frank Harrison series .Set as previously in California the book involves newspaperwoman Irene Kelly in shady politics and smear campaigns .She is approached by the 16 year old son of a DA candidate a personable young man who is being wrongly accused of involvement in a Satanic cult .He was present at a meeting of such a group but was seeking to persuade a friend to leave the meeting .The friend in question is Sally a homeless girl who has taken refuge from an unsatisactory home life by running away and is currently living in a shelter for street kids .This is run by Irene's neighbour the kindly Mrs Fremont who is brutally slain in a mannner suggesting Satanic involvemnet .Soon after Sally is also killed and the reasons are linked to her diary which contains revelations .Before the case is resolved Irene is kidnapped and beaten by two thugs Devon and Raney -and some will find these scenes rather strong meat .The captivity scenes are quite harrowing and tend to distoirt the novel somewhat .Its a decent enough book but somewhat clumsily structured -the identity of the killer is revealed with about a quarter of the book remaining while the revelation of the man behind all the violence comes as no great supriseThere is rather too much time given to the familial troubles of Irene's lover the cop Frank Harrison ,in particular his mother's resisitance to the relationship but a lively sea bound climax brings thinks to a satisfactory endingIt marks no real advance on its predecessor but those who enjoyed that book will enjoy this volume too."},{"Title":"SWEET DREAMS, IRENE","review":"This &quot;femjep&quot; mystery has all of the flaws of a beginning effort and few of the charms. The focus is really on the relationship between reporter Irene Kelly and detective Frank Harriman. Solving the mystery is almost incidental. And Irene doesn't do much investigating. Things happen to her and she overlooks obvious clues (e. g., the cable truck sitting outside her house for several days). She finds herself in far more physical danger than any one person would face in a lifetime, and yet the solution to the crime pops up when she isn't even looking for it. Burke has an annoying habit of trying to misdirect the reader -- which a mystery writer is supposed to do -- but in such a heavy-handed way that no reasonably intelligent reader is going to be fooled."},{"Title":"SWEET DREAMS, IRENE","review":"Usually 2nd books by an author aren't quite as good as the 1st. I was happy to finish Sweet Dreams Irene just as happy as I was when I finished Goodnight Irene. Jan Burke has a way of giving her characters such interesting lives. Irene is a person most readers want to be. Her life is interesting and Frank makes her complete. The plot with the election,covens, and murders is as fun to read as most people would want. I'm sorry I waited so long to hear about Irene and I plan on reading more!"},{"Title":"SWEET DREAMS, IRENE","review":"This is the second &quot;Irene Kelly&quot; from Jan Burke, who eventually went on to win an Edgar award for &quot;Bones&quot;. Kelly began life in &quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot; as a reporter in the city of &quot;Las Piernas&quot; (&quot;The Legs&quot;) on the coast south of Los Angeles. Kelly is the most assault prone reporter in the world leaving out Colombia and Chechniya. We have a newscaster in Chicago named Russ Ewing who has become the guy that accused killers call up to turn themselves in to so the police don't kill them. He has had something like 50 or 70 accused killers turn themselves in to him and hasn't been wounded once, yet Irene sustains more injuries than James Garner did in &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. Go figure.Anyway, I wrote an Amazon review of &quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot; in which I identified many &quot;beginners' faults&quot; of detective writing. The good news is that &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; corrects many of these faults and is thus a significant improvement over her first volume. I will take credit for this myself when I figure out how she read my review in 1993.To begin with, the plot, which involves real or imagined Satanist activity at election time, is a lot more original and better designed than in her first work. Irene has stopped riding around in the cop car with her beau Frank all the time, which was an improbable feature of &quot;Goodnight.&quot; She does more actual detection here than there. She tosses the blood around with less slapdash abandon in this book, although there's still room for improvement. For example, when a bloody human heart turns up, it doesn't get the attention that it really should, you know? The police test it to confirm that it's really human blood, but there doesn't seem to be much interest in WHOSE heart it is, etc., particularly considering that they should be able to make the same guess that the reader does.One carry-over from the first book is that Irene is still prone to falling into stupid traps, as Frank points out:&quot;Why the hell did you go out to that field that night?&quot;&quot;I've asked myself that question many times.&quot;&quot;I just don't understand it. You're smart. But I swear to God, Irene, sometimes you do something so...&quot;&quot;Stupid,&quot; I finished quietly.Well, *sigh* knowing you have a problem is the first step. Also, I have to say that the action flags a bit about three quarters of the way through, and after that there is some Penguin's Folly stuff. I just now invented that term. &quot;Penguin's Folly&quot; is from the 1960's Batman TV series, which was on for two half-hour segments per week. At the end of the Tuesday night segment, the Penguin (or whoever) would tie Batman and Robin to a death machine, and then RUN OFF AND LEAVE THEM UNATTENDED. Every time. And then at the beginning of the Thursday night segment, Batman and Robin would get out of it. Hence the term, &quot;Penguin's Folly.&quot;I also have to say that Kelly is not nearly so well-described or deep a character as she could be; she doesn't seem to have much in the way of higher interests, other than reporting, Frank's body, and staying alive. This has something to do with the breakneck style that Burke is using in these early volumes (she may change later), where you have not much chance to catch your breath, and the text is full of elaborate &quot;detective story style&quot; metaphors the way a box of Ghirardelli's chocolates is full of grams of fat.So there's still room for improvement in this volume, but the learning curve from &quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot; to this one is encouraging, and in fact her third volume, &quot;Dear Irene&quot;, is better yet."},{"Title":"SWEET DREAMS, IRENE","review":"The annoying thing here is after being introduced to most of the cast in GOODNIGHT IRENE, several of their personalities seem to have completely changed as of this book (taking place several months later). Irene, still back at the newspaper, is covering the local election for District Attorney, and thanks to her involvement with homicide cop Frank, banned from crime stories. The son of one of the DA candidates comes to her, explaining that he is going to be accused by the other candidate of being a Satanist, by way of a photo of a group of Satan worshipers, and wants to tell his side of the story. Frank's elderly next door neighbor is murdered, the killer(s) leave satanic symbols at the scene. Irene suspects the symbols are meant to throw people off, although for a reporter she does very little research on Satanism and Wicca (what the group in the \\"satanic photo\\" claim to be) other than going to the local pagan shop and asking a couple questions of the owner. (ok maybe I am being biased here because I know a lot about Wicca, and some of the people who gravitate toward it). As in the first book Irene suffers from a total lack of foresight to call Frank or any of the other cops involved and share information, and this gets her into greater trouble. I am constantly frustrated by writers who use this \\"give the reader everything but don't let the different characters share with each other\\" method, and I just spend half the book screaming \\"just call someone and tell them what you know and the murderer will be easy to spot\\". I plan to continue reading the series, although I am currently not sure if this is because I hope it will get better, or because I am punishing myself."},{"Title":"SWEET DREAMS, IRENE","review":"This one is miles ahead of &quot;Goodnight Irene,&quot; though I liked that one as well. It's just that the author has matured somewhat and so has the style.

This is the story of what one determined man with a rifle can do, even in the face of great odds. Brown is a seaman on a British cruiser sunk by the German battlecruiser Zeithen.

Epstein's strength and weakness here are one: this is a personal book. He ruminates on his experience as an editor and how it reflects the business as a whole. The anecdotes he collects are filtered through his impassioned eye, and his predictions are heavily based on what he has seen and known, not on the advice of other experts.The book's relatively loose structure is reminiscent of an intimate conversation. Is this bad? It depends on what you want. I found it refreshing and enjoyable, especially given the book's brevity. BOOK BUSINESS is a warm appraisal of a business close to the author's heart, and you won't find a more loving tribute to the art of book publishing."},{"Title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"The preface of BOOK BUSINESS mentions the very origins of written language: cutting or &quot;scoring&quot; a mark onto a board. He notes that &quot;scorekeepers still keep score on boards&quot;. He might also have added that the early scoring was the first expression of binary code, the language understood by the tiny chips that run the giant scoreboards at the Super Bowl, as well as every other scoreboard or &quot;computer&quot; on Earth.Epstein gives here a curious insider/outsider account of the book business over the last half century. He was decidedly inside when he began in the fifties, working with Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer to &quot;publish&quot; such legends as Nabokov and Faulkner. His anecdote of Nabokov is a gem. He runs into the author in the bar of the Paris Ritz in the early seventies. Nabokov, in a loud Hawaiian shirt and a loud Midwestern accent, raises a toast to Richard Nixon. Why Nixon? Because he believed Nixon would eventually triumph over the Viet Cong and that would lead, dominolike, to the fall of the Soviet Union, enabling him to return to his beloved homeland.By the eighties Epstein and his ilk are being overwhelmed by mass market forces. Chain bookstores seem to be taking over the industry and reducing drastically the numbers of titles available for sale (and by extension able to be published). The pressure of real estate costs at the malls steadily reduced the selection at bookstores to a handful of bestsellers, &quot;whose faithful readers are addicted to their formulaic melodramas&quot;. Publishers who in Epstein's early years were like intellectual families had by the eighties been reduced to mere distributors and advertisers. Between 1986 and 1996, he relates, &quot;63 of the 100 bestselling titles were written by a mere 6 writers&quot;.By way of hinting at what was to come, Epstein tells of meeting a man who in the 1950s described to Epstein in some detail...the Internet. Epstein liked and respected the man, Norbert Wiener, an engineering prof at MIT, but &quot;dismissed this prophecy as science fiction&quot;. Courageously, Epstein admits his failure to take the prophecy seriously reflected &quot;the limitations of my own worldview at the time and that of my intellectual friends who were increasingly absorbed in Cold War issues and felt that the fate of Western civilization depended upon the positions they took in their articles for Partisan Review or in their dinner party conversation&quot;. One sees the limitations of his worldview pop up again when he meets a man named Bezos, who is committed to changing the book business. After a fairly short time, Epstein pronounces Bezos to be &quot;committed to an incorrect business model&quot;.But in spite of revealing himself to be a bit of a mossback, Epstein also gives what I found to be one of the most exhilerating glimpses anywhere of what technology can do for the book business: A kiosk, containing an &quot;ATM machine for books&quot;. In it, an integrated set of computer, internet connection, laser printer, and binder. You put your money in, type onto a keyboard what text you want--anything from a transcript of the Nixon tapes to a copy of LOLITA to a handbook of Siberian butterflies--and the computer downloads it, the laser prints it, and the binder binds it. It doesn't matter if it's &quot;out of print&quot;. That phrase is obsolescent. It doesn't matter if the book is banned. The newly printed and bound book will fall into a slot like a can of Coke. Your wait will be perhaps 5 minutes in 2005, falling to 5 seconds in 2010."},{"Title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"____________________________________________Just a quick note recommending this short book. Epstein, who spent most of his career at Random House, remarks on how publishing has changed over the years, with plenty of juicy anecdotes. Forex, the Dickens:As you may know, the US was a book-pirate haven in the 19th century, and Harper Bros. grew to be the nation's largest publisher by pirating Dickens, Thackeray, the Brontes, Macauley -- really, the entire roster of bestselling British authors. Macauley's (pirated) History of England sold a remarkable 400,000 copies here.Charles Dickens, who kept a close eye on revenues, made a trip to the US in the 1840's, to protest the theft of his work. His plea was ignored, and he didn't much like the country, either. He wrote a short, glum account of his visit, _American Notes_, which Harpers promptly pirated.Dickens recounts a train trip from Washington to Philadelphia through what he thought was a storm of feathers, but which proved to be spittle from passengers in the forward coaches. He also reported that US Senators spit so wide of the cuspidors that the carpets were \\"like swamps\\".WH Auden, Epstein reports, had the disconcerting habit of showing up an hour or so early for parties and dinner invitations, so he could be home in bed by 9 PM.Epstein was the first to publish a line of quality paperbacks (Doubleday Anchor) in 1952, and was a founder of the NY Review of Books. From his memoir, I'd say he had an interesting and fun career in publishing .Happy reading!Pete Tillman"},{"Title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"The world of book publishing and all of its adjunct business like book superstores, are an interesting yet hidden mystery. (Or at least I feel that way)The author takes through the journey of publishing and his life, which are tightly intertwined. He starts with the early and maybe exciting years of publishing in the 50's -60's to the movement of paperbacks to quality and outside the drug store.Along the way he also shares with us his prospective on the current book publishing/selling/writing situation around us. While I don't want to say much about this part, he doesn't paint a good picture of the overall situation.But then after describing the current situation he takes to his idea, vision, and hope for the future of publishing were authors would sell directly to readers.This is a fun and educational book to read for any book lover. I high recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"Unfortunately it isn't a book that'll help us understand how to set up and run a business sucessfully. Let alone the book or any media business, all that carry a huge ammount of sheer luck or &quot;right place at the right time&quot; in its record of achievements. Mr. Epstein shows the way through a business in which projections and assurance simply don't exist. It is the true business of risk and good sense. It won't show you how to succeed but again no book will. But it will entertain you an awful lot and hopefully make you want to be part in this great and demanding profession."},{"Title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"Jason Epstein started in publishing fresh out of college at a time when the concept of Quality Paperback was still revolutionary. In this book he states it as obvious that new technology will force the big publishing firms to drastically change or disappear.Epstein welcomes the anticipated change. He shows how publishing is ideally suited to small firms. Indeed, the current fashion in business to outsource everything except the core competence was for a long time traditional in publishing. When Ford glorified the concept of doing everything inside his corporation except the digging up of the raw materials, it was traditional for publishers to operate out of a small office, outsourcing printing, binding, design, distribution and concentrating of acquisition, financing, and marketing.In the 1980s and 1990s when business in general was going back to core competences, publishing was going in the opposite direction, when book publishers got bought by media conglomerates, apparently lured by anticipated &quot;synergies&quot;. Epstein fits in the world of small publishers, and suffered from the change that dominated his career.One interesting aspect of the book is Epstein's optimism about the Internet and the prospect of portable devices for downloading and displaying books. He sees it likely that this shifts the balance of power back to small publishers. Even more intriguingly, he notes how the Internet may even completely disintermediate the publisher by allowing authors and readers to find one another directly.An additional attraction for people like myself who are not in the book business, but are book junkies, is the glimpses into what it's like to be an editor. Epstein graduated from Columbia College where the idea of education was to read the One Hundred Great Books, started with Homer and ending in the 19th century. Anything later was still considered too dicey; not clear enough what was Great. Epstein took to it like a duck to water. Without this background, he would not have started Doubleday Anchor books, and even knowing about the existence of the One Hundred Great Books would still have been confined to a small elite.Why three rather than five stars?

Despite being filled with name-dropping on every other page (he hung out with people like Nabakov and Updike and he worked at Random House back when it was still a few small offices in the building that is now the Palace Hotel), this book is a great road map of where publishing has been and it's at least an insightful guess about where it's going in the future. Epstein helped guide the paperback revolution so he's made excellent predictions in the past.

I do not consider this a how to write a book. However, this book helps future authors to make certain if they want to sell their works they will need to remember to offer to the busy reading public their product in all available formats because people have more choice today then they had in the past.

It reminded me of how much of today's social networking revolution is lead by young people who have a better feel of for how people of their generation connect with each other.

As someone who is extremely interested in the publishing industry, this has provided a small dose of knowledge. I do appreciate that even if small. Also, I highly respect a man with such a passion for books. I knew there had to be those knee-deep in this business that truly loved books.I expected this book to provide more insight into the future of publishing. That it focused a lot on history was somewhat disappointing.All in all though, it's a relief to see that the physical book is not in danger of becoming obselete and that the bookstore will live. Dedicated readers like myself must agree that the book is a precious thing."},{"Title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"A very enjoyable,well written read. As with most things the reader will be the one who makes the decision on how the book business will go,not the authors, publishers or the booksellers.This has happened in most fields and the industry stalwarts have,with the best of intentions,tried to control the changes,or at least tried to keep up in their own way.However; the \\"tried,true and knowledgeable\\" have usually been swept aside by forces \\"outside\\" the industry.This has happened with all forms of marketing as evidenced by \\"box stores\\" ,restaurant chains,the cars we drive,the clothes we drive,the music we listen to,etc. The book industry is like any other where the \\"establishment knows what's best\\"and acts like the person whose preference for lunch is cavier,blue cheese and a glass of wine;opens a restaurant and offers it to his clients,gets very little business,seethes,looks on his potential customers as lowbrows when they disagree with his choice;and goes broke.In the meantime another decides to cater to his customers and offers soup,sandwich and \\"free\\" coffee and prospers.The diner decides! Like it or not it was the voters who put Schwarzenegger in power in California yesterday;not the political establishment, regardless of stripe.Socialistic type control by the establishment with grants,in-house editions,best seller lists,establishment, as opposed to reader,awards,etc.remind me of the days when the franchise owners tried to use black-outs to force fans to their games.The fans will decide if they want to go to the stadium,what team they want to watch and how much they want to pay; the same with readers.Epstein seems like a good person and wants to do the right thing;he is part of the establishment and this is not going to be where the changes will originate;they will come from outside.Remember it was not from the large communication companies like A T & T that gave us the internet.The restricted world of academics,authors,reviews and books he mentions is fine for the establishment but how come he doesn't seem to recognize Steinbeck,Hemmingway,McMurtry,Twain,Spillae,Westerns,Mitchener,Doonesbury,Romances,Sci-Fi,Mysteries,Biographies etc.or such novels as Uncle Tom's Cabin or Gone With the Wind? Are these not books in the mind of the writer? Is it only names like Proust,Camus,Cerf,Dupee,Nabakov etc.that are worthy of thinking as books? How many have read Gone With the Wind versus To the Finland Station ?As to the local,knowledgeable Booksellers...one day I was in an old established,prestige,well known bookstore in Toronto by the name of Britnell's looking to see what they had in books on mathematical puzzles and recreations.I asked if they had a section on Games and Puzzles. I was smugly told to try a \\"toy store\\".Like TARA, they are now Gone With the Wind; and by the way the large chain stores always have such a section.I have a personal library of about 6,000 titles,read between 120 and 150 books a year and have read very few of the the books reviews or authors mentioned in the book.

Although it seems as if Epstein is crying about it, he couches this in language that shows how the whole publishing industry remains in a state of flux and that this is just another view of this flux.The book has good flow, and it is a quick read.

Mr. Epstein makes a persuasive case for electronics reducing the costs of reaching readers in ways so that authors and their readers will interact more directly, as they did before the 20th century. The bulk of the book is an anecdotal history of publishing and book retailing in the United States over the last 150 years. In most cases, Mr. Epstein uses his own career for examples of the changes that have occurred in the last 50 years.Mr. Epstein takes on this challenge from a position of considerable authority. He been a top editor, working with authors like Norman Mailer, Vladimir Nabokov, E.L. Doctorow, Philip Roth, and Gore Vidal. Beyond that, he has been an important industry innovator, having helped introduce the quality paperback through Anchor Books, being a founder of The New York Review of books, and helping establish the Library of America (featuring authentic versions of important American works in paperback). When time-shared computer services were first expanding, he helped develop the &quot;Reader's Catalog&quot; for getting backlist books.... He was the first recipient of the National Book Award for Distinguished Service for American Letters for &quot;inventing new kinds of publishing and editing.&quot;Basically, the economics of creating a book involve getting the book edited and produced at the lowest possible fixed cost, and then being able to create copies at low marginal cost rates. Anything you can do to avoid any other overhead is all to the good. If an author simply publishes his own work electronically (as Stephen King has started doing), both costs reach a bare bones minimum. The potential for profits is enormous. Unfortunately for publishers and retailers, this new economic circumstance favors the authors and the readers. More and more book sales are coming from fewer and fewer authors (6 authors did over 60 percent of the top 100 books from 1986-1996). These authors now see themselves as needing business managers more than literary agents, so they can earn profits in more ways from their production. Mr. Epstein forecasts that more successful authors will simply buy the services they need from specialized firms rather than using publishers at all.The implication of this is that the major publishing conglomerates will soon be dismantled in a scramble to avoid the diseconomies of bidding higher and higher advances. Having not focused on building a backlist business, these firms will be unprofitable compared with alternative investments. The book business will probably go back to being run by people who do it for love of books, rather than love of profits. He sees chain bookstores surviving, but more as a place to have a cup of coffee and meet with others to discuss books. Nonbook outlets (possibly including Kinko's) could become places where you can go to get any book you want made to order. .... Authors will flourish as books always remain in print. New forms of books will arise that allow different combinations of material to be created, just to match the needs of an individual reader.This book is an expanded version of three lectures that Mr. Epstein gave at the New York Public Library in October 1999. The first chapter has already been published in the New York Review of Books. Unfortunately, after that chapter the book reads like a series of disconnected lectures rather than as one book.The first chapter is dynamite. The rest isn't nearly as good. The other sections are just detailed expositions of the points in the first chapter. So the content, while charming and interesting, is an elaborated magazine article. If Mr. Epstein had developed his economic insights in more depth, rather than providing a lot of historical background on the industry, the book would have been a lot better. As written, the book is backward looking 85 percent of the time and forward looking 15 percent of the time.Mr. Epstein needed a stronger editor to take his marvelous thoughts and shape them into something more visionary and coherent than this book is. But it must be tough to edit a legendary editor. I graded the book down one star for these faults. Some will grade it down more. If the book had been better focused and organized on the industry's future, I would have said that it was a more than five star book. So, you could say that I am really grading it down two or three stars for this problem.Now, please understand that the book is well written. The sentences and thoughts are beautiful. It just isn't formed into the best book it could be. If you like to read books of lectures, you won't mind a bit. So &quot;Book Notes&quot; junkies will love it!Ask yourself these questions: Where would you like to get your stories and information from the world's best writers and thinkers? How could the material be made more attractive and useful to you? How important are cost and convenience as issues for you?Cherish the potential of technology to expand our access to each other . . . always!"},{"Title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"After reading the New York Times Book Review write-up and a review in Newsday about Book Business: Publishing Past, Present, and Future, I was excited that someone had finally written a book about the business in which I work. However, readers need to heed the warning: \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\" (or, in this case, its title). I have worked in the book publishing industry for 15 years, and have seen firsthand a great deal of what the author describes in this book. It seemed that the beginning of each chapter captured me, as I personally related to what was being discussed. But after a few paragraphs in each chapter, the author digresses into biographical issues that lend no value or substantial insight into aspects of the general history of the book publishing business, which might affect or interest someone in the industry. With all due respect to the author (and I truly appreciate his attempt at such a work), the book is much too brief to live up to the hype I read in reviews touting it as some type of benchmark work. The author's analyses of the various aspects of the industry are simply not profound enough. He begins a discussion of a particular aspect of the business, and then maunders into a personal story, which is far from relative to general interest.The book is a very quick-and-easy read considering the author's style, which was obviously maintained throughout (leading me to believe that he was probably his own editor; some sentences are nearly a paragraph long). His use of a William F. Buckley-like vocabulary was probably not necessary for the typical reader. As an editor, I was, however, impressed that I could find but one typographical error in the entire book.I would not recommend this book for someone interested in starting a career in the publishing industry. It does, however, serve as an amusing little folk tale for those of us already in the business."},{"Title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"Like the hedgehog of legend, Jason Epstein in this book has one big idea: The Internet, he says, changes everything! All the rest of this book is commentary, memoir and historical anecdote recalled from a lifetime of experience in the hermetically sealed world of New York publishing.In fact, Mr. Epstein has written an interesting if only moderately useful book about the changes he has witnessed in the publishing arena, a book which, regrettably, does not offer much beyond an earlier essay he presented on-line about these same issues, although it is fleshed out here by the anecdotal descriptions of his personal experiences in the field. His basic thesis is that the publishing industry, by rights, ought to be a small scale business, but has grown, over time, into an unpromising corporate behemoth which cannot, in the end, sustain itself. However, the advent of the Internet should bring this chapter of the business to a resounding close, he suggests, as authors discover how to reach readers directly and, thereby, marginalize publishers.What, after all, do publishers do, he asks? They make books available to the public by investing in titles through a selection and editing process and then by financing the books' production (editing, layout/design, printing and binding), distribution (warehousing, linking with distributors and re-sellers) and promotion (advertising, networking with the review community and sales outreach to retailers). This is not very much, in the end, says Mr. Epstein, given the powers conferred upon authors through the Web.Thanks to modern e-publishing (on-line electronic publication and print-on-demand), authors can now do much of this themselves through on-line service providers at very minimal cost. The existence of on-line sales outlets such as amazon and bn.com (which have seen their share of book purchases grow from an early 1-2% to a more recently reported 6%) makes all this feasible since buyers cannot easily distinguish between self-published works which are well presented and their more commercially published cousins at the on-line sites. So, says Mr. Epstein, the business he has spent his life in is about to change radically . . . and for the better.Unfortunately, his own book does not go much beyond this basic point, aside from the interesting life experiences in the publishing world he has to recount. And so I was somewhat disappointed by it. I came to it hoping to learn more about the publishing business and how to circumvent it, having been a rejected author for the better part of my professional life.(In the interests of full disclosure I should say, at this point, that I am one of those \\"empowered\\" authors Mr. Epstein seems to be alluding to who has found an alternative to the closed world of \\"big\\" publishing through the exigencies of the Internet. Unable to place my first novel with a bona fide commercial publisher, I went the POD -- print-on-demand -- route to generally good reviews. But I have found that this means of publishing falls well-short of expectations as I still lack the means to connect with the big-time review community, which seems to have a prejudice against the self-published, or to promote my book on a scale which the traditional publishing world can offer.)So I was looking for more in Epstein's book, hoping to learn something I did not already know and gain insight into how I might parlay my foray into on-line based self-publishing into something bigger. But Epstein doesn't deliver that. Instead he offers only a few insights and generalities about changes in the offing.And yet, perhaps that's the best one can do, as this is a new and growing field and none of us can really foretell the future, not even a man of Mr. Epstein's substantial experience. At the least, I think his basic insight is correct, that the Internet does indeed alter the present landscape dramatically. Still, as noted, I was left a trifle disappointed at the book's end (which came rather quickly, as it's a very short book). Aside from learning a bit about Epstein's own contributions to publishing past, and seeing reiterated in words my own experiences with on-line publishing, and learning that Epstein doesn't hold out much hope for outfits like amazon either (he proposes, instead, that amazon become a broker to publishers and authors, taking a small fee for linking readers with the books they want, through a publishers' consortium, each time a sale is rung up), he doesn't have much that is new to tell us.And, if I may be picky for a moment, I was a little put off by the editing/proofing of the book which I expected more from, given its professional provenance. I counted at least three typos (including two \\"thats\\", a common enough error, and the use of the word \\"identify\\" when \\"identity\\" was meant, among them). Worse Mr. Epstein got his reference to Albert Payson Terhune wrong! Terhune was famous for his books about collie dogs but he did not write any Lassie books, contrary to what Mr. Epstein reports. That was a fellow named Knight. Terhune wrote LAD, A DOG and numerous subsequent works based on the generations of Lad. A one-note theme, to be sure, but he kept me reading in my youth and was probably the first writer to inspire me to try my own luck in the publishing arena. Unfortunately, I did not have the same good luck as he did in finding a publishing outlet, until the advent of the Internet which, as Mr. Epstein suggests, may well, and hopefully will, change everything.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"Jason Epstein has had a wonderful 50 years in the publishing industry. Good for him. I respect all that he's done. But upon reading this book, which was touted as &quot;the book they'll be talking about for decades,&quot; I am terribly disappointed. I bought the book hoping to find some insight into the publishing world of today. The first chapter or so, and a bit at the end of the book, gave me information and his opinions, which I value. The article &quot;Mistah Perkins, He Dead,&quot; written years ago, however, says much more succinctly what this 175-page book for $25 ever did. And believe me, I kept hoping."},{"Title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"Jason Epstein has had an extraordinary career in literary publishing, and if he ever writes a full-blown memoir of that career, it would make interesting reading. Epstein has also watched the publishing industry change radically since he entered it in 1950, and thought deeply about it. A book-length discussion of those changes would also make interesting reading._Book Business_ reads like condensed versions of both those books, inexpertly woven together. It jumps frequently and (it seems to me) awkwardly from big-picture analysis to \\"there I was having drinks with Nabokov\\" anecdotes. Ultimately, neither half of the story is entirely satisfying.The business analysis is interesting as far as it goes, but too narrow. Epstein dismisses all of popular fiction in a sentence as \\"formulaic melodrama,\\" and (aside from literary criticism) barely mentions serious non-fiction at all. He seems to make no distinction between \\"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\\" and Harlequin Romances, or between David McCullough's \\"John Adams\\" and the latest diet book. His ideas about the future role of the internet in publishing are equally narrow. He spends pages explaining (in 2001!) why Amazon.com can't possibly succeed. His enthusiasm for print-on-demand \\"book vending machines\\" is infectious . . . but takes little account of the staggering mechanical (not electronic) challenges they would present.The literary-memoir side of the book also feels curiously shallow. The anecdotes about Nabokov, Edmund Wilson, and the like are fascinating, but the sum of them feels like an after-dinner speech on \\"Great Authors I Have Known\\" rather than a discussion of what it's like to edit great writers. The stories from Epstein's career are also great reading, but they are so obviously *just* the high points that they give little sense of the texture of his career as a whole. Did he *never*, in fifty years in the business, suffer a setback?There's much here that's interesting, and Epstein is a graceful writer, but I think in the end I'd have rather read the two separate, longer books he might have written."},{"Title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"Jason Epstein has worked with many of the best writers of the twentieth century. He has helped revolutionize the American book market by introducing the quality trade paperback, the purchase of choice for today's avid readers. His \\"Book Business\\" was written amid the present publishing crisis, which has many precursors, including competition with other media. So why write this book now?This book is a memoir, a book created out of a series of three lectures that Mr. Epstein gave at the New York Public Library in 1999, where he discusses, more than anything else, his own background. He details one of the most all-encompasing career paths that were ever born in a world of books, from his beginnings with Random House, his more recent founding of the New York Review of Books, to his current endeavors to shake up the publishing industry. Some of it nostalgic, some historical, but all is stamped with a very biographical hand.This is not a book to read if you are looking for a historical analysis of the the book in the United States. Nor will it offer a deep understanding today's publishing world--in this regard it is an adequate overview. Book history is an actual academic discipline that has existed in Europe for decades and is just now becoming interesting to scholars in North America. In that sense, the subtitle, \\"Publishing Past Present and Future,\\" is incredibly misleading, a supreme overstatement. What this book can give you is insight into the life of a man (and his wife), who has committed his life to books and continue to do so. Epstein is a man to admire, a true man of letters.Perhaps this book is merely a preface to Epstein's next endeavor, a book-machine that can spit out any text, anywhere on the face of the earth, in any language. Books become digitalized, small language groups will be preserved, no book will be out-of-print. E-books, digital screens instead of musty yellowed pages--the digitalization of literature already has many enemies. But whatever huge advance rocks the boat of the publishing world, Epstein is sure to be there at the helm, or perhaps even be the wave itself."},{"Title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"Publishing is a notoriously conservative, unprofitable, non-linear line of business. The most fascinating parts of Epstein's book are his accounts of how he did something a little differently (&quot;thought outside the box,&quot; to use a current cliche) and helped create something truly innovative and worthwhile--like quality paperbacks (Anchor Books) and the Library of America (uniform editions of carefully edited American classics on acid-free paper). While this book is essentially an extended essay on where publishing is going (as publishing houses become lesser components in larger media companies, and author advances for the turner-outers of blockbuster titles sap publishers of their resources and makes them unwilling to take risks on more significant literary voices), there are some interesting portraits of key figures from publishing's past, such as Horace Liveright, Bennett Cerf, and Donald Klopfer.His key thesis, that the future of publishing lay in being able to obtain printed books on demand from ATM-like kiosks, is both hopeful and scary. It means that there will be no need for any title to ever go out of print, no matter how limited its audience. (Hopeful.) But will books produced in this manner be as satisfying to read, hold, and collect as any single title in the Library of America? (Scary.)"},{"Title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"Many successful careers are the result of surprising and totally unpredictable turns of events, particularly turns of a psychological kind. Jason Epstein originally went into the book business to associate with authors and to learn from them first hand as a continuing education, with the distant idea of becoming a writer himself. To his surprise he turned out to be something of a visionary and a sharp, effective publisher, whose romantic, yet business-like nature fitted the New York publishing world like a well-tailored suit. He had discovered, as he puts it on page 59, &quot;that literature, like all religions, is also a business, though not a very good business.&quot;Epstein sought to make it better, and in succeeding represents that rare species, the romantic as a successful book publisher. The emphasis should be on the word &quot;successful,&quot; of course, but I'll emphasize the romantic because in the book business they (at least in my modest experience) they are now as rare as dodos, and for similar reasons. Epstein's delicious and gracefully written little memoir recalls his fifty years in publishing with the kind of understated, buttoned-down, perceptive style that one associates with the New York world of books before the rise of the conglomerates and the block buster mentality. There are chewy reminiscents of Edmund Wilson and Vladimir Nabokov, of Faulkner with brown bags under his arms, of Donald Klopfer and Bennet Cerf who &quot;accidentally&quot; became a millionaire because of his love of quality books, and many other illuminati, curious creatures from a more genteel time when literature mattered, and the bottom line was secondary.But, as the title insists, Epstein is looking forward as well as backward, supplementing the story with forecasts and guesses about the future. He believes that the Internet, &quot;the electronic literary marketplace,&quot; is going to revolutionize the business in ways we cannot guess, and the scope of the changes will be comparable to those brought about by the invention of movable type. He sees machines capable of printing a single copy of a book downloaded from the Internet on the corner of his Manhattan street or &quot;at the headwaters of the Nile&quot; or &quot;in the foothills of the Himalayas&quot; or even in our homes (p. xii). He compares Amazon.com's margin problems to his experience with The Reader's Catalog and the direct-mail selling of books. Because of his past success in anticipating trends and because of his innovative skill, people in the business will read this book with mercenary as well as nostalgic interest.Besides editing some of the great writers of our time (the book jacket contains praise and appreciation from Toni Morrison, Norman Mailer, Michael Korda and E. L. Doctorow) Epstein was the first to see the potential for quality paperbacks with his launching of Anchor Books in 1952. He also started the very influential The New York Review of Books in1963 opportunely during a strike that shut down The New York Times and its Book Review. Epstein was also instrumental with in bringing about the Library of America, a story he recounts in the chapter entitled &quot;Groves of Academe.&quot;Others have remarked on the clear and even elegant style of this memoir; and it is certainly pleasant to praise an editor for his writing ability. I would like to join the chorus and add that I recognize a lesson he is implicitly teaching, namely that of brevity and economy of expression, but with a kind of leisurely urbanity that is unafraid of the complex sentence. One can also see that every sentence was polished, resulting in that seeming serendipity known to every editor as the easy reading that comes from hard work. Note however the missing word &quot;year&quot; near the end of page 60, and the unclear sentence spanning pages 97 and 98. (I take a writer's delight in, as it were, &quot;editing&quot; an editor!)It might be noted that one of the pleasures of writing a memoir is to thank (and to make look good) one's friends and the people one admires (which Epstein does very well), while slyly, almost inadvertently, assassinating the character of others. Epstein indulges himself sparingly, but gives it to Vladimir Nabokov right between the eyes. His recall of the celebrated author of Lolita aping an American tourist at a Manhattan restaurant while cheering on Nixon and our tragic involvement in Vietnam is unsettling. His sketch of Bennet Cerf is warm and admiring without any insincerity, and his recall of half a dozen other editors and publishers seems objective and even kindly. Epstein comes across as a man pleased with himself and the world and what he has done with his life."},{"Title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"In book publishing since 1950, Jason Epstein knows firsthand the problems the industry has faced over the years and how recent technological advances are about to bring a much-needed change. And though this may seem boring on the surface, read on, for according to Epstein, the future of book publishing is about to change dramatically.No stranger to innovation, Epstein launched The New York Review of Books, and the Library of America, in addition to creating Doubleday's Anchor Books, the imprint that started the quality trade paperback revolution. Now he envisions another revolution, but he's not talking about electronic books (e-books).In the preface to Book Business, Epstein says, \\"Technologies change the world but human nature remains the same,\\" which seems to sum up how most readers feel about e-books. You can't replicate the experience of curling up with a good book if you're glued to a computer screen or fumbling with a stack of loose-leaf printed pages. What he is talking about is print-on-demand (POD) publishing - technology that is capable of transferring book text electronically to book kiosks which will be able to print and bind a finished book, either in a central location or, eventually, in your own home.Joining Random House in 1958, when the company was housed in New York's Villard mansion, Epstein witnessed an exciting part of book publishing history. He recounts tales of W. H. Auden showing up unannounced \\"in torn overcoat and carpet slippers delivering the manuscript of The Dyer's Hand\\"; Theodore Geisel (Dr. Suess) \\"arriving with his storyboards to recite Green Eggs and Ham\\"; and Andy Warhol \\"bowing slightly and addressing me in a deferential whisper as Mr. Epstein, as if I were not someone in a torn sweater and corduroy trousers hardly older than he was....\\"Epstein elucidates a time in New York after the Second World War when the sounds of Johnny Mercer and Ella Fitzgerald could be heard at the Vanguard or Caf&eacute; Society and, if you had a few pennies, you could enjoy a beer while you were listening.But irregardless of the social opportunities it affords, Epstein asserts that publishing, by its nature, is not suited to becoming a commercially viable enterprise, and that attempts at making it so have oft led to disappointment, since the publishing paradigm includes allowing booksellers to return unsold stock for full credit. When he was at Doubleday, Epstein later learned, the company's treasurer was advising its owner to sell the business and invest the proceeds in government bonds, arguing that this would yield a greater profit. \\"The book business as I have known it,\\" Epstein confesses, \\"is already obsolete.\\"Meanwhile, the marketplace has come to be monopolized by superstores, whose accompanying high overhead costs require high turnover. The trouble started with the migration from cities to suburbs, since the only place booksellers could set up shop in the suburbs was in the malls, where high rent precludes the profitable operation of a retail business that requires a great deal of inventory with very little turnover. \\"When this phenomenon first became apparent some 30 years ago,\\" Epstein quips, \\"the industry joke was that the shelf life of a book had fallen somewhere between milk and yogurt. Since then the situation has worsened....\\"Internet booksellers have attempted to bring these inconsistencies within line, but even their dismal profit performance shows continuing difficulty. The problem is that even in a warehouse, overhead rises with increased sales and profits never improve.Enter the \\"ATM for books,\\" POD machines proficient at printing and binding any paperback book for the cost of a few dollars. They are already in use at book wholesaler Ingram, and other publishers and retailers. Smaller, less-costly versions of these machines are now in development, coming soon to a store (or library, or post office?) near you. One day you might have one attached to your computer as your conventional printer is now.In the meantime, many publishers are scurrying to digitize their backlists, although there is still controversy over whether they, or their authors, own electronic rights; while another hurdle to be overcome involves developing reliable encryption to prevent against copyright infringement.But imagine the possibilities: any book ever written available instantly, or the ability to create custom books with combinations of text from one or more authors, all from the comfort and convenience of your own home.Book Business is not only premonitory when it comes to the coming revolution in publishing - which makes it a compelling read - but well-written and conversational; the kind of book you don't want to end. If Epstein's predictions ring true, our world will almost assuredly be a different place for publishers, booksellers, authors, and readers alike.When it comes to considering the possibilities this technology brings, the mind boggles and I feel the urge to visit my local bookstore, this time spending a little more time, so I'll be able to tell my grandchildren what one looked like."},{"Title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"Given that this was the compilation of 3 lectures given in 1999, that the Afterwards was from an article in 2001 and that the \`Preface to the Paperback Edition' was written in 2002 this book is interesting as a historical footnote to the impact of various communication and information storage technologies on the publishing industry. As far as analysis, there is very little of that, and what there is is more like an \`executive summary' type commentary. Nothing really trenchant or substantive. As a memoir of Epstein's work history and a general history of trends and structure in the U.S. publishing industry it is fairly interesting though not in any way comprehensive.Why two stars? There were a couple of problems I could not get around. Epstein wants his book and to edit it too. He is neither a business analyst nor an academic, and it shows. Though he repeatedly cites the numerous structural and business process inefficiencies of the publishing industry he defends the necessity and role of the editor, that is to say, by turns he criticizes writers, agents, publicists, retailers, corporate owners of publishing houses, and readers (consumer trends) but he reiterates the necessity of professional editors and expresses the belief that book publishing does not well conform to conventional business models and practices.Epstein displays a superficial understanding of basic business principles (his work with The Reader's Catalog and his commentary [...] as well as his consortium idea are just a laugh-riots, he should have taken some business courses at Columbia) and a lack of anything remotely approximating an academic, much less a high level business analysis of the industry, \\"Trade book publishing is by nature a cottage industry, decentralized, improvisational, personal; best performed by small groups of like minded people, devoted to their craft, jealous of their autonomy, sensitive to the needs of their writers and to the diverse interests of readers.\\", \\"During this time book publishing has deviated from its true nature by assuming, . . .the posture of a conventional business.\\" First of all, his understanding of a cottage industry is flawed and romanticized. The penchants of a cottage industry are scarcity of resources, brutal efficiency, and filling a specific and exact need for a customer. Epstein admits to the inefficiency of the current methods that describe finding a manuscript (and writer) through editing/finishing a manuscript for publication but notes this as a necessary part of the process rather than one of the inherent flaws. If 80% of commercial fiction FAILS to make a profit isn't that as much of an indictment against the selection/editing process as a failure of distribution outlets??Epstein completely dismisses the transformative aspects of communication technologies with respect to process and overemphasizes the impact on distribution methods. \\"It is highly improbable that from this clutter (literary web sites that offer publishing-on-demand) works of value will emerge. . . The filter that distinguishes value is a function of human nature, not of particular technologies.\\" I think I can forgive this because at the time he was writing this, fan fiction, via message boards (most notable Harry Potter related) were just starting to emerge large scale and the peer review through specific social networking was probably way out of Epstein's realm of understanding. He fails to anticipate any sort author to reader selling through social networking. He does not mention blogging in any detail in the book. The power of various functionalities of advancing technology to narrow and in most cases eliminate the distinction between amateur and professional in the catagory of selecting/editing a book is nonexistent. **I would bet the if at the publication of this book Mr. Epstein had been given a one paragraph explanation of a free online dictionary edited by anyone (Wikipedia) he would have scoffed. In the same vein if you suggested to him now that groups of non-professional reviewers could edit a novel he would also scoff**Here is the capper, \\"For readers who are accustomed to an orderly literary marketplace the much less disciplined digital future may seem as threatening as widespread literacy seemed to the priests of the 15th century.\\" Ohhhhh Mr Epstein, if only you had gone to just a few business classes. The consumer of today is NOT frightened of expanded choice and they willing embrace anything that expands their choices, and they reward producers and companies who make it easy for them to choose among hundreds of choices [...].Other than a memoir, a broad overview of the book industry, and a example of professional bias this book misses as any sort of substantive analysis of transformation in the publishing industry."},{"Title":"Say Unto This Mountain","review":"The author begins, \\"God's principles concernting prayer are as workable as His natural laws . . .

He makes a living, barely, by translating French works into English and he stays in the flats of friends. As the novel opens Jake is informed that he, and his man Friday, Peter &quot;Finn&quot; O'Finney, must move out of their current address, because Madge, who has been letting them stay there, has found herself a fianc&eacute;. Over the course of the rest of the book, the flat-broke Jake desperately seeks for ways to avoid having to do any work and for places to stay courtesy of his friends. Much of the story is taken up with his broken friendship with Hugo Belfounder, a philosopher turned moviemaker (apparently based on Ludwig Wittgenstein), whose theories Jake presented in somewhat bastardized form in one of the few books he actually wrote himself. Another subplot involves a dognapping of an animal which is an unlikely film-star. The book ends, as it began, with Jake broke, not writing, and looking for a place to stay.I suppose some of the scenarios in the book are amusing if you are British and are immersed in the works of philosophers like Wittgenstein. For the rest of us, it's all rather tedious. A picaresque where neither the central character nor any of the people he comes in contact with show any signs of personal growth and development seems an exercise in futility. Personally, I agree with the friend of Jake's who suggests :Society should take you by the neck and shake you and make you do a sensible job. Then in your evenings you would have the possibility to write a great book.To the extent that Jake in this sense embodies all of England between the Wars and the rise of Margaret Thatcher, I suppose you could interpret the book as depicting the adverse effects of the dole mentality on British culture.But Iris Murdoch apparently intends the book to convey a somewhat more existentialist message. As she says :All work and all love, the search for wealth and fame, the search for truth, like itself, are made up of moments which pass and become nothing. Yet through this shaft of nothings we drive onward with that miraculous vitality that creates our precarious habitations in the past and future. So we live; a spirit that broods and hovers over the continual death of time, the lost meaning, the unrecaptured moment, the unremembered face, until the final chop that ends all our moments and plunges that spirit back into the void from which it came.Here I come back to my eternal quarrel with existentialism : if it's all pointless anyway, then why in the name of God do you spend your time writing about it, and for what earthly reason should I waste my time reading what you write ?I must admit myself to be at a complete loss to explain the presence of this novel on the Modern Library Top 100 list. Luckily, we'll all be disappearing into the void soon, so we need not trouble ourselves over the matter.GRADE : D+"},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"i don't understand what is so great about this book. i didn't learn anything new from it, and it was only mildly entertaining. i suppose it's good casual reading, if you're on a plane or something. it's more or less well written, but not spectacular by any means. of course, i don't find wittgenstein that great, either. the book is funny at times, though.honestly, after reading all the great reviews, i expected much more of this book. i was very dissapointed. i felt like i was watching some quirky hour-long t.v. show about the wacky adventures of aspiring authors - something fantastic, something that would never happen in real life; but if you don't take it seriously, then it's fine. this is the only book by iris murdoch that i've read, and i really hope it isn't her best.so buy it if you want to read something mildly amusing, but if you feel like reading something that is truly worth the effort, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"This book is so pretentious, so show-offy, so geared to highly educated Oxbridge people, it clearly excludes the well-educated non academic reader.If you find drunkenness funny and the long descriptions of how drunkenness affects the body, I guess you will like this.I had to read it for my book club but hated every page -- no favorite characters or episodes.I hate to think the entire British public lives to get drunk but this and other literature and movies forces me to believe that no event in Britain, celebratory or shocking, takes place without a glass in hand."},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"I audibly laughed through half the scenes of this amazing first novel. It is a great thing to make someone laugh out loud while reading and this book did it continually. Whether it be the point where Jake Donaghue sits outside Sadie's flat listening to the \\"plot\\" against him with the neighbours poking him to see what he'll do or the superhero stunts of Jake and Hugo at the Roman set saving Lefty. I couldn't stop myself from laughing at the clever wit of the situation. But, what is amazing is that behind all of this there are deep philosophical thoughts at work, but the spaciousness of these thoughts never intrude upon the enjoyability of the story. It is similar in that way to Bellow's Henderson the Rain King, but the comedy in this is up a few notches more. The story is deeply routed in London (with a side-trip to Paris) and this location no doubt gives all the more joy to readers familiar to the area with its deep descriptions of particular sections and jabs at the reputations of others. Yet, this too did not detract from the book's enjoyability because of the eloquence of her descriptions. \\"When caught unawares,\\" Jake reflects, \\"I usually tell the truth, and what's duller that that.\\" The book is one long reflection and so, according to this line, we are thenceforth suspicious of all we are told. Many points of his memory are probably deeply exaggerated and this would explain some of the all too convenient coincidences. But, who cares? It's a good, entertaining story. Ultimately, Murdoch is presenting a rather ideal view of the independent will of the free spirit. Jake's hope is neatly set forth at the end. But the ideals of living in regards to work and love, wealth and fame seem to be given a manageable frame in which to work in. What Murdoch seems to be saying is that we must be swept along by the course of our own story and not be caught \\"under the net.\\" The old argument which Bellow echoes also of Being and Becoming. Living, not without reflection, but containing the dialogue between oneself and existence within because once it is set out on paper it becomes a story, not life. \\"The substance of my life is a private conversation with myself which to turn into a dialogue would be equivalent to self destruction.\\" Jake is learning to live more fully by instinct and self-forgetfulness. He is learning to allow other people's point of views into his own life. He finds that by constantly looking only within himself he isn't able to see anyone there. The being has left."},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"Had been meaning to get round to Murdoch for some years but was expecting a fairly heavy read. In fact, after the first 70 pages or so in which I was unsure about the direction I was being taken, I found that I was laughing aloud for much of the book (rare in my case), which is not something I had expected. The set pieces of the book are conceived with great originality & a deeply quirky, Irish type of humour. The characters themselves remain - intentionally - rather hard to fathom for most of the book, adding to a mildly dark sense of mystery which leads us (and them) on from one episode to the next. This also adds to our questioning about what direction the author is trying to take us. Inevitably, the answer is largely subjective - but what added to my appreciation of the novel after I finished reading was that rather than attempting to draw a broad prescriptive lesson about life, it is rather a celebration of the individual and offers humour and a kind of resolution - or at least positive progress - even in the midst of the most confused and unheroic of lives. This is a picaresque novel peopled principally by (lovable) roguish empiricists - not one for those craving a strong plot. I loved it. And I have an implicit confidence that this is an author of such skill & originality that I shall enjoy any of her remaining 25 novels (this being her first). Even when I have hugely enjoyed reading a book, I have rarely, if ever, looked forward to reading other novels by the same author with such confidence and relish."},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"Jake, a marginal literary figure who gets by translating French novels, veers erratically from one obsession to another. He goes from determined pursuit to avoidance in the blink of an eye. Whenever he gets what he has indicated that he wants, he spurns it. He is maddeningly arbitrary, but also fascinating because the author deftly expresses the flux of thought and impulse that motivate human action (and inaction). The other characters serve primarily as foils for his shifting attitudes. Only by conspicuous exertion is Jake able to even conceive of Hugo, his hulking sometime companion, becoming a watchmaker or of Finn, his longtime &quot;shadow&quot;, returning to Ireland. They exist only as they play a role in Jake's life. The most significant development, in a story where things largely end up where they started, is Finn's replacement by a dog (not necessarily a flattering commentary on Finn).The one non-ancillary character is &quot;Mrs. Tinck&quot;, the news store proprietor, who, benevolent soul that she is, comes across as an interesting person in her own right. The book effectively begins and ends in her shop. She is also the one who, gently, helps Jake to take himself less seriously. She accomplished this, in a scene at the end of the story, in a fashion that left me smiling as I closed the book.While some of the plotting seems unnecessarily complicated, some of the dialogue far too (intentionally?) stilted, and there are too many coincidences, the overall effect of this book is dazzling. The best scenes: Jake and Finn stealing Mars; Jake following Anna into the Tuileries Gardens; and all the scenes with Mrs. Tinck more than offset the comparative clunkers with Lefty Todd and Hugo. The author's expatiation on the tension between silence and expression (truth and falsehood) came across as heavy-handed spoof, especially with the passage from &quot;The Silencer&quot; and the mime theater interlude.All in all, however, in its sly and subversive way, this book is &quot;one of the wonders of the world.&quot;"},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"Fast-paced, funny, unpredictable, this book may be Murdoch's best. I originally came to it because I read that she had based her first novel on the ideas (and character) of Ludwig Wittgenstein. I did, in fact, find some elements of W's ideas in it; but that's not really the reason I found this book so beguiling. As a novel it succeeds brilliantly: it manages to present complex ideas in a completely literary form. You are so caught up in the plot, the characters, the comedy, you may never notice the author is doing philosophy.The writing is excellent: Murdoch describes a night of drunken revelry so well that you can feel the chill air on your skin. She also puts together an unforgettable cast of characters: Sadie the movie star; her mysterious sister Anne; Hugo, the tortured soul; Dave the impatient academic; Lefty the socialist bon-viveur; Magdalen the ambitious secretary; Sacred Sammy the cool operator... and more. Read it as as a philosophical 'bildungsroman' or read it as a picaresque romp - entertainment guaranteed."},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"Under the Net's main character is Jake Donaghue. He is an intellectual who translates the works of a mediocre French novelist. He is looking for a place to live and decides to look up some old friends of his. The people he visits are wonderful characters - philosophers, actresses, movie stars, radical political leaders. These people lead him back to Hugo Belfounder, an old friend of Jake's who has always made money, and who impressed Jake with his philosophy. It's not certain if Hugo even knows he has a philosophy, but Jake believes he does. Jake believes that Hugo's philosophy states that truth can be attained only in silence; that all expression (speech, writing, theories) is untrue because people always expand, elaborate and lie about what they're saying in order to impress others. Jake's silence, however, often leads him to misunderstandings and trouble. Aside from the philosophy of the characters, which I may have misunderstood anyway, the novel is filled with wonderful moments, both comic and romantic. Check out the scene when Jake is eavesdropping outside of Sadie's door, or Jake and Finn's escapade with Mars, the movie star dog. Another great moment is when, during a fireworks show, Jake sees Anna across the river in Paris, and his pursuit of her afterwards. Under the Net is a wonderful book filled with humor, romance and great characters. Definitely check it out."},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"Very few books have I ever picked up to immediately find myself thinking, &quot;Oh!&quot;Such was the case with &quot;Under the Net&quot;. This was my first Iris Murdoch novel, but by no means will it be my last.She deftly creates empathy for our anti-hero, Jake, while making him less than sympathetic, drawing the reader into the story while at the same time keeping us far enough away that we can comfortably laugh at the proceedings. Murdoch also reveals her story slowly, layer by layer, turning what we believe will be little more than mild humor into a mystery of character assassination.And it reads very much like a mystery, the kind that you just don't find anymore. But here it is not a dead body that is the victim, but rather a living, breathing one. But is he as much a victim as he likes to think he is? Our hero finds that nothing is as he believes it to be.Is it ever?"},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"This isn't merely Murdoch's first novel, it is also (one of) her best. The story of the would-be writer Jake D. who struggles to find a proper literary philosophy to ignite his career, nicely reflects Murdoch's own intellectual struggles in writing &quot;Under the Net&quot;. Although this might sound rather high-blown and tedious, it is not, for by mixing the philosophical musings with the picaresque form, Murdoch ensures that the story is highly dynamic and entertaining. We follow Jake through a series of bizarrely comic and breathtaking incidents, and observe how he develops his initial egoistical Sartrean world-view to a truer and more profound understanding of his fellow-beings. It is fascinating to watch how this development unveils Jake's pretentiousness and shapes him into a mature artist. In sum, this novel simply has and is everything, drama, farce, mask, satire etc. and Murdoch has mixed these elements with such dexterity that one can doubt whether she ever wrote a better book. In saying so it must also be emphasised that &quot;Under the Net&quot; foreshadows much of Murdoch's later work."},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"In his early period (specifically, in \\"Tractatus\\"), the Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein argued that the \\"net\\" of language both separates us from and connects us to the world: it simultaneously impedes and determines our understanding of life. He furthermore concluded that anyone who finally comprehended the meaning behind the language of \\"Tractatus\\" would realize that its arguments were senseless; to quote the Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, the reader can \\"throw away the ladder after climbing up on it\\" and experience the world directly through contemplation rather than through philosophical discussion. \\"Under the net\\" of language, then, lie the truths of the world.Yet it's not essential to have an understanding of Wittgenstein to enjoy the zany farce of Murdoch's novel, whose characters are hunters of truth in its pure manifestations (love and freedom), as well as its illusory aspects (money and success). The chief seeker is Jake Donaghue, short of cash and without much prospect for any meaningful source of income. Jake has been freeloading in a friend's apartment; when she becomes engaged to be married, he's homeless as well as poor. Along with his sidekick, Finn (who serves as a less dependable Jeeves to Jake's ungentlemanly Wooster), he sets out in search of a new home and instead embarks on a series of adventures: a peek at a bizarre theatrical performance by mimes, a night of pub-crawling, a day at the races, a dog-napping, and a visit to a film studio whose riotous outcome prefigures, as much as anything, the finale of \\"Blazing Saddles.\\"During his journey, Jake runs across three old acquaintances: a former girlfriend; her sister, a famous actress; and most important, Hugo Belfounder, who had been a fellow patient at a clinic testing inevitably unsuccessful cures for the common cold. During alternating bouts of deliberately induced illness, the pair held philosophical conversations, to which Hugo contributed nearly all of the original thoughts. Jake in turn converted these pronouncements into a book, \\"The Silencer,\\" published without telling his new friend. Only after he'd finished the book, however, did Jake realize that the profundity of Hugo's opinions had been frustrated by his own attempt to render them into words. Jake's embarrassment over both his deceit and his failure had caused him to break ties unceremoniously with Hugo, who has since become a filmmaker. (Although this suggestion of truths masked by language is one of the more overt allusions to \\"Tractatus,\\" biographer Peter Conradi points out that the character of Hugo is based not on Wittgenstein but on a Cambridge friend of Murdoch's who was the philosopher's star pupil.)There are a number of wildly unpredictable and often absurd subplots involving the four old friends, all based on the miscommunication that results because each of them is in love with another, but none of them is in love with each other. It's a circle of love right out of an Elizabethan drama.In spite of its philosophical borrowings, Murdoch's first novel is her most fast-paced--and it's certainly her wackiest. At times, it's even downright silly, and looking for meaning in the fun is like tracking down the literary references in a Buster Keaton film (they exist--but does it really matter?). Once you get past the surface trappings of its metaphysics, you can simply enjoy the screwball comedy of \\"Under the Net.\\""},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"This is my favourite novel as strange as it is. Well, the fact is strange, not the novel. I read Murdoch's Unicorn and shrugged my shoulders. Read Black Prince and had a feeling that I had wasted my time. But Under the Net! - mmmm... A perfect book for young existentialist beer-lovers, who love dusty bookshops, who keep late hours and hate regular jobs. And, please, don't blaspheme this book by analysing it too much (like some sophisticated reviewers here tend to do). Enjoy the ride and have some beers with good friends instead. If you like deconstructing things to symbolic bits and pieces, read Camus instead."},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"The protagonist of this story, Jake, is an Oxford-educated male writer, while the author is the same, with the exception of gender.How she manages to look into the mind of the male is amazing. The dialogue reminds me of Waugh or Forster. The main character - who neither seeks job, reputation nor achievement - fights off his talents for a life of impoverished mediocrity. This reminds me of Murry Burns -- the \\"A Thousand Clowns\\" main character played by Jason Robards.The carefree reckless disdain for the next day allows this book to float from scene to scene. Eventually, the scenes tie together -- the later scenes make the prior scenes become more appropriate. Within a matter of days, the humor of this book has Jake kidnap a movie star dog, experience the falling of Rome (on a movie set at least), visit a mime theater, engage with a bookie in fixed races, engage in a drunken leftist movement, and sleep in a bearskin suit when evicted from his home.The madcap adventure of a little more than a week encapsulates much. The humor, a bit stale after five decades and a country apart, still resonates in today's world and would make a wonderfully sarcastic film.The writing, which is like her peers and some of the great British writers who preceded her, is more descript and more detailed than modern-American prose, and exemplifies the writer and her achievement."},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"It's a work of Art as i pursue more authors like Iris.. what a world this book is.

I had read Murdoch's The Sea, the Sea years ago (well, I finished it Dec 4, 1983, if you really want to know that) and had been underimpressed by it. I should have read the reviews on Under the Net on this site before I read it. That would have given me some clue to what I was supposed to expect and derive from the book. I am no student of Ludwig Wittgenstein, but if I had known that Hugo was supposed to be based on him, it might have made me more alert to what he did,e.g. But I read the book as I do any other, and I found it very unimpressive--and I know that is my fault, I suppose. So I guess what I am saying is that if existentialism, Wittgenstein, Sarte, Bellow, etc., don't get you very interested you might not enjoy this book. I found I was glad when I was nearing the end--tho I admit that the last ten pages I rather enjoyed!"},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"Published in 1954, Under the Net is an entertaining novel about one season in Jake Donaghue's life. Jake is a 30-ish writer in London whose specialty is translating French novels to English to earn money, which he hasn't much of, and he hasn't written anything original for sometime. Despite being semi-dependent on friends for survival (and a strong aversion for actual work), he seems very likeable, generous, loyal, and would not compromise his ideals for easy money. He is living everyone's romantic version of poverty, where everything works out and he's never actually desperate, in fact it's a bit too fantastic how he gets out of trouble sometimes, chasing one urgency (a long lost love or friendship he has to repair) after the next. But it's a feel good book because of that, and maybe in post-World War II London all this was not impossible. In the end, this very impressionable and impetuous character is more wise, has writing and employment plans, and is just as poor.Jake's fascinating friends also add entertainment - the social climbing Madge and her friendly/devious fianc&eacute; Sammie the bookie, Jake's strangely loyal &quot;assistant&quot; Finn, his socialist filmmaker friend Hugo, and the attractive Quentin sisters who are two corners of a sad, 4-way unrequited love structure. Something exciting or dangerous is always happening.The novel is also filled with nuggets of wisdom from Murdoch, that you can't help but feel she's pondered a lot on love, the intellectual life (vs. accomplishing work on a daily basis), and many other things. She describes swimming and judo with such zeal you feel it is something she has done, rather than just having researched on it. Perhaps it should not have been told in the first person because at times it does not sound like the thoughts of an immature male writer who is still finding himself, but someone wiser. It takes thirty pages (out of 286) to get going and I'm not sure everyone will relate to Jake's character, but it's certainly a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"Iris Murdoch's first novel, Under the Net, follows the story of a young English writer, to lazy and afraid to write anything original, who subsists on translating trash French fiction and survives on the charity of friends. One of the most interesting aspects of this book is that it consists of a first person narrative of a male character, written by a woman. The protagonist finds thrown out of the house in which he has been living when his benefactor (and sometimes lover) decides to marry a somewhat unsavory character. What follows is a series of revelations about the motivations and character of his aquaintances which leads him on an interesting romp through the London of the fifties. A must read for any Murdoch fan. Cheers"},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"An amusing and interesting novel of ldeas, but not a work that I connected with on an emotional level. The book came out in 1954, and is set in London and Paris, It does not seem dated, which is rather odd, given how difficult life was in Britain in that period. It is narrated by Jake Donaghue, an impecunious translator of French novels into English, and follows his wanderings through London (and eventually to Paris) in search of various people he knows. There are long philosophical discussions, few of which lead anywhere in particuar: perhaps this is post-was existentialism in action.As to the story, there are very funny bits, and terrific set pieces, but I kept wishing that Jake would settle down and follow one goal (or person), rather than constantly shifting targets. Also, at the end of the novel all the relationships that Jake thinks he understands turn out to be something else all together. That changeability makes several of the characters difficult to care about very much.I did end up being rather fond of Jake, but the dog is still the most sympathetic character in the novel.One's response to this book, I imagine, is very much a matter of taste. There is no question that it is beautifully written, and that it is at times very funny. But it is also degage, and on some level -- for me at least -- inconsequential. All very clever, like beautifully decorated desserts, but not necessarily satisfying."},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"Jake Donaghue is the free-spirited center of this luminous novel about a man who drifts confidently through his life mooching off friends, chasing dreams, and never once realizing how much time and talent he is wasting while in orbit around himself. Ejected from his latest rent-free living arrangement by a woman friend who finds a \\"real\\" boyfriend and wants her flat to herself again, Jake and his dreamy sidekick, Finn, run off to their buddy Dave's house to try to find another (free) flatmate or two.The journey is hilarious and pitiful at the same time. Jake truly lives for the moment. Just as the reader adjusts to Jake's newest situation, he jettisons himself into a new place, new relationships, new goals, even a new pet dog which he steals for his own leverage purposes, then becomes too attached to give the pooch back. He revisits a long-ago incident of dishonesty with a former friend, chases the elusive shadow of an old girlfriend, and finally comes face to face with the man he cheated long ago. All along one gets the uncomfortable, prickly feeling that Jake is running, running, hiding from the truth: the truth about the book he wrote that stole another's words and insights; the truth about who he could have been if he hadn't been so shiftless. The title of the book, in my humble opinion, is a metaphor of how truth catches us, in contrast to the popular notion of seeking after truth. Murdoch presents truth as a hunter and humanity as the prey. We make our wild attempts to fool Truth, as Jake does all through this delightful and powerful novel, but in the end, Truth triumphs and we are caught \\"under the net\\" like an insect caught for a collection under glass.Great fun, but do be careful. The net is poised over you, just as it is over Jake!"},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"I cannot but think of &quot;Under the Net&quot; and smile and it is for this reason that I'm so endeared to Murdoch's gem of book. The last time I really laughed out loud while reading a novel was Don Delillo's &quot;White Noise&quot;. Behind all the zany situations and comedic characterization is a smart, strangely gratifying take on life. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"The \\"net\\" in the title is language, and to get under it is to find a sort of positivistic truth. Let me intercede here that this novel contains a lot of philosophy, which will leave some readers snowed and disappointed. What I think this book is \\"about\\" is Christian faith. The plot is basically tragicomic, with positive, negative, and neutral events as in real life. But there are certain scenes that are definitely Christian allegories. For example, after Jake, Finn, and Dave go bar hopping, someone has the idea to take a skinny dip in the Thames. The one person who refuses is Dave, the Jewish philosophy professor. Obviously this is a baptism scene... but notice the nuance of antisemitism in the case of Dave. And prior to the dip, in a bar, someone says that the one thing that'll never perish is the Jews. That makes me uncomfortable. What is Murdoch saying? Straying from the present novel, if we look at the devil figure in _A Fairly Honourable Defeat_, Julius that is, he's a survivor of a Jewish concentration camp.A Fairly Honourable Defeat (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics). Murdoch took some heat for that and was put on the defensive...Anyway, the tragicomic plot plus the Christian allegories create a sense of ordinary reality going on while sublimely there is, behind it all, a Christian order.If you just want a good laugh, then skip to the dognapping episode. It had me in stitches. But I take her antisemitism very seriously. The most important thing I learned in college was the HolocaustThe Cunning of History. The humor may seem innocent, but please be aware of certain racist attitudes in this novel."},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"It's always astonishing to me when I'm exposed to a book I would never have picked up, and that's the very reason I have been working my way through the 1001 Books list.In UNDER THE NET Jake Donaghue is a failure of a writer, a bum, a leech on his friends and, despite being an adult, views the world almost as a child does. He never thinks an action through to the consequence, he treats his friendships lightly - taking them for granted or doing stupid, silly things to sabotage them.This book isn't about action and adventure. It's a slow, quietly witty journey through a period in Jake's life. It explores friendships, loves, jobs and heartbreaks. It has quiet humor - in fact, in a way this book reminds me of the few Nick Hornby books I've read (minus the language).Despite being written in the 50's, UNDER THE NET is not dated and it's very easy to relate the story to modern day times. It's a short novel - so if you are worried that a meandering journey might be something that would bore you don't worry... it'll hold your interest and give you a good dose of philosophy to boot."},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"Having recently seen the movie IRIS, which detailed the writers battle with Alzheimer's, I was motivated to read one of her works. Suppossedly she was a novelist/philsopher but,if 'Under the Net' contained any grandiose phillisophical theories, I must have missed them. But I accept the fact that Ms. Murdoch must have been one of the finest minds of her era. I found the novel fast paced and easy to read and the humor, typical of the British, very subtle.It was interseting that a female author would have a male protagonist and narrator. The hero, Jake Donahue, is a frustrated author turned interpretter of foreign novels. He is displaced from his residence by his landlady/lover and,in his attempt to find another place to live, he is reunited with an ex-lover and in the process is re-introduced to several other people from his past.In the midst of Jake's search for his own self worth, he comes into contact with several intersting people in both the world of books and films. In one of the most light hearted episodes, Jake and his cronies, Dave and Finn, manage to kidnap a dog film star and Jake becomes the aging dog's protector. Through his protection of the dog, Jake uncovers in himself a gentler side that he did not know existed.Whether Jake's misfortunes are due to betrayl by his friends or by his own stubborness and laziness is not quite clear. However at the end the reader has the sense that Jake is truly a better person for all his travails."},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"In her novel Under the Net, Iris Murdoch examines the nature of reality through the thoughts and relationships of the novel's main character, Jake Donaghue. A recurring theme in the novel is the idea of reflection, in both senses of the word: Jake is continually thinking about ideas, and he is also forever trying to see himself as he really is. Many of the instances of reflection in the novel occur near rivers or are connected in some way to currents. Under the Net examines the nature of reality through the many reflections in the novel. Iris Murdoch uses these reflections to mirror the true relationships between contingency and non-contingency, between appearance and reality:Events stream past us like these crowds and the face of each is seen only for a moment. What is urgent is not urgent for ever but only ephemerally. All work and all love, the search for wealth and fame, the search for truth, like itself, are made up of moments which pass and become nothing. Yet through this shaft of nothings we drive onward with that miraculous vitality that creates our precarious habitations in the past and the future. So we live; a spirit broods and hovers over the continual death of time, the lost meaning, the unrecaptured moment, the unremembered face, until the final chop that ends all our moments and plunges that spirit back into the void from which it came. (p244)Contingency and non-contingency, like reality and appearance, are mirror images of each other that are interconnected; one cannot exist without the other. Despite the contingency and uncertainty surrounding our everyday reality, we press on as part of the dialogue of life, and Under the Net stands as a fascinating exploration of this uniting of concepts."},{"Title":"Under the Net","review":"The protagonist of this book could be compared to Henry Chinaski in Bukowski's novel Post Office or Sebastian Dangerfield in Donleavy's novel The Ginger Man: all three go from woman to woman, drink too much, and live rather aimless lives. The difference is that this hero, Jake Donahue, is actually a decent human being, albeit somewhat misguided. The novels could be considered similar, also, in that they are all comic (or aim to be) and feature fantastic escapades. The difference is that this novel is actually funny. Very funny, in fact.Jake claims to be a writer, but he actually spends all his writing time translating French novels into English. Ousted from his free lodgings by a lady friend, he goes in search of new digs, and returns to a former love, discovering that maybe he still loves her. But it seems that she has become involved with another old friend of his, Hugh, with whom he had once had grand discussions about philosophy. Jake becomes obsessive about finding Hugh again. The plot from here is complicated, but logical, and comes to a very satisfactory conclusion. It includes laugh-out-loud accounts of the kidnapping of a movie star who happens to be a dog and a fist-fight in a film-set of ancient Rome. All this mayhem seems logical and inevitable, surprisingly.Jake's fault, which he finally realizes, is of \\"having conceived things as I pleased and not as they were.\\"I really enjoyed this book.

Pabongka Rinpoche was a renowned master, teacher to some of the most respected masters of Tibetan Buddhism of our time - Kyabje Trichang Rinpoche (junior tutor to the Dalai Lama and Kyabje Ling Rinpoche (senior tutor of the Dalai Lama and Ribur Rinpoche among others. One could not ask for a better teacher.Drawing upon Lama Tsong Khapa's Great Stages of the Path (Lam Rim Chenmo), Pabongka Rinpoche elucidates all the main topics of meditation with anlaytical rigor and rich anecdotes, all the time, situating and linking his teaching to the vast corpus of the Buddha's teachings.This is a PRACTICE text of the highest calibre and, as such, to truly derive its essence one must try out what Pabongka Rinpoche teaches for himself/herself."},{"Title":"Liberation in the Palm of Your Hand: A Concise Discourse on the Path to Enlightenment (Spiritual Classics)","review":"This book intimidated me at first -- it's so large! And such a long teaching just on Lam Rim? However, the instant I started reading it, I was hooked in, and I've been at it non-stop ever since. I can safely say that no other book has provided me with as many eye-opening realizations as this one. Every few pages strikes a chord in me and helps me to understand on a deeper level the many aspects and facets of Lam Rim.What is Lam Rim? It is &quot;Stages of the Path&quot; -- one of the central kinds of teachings in Tibetan Buddhism. In Buddhism, the goal is enlightenment -- to free oneself from suffering, and to help others free themselves as well. Yet the teachings of the Buddha are so voluminous and complex, that it is difficult for a beginning student to know where to start, what to study, what to practice, in what order, etc. For this reason, the great Indian master Atisha (10th-11th c.AD) composed the first Lam Rim text, which presented the entire path to Buddhahood, leaving nothing out, in a clear way, and in the correct order for practice. Since then, Lam Rim teachings have been central for most Tibetan schools of Buddhism. This systematic and clear approach is not found in most other schools of Buddhism.In Lam Rim, one develops realizations along 3 major stages: Small Scope, Medium Scope, and Great Scope. In the first two, one develops a strong wish to free oneself from present and future sufferings, to achieve a state of total liberation and peace. In the third, one expands this through compassion to wish that all sentient beings may be in this liberated state.Each stage involves contemplating and thinking about a number of different aspects of life and human experience. As one does so, one is almost guaranteed to start to see things more clearly. This will lead to a stronger wish for liberation, a more powerful compassion, and greater wisdom into the nature of reality. Thus, Lam Rim is really essential, especially for those who intend to practice Tantra, since it is like the base and foundation.While there are many texts of Lam Rim, Pabongka Rinpoche's teaching is so direct, so clear, and filled with so many brilliant examples and stories, that it can be ranked among the best. In the Gelukpa school especially, it has become a classic that every student should read at least once. I hope it will benefit you greatly!"},{"Title":"Liberation in the Palm of Your Hand: A Concise Discourse on the Path to Enlightenment (Spiritual Classics)","review":"This is an excellent book, an excellent set of instructions for a serious practicioner of the dharma.

It, forall practical reasons, is our Bible. While reading it, one becomes relaxed and feels at home. It outlines the entire path of the Lam-Rim or the graduated path of enlightenment. PabonkaRinpoche gave a famous twenty-four day discourse on the teachingsof the Buddha. These talks were translated by Trijang Rinpoche,the tutor of His Holiness. Finally, it was translated into English by Michael Richards. This book is a masterpiece. Each page fills the soul and heart with happiness and love. The illustrations are just marvelous. A couple caveats are in order before you buy this marvelous book. First, please understand that, despite what a few Occidental iconoclasts believe, TibetanBuddhism flatly espouses a belief in cyclical existence. That at death, unless we have lived a life of firm morality and generosity, the mindstream can spin out of control and just about be reborn in any lifeform. In Tibetan Buddhism, this is a given. Secondly, is the belief in sin. The belief that if weharm others, the arrow comes back at us. And this karma is expandable. Yes. Bad things do happen to good people.With these two understandings under your belt, buy and enjoy.The vision which Pabonka Rinpoche gives us may seem horrible. Nevertheless, it may be true.

In the book, the motivations have been abbreviated in favor of new material, but the remarkable first chapter, Day One, is both an elaborate motivation and an excellent glance meditation on the entire Lim-rim. In a sense, the rest of the book is a commentary on this chapter. As Pabongka Rinpoche makes clear throughout, dedicating ourselves to the development of bodhichitta is the most meaningful way of directing our lives, and the graded realizations in Day One lead us to that goal. At the end of the book, Pabongka Rinpoche says, \\"Practice whatever you can, so that my teachings will not have been in vain...But above all, make bodhichitta your main practice.\\"These teachings contain much that is new and unfamiliar, especially for Westerners, but as with any meaningful pursuit, study, reflection and practicing these teachings in our everyday lives, will lead to clarity and understanding."},{"Title":"Liberation in the Palm of Your Hand: A Concise Discourse on the Path to Enlightenment (Spiritual Classics)","review":"Although a bit daunting at first appearance, \\"Liberation\\" is an important book, recorded from important teachings.

It is most unfortunate that the author did not live to see it's publication and receive the recognition he deserved for this fine book."},{"Title":"Homeward Bound","review":"I bought this book as a result of doing some family history research. I found the war diary of my great great grandfather's regiment, but it raised many questions about how he got home from Raleigh, NC where he was late in April, 1865 to Minnesota in mid-July. My professional historian husband wanted to know: how DID the Federal Government in 1865 disband the largest citizen-soldier army ever to have existed up until that time? I'd never thought of that question, nor the fact that up until then no government had tried. Also, how did the Confederate soldiers get home?This book is the result of a labor of love compiled from a life-time of research, and was published after his death by the author's friends. It is a fitting monument to the author's painstaking and careful research and scholarly interests, and is well-written and thorough. The way in which the Federal Government organized the demobilization in 1865-6 set the pattern for all later American citizen-soldier wars: World Wars 1 and 2 and other conflicts involving large numbers of non-professional military personnel. That the men got home, got paid, got pensions when needed, was all due to the careful way in which those who organized this demobilization proceeded within the context of a war-torn landscape and badly disrupted infrastructure. If you are interested in the Civil War, you should be aware of this last and final phase of the war. If you want to find out how anything so massive is organized on a rational basis, then you need to read this. (Perhaps a good read for today's project managers!) And, if you want to find out what happened on an individual and unit level, this will also prove helpful (as it did for me). There is much of human interest here, and this is a valuable source for any Civil War buff or any family historian whose ancestors were caught up in either side of this conflict."},{"Title":"Homeward Bound","review":"I purchased this book some time ago, with great anticipation, yet was somewhat disappointed. Oddly, the whole tale is outlined in the excerpt printed on the back cover! Johnny Reb was pretty much on his own, while the Northern troops had the advantages of the railways, and other means of transportation at their disposal. That is pretty much it! Granted, the late Fr. Holberton offers many &quot;eye-witness&quot; accounts of the trials and travails of the wanderings of both Federal and Confederate soldiers, yet even these become repetitive in their sameness.On a more structural note, the format offers relatively big print, and only 150 pages of readable text."},{"Title":"Homeward Bound","review":"I'll admit I find books such as these appealing, for the writers (in this case deceased before publication) are assembling information from lifelong passionate study, in this case, the American Civil War.This topic is long neglected--the demobilization of the Armies. One would think that the period between Appomatox and the official end of Reconstruction was one of relative non-events...yet on personal levels, from which William Holberton draws, it was a period of passion and uncertainty that we would hardly bear quietly today.During this time, however, was laid the blueprints for many current political issues--political correctness, repatriations to victims of slavery, the development of the Southern Heritage movement in various forms, and regionalization of the South which would last another 140-plus years.As an example, hear the yearnings of a member of the 56th U.S. Colored Infantry Regiment, bound to return to the border state of Missouri...\\"There has severl redgements who enlisted one year after we did mustered out and gone home. We stood on the bank and she teers to think that we who had batled for our country over two years should still be retaineed and deprived of the privilege of seeing those who are so sear to us\\" (p. 139). This, from a man who came from those whom sociologists only recently learned had \\"family units\\" and loyaltie that would make a modern divorce lawyer wince.And consider the many who died of disease AFTER the war, or the Ohioans in occupation who were camped south of New Orleans, only to fight alligators, polluted waters, only to move on to the occupation of Texas, an even more formidable assignment, many dying daily of dysentery and like illnesses.My only criticism of this book would be the relative lack of documentation of Confederate demobilization--not surprising, given the manner in which Confederate veterans were treated. Unfortunately, Lincoln's \\"with malice toward none...with charity for all\\" dictum was not held in wide esteem or knowledge. The country today would be better for recognition that Confederates (often black or African-American, Jewish, or members of some other \\"minority\\" were fighting as Cicero said, \\"Pro Aris et Pro Focis\\" (for home and hearth) against an invasion, as much as for political beliefs.A volume beloning in any Civil War historian or student's library."},{"Title":"From Atalanta to Zeus: Readers Theatre from Greek Mythology","review":"If you are teaching Greek Mythology, this is the book for you. the book includes everything from a pronunciation guide to delivery and costumes suggestions.

If you want great fiction, look elsewhere, but like I've said in other reviews, if you're wanting a good time to imagine somewhere else...this series is a good bit of fun.That being said, it's also worth noting I've been a fan of the Battletech/Mechwarrior universe since the 1980's. While I sympathize with some of the reviewers here, I respectfully disagree. Having a long series one exciting battle after another is fun, but if you want a series of books to last beyond five or ten books, you sometimes have to build more background, which isn't always going to be done in the most exciting manner.As one reviewer noted, members of the clans are almost alien. While much attention has been given to their reasons for fighting and their skill at doing just that, why they think and do things differently than other humans just hasn't really been well developed. This book aims to change that, by taking one individual clan member, and showing us his upbringing, his thoughts, his struggles. In fact, by showing us the \\"heretic,\\" it gives us a much better view of the psyche of a clanner. One of the chief themes of the book is a universal one, \\"what is my role in the universe.\\" It's one of those things that almost everyone goes through at some point, but the point of this book is that those in the clans rarely if ever doubt their role. The book not only tells us this, but shows us why by exploring the childhood of those in the clans and interactions between adult members.In fact, looking at the series as a whole, it's surprising that there are children at all in the Battletech/Mechwarrior universe, as they are so rarely seen.Why four stars? Well, the book was enjoyable and well written (but with the editorial errors as noted, so minus one star), but more importantly it's given me more insight into the entire universe, so after this book I'll enjoy seeing clans more, and Nova Cats in particular. As a member of the military in real life, knowing why people fight is important to me. It will be fun when they go back to their epic battles, but now I'll care just a little bit more since I have a better appreciation for why. That difference is worth four stars any day."},{"Title":"Mechwarrior: Dark Age #17: Heretic's Faith (A BattleTech Novel)","review":"In HERETIC'S FAITH, Randall Bills's second MECHWARRIOR: DARK AGE novel, Bills continues to explore some of the less-important factions in the current setting. Previously, he brought us a look at live in Clan Sea Fox; in FAITH, he returns to the subject of his first BATTLETECH novel, Clan Nova Cat.FAITH follows up on the events of DAUGHTER OF THE DRAGON, the previous book in the series. Katana Tomark, a newly-made Kuritan warlord, decides to recruit the Spirit Cats in order to supplement her rather woeful forces. This sets Kisho, Nova Cat mystic and the titular heretic, down a path of reconciliation.It's tempting to compare FAITH to DAUGHTER. Both are character-driven novels, by authors who like to get the readers into the characters' minds. But it's hard to do so fairly; DAUGHTER focuses on two characters who are all too human. Kisho, as a Clanner, is for all intents and purposes an alien.FAITH was an enjoyable read. However, the book didn't so much end as it did stop. Kisho's personal journey reaches a turning point, one that would have made a good end; however, the plot isn't actually resolved. Threads are left hanging, and it's stated that Kisho will be involved--but we're left there.In the end, Bills leaves the reader wanting more, and not necessarily in a good way. But that doesn't detract from the fact that it's an excellent character piece well worth reading."},{"Title":"Mechwarrior: Dark Age #17: Heretic's Faith (A BattleTech Novel)","review":"If you read the BACK COVER of the book, there is a spoiler that the author didn't spill the beans on until the last twenty pages. Shame on whomever wrote the back cover copy. Also, they should have checked the dates involved. DECADES ago, Minoru Kurita joined the Nova Cats, not centuries. That should have been caught by some editor.All that said however, this was a really good book. I have no problems recommending it to others."},{"Title":"Mechwarrior: Dark Age #17: Heretic's Faith (A BattleTech Novel)","review":"I've been waiting for more background and updates on the current activities of the Nova Cats and the Spirit Cats, and this story elaborates on these factions with a fair amount of detail. The story focuses on Kisho Nova Cat, a mystic that was introduced in \\"Sword of Sedition\\". After throwing \\"Daughter of the Dragon\\" in the trash, where it belonged, this book was a pleasant surprise to me. The author goes a little overboard on the inner turmoil content, pushing Kisho's behavior slightly beyond believable. However, the story and action provided enough of a foundation to keep my interest. Although not blatantly pornographic, like \\"Daughter\\", there is one subtle sex scene that spans chapter 7, so parents, be forewarned. The author aparently also has permission to kill off a couple well-known characters from the MechWarrior miniatures universe. I was very dissapointed in the pointless way they were eliminated. I'm worriedly holding out hope that WizKids and their authors will reveal some actual purpose for these executions, other than to just eliminate factions in their game.This book does a nice job of illustrating the nobility and pride of the Nova and Spirit Cats, while also exposing the conflicting nature of their eugenics program; the brutally harsh system that the Nova Cats have swathed in a semi-religious belief system. Although not as good as Loren Coleman's books, or \\"Target of Opportunity\\", this is a good read, especially for those interested in the status of the Nova Cats and Spirit Cats."},{"Title":"Mechwarrior: Dark Age #17: Heretic's Faith (A BattleTech Novel)","review":"The back cover spoiler was QUITE annoying, as I always read the jacket/cover stuff.I like Randall's previous works, but this one was a little too light and fluffy for me. Not enough battle is not always a problem, but since there wasn't much else going on, it definitely showed.I was intrigued by the mystic concept, but ultimately I feel let down. This was the first time in all the Dark Age books (or any Btech book for that matter... ) I just couldn't seem to latch on to the story...Note that the interludes were interesting, and did give some unique insights which I liked... but the \\"breadcrumb\\"ing of the past is only going to work for so long... :)"},{"Title":"Mechwarrior: Dark Age #17: Heretic's Faith (A BattleTech Novel)","review":"This book hits bottom barrel.

I've followed battletech books since I was a kid, and have basically bought and read every battletech novel since the Sword and the Dagger.Heretic's Faith was convoluted, lacking direction, and left one very unsatisfied with the rather unclimatic end. While there was the nice touch of Minoru Kurita, I think Bills over-reached in this attempt, which resulted in a pretty un-battletech-like book. No good combat sequences, glimpses but no decent overview of the political and strategic objectives and success of the involved powers, and a disappearance from the clean-cut technological warfare that raises battletech above the other sci-fi and fantasy books out there.All of Bills' published battletech work prior to this has been pretty good and hopefully we can return to that in his next novel."},{"Title":"Mechwarrior: Dark Age #17: Heretic's Faith (A BattleTech Novel)","review":"At one time I looked forward to the release of a new Battletech novel. The writing was, for the most part, enjoyable and the stories were, again for the most part, exciting.Then came Mechwarrior Dark Age.I really tried, tried hard to enjoy these books. But each one got progressively worse. The plots, such as they were, became more banal and dull.Heretic's Faith tries very hard to break the pattern. But, it fails on almost every attempt. By the midpoint of the book, you'll have figured out the ending. By the ending you'll be wishing that you ordered something else. Surrounded by fanboiz and sycophants the current authors fail to realise one important fact:The magic is gone, and they have no idea how to get it back.Go buy some of the Original Battletech novels."},{"Title":"Blondes Have More Felons (December Vaughn Mysteries)","review":"Alesia Holliday's \\"Blondes Have More Felons\\" is a well-crafted novel with hilarious characters that you wouldn't mind meeting and spending a little time with.

I mean, you gotta love a guy who says \\"he ain't been the same since that testicle problem--Man's got half his left nut missing and it drove him insane\\"! This book is fast-paced with lots of thrills and chills throughout as we follow every twist and turn of this crazy case in which December Vaughn, attorney at law, finds herself embroiled. This book sets the stage for a series so we are introduced to several characters that will play key roles in the books to follow. I found these people to be warm and funny and believable and I was drawn into their lives and found myself wanting to know more about them. Everyone has a story to tell and Ms. Holliday has her work cut out for her in the coming years finding out what those stories are!One of the things that I like the most about Ms. Holliday's writing is that her books are pretty PG--I can let my daughters, who are 12 and 14, read these books without worrying about the content being \\"too adult\\" for them! I'm not saying I don't care for erotica, but it is refreshing to come across an author who knows how to tease without being obvious and can carry the story without having to resort to steamy sex scenes to draw readers in. There is plenty of sexual tension, don't get me wrong, but it is tastefully done and instead of leaving the reader unfulfilled it makes you scream for more! The mystery was tight and well thought out, the plot made sense, and I'm pretty sure that I learned something about how pharmaceutical companies AND law firms function, so it was educational as well! (AND there's a REALLY cute dog in the story, so all the bases were covered!)I am really excited about this new series. I believe Ms. Holliday is going to be a huge name in fiction, whether it is romance, chicklit, or mystery. I have read everything she has written in these categories so far and she hasn't disappointed me yet!

I've gotten to the point where if the main character in a book I'm reading runs five miles every day before work, goes to the gym every night, never eats and seems to survive on cocktails and mineral water, I'm too annoyed to enjoy the story. That isn't the case in this book!

Readers of previous books in the Madonna Key series will remember Dr. Moon, the infamous art thief plaguing Europe. This is her story...Aubrey was forced in to a life of crime by the Adriano family, due to circumstances beyond her control. She even had to give up her beloved daughter so the young girl would be protected and safe from the evil Italian family determined to use Aubrey for their own personal gain.Aubrey's life takes a fantastical bend though when she of forced to steal an ancient manuscript, believed to be from the pen of Joan of Arc herself. The discovery of this document, and the secrets found within, reveal a destiny Aubrey never knew she had. Now she is on the run, with only Eric Cabordes to assist her. He is the personal bodyguard to the Adriano heir, but shockingly Dark Revelations lead him on a new path. If only he and Aubrey could find time to explore the intense feelings between them.The third book in the Madonna Key series reveals even more secrets about the mysterious and near mythical Black Madonnas. It also shows the expansion of the nefarious plot a small sect of men have to permanently bury the legend of the Madonnas and the women who worshipped them. Time is of the essence for the Marians to win this war.One thing I love is how each book delves deeper in to the past, crossing the centuries backwards, to reveal the story of the Marians, the protectors of the Madonnas. We've visited the 18th century, the 17th century, and now the 15th century in successive books, as we learn more about the women from whom Aubrey is descended. In this chapter of the saga, we discover one unique spin on the story of Joan of Arc.Romance, though most definitely present between Aubrey and Eric, plays a lesser role in this story, but is still key to the plot. The focus here is on Aubrey, as she comes to terms with her past, and strives to protect her future. Readers will cheer her on to the resolution of her dramatic life. Eric's story is important too however, as we see his acceptance of Aubrey and what she stands for, even if it's in direct opposition to what duty asks of him.In a departure from her usual works, author Lorna Tedder has written a fascinating story in Dark Revelations that is more than up to the expectations of Madonna Key followers. She knows just the right recipe for a good romance/adventure novel. I hope to see more works by this talented author in the future.Kelley A. Hartsell, August 2006.

However, the family patriarch refuses to free the notorious Aubrey de Lune jewel thief, somewhat out of an obsession, but also because she could cripple the gang if the authorities learn who she is. Besides, the bottom line is no one leaves his Family.The Family asks her to perform one last job for them with bodyguard Eric Cabordes at her side; she assumes as a babysitter. However, she soon finds out that the object she is purloining is worth a lot more than just money if it ends up in the wrong hands. She turns to Eric in a desperate move to keep the Adriano Family from stepping closer to obtaining the Madonna Key.Ginny makes the action-packed thriller work as she struggles between doing the right thing and the demands of her \\"employer\\" in the latest stand alone yet interrelated Madonna Key tale (see HAUNTED ECHOS). The fast-paced story line never allows the audience to catch their breath as she and her new cohort try to remain one step ahead of their former employer. With its Joan of Arc connection already making DARK REVELATIONS fascinating, part of the delight of this fine romantic suspense is the heroine's turmoil as to whether she should trust the bodyguard who she is falling in love with. Lorna Tedder adds a strong thriller to this fine miniseries.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dark Revelations","review":"One last job... Dr. Ginny Moon intends to retire after one last assignment for the Adriano family. She is tired of the secret life that forced her to give up her identity as Aubrey de Lune. Ginny doesn't realize that her \\"last job\\" for the Adriano family is a manuscript that could devastate all that the Marians have worked for. Will the Adriano family truly let their best art thief go so easily? And just why is Ginny so important to the Adriano family anyway?DARK REVELATIONS is yet another installment in the fascinating Madonna Key series. Lorna Tedder has written a story that truly addresses the heart of a mother and what she is willing to sacrifice for her child. Ginny isn't always a sympathetic character as an art thief is a bit difficult for most people to identify with. But her love for her daughter shines through very clearly and helps soften her. I did find her seeming ignorance over the entire Joan of Arc issue surprising, but some history is provided later in the novel that helps explain this to at least some degree of satisfaction.DARK REVELATIONS is very action oriented. As with many Bombshell stories, the strength of the heroine is key to the story and Ginny certainly proves herself to be strong. Her relationship with Eric Cabordes is only a secondary part of the story but is sure to satisfy romance readers with the devotion seen between these two.

The story of how father and son struggle together to make their difference engine a profitable invention is incredibly interesteting both in a technical and economical aspect but also in a social aspect.

He is now belatedly well known. Considered to have built the first computer. Though it was never fully functional. But what Lindgren has uncovered is that around the same time, Muller and the Sheutzs in Sweden were trying roughly the same approach, independently of Babbage.Both sides hit upon the idea of replacing a human with automated machinery, in a programmable fashion. The Swedes also seemed to have within themselves the equivalent talent of Ada Lovelace, in being able to devise software.But both groups failed within their lifetimes. A bridge too far. At best, their efforts were seen as intellectual curiosities by their contemporaries. If anything, this research by Lindgren reinforces a common conclusion about Babbage's work. The Swedes' efforts can be seen roughly as a parallel experiment to Babbage. His failure is considered by us [20th-21st centuries] to be due to the primitive technology that he had to start with. The failure of the Swedes to commercialise their work suggests that it wasn't Babbage's fault that he failed. Or theirs that they failed.It would be 90 years later, before economically viable machines could be made."},{"Title":"Customers As Partners: Building Relationships That Last","review":"Chip R. Bell combines the practical with the heartfelt in a top-notch guide to creating a partnership with customers. He focuses on the elements of abundance, trust, dreams, truth, balance, and grace. The book uses intelligent and creative case histories and anecdotes to illustrate these essential components and, therefore, rises above the level of the basic how-to. The author pays close attention to intangible, human relationship concerns. The book is written well in an intimate, yet highly informative style. It weaves stories throughout each chapter. Although we at getAbstract recommend this book for people who deal directly with customers and people who supervise, manage, or lead others in a service-oriented business, the author correctly points out that the book's methods also can enhance anyone's professional and personal relationships."},{"Title":"Customers As Partners: Building Relationships That Last","review":"Chip Bell takes the idea of customer service one step further -- make your customers &quot;partners&quot;.

You won't find any quality jorgon or terminology here... just plain english thats easy to read in one sitting. Definately a five-star book. Be sure to buy more than one copy if you intend to lend it to a friend because you won't see it again."},{"Title":"Customers As Partners: Building Relationships That Last","review":"Ten years ago, I bought multiple copies of this book based on the recommendation of a good friend. I have subsequently given all of them away to customers, friends, and associates to help them understand how I wanted to run my company. I have subsequently sold the company and retired. This book is one of a kind. Mr. Bell gives examples of how to treat customers as partners, and it works. The person who bought my company did not follow the principles of this book and has subsequently spiraled downward because he focused on things other than customer needs and desires. My utmost gratitude to Chip Bell for taking the bold step to write this book. Thank you."},{"Title":"By what authority?","review":"i liked the novel for its historical connection to 16th century English history and its portrayal of martyrdom in that period.

With Whitman this is complicated by the 1855 LEAVES OF GRASS with the 1891-92 LEAVES OF GRASS. Many prefer the 1855 version of \\"Song of Myself.\\" This collection uses the 1891-92 versions of the poems. I will confess that I prefer the later versions in almost every instance. For instance, I much prefer the later version of the accounting of the John Paul Jones victory over the British in \\"Song of Myself\\" XXXV.The poems that I particularly regretted not being included in this are \\"Song of the Open Road\\" and \\"When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer.\\" There are others, but those are two I often read. But to be fair, most of Whitman's great work is contained in two poems, the magisterial \\"Song of Myself\\" and the passionate \\"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry.\\" I've never warmed up to such old chestnuts as \\"I Hear America Singing\\" and \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd,\\" but I can and have read \\"Song of Myself\\" and \\"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry\\" countless times. In fact, the reason I wanted a highly portable, but attractive edition of Whitman's poems was so that I could carry it about with me. One of the few books that I've come very close to wearing out (and I treat my books with great care) is the Library of America edition of Whitman's poetry and prose. But it simply doesn't fit into a messenger bag. This lovely little Everyman edition does.So while this slender little volume doesn't quite have my ideal collection of Whitman's poems, it does at least have the most essential. And the book itself is lovely and inviting. I heartily recommend it to anyone desiring a choice selection of Whitman's poetry to carry with them either into the woods or onto a commuter train."},{"Title":"Infatuation (Arabesque)","review":"Sonia's latest book is excellant.

As most of us when reading these romance novels we like a little twist and turn with romance and suspense. This book offers both and actually the author does not wait to start this book moving.At the first chapter, both the heroine and the hero have their first encounter at the hero's (Wade O. Beresford) office of Bribe Magazine where Wade is the owner of this tabloid-type magazine. Heroine, Desney Westbourne is one of the daytime soap's top stars. The author does an extreme excellent job of how she allows each chapter to illustrate the relationship that builds between Wade and Desney.Now, we also like some enhancements to our romance stories, well this book offers, lies, deceit, betrayal, attempted murder, assualt and who-done-it parts that lead to shall I say, interesting twists and surprises.This is one of those &quot;All-Nighter&quot; books that you just want to read one more chapter before you turn the lights out. I encourage those to read this book, I feel you will enjoy it and be just as surprised as I was at some of those secondary characters.Thanks Sonia, for an enjoyable book to read.

She ended up completely well without any deficit and continues to teach as does he. Well I decided to go to paramedic school to get my foot in the door of the medical profession, which was totally unrelated to the incident in class because I layed out that morning and didnt really get to see any of the action. while attending paramedic school I went to a bio lab back at the old college to grab some supplies. While talking to another professor about my new career plans he told me about Dr. shapiros work in NY and his book, and filled me in on the fact that he was the \\"one\\" that came in and helped save the other said professor.

This is inexcusable, as the book gives the exact same formulae as for ellipses, i.e., (x/a)^2 + (y/b)^2, rather than the correct formulae which are more like (x/a)^2 - (y/b)^2 (note the \\"minus\\" sign, which is critical).Sample text, question #27 at page 217, there is no correct answer.

There are determinants with three values instead of four. Numbers are sometimes in the wrong place.While I agree with the authors there aren't a lot of shortcuts to this exam, I wish that they did point out some more effective means to solve a problem. For example on limits, they don't show you L'Hospital's rule. While this is a topic typically covered in Calculus there is no reason not to remind students who may be taking Calculus in their senior year about how they can use differentiation to save time on this exam.One thing that rather peeved me was the section on \\"invented operations.\\" I will admit that it has been several years since I took the SAT II Math IIC, but in the two times I took the exam I never remember seeing problems with \\"invented operations.\\" Neither the official College Board guide for this exam nor any of the other major test prep books seem to mention this as part of the exam so either it isn't really on the exam or it is so rare as to be of questionable value to review.While I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this book for the math review specifically there is one redeeming value for this book: the exams. Most of the competing test prep books are a few dollars more, but typically have six exams compared to the eight exams in this book.

His description of three generations of Waughs makes for riveting reading. How fun to read letters across the century between the fathers and sons of one of the most illustrious literary families in English letters. We Americans know Evelyn best, but Alexander's descriptions of his father,Auberon, convince me that he has been wrongfully neglected on this side of the Atlantic. Waugh clearly was the genius of the dynasty. His relationship with his father is heart-breaking and wonderfully drawn by the grand-son, a brilliant stylist and clever wit. His close reading of his grand-father's famous novels provides useful insights into the creation of these novels, which remain in print after making best-seller lists more than 50 years ago. One Waugh, one would think, would be more than enough, but here we learn the English language world has been graced with at least four: Arthur, Evelyn, Auberon, and Alexander. How delicious."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"This collective biography spans about six generations responsible for, one from the fifth generation tells us, about 180 books-- quite an average. Alexander's narrative depicts The Brute, muttonchopped patriarch from the 1860s; Arthur, Pickwickian declaimer; Evelyn & Alec, one funny, one feckless, both novelists, bon vivants, and diligent scribblers; Auberon (\\"Bron\\"), satirist whose entries for the Daily Telegraph & Private Eye I'd always heard of but never before (given their London provenance) had the chance to sample-- in his son's excerpts here; Alexander, who never seems to have been called as such ever by Bron. \\"For the first eight or ten years of my life I was addressed simply as 'Fat Fool'.\\" (422) It's that kind of relationship; the book concludes gracefully if ruefully with the newest father's glance at his next generation. Alexander, as I must call him for clarity's sake in a book with three Brons and a He-Evelyn & She-Evelyn, delves into the correspondence, rumors, anecdotes, novels, journalism, and gossip that makes up about a century and a half of alternately engrossing and trivial material.Rather than the Delphic oracular injunction to \\"know thyself,\\" Alexander avers this on the lowered level of the teenaged \\"I need to discover the real me.\\" He counters: \\"Perhaps 'O Man, know thine ancestors' would be a more useful motto for the modern egotist to pin on his puffed lapel. For the key to his identity, if such a thing even exists, will be found to lie not where he instinctively looks for it in the mirror-glass in front, but furtively concealed all about the hedgerows and borders of the long, twisting, dusty road behind.\\" (19)Why focus on the fathers and sons? That's where the bulk of the literary material lies, and the reason for \\"Wavian\\" renown, envy, backlash, and retribution. Michael Dirnda's review posted on Amazon recounts the episode of Bron's Cypriot machine gun gone awry, and this could have been lifted from a novel by Evelyn, his father. Alexander's best when he shows precisely how real life overlapped with Evelyn, Alec, Arthur, and Bron's own writing, and how they all used extraordinary wit (at their best at least; all wrote so much that inevitably standards slipped) to illuminate in fiction and essays their own foibles and those of their fathers. This pattern, as the son reflects late on in this family history, presents fascination and difficulty.\\"A father may have many children to add to his many concerns but a son has only one father, the 'august creator of his being', who chooses where he lives, where he goes to school, what he might find funny and, to a certain extent, what he thinks. Fathers are more important than sons, and therein lies the problem.\\" (418) The gist of this lengthy book, filled with letters back and forth between the generations as they snipe, nudge, and snicker with each other, is that in such a chain of progenitors and offspring may not lie conventionally false notions of affection for children-- in all their boredom, annoying habits, and demands to Be Taken Seriously. Instead, refreshingly, each father W. appears to-- as documented closely here-- have detested and escaped from his snivelling progeny whenever possible, and for this, in time if decades later, the son loved the father. Such honesty, as Alexander and his father show, eviscerates sentiment. It attacks maudlin convention of how parenthood should be celebrated, and this remains the lasting message I take from this book.But I'd be remiss to say, without giving away the best parts of this narrative, that for all the longueurs, for all the endless moaning about headmasters and contracts and affairs and alcohol that occupy so much of the content of the letters and the recollections-- that considerable learning, outrageous incidents, and genuine humor at the foibles of our fallen human condition provide the essence of this study. Evelyn and Bron sigh eloquently, in frustration at the pablum that the nanny state thinks we need for nourishment in ever more philistine times.Not all is either stultifying correspondence, insider family lore, or dutiful corroboration or refutation of allegations whispered or thundered for decades against the Waughs. The contents are stuffed full of epistolary invective, and it's probably difficult for Alexander, having to set the record straight and add his many askew angles to what's been printed and promulgated about his family, to edit the wealth of primary sources he presents, sifts, and challenges. The book may suffer in readability for those of us not as enamored of or as intimately related to Waviana. Still, this is a forgivable fault and a welcome one, given the access Alexander offers for those who immerse themselves in his in-depth presentation of Alec, Arthur, and his own father.By contrast, the more familiar Evelyn recedes, and we see him more as one integrating his father, Arthur, into such works as \\"A Handful of Dust\\" so memorably. Evelyn's more personally presented to us, and less of his works or public life, such as it was, gains scrutiny here. The book, for me, gains poignancy in the later years of Evelyn and the maturity of Bron; this allows Alexander more space to consider his own entry then onto this crowded dais of literary predecessors. His emphasis is on the personal side of Evelyn, his grandfather, as he signed to Bron \\"yours affec. E.W.\\"Bron comments on Evelyn after his death that \\"politics bored him. His interest was confined to resentment at seeing his earnings redistributed among people who were judged more worthy to spend them than he.\\" (qtd. 424) This typifies an ethical, yet bitter, sense of withheld fairness amidst what Evelyn lamented as the \\"abominable difficulty of human relations.\\" Bron credited Evelyn's removal of all his teeth without anesthetic as improving his disposition in old age; Evelyn in turn had followed Arthur's venerable example. Such relationships, then obliquely reflected by Bron with Alexander, as had Evelyn & Alec's with Arthur, sets up a hall of mirrors. The later father and son characterize themselves as \\"liberal anarchists,\\" fed up with a notion of prosperity that insists only on materialism and gadgets. (Although I did marvel at Bron's ability \\"without gainful employment\\" at 24 when fathering Alexander \\"near Treviso in Italy at the house of a one-eared Arabist called Dame Freya Stark\\" to \\"employ a daily help, a French maid and a maternity nurse.\\" (422-23) Money did seem to afford handsome estates, lengthy trips abroad, boarding schools and Oxford, and lots of fine wine on what appeared to me vanishingly little visible means of income. This may be my American sensibility, unaccustomed to how the other half lives.Alexander on Bron: \\"He, too, used his writing to free himself from the irritations of life and the problems of human existence.\\" (430) The whole refusal to kow-tow to the demands of children, while delighting in the pursuit of one's own selfish pursuits, certainly runs against the prevailing philosophy of our age. Somehow, the Waughs managed to produce the children they deserved, I suppose. This all reminds me of an observation by Borges: both mirrors and procreation are abominable, for they reproduce the human figure without reason.Bron emerges as a match for Evelyn when it comes to insight beyond the family's eccentricities and social shenanigans. As Evelyn became discouraged by the post-Vatican II Church, so did his son. After attending services that Bron realized \\"would be completely unrecognisable to him, that the new religion had nothing whatever to do with the church to which he had pledged his loyalty,\\" Bron \\"felt I could distance myself.\\" Wisdom follows: \\"Whatever central trut survives lies outside the modern church, buried in the historical awareness of individual members. Or so it seems to me. But whenever I have doubts, it is my father's fury rather than divine retribution which I dread.\\" (435)Bron's son follows suit. He titles a recent book \\"God,\\" yet asserts that the loss of a True Faith (as Evelyn famously displayed) may be simply proof that the zeal of the convert's rarely hereditary. Decline & Fall repeats each generation on the Waugh's domestic stage. \\"The English show their hatred for children by dressing them in anoraks and romper suits, stuffing them with sweets, refusing to talk to them and sending them out of doors whenever possible in the pathetic hope that someone will murder them.\\" (qtd. 437) The clumsy love of father for son, and the half-shameful, half-affectionate fumble of emotions, moves through many letters quoted here, if to often unintentionally comic rather than the usually desired risible or denunciatory effects.A couple of examples must suffice. Arthur wrote to teenaged Alec off at school, in May, 1914 about the sin of self-abuse. \\"It is an awful thought that someday you might take to a poor girl's arms a body that will avenge its own indulgences upon children yet unborn.\\" The letter goes on, by the way, for probably over fifteen hundred words, and is printed in its entirety. I do doubt the assertions in one footnote Alexander adds, however, so I must append it too for the sake of transparency: \\"Masturbation was not considered unhealthy until 1710 when John Martens, a quack doctor and pornographer, proclaimed it as such in a book called &lt;em>Onania&lt;/em>. Marten's fortune derived from the medicine sold in conjunction with his book. The Church did not consider masturbation a sin, or indeed link it to Onan's behaviour in Genesis, until after the publication of &lt;em>Onania&lt;/em>.\\" (63) Certainly a topic needing hands-on research?There's much of this sort of skewed erudition here from all Wavian contributors. I leave to you to burrow out the derivation of Crutwellism, to hearsay regarding Oxonian \\"dog sodomy,\\" Evelyn's providing rabbits with a deadly glass of Christmas cheer, and his wife Laura's fate when she fails to get rid of rotten fruit. You'll find which Waugh died with a turd near his corpse, which one provided inspiration for both Island Records and the cocktail party, which one became Colonel Gaddafi's favorite author, and which one was depicted in a moralizing portrait, \\"Dr Waugh and the Perverse Pupil.\\" Not to forget such sentences as this, concerning \\"an ethnic guitar\\" which Alexander's brother Nat brings back from South America \\"as a present for his mother-in-law\\" that \\"contained chagas larvae, which hatched unto beetles, crawled out of the instrument, killed the dog and rendered his mother-in-law insane.\\" (443)"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons","review":"Boy, what a tangled bunch of father/son relationships!

I believe my 5.5 out of a possible 6 on the essays is due to the tips in this book. It is short but to the point. You may need more than a week to absorb the math if you are out of practice. Also, it can not make up for a lack of vocabulary."},{"Title":"Crash Course for the GRE, Second Edition (Graduate School Test Preparation)","review":"I decided to apply to graduate school on October 31. I had to take the GRE really soon to meet the application deadlines, and since I registered at the last minute the best test date I could get was November 25. That gave me less than one month to prepare! I went shopping for test preparation materials and one of the books I found was &quot;Crash Course for the GRE.&quot; That seemed perfect for my needs. The book is organized around the &quot;ten steps to the GRE,&quot; basically one step for each type of question to be found on the test. I found the steps for the verbal section of the GRE (analogies, sentence completion, antonyms, and reading comprehension) to be extremely practical and I got a score I was quite pleased with. However, the strategies for the math section (numbers/vocabulary, figures, equations I/estimating, and equations II/plugging in) were less effective for me and I decided to take the test a second time (I contacted the schools to which I was applying to request that they accept a second set of late GRE scores). The tips for the analytical writing section (issue essay and argument essay) were helpful, as was the general information on the GRE.I highly recommend this book for an overview of the GRE, for general GRE test taking strategies, and for its test taking strategies for the verbal section. The math strategies might be helpful if you are really weak in math, but I suggest supplementing the Crash Course with another book (I used &quot;GRE Exam 2004&quot; by Kaplan). Also, I used &quot;Word Smart for the GRE&quot; to help with vocabulary. Note that the Crash Course has practice problems but it does not provide any sample tests; you should download the free POWERPREP software from the GRE Web site, and you may want to get a book with sample tests (such as &quot;GRE Exam 2004&quot;). But if you only have time for one GRE test preparation book, I'd recommend the Crash Course."},{"Title":"Crash Course for the GRE, Second Edition (Graduate School Test Preparation)","review":"This is a great book to browse through right before you try tackling other long winded GRE references. It very effectively summarises study tips. Additional practice material is definitely needed though. The book does not provide word or root lists to help with the verbal section. Use this only to get a quick overview of the GRE, or for even quicker study tips."},{"Title":"Crash Course for the GRE, Second Edition (Graduate School Test Preparation)","review":"This book was short, easy to follow and to the point. It gave VERY practical advise for the format of the GRE exam as well as some sample practice problems. I used it as my only preparation source, except for some sample vocab lists from the web, and I did very well on the exam. (If I remember right I got somewhere between 960-1000.) This book is an excellent help for someone who doesn't have alot of free time to be messing around with loooong review books. Definitely worth the money."},{"Title":"Crash Course for the GRE, Second Edition (Graduate School Test Preparation)","review":"I decided to apply to graduate school three weeks before the application deadline and did an utter crash course in the GREs. With no time to enroll in a test prep class, I picked this book up on a whim with one other. This book was immensely helpful in raising my math and essay skills before the big test. The tips on what they looked for in essays was really helpful in letting me wrap my head around how to really answer the essays. The tips on how to think quickly through the math questions worked well with me and helped my scores go from the 670 to 730 range. My verbal scores turned out so-so, but you can't build a solid vocabulary in three weeks.I highly recommend that anyone use this book in tandem with another test book that has lots of practice tests on paper and online. Combining this with the free GRE tests online will also be helpful. This book is slender, simple and surprisingly very useful."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Canyon (Sundance #2)","review":"Having read quite a few of the 43 books that make up this series and having always thought the earlier entries were the best I expected another good read as this is the 2nd of the Sundance books.The book starts well with a tough battle with Indians, which is very quickly followed with a brutal fistfight between Sundance and an outlaw leader called Gannon. Unfortunately the book goes into a slump afterwards as the plot is outlined, the search for Maximilian's priceless treasure of lost jewels.The jewels are said to hidden deep in Apache territory and once Sundance meets up with the Apache the book picks up again and ends with some great action as Sundance and Cochise team up to take on Gannon and his gang between them.Shame about the slump, otherwise not a bad read."},{"Title":"Israel Potter: His fifty years of exile (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"This book is at the same time the least and the most &quot;Melvillian&quot; of all Melville's corpus. Melville wrote in Moby-Dick that &quot;two thirds of the world revolve in darkness.&quot; This idea certaily holds true for most of Melville's works, but not Israel Potter. In this uncharacteristically light-hearted and crisply written rewriting of American history, Melville gives an early literary version of Woody Allen's film Zelig. The character Israel Potter is that same sort of insignificant historical non-entity who just happens to get caught up in incredibly significant historical moments. In his various wanderings Israel meets and becomes politically involved with a trio of the most important American patriots--Ben Franklin, John Paul Jones, and Ethan Allen. It is through these encounters that Melville subtlely (and sometimes not so subtlely) realizes his critical agenda and those darker themes that dominate so much of his other work begin to show themselves. In his portrayal of Franklin, Melville takes a bash at what he sees as the exemplar of American &quot;genius&quot;--the same American genius that ignored and misunderstood his most significant works and forced him into obscurity and poverty in his lifetime. Melville sees Franklin as representative of all that is wrong with the American character--he is parsimonious, small-minded, hard-headed, and morally hypocritical. In the other two historical figures, John Paul Jones and Ethan Allen, Melville finds redemption. In them he sees represented more of that European idea of genius, the manly half-savage/half-civilized genius of Thomas Carlyle. Like Queequeg in Moby-Dick who is described as &quot;George Washington canabalistically rendered,&quot; Jones and Allen are wildmen in a civilized society, raging against the world as they utter their outrageous and at times incomprehensible truth. A fun yet undenialbly thought-provoking read. Enjoy"},{"Title":"Israel Potter: His fifty years of exile (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"After the financial failure of \\"Moby-Dick\\" and the social scandal of \\"Pierre,\\" Melville settled down to write a book that would please the public, his publisher, and (most important at this point in his life) his bank account. He promised George Putnam (his publisher) both \\"nothing of any sort to shock the fastidious\\" and \\"nothing weighty.\\" In short, he wrote an adventure story.But not just any adventure story. Melville drew on a little-known autobiography published 30 years earlier and called the \\"Life and Remarkable Adventures of Israel R. Potter,\\" which recounted the extraordinary career of a veteran of the Battle of Bunker Hill who delivered secret wartime letters to Benjamin Franklin, who found himself stranded in Europe, and who ended up a pauper in London. (The original Northwestern-Newberry edition reprints a facsimile copy of this source, keyed to passages in Melville's text. More remarkably, this edition notes the recent discovery of an unrelated text by a British author who included a brief account of Potter's days as a nomadic street-trader in London, along with a portrait of the man himself.)Yet Melville's book is not merely a biographical novel. Instead, he greatly embellishes Potter's account, incorporating a farcical portrait of Franklin and adding equally comic accounts of John Paul Jones, King George, Ethan Allen, and several other historical figures whom Potter never actually met. In Melville's hands, Franklin becomes a miserly, philandering \\"tanned Machiavelli in tents\\" and \\"not less a lady's man, than a man's man, a wise man, and an old man\\"; Allen is transformed into a larger-than-life Paul Bunyan figure; King George is a kindly dolt; and Jones turns into a tattooed, flirtatious, vainglorious rake. And poor Israel Potter himself is alternately drafted, imprisoned, released, and press-ganged.The result is not only Melville's most accessible work but also an over-the-top spoof of the heroic amateurs running the Revolution and (more subtly) an acidic indictment of the abandonment of the early American dream. While it lacks the depth or the \\"weight\\" of his other late works, \\"Israel Potter\\" makes up for its shortcomings with charm and mirth."},{"Title":"Israel Potter: His fifty years of exile (The Works of Herman Melville, standard edition)","review":"This edition of Melville's ISRAEL POTTER is one of the most accurate will will have in terms of text and also a good introduction to the lighthearted side of Herman Melville. His satirical portraits of Great Americans and their various hypocrises are central to the book, as the battle action of John Paul Jones is to adventure.For those interested in a more modern interpretation of the Israel Potter legend, see GONE OVER by David Chacko and Alexander Kulcsar--one of the best books of 2009."},{"Title":"The Bar/Bat Mitzvah Planbook","review":"This book stresses both the religious ritual and the post ceremony festivities. Although the book devotes a fairly large amount of space to the party, I hope readers will consider the religious aspects of the experience to be paramount. I think this book does a goos job in organizing all aspects of planning a bar/bat mitzvah. The parts of the book devoted to the importance of a good Jewish education and preparing the child give the reader a good start toward a meaningful and fufilling experience. This book is useful to the family with a limited background in Judaism and will increase the understanding of what is involved in making the bar/bat mitzvah process successful."},{"Title":"The Bar/Bat Mitzvah Planbook","review":"Highly Recommended!

It can be very vulgar, but it is also symbolic, metaphoric, and at times even poetic (albeit in a crude way). But instead of focusing on that, Merda is content to be little more than a list of ways to accuse someone of practicing the world's oldest profession, and new methods to refer to defecation in every day conversation. Instead of using insight, it relies on shock value.Sadly, it also confuses some regional phrases with true Italian, and there are more than a handful of translation errors.It is true that much of the information contained on the book's pages is difficult to come across without hanging out with i ragazzi after dusk on a street corner in Naples, but it could have been so much more.Combine those fatal shortcomings with poor quality given its price (it's produced using newsprint between two flimsy covers), and you end up with a product with little to recommend it."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],H={key:0},E={key:1};function W(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",B,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",E,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",H,"See more"))],8,C)):p("",!0)])}const q=d(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-584d95fe"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/61.md","filePath":"people/61.md"}'),L={name:"people/61.md"},j=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(q)]))}});export{P as __pageData,j as default};
