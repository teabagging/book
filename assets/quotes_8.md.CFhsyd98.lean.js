Teppic doesn't wear a crown, but there's plenty else. Besides all the gear he took up while training to be an Assassin in Ankh-Morpork, there's The Reaping Hook of Justice, The Sheaf of Plenty and The Three-pronged Spear of the Waters of the Earth. Oh, yes, there's also a gold mask for identity. All this has been imposed on Teppic since ascending the throne of Djelibeybi at the death of his father. Along with the paraphernalia, Teppic has also inherited a staggering, if unspecified, debt load. In Djelibeybi, each monarch is to \\"rest\\" in a pyramid, each one larger than that of his/her predecessor. With seven millennia of monarchs, the shores of the River Djel are occupied with these man-made stone mountains. And nobody can remember how long it's been since any of them was paid for.Teppic, having breathed the foetid air of Anhk-Morpork, misses feather mattresses and plumbing. He is also suspicious of the type of \\"justice\\" prevailing in Djelibeybi. Long centuries of \\"tradition\\" have conditioned the populace to endure bizarre forms of justice. So conditioned that they will self-inflict punishment, no matter how illogical. Teppic has difficulty understanding this, but Dios, his high priest is there to counsel him on how the system works. There's also another voice, just at the level of perception, adding to Teppic's uncertainty. Urged by Dios to build the greatest pyramid ever to honour Teppic's departed father, the new king has reservations. Something is telling him it's a bad idea.The bad idea proves worse than he can imagine. The ranks of pyramids contain the fourth dimension, Time, which can distort the other three if enough accumulates. Events transpire, not the least of which is the disappearance of Djelibeybi, river, pyramids and all. This situation allows Pratchett to make his first drastic departure from the image of \\"humourous fantasist\\" pinned on him by uncomprehending critics. He does so with gusto. Employing the assistance of the Discworld's greatest mathematician [not a dolphin!], Pratchett guides us through the world of quantum physics. Far from fantasy, this is serious science brought to life by the one writer who can accomplish it with such finesse. Who but Pratchett could utilise the metaphor of Djelibeybi stretching like \\"a lead ball on a rubber sheet\\" in such a context?What happens when Time distorts the other dimensions? If you're outside, how do you return? If you're inside, what effect will the transformation of those dimensions mean to reality? What will be reality? Pratchett answers those questions in ways that will astound fans of fantasy and confound physics professors who seek ways of awakening their legions of drowsy students. He formulates a new reality in which those things we believe in but never see are given substance. Will we still believe in them when they confront us? How will we cope with the forces they possess? Pratchett poses these questions to prod us into considering them for ourselves. Can you accept his challenge?Read this as a guidebook to the world beyond \\"reality\\" and enjoy the immense wit Pratchett uses to describe it. You won't be disappointed.

Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat \\"Bite me!\\"I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"A delightful piece in the discworld series, this must have story depicts the life of P'Teppic(an assassin) the son of a Phaoroh in his attempt to govern his people.

He must now build the hugest pyramid ever."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"As a relatively new fan of Terry Pratchett and his Discworld series, I was so impressed by what he wrote so far I started to believe that everything from the series will be brilliant and excellent. Therefore, despite the fact other books sounded better, I picked \\"Pyramids\\" at random. And also because... All I can say is, even the best writers can make mistakes now and then - and that I will be more careful next time.About the book: Pyramids is set in Djelibeibey, which is the Discworld equivalent of Ancient Egypt. The main character is Teppic, the son of the Pharaoh who gets sent to Assassin's school in Ankh-Morpork for a few years, only to come back exactly when his father dies and he becomes the new Pharoah of the kingdom. The plot gets complicated by the building of a pyramid which is bigger than any pyramid which has ever been built in the kingdom. This pyramid somehow twists the rules of space, time and belief to create a big mess.Does this sound a big vague? To me it does - and the story feels confused and vague to the end. Many plot lines aren't fully explored, many characters aren't fully developed.. the plot is very thin, it feels as if it leads nowhere. Even the jokes in the book weren't as witty as the other Discworld novels I have read. It's a pity since the premise has a lot of potential, and Teppic is cool as the main character.What can I say, I guess Pratchett is human after all, even great authors can do less than perfect every now and then. Was I disappointed? Yes. Will I continue to read more Pratchett novels? You bet! I guess I would recommend this book only to people who are absolutely die hard fans of Discworld.. for anybody else I would say, Skip this one."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Pyramids revolves within Prachett's representation of a very British, albeit magical, Egypt. Pratchett has some fun playing with classes, and the expectations and confinements imposed on all classes (especially royals, in this case). He also takes many amusing pokes at polytheism. A camel, going by the name of You Bastard, provides the rest of the hilarity expected (and delivered) with Pratchett's Discworld books.Unfortunately, the final sections of Pyramids are disappointing, failing to make much sense or be very funny. Of the nine Discworld books I've read (the first 8--Pyramids being the 7th--plus Going Postal), Pyramids is on par with Sourcery as being the least of the lot. Not that this is hugely negative, as Pratchett's least is still very good. But with 30-some Discworld books available, this one's recommended only for the most serious of Pratchett fans."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"I don't claim that this one is the rollicking, laughter filled ride of most of the previous books (particularly WYRD SISTERS) but, for sheer inventiveness and looney logic, this has claimed its current spot in my head and heart as King of the Hill as far as Discworld novels are concerned. However, I am reading or re-reading the series in order published, so it will likely change. Camels. Who would've thought? Highest recommendations."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"A rollicking trip through Djelibeybi (Jelly baby, a British candy, get it?), Ephebe (with it's suspicious resemblance to classical Athens), and Anhk-Morpork (which needs no tag line). We're introduced to life as a student in the Assassin's Guild, where school dinners are the most stressful event of the day but not for the bullying. We observe the true pyramid power, the ability to muck about with the flow of time, and gain insight into the lives of those who build the pyramids, those who build things to go in them, and those who go in them.Most important, we meet Dios, the high priest of Djelibeybi. The man has LOTS of experience at managing royalty, but is overcome by Pteppic, the young price sent to Anhk-Morpork to be educated at the Assassins' Guild. (You'll appreciate how easy even your hardest final exam was.) No, Dios is not assassinated, just out-witted by the independence and cunning the boy acquired in his years in that city of cities, that festering dung heap on a warm day, Anhk-Morpork.Ephebe, a city of philosophers in search of bath-towels plays a critical role in this story, and the value of a good listener is demonstrated, to the cent.One of Pratchett's best. The characters are well developed. Shots are taken at New Age silliness, boarding schools, and philosophy. It ends with a twist. What else can we ask for?"},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Teppic is the son of King Teppicymon XXVII, the pharaoh of the ancient Klatch kingdom of Djelibeybi. Young Teppic is sent away to Ankh-Morpork to go to Assassin's School. He is called back to the kingdom immediately after graduation because of the death of his father. He must now ascend the throne, wear the ceremonial gold mask, and commission master architect Ptaclusp to build the massive mother of all pyramids for his father's earthly remains. Being the pharaoh of the dusty old tradition-steeped Kingdom of the Sun is no fun, however. Teppic misses the modern excitement, not to mention the modern plumbing, of Ankh-Morpork. When the pyramid under construction begins to generate enough energy to warp the fabric of time and space, the entire kingdom is displaced from Discworld into an alternate dimension. Teppic, accompanied by his headstrong handmaiden Ptraci and a mathematically inclined camel, is catapulted out of the kingdom. The threesome must find their way back to the kingdom to return it to its place within the dimensions of Discworld, rescuing it from beliefs turned to hellish reality.This Discworld novel has a different feel from ones that precede it. Once Teppic leaves Ankh-Morpork, almost all traces of Discworld slip away. The reader is immersed in an amalgam of ancient Egypt and Greece, complete with mythology, high priests, deserts, hieroglyphics, and lots of pyramids and mummies. There are no wizards or witches here, and the magic is of an entirely different nature. There are almost no familiar characters, although Death does make a minor appearance. Pratchett uses this unusual setting to explore ideas about religious beliefs and traditions, and the nature of time, space, and reality. This is some pretty heady stuff, but it is given the magic Pratchett touch that entertains the reader while providing a lot of serious food for thought.Pratchett is in top form as he satirizes Greek philosophy, Zeno's paradox, quantum physics, mythology, pyramid power, and the Trojan wars. His parody of the Riddle of the Sphinx is hilarious, as is an introduction to the questionably honorable ideals of the Assassin's Guild. Although Pratchett avoids chapter breaks, at least this book is divided into four sections to provide you with a few logical stopping points. This will give you several places to catch your breath in a funny and thought-provoking story that is a royal jewel in the scepter of Discworld.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"This book was fantastic! I found that Djelibeybi, the Kingdom of the Sun that Teppic finds himself ruling, had many similarities to our own world and ancient civilizations.

The books aren't in any particular order, and you really don't have to start with the first one. But I don't recommend you start with this one. It may be confusing.

Teppic is successful in his studies there, but, seven years later, the death of his father sees him recalled to take up the mantle of pharoah.Unfortunately for all concerned, Teppic comes home with some strange notions about plumbing and the benefits of feather mattresses, which is not good news to the head priest, Dios, who prides himself on how things are run in the kingdom precisely as they were seven thousand years ago. New ideas are not welcome in the Old Kingdom...Pyramids (subtitled 'The Book of Going Forth'), the seventh Discworld book, is one of several 'sleeper' hits in the series. Much more attention is lavished on the book preceding it, Wyrd Sisters, for introducing the popular characters of the Witches, whilst the succeeding volume, Guards! Guards!, gets a lot of props for introducing the City Watch and also for being one of the best books in the series. Pyramids by contrast tends to slip beneath the radar, which is a shame as it is a very good book indeed.It's a stand-alone with not too many continuing story elements, but it works well for that. Rather than simply doing a story about someone with new, radical ideas turning up that the priesthood gets annoyed by, Pratchett throws in some excellent mickey-taking of philosophers and also some nice commentary about SF. Around the time Pyramids came out a lot of 'approachable' SF had been discarded in favour of brain-expanding stories about time travel and non-linear space or something, and Pratchett's constant use of \\"It's probably quantum!\\" to explain every single possible plot hole in the novel is a nice bit of satire.Teppic makes for an engaging protagonist, although he's one of Pratchett's more familiar archetypes (a general do-gooder whose attempts to do good go wrong but he sorts it all out in the end). Dios is one of the series' more interesting protagonists, and the various pyramid-builders and embalmers make for an amusing secondary cast as well. On the minus side, the book's humour is a little bit too obvious in places (there's a few obvious Cleopatra jokes and the employment of mummies for comedic purposes), but there's still a few good belly-laughs in there as well. The theme of the book also seems a bit vague, except that ossification should be avoided by embracing new ideas, which is a bit of a no-brainer.Pyramids (****) is a solid entry to the Discworld series, funny and entertaining throughout.

I recently read two more books in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, WYRD SISTERS and PYRAMIDS. (I had previously read about a third of the Discworld books, but I'm currently reading all of them in order of publication.) I had imagined that I was going to love WYRD SISTERS, knowing that it was filled with Shakespearean references, and imagined that I was going to dislike PYRAMIDS, since I am pretty uninterested in Egyptian mythology and religion. And given that the novel was set in an area of the Discworld in which we were not likely to encounter any of I was wrong. I enjoyed WYRD SISTERS well enough, but I didn't love it like I expected. But I absolutely adored PYRAMIDS. The novel is nothing short of absolutely hysterical, with Pratchett's inventiveness hitting on all cylinders, with one deliciously absurd character after another. The scenes where Dios exerts complete control over the actions of Teppic are among the finest Pratchett has produced, while the delightful beast known as You Bastard are among my favorite creatures in the entire Disc. The scenes in which Teppeic and Dios exchange words are unfailingly delightful. But I may prefer ever more the moments in which we learn that camels are the most brilliant creatures on the Disc and that they are oblivious to others because they are perpetually engaged in working out problems in higher mathematics. The book also has a brilliant encounter between Teppic and the Sphinx, with some typical Pratchettian twists on the tale.I didn't actually dislike WYRD SISTERS. The problem was more that I have never really been drawn to the witches to begin with. Just a matter of taste. I did enjoy the references to Shakespeare. Have the joy of Pratchett is getting his various cultural allusions. For instance, any Gene Wolfe fan will love the title of Part Three of PYRAMIDS, \\"The Book of the New Son.\\" But it isn't enough merely to have references to Shakespeare; the allusions must stand up on their own, and my own feeling was that the Shakespearean elements in the book were the weakest part of the book.So here is the paradox: I thought I was going to love WYRD SISTERS and dislike PYRAMIDS, whereas PYRAMIDS is my favorite of the first seven books in the series while WYRD SISTERS is my least favorite. Just shows to go that you need to read books before knowing whether or not you will like them."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Terry Pratchett's first novel, \\"The Carpet People\\", appeared in 1971. \\"Pyramids\\" is the seventh novel in his hugely popular Discworld series and was first published in 1989. It's the first - and, to date, only - book to feature Teppic, and is largely set in his home country of Djelibeybi.As the book opens, Teppic (or Pteppic) is approaching the end of his education at Ankh-Morpork's Guild of Assassins. (The final exam, if failed, tends to be very...&lt;ahem>...final). However, there is more to Teppic than dressing very stylishly and inhuming only for vast amounts of money. With the very recent death of his father, he has also become King Pteppicymon XXVIII of Djelibeybi. Teppic's home country is very obviously based on Egypt : it's two miles wide, one hundred and fifty miles long and runs along the river Djel. It has driven itself bankrupt, having spent seven thousand years building pyramids for its monarchs - invariably on the country's most fertile soil. Having become the first Pharoh to be educated outside Djelibeybi, Teppic finds it difficult to re-adapt to the traditions of his home country. He is technically a God and although he is officially Head of State, it's Dios - the very aged High Priest - who actually runs the country. Teppic isn't entirely impressed about this - he wants to introduce proper plumbing and pillows, for example. However, in spite of the country's debt, he does agree to building a massive pyramid for his late father. (This isn't something his late father - still pottering around as a ghost - isn't too impressed with). The final straw comes when Dios decides to feed Ptraci - the late King's favourite handmaiden - to the crocodiles. Teppic decides to become a little more politically active - and, luckily, he has a helpful education to fall back on.Like everything else I've read by Pratchett, this is an excellent book. It's easily read, features plenty of likeable characters and there are plenty of laughs. As it's one of Pratchett's stand-alone books, it's a good starting point if you've never read any of the Discworld books before. (In a way, I find that a pity : I'd love to have known what became of Teppic and Ptraci).

He has high hopes that his son will end all of this death-worshiping nonsense, but Teppic is guilt-tripped by the high priest into building his father the biggest pyramid of all.When the young king finally realizes that the mad, old high priest is the real ruler of Djelibeybi, he dons his black assassin's outfit and sets about rescuing beautiful handmaidens, thwarting the sacred crocodiles and their priests, and confronting Djelibeybi's ancient animal-headed gods.Not bad for a kid who started out by letting the grass grow under his feet.\\"Pyramids\\" is not part of a Discworld miniseries, but stands alone as a satire on religion, ancestor worship, ancient Greek philosophers, mathematicians, piratical merchants (another great career opportunity for a graduate of the Assassins Guild) and anything else Pratchett felt like taking a swing at.This is ancient Egypt and Classical Greece as seen through the eyes of a mathematical genius who happens to be a camel, a young assassin who happens to be a king, and a mummy who would rather not spend the rest of his afterlife in Discworld's biggest pyramid."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Despite not featuring Unseen University or the witches of the Ramtop Mountains, this is my favorite Discworld book.After hinting at it in \\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" Pratchett paints an engaging portrait of life in the Ankh-Morporkk Assassin's Guild. The suave, stylish, chic and, well, murderous life as an apprentice assassin is, against all logic, made sort of appealing and cool, like an academy for future James Bonds.Then our protagonist, Teppic, is cruelly jerked back to his reality -- he's the son of the pharoah in the Kingdom of the Sun, and his father has just died. The cosmopolitan Teppic has to face what are, to him, backwards and outdated customs the rest of the world has left behind centuries ago. He's right, of course, and the mystery as to what's really happening in his kingdom spins out at Teppic tries to adapt himself to life as pharoah, and try to drag the kingdom into modern times.Along the way, there is the ghost of his father, who mournfully watches his own body being prepared for the afterworld, a sassy handmaiden, and a mysterious and forbidding high priest. Toss in the greatest mathematician on Discworld -- not a biped, though -- a parody of Ancient Greece, and a graduate assassin turned pirate, and you've got a rollicking cast plunging towards a very local sort of doomsday.The ending is a touch ambiguous for my tastes -- Pratchett was trying to use a light touch and went a touch TOO light for my tastes -- but overall, this is an engaging, amusing and even somewhat thoughtful Discworld novel, and one that stands alone even better than most.By the order of the pharoah, this is strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"First of all, I loved this novel. Teppic is a great guy who grows up as we read. The very name of Teppic's country, Djelibeybi, made me giggle, and the final exam in the Assassins' School had me at the edge of my chair until Teppic -- whew! -- makes the right decision. It's fun to look for the sources of Pratchett's plots (and satires). Did anyone else notice the similarities between this one and the first two of the Gormenghast trilogy? Not just Daddy's becoming a bird, but the dark ambience, Teppic's strange rivals and relatives, and the liberating finale. This book isn't my absolute favorite of Pratchett's (those accolades are reserved for the Watch novels and REAPER MAN), but it's a far cut above the Rincewind tales -- and better than the Gormenghast novels, since it examines all problems, including the hilarious ones, that trouble the inheritor of vast inbred territories."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"One of his better parodies. I guess I find the math humor phunny too, what with the sons of the pyramid builder having to develop calculus so that he could pay the wages in more than three dimensions.... And I will never look at a camel in the same way again. My boys and husband just split a gut laughing over the plot of this one."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Terry Pratchett certainly knows how to take you on a wild ride. The prince is off learning to be an assassin when his dad dies. Guess he's surprised when mummys not only climp out of their pyramids but the Gods of the Old Kingdom come for a visit. If you haven't read Pratchett's Discworld this book can certainly stand by itself, but if you have than it gives you a peek at another group of Great A'tuin's crazy inhabitants. I could only give it four stars because I'm a big fan of Rincewind and alas he's not along for this ride but this is still a GREAT addition to your Disworld Collection."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Pratchett has a marvelous sense of humor. He is so quick that you might note that you missed things and then have to review what you recently read to put it all together in your mind.His made up history of places and the reasons that his characters behave as they do are absolutely priceless. He comments on our present day world in an indirect manner using his make believe world. His comments are pointed and hysterically funny at the same time. The man is an accomplished writer. Would that I had more of his stuff to read - so, write on Pratchett and do it quickly!"},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"\\"Pyramids\\" is an odd entry in the Discworld franchise. It is neither a knock-you-down laugh riot, nor an existential meandering. It has great dollops of both, though, and sometimes the two sides clash confusingly in the middle. Other times, they fit together perfectly, like the large blocks that when stacked together make up a pyramid.There are some classic Pratchett moments here. Funny stuff. Like when a doctor (medicine being a new artform on the Discworld) declares a man's temperature so hot you could fry an egg on his forehead. Then, predicting the complicated medical jargon we all know and love, he pompously declares that the man is suffering from \`Pyrocerebrum ouerf culinaire'. A great and ridiculous moment. Even better is the scene near the middle of the book, where our hero, Teppic, encounters the legendary Sphinx, and ends up debunking the logic behind its famous riddle. It is a great scene, hardly integral to the plot, but wonderful to chomp on while it's playing.As for that plot, well, Terry tries some complicated set pieces, and usually manages to pull them off with minimal explanation. He lets the reader figure out the merits of the Assassin's Guild, what it means to inhume a client, the concept of &quot;flaring&quot; off a pyramid, camel mathematics, and &quot;quantum&quot; architecture. Needless to say, none of these concepts are very useful in our world, but all make perfect sense on the Discworld.I was somewhat disappointed that he returned to some tried and true devices. The ghost of the dead king, used so well in &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;, here comes off as a tired rehash (although the king's afterlife companions turn out to be an interesting bunch). Also, the smart-mouth female sidekick has been done to death by this point. And our hero seems to be just an amalgamation of every Discworld hero so far, from Rincewind to Twoflower to Mort to Rincewind (again). Although Death returns, for a very brief but memorable appearance.All told not the greatest entry in the series. Terry aims the bar quite high, which I commend him for, but he manages to knock it down more times than not."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"I really enjoy Terry Pratchett's writing and he did not disappoint with this one.

Love the bits of relevance to true life as is often the case with this author, very funny, a god lighthearted read"},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"In \`Pyramids', master storyteller and satirist takes on the funeral industry, philosophy, and more. Teppic, heir to the throne of Djelibeybi (which bears more than a passing resemblance to ancient Egypt), has just passed his final exam to become a member of the assassin's guild in Ankh-Morpork when his father dies in a bit of madness. He returns home to take on his responsibility, for which he is totally unprepared. Even though he is king and considered a god, he finds he has no say in anything at all; because of the high priest, his is merely a ceremonial position. The story is no mere court intrigue, though; the Djelibeybian custom of building a bigger, more impressive pyramid for each kingly generation's resting spot creates havoc when the new pyramid proves to be so large that it creates a warp in space and time. Teppic, with the aid of a handmaid and Discworld's greatest mathematician (a camel named You Bastard) must put things to rights before Djelibeybi is destroyed by gods who have suddenly manifested on the physical realm and before war breaks out between the countries on either side of where Djelibeybi used to be.While certainly amusing (the assassin's final exam is particularly good), this isn't one of Pratchett's stronger stories. It's disjointed and a lot of things happen that don't advance the story- the gods becoming physical and apparently witless being one of the worst. The characters aren't as vivid as in most Pratchett stories. Teppic and Ptraci are likable but not compelling. The best characters are the dead king and Dios, the power mad high priest who turns out to be motivated by good. But still, a not so great story by Terry Pratchett is better than a lot of some authors best stories, so it's certainly worth the read."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Very funny, like all the other discworld books.

It was also a little boring in some parts.But I still loved the Teppic, he is fun and cool. I loved the philosophers and the crazy political guards. The book was hilariouse.

I also loved the ideas.If Terry Pratchett had only put a little bit more depth into the book, it could have been one of the best."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"This story did provide an interesting view of the assassins guild in Ankh-Morpork. In fact, the early pages were among the most interesting. The story about Djelibeybi, a take on ancient Egypt, was still funny at times. But he business with the pyramids and the architects - what were they talking about (once again, maybe Pratchett meant it to sound complicated)? It was a bit vague. Also, I didn't really like any of the main characters (Teppic was well-meaning; I liked him better in Ankh-Morpork as an assassin), except the ghost of the late king.

So when I get the time, I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the books!!!"},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Every once in a while there appears a book in Pratchett's generally excellent series that really doesn't quite fit in; a book that, through setting or plot, just doesn't possess the quality usually found in the series. Pyramids is one of those outliers. This book has the weakest of connections to Discworld as a whole. Taking place in Discworld's version of Egypt, this one is populated by characters you're unlikely to meet again in the series and if the hero, Teppic, hadn't been educated at the Assassin's Guild, this could have been a separate fantasy novel for all it had to do with Discworld. The nature of the Egyptian belief in the pharaoh as god, is examined here; I'm really not sure for what purpose. It seems with this one, the idea and the execution both came up short. Although there are silly bits about the nature of the afterlife, with mummies staggering around, and the power of pyramids makes for an equally funny commentary on some new age beliefs, the overall effect of this one is fleeting, making it one of the weaker Discworld books."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"A young prince from the kingdom of Djelibeybi is sent off to Ankh-Morpork for training at the guild of Assassins. His final exam is vividly imagined and well-told. But just after graduation his father the eccentric pharaoh of the realm, considered a god, dies, and young Teppic must return to ascend to the throne. His father's ghost gets to hang around and watch himself get mummified, and Djelibeybi begins building its biggest pyramid yet. In this book Pratchett throws in an awful lot of funny detail in: we get a send-up of Zeno and his paradox, a mockery of the whole notion of \\"pyramid power\\" (subject of many silly pseudo-science books that I remember from my childhood), and a nasty but mathematically inclined camel... in other words, a whole lot of bits and pieces with \\"Laugh! This is funny!\\" stamped on them... but they aren't, and I didn't. Teppic is never developed further as a character; although as the new pharaoh himself, he finds his orders constantly reinterpreted by his high priest. This makes for good satire of Egyptian government but results in a situation where nothing Teppic says or does really seems to matter. Teppic's love interest, Ptraci, is even less interesting; she is described as a voluptuous handmaiden schooled in the exotic arts of love, and scented with intoxicating perfumes. But rather than give her anything interesting to say or do, Pratchett simply takes her off-stage for most of the book, and focuses instead on nerdy quantum instabilities, reanimated mummies, a parody of the Trojan Wars, the Sphinx, the internal squabbles of the high priests, a bevy of bizarre gods, and a mishmash of other distracting details. Erotica is not Pratchett's style, and I wasn't expecting a real X-rated Kama Sutra send-up, but we don't get even a budding romance or a love-hate relationship; instead, we get a disappointing plot twist that effectively neuters the characters. Although I admire some of Pratchett's big ideas in this book about Egyptian culture's obsession with death and time, and found the story of Teppic's assassin's guild examination to be fun reading, the book ultimately becomes quite dull and hard to finish. This is a shame, because there is a the seed of a very good Discworld novel about Teppic the Reluctant Assassin buried in here, and that would have been much more fun to read. For a far better Discworld standalone read _The Truth_ instead."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Pyramids is almost a complete standalone discworld book, with just small references here and there to the occasional other person.This is his take on the whole Egypt and pyramid worship and the whole thing about the shape and construction of pyramids doing weird things with preservation and time."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"I could write a 1000 word essay on why to buy this book but wouldn't do justice to the cause by half. So I'll just summarize:Terry Pratchett.DiscWorld Novel.'Nuff said."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Probably the best of the Discworld series. Enjoyable, funny in places, and enough story to make the book an easy one to finish.I've wondered on occasion why Pratchett (at his best) is never nearly as funny as Douglas Adams (at his best); now I think I know. \\"The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is genuine science fiction. The story drives itself. The Infinite Improbability Drive, is exactly the sort of thing a science fiction writer would invent, and the explanation for its existence exactly that which a science fiction writer would give. Someone with no sense of humour at all might not like Adams's book, but would at least understand it.None of this is true of Pratchett. His books, as a rule, aren't fantasy: he usually gives the impression of wanting to write about something else. (This is most apparent in, say, \\"Moving Pictures\\", a book about Hollywood that would lose most of its humour if it was actually set *in* Hollywood.) Usually there's nothing to Pratchett except one liners and turns of phrase. He presents us with a plot he doesn't appear to care about, and then goes through the tedious motions of writing a novel to it, all the time keeping a sharp look-out for amusing comments to make. The amusing comments are what makes the otherwise tedious excercise worthwhile. They don't always succeed.(This explains why Pratchett is seldom REALLY funny. Someone who has no particular axe to grind and is just looking for jokes, any jokes, is in the unenviable position of a a clown at the circus, or a court jester, whom everyone expects to be funny but no-one expects to be anything else. Such people produce dutiful chuckles. Humour needs passion.)This is a generalisation. There are exceptions, and this book is one of them. Ankh-Morpork is about the only thing left in Discworld which is interesting in itself (and not just interesting as a result of the funny things that might be said about it); so, hurrah, we begin the novel in Ankh-Morpork. We get a story which has some merit as a fantasy story all by itself. The magic is for once genuine magic, and not a kind of ersatz technology. This book approaches the kind of thing Discworld as a whole ought to have been.Another book worth reading for similar reasons is \\"Mort\\". Read it after or before \\"Pyramids\\". It won't hurt to read the other Discworld books, but there is really no need."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"The first part of this book revolves around the idea of an &quot;assassin's guild&quot;. This is undoubtedly the wittiest and most original part, unfortunately it is also the briefest. Pratchett is unable, or unwilling, to continue in this vein and instead tacks a great wad of stodge on to this promising introduction. Whilst this manages to pad it out to a reasonable length to be published, it also makes it profoundly wearisome. Obviously however it is this tripe, more concerned with its own twisted logic than with being amusing, which Pratchett considers to be the most important part. This is evident from the reworking he gives most of these ideas in &quot;Small Gods&quot;, and by inflating the size of this book he manages to make the same old themes more turgid than ever before. If you value your sanity then stop at p68, progress beyond this point at your own peril."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Pratchett is always a good read!

I especially enjoyed the world's greatest mathematician and his formulae."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"This is what I believe to be the start of Pratchett's most inspired and hilarious period.The sphinx chapter is one of the funniest things out there.DEATH is here too, with his dry humor, not to mention lots of mummies and gods and quasi-quantum silliness.Lots of philosophizing, Pratchett style. The meaning of life according to idiots who are us.

It was enjoyable--sort of a Douglas Adams lite. I think one of the reasons it feels toned down is that everything in DiscWorld seems to be an analogue for something in our world. (I'm not entirely certain why the Egypt analogue was named after a Jelly Baby.) That gives things a little distance. With the HitchHiker books, Arthur was very firmly rooted in the banality of our own familiar world, and served as a more effective foil for the wacky folks he met."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"The Discworld is definitely not Earth, but some parts of it are similar, and the exaggerations are rip-roaringly funny.

The seller was both prompt and honest.Ruth Root"},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"First off, it's well known that Sir Terry is quite incapable of writing a bad book. This one, however, falls right in the middle of the pack: Perfectly readable, very funny in places, and with some pointed points to make regarding the anti-progressive nature of religion (a recurrent theme of Pratchett's), . . . but still, on the whole, and not to put too fine a point on it, not nearly as engaging as his stories about the Witches or the City Watch.The setting this time is the long, narrow river-following desert country of Djelibeybi whose principal function is to act as a buffer between two other nations, once minor but now major indeed. Moreover, it's littered with 7,000 years worth of pyramids, all of them flaring off their stored-up energy every night. Teppic is the son and heir of the current pharaoh and, since his father thinks he ought to see something of the world before being locked into the stultifying job of king for the rest of his life, he's spent the past seven years at the Assassin's School in Ankh-Morpork. (Well, it does provide the best education available.) And he does surprisingly well there, but then, just as he has passed his final exam -- and you can imagine what that's like -- his father dies and Teppic is yanked back home. Being an earnest young man and inexperienced, Teppic decides he ought to be a man of the people -- only to discover that that's not what the people want at all. And he discovers that Dios, the High Priest of Djelibeybi, actually runs things to suit himself and will not be denied. There's his late father's pyramid, for instance. Even though he doesn't really approve, and doesn't think his father would have, either (too right he didn't -- and doesn't), Teppic finds himself ordering a pyramid to be built twice as large as the standard model. Ptaclusp, the contractor whose family has been constructing tombs for royals for many centuries and not being paid for it, has his own problems, with one twin son who is an accountant and another who is an innovative architectural engineer. \\"Innovative\\" is not an attitude that's well thought of in Djelibeybi. But that huge pyramid is going to be a problem for the entire river valley, because the reason the country has gone on and on for thousands of years without ever changing is that \\"pyramids are dams in the stream of time.\\" That way, a dying king tucked inside will live forever -- more or less. And what the pyramid releases at night is the time it has accumulated during the day -- provided it isn't too big.The author's characters, as usual are droll and a lot of fun, especially Ptraci, the luscious handmaiden. \\"Ptraci didn't just derail the train of thought, she ripped up the rails, burned the stations, and melted the bridges for scrap.\\" And then there's You Bastard, one of the greatest mathematicians on Discworld and deadly with a wad of half-digested cud. Pratchett is also, as always, adroit with the language, dropping original metaphors and similes on almost every page. One old lady is \\"as tough as a hippo's instep,\\" while another is \\"as self-centered as a gyroscope.\\" And Teppic's encounter with the Sphinx is almost Monty Python-ish. Still, the narrative seems forced at times -- not something one usually encounters in a Discworld novel. And the first part of the story, about Teppic's experiences with training as a black-clothed assassin, while quite good in itself, has nothing really to do with the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"If indeed any one of Terry Pratchett's Discworld books can be termed any more 'unusual' than the others...Pyramids is more or less of a one-off among Discworld books, not fitting into any of the 'arcs' which include most of the others (ie: Wizards, Witches, or the Watch). The writing style is pure Pratchett, and his inimitable humor is just as evident in this novel as it is in any of the others. I would say that if you liked any of the books dealing with the History Monks of Wen, you will probably enjoy Pyramids."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Pyramids represents something of a detour in Pratchett's Discworld series. The principal action takes place in the heretofore unfamiliar land of Djelibeybi, located in northern Klatch across the Circle Sea from Anhk-Morpork. This is a unique realm of the Discworld, two miles wide and 150 miles long. It is often referred to as the Old Kingdom for a very good reason-it is quite old, over 7000 years old in fact. It is a desert land whose pharaohs are obsessed with pyramid-building; besides bankrupting the country, this obsession has also had the unforeseen consequence of keeping the country firmly entrenched in the past. Pyramids, you see, slow down time, and there are so many pyramids in Djelibeybi now that new time is continually sucked in by them and released nightly in flares. In a land where the same time is reused daily, it comes as something of a surprise when the pharaoh Teppicymon XXVII decides to send his son Teppic outside of the kingdom to get his education. Just after becoming a certified, guild-approved assassin, young Teppic is called upon to return home after his father suffers the unfortunate consequences attendant upon thinking he can fly. Three months into his reign, he basically loses his kingdom-literally. The Great Pyramid being built for his father's mummy is much too big, and eventually it causes the temporal dislocation of Djelibeybi from the face of the Discworld. Accompanied by the handmaiden Ptraci, whom he rescued from certain death, and a camel whose name would be edited were I to state it here, Teppic must find a way to restore his kingdom back to its proper place and time above the ground. The ordeal is only complicated further by the fact that all of the land's dead and thousands of gods suddenly have appeared in person, acting as if they own the place.While its unusual setting and the fact that it features characters seen here and nowhere else makes this novel seem a little different from its fellow Discworld chronicles, I must admit it is quite an enjoyable read. Pratchett ingeniously incorporates ideas and practices from ancient Egypt and ancient Greece: pyramids, mummification, Greek philosophers, the Trojan War and its Horse in particular, etc. Teppic is an enjoyable enough character, but we never seem to delve deeply enough to understand him properly. I loved the brash handmaiden Ptraci and her fearless contempt for tradition. All of the dead pharaohs are quite funny, particularly in terms of their opinions on an afterlife spent shut inside a tomb inside an escape-proof pyramid. The subplot featuring the history of warfare between two neighboring kingdoms really helps make this novel a true winner. Perhaps the most interesting thing to be found in these pages, though, is the actual identity and thought processes of Discworld's greatest mathematician. There is also much to amuse and delight fans of temporal dislocation theories-the pyramid builders make many incredible discoveries in the process of building the Great Pyramid, not the least of which is a means of utilizing the structure's innate time loop to call forth several different selves to help make sure the job is finished in the allotted time.Even though this book is funny and satisfying enough to stand on its own, I would not start my Discworld reading with it. Aside from Teppic's time spent in Anhk-Morpork learning to be an assassin, the action takes place outside the much more familiar lands we encounter time and again in the other novels. Of course, Pratchett devotees will want to read it for the very reason that it acquaints us with a strange, otherwise unfamiliar section of the Discworld."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"This is a fairly early Terry Pratchett (number seven I believe) and demonstrate his unique ability to lampoon nearly everything at once. We find ourselves with Teppic the heir to throne of Djelibeybi, who has been sent off to Ankh-Morpark to learn a decent trade. Or rather, a lucrative indecent trade of inhumation (otherwise called assassination). Djelibeybi has been building bigger and bigger pyramids for some 7,000 years and is way behind on its payments. Somebody has to bring home a paycheck.Teppic has mastered all the requisite skills (tucking equipment everywhere, wearing black clothes, swinging from buildings, etc) and now, in a flash of accidental good luck, he has passed his final exam. At this crucial moment, Teppic's father develops a sudden urge to fly and our young assassin must return to the world's most tradition bound kingdom (no toilets, no mattresses, and no aqueducts). Having spent years in the most corrupt city on Discworld Teppic must wear a very heavy mask, sleep on stone beds, and be a very bored god. And bankrupt the kingdom building his father's pyramid.Pyramids are the problem. Since each one has to be bigger than the last, they have long since achieved enough mass to bend light and absorb time. This keeps their occupants alive, but the accumulation of present and future time has to be vented off nightly. The reason Teppic's country is so stodgy is that all the present and future is being shot off into space and they only have the past left to live in.Now Teppic decides that his father's tomb will be an order of magnitude larger than its predecessors, and all quantum breaks out. Even before it is finished is becomes a major time hazard and suddenly, in one great big pffft, it folds Djellibaybi into a Hilbert space and leaves Teppic with a camel sized headache. Needless to say this irritates the heck out of Teppic's father (dead or not), all the mummified kings, and a large number of loose gods.Pratchett uses this opportunity to mach fun of organized religion, solipsistic scientists, relativity, archaism, relatives, politics, war, and mathematicians with one or two humps and four stomachs. He spares no one, and it is great fun for the reader. His ability to pull a horrible pun out of thin air is unequalled. Pratchett's message has always been that life is too important to take seriously, By all means hunt this up, you'll be mummified laughing."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.On earth this passage from Genesis describes the Tower of Babel. But on Discworld it just may describe the proud towers (pyramids actually) built by the people (slaves actually) of Djelibeybi in Terry Pratchett's seventh Discworld book, Pyramids. Pyramids is an excellent addition to the Discworld series and, like just about every other volume in the series is both hilariously funny and thought provoking.Teppic is the heir to the throne of Djelibeybi. For each generation going back as far as anyone can remember the new king, upon the death of his father, builds a pyramid that will serve both as his tomb and an eternal monument. This would be fine but for the fact that each succeeding generation is expected to build a monument that is greater than the last. This keep Djelibeybi locked in a perpetual financial crisis and has caused each succeeding ruler (Pharaoh) to lead a life that is overly regimented to the point of insanity, or at the very least officious inanity.Teppic's father, Teppicymon XXVII, seems to want a bit more from his son then a life of idleness sitting on the throne and when the story opens we find Teppic going off to \`college' in this instance the famed school run by the Guild of Assasins on Ankh-Morpork. No sooneer does Teppic pass his Assasin's exit examination (a typical Pratchett tour de \`farce') then his father dies and Teppic is called back to assume the throne.Teppic chafes at the constraints put upon him and his life by Dios, the nation's chief holy man and enforcement officer. Dios is the type of horrifically evil bureaucrat who, smitten with a bit of power, tends to be the person you must deal with at the Department of Motor Vehicles or at the bank or at the office who's biggest skill is the ability to say \`NO!!!' in an infinite number of ways. The rest of the story follows Teppic's adventures as the power of the new pyramid built to honor his father causes havoc with the time-space continuum and which in turn threatens to engulf the region in a disastrous war.Pyramids is the 7th in the Discworld series. It is far enough along in the series for the reader to see Pratchett really hitting his stride. You can see the beginning of themes that he develops with great success in later volumes, particularly in his masterful Small Gods. Pratchett's treatment of the Ephebian philosophers is hilarious. As portrated by Pratchett these neo-Athenian philosophers would fit in perfectly with those Australian philosophers named Bruce made famous by Monty Python. The presence of mathematically inclined, nasty-tempered camels was also drawn to great effect. I'll never see another camel again without wondering whether it is performing advanced calculus.Devoted fans of Terry Pratchett are likely to have read Pyramids already. However, for newcomers to Pratchett this is probably not the best place to start. I think in order to appreciate Pyramids to the fullest it is probably advisable to read at least one or two earlier Discworld stories (Color of Magic or Light Fantastic would probably be best) before getting to Pyramids. Needless to say, as someone who was made his way through about two thirds of the Discworld books, it is well worth the time and effort to get invested in the entire series."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Recently I became a fan of Terry Pratchett, after having read The Color of Magic. I continued to read the series in order, and I just finished reading Pyramids. Immediately I liked this book, because I found the Assassins Guild fascinating, and I thought Teppic was an interesting and cool main character.The plot goes something like this: Teppic was born in Djelibeybi (a sort of ancient Egypt-like country) and was sent to Ankh-Morpork when he was 12 to become an assassin. Just after Teppic passes the final test, his father dies and he has to return to Djelibeybi to be king. When he arrives, he realizes a pyramid has to be built for his father, and he orders that it be the biggest pyramid in the valley, with labyrinths and statues and so forth. But the pyramid is -so- big and powerful that it somehow alters the fabric of time and space, and puts Djelibeybi into its own little dimension, separate from the outside world. It's now Teppic's job as king (and a god) to make things right, even if the High Priest likes to twist everything he says.Thrown into the mix is the mysteriously old High Priest named Dios; the best mathemetician in the world (a camel); a handmaiden named Ptraci; the gods coming to life and freaking everyone out; and thousands of dead 'ancestors' lurching around and complaining about their pyramids. The story is humorous, as are all of Pratchett's books, and the characters are very likeable. And for those of you who like romance, there is definitely some of that (which I was glad of).Some reviewers complain that the plot is thin and the characters are under-developed, but I must disagree. So far this is my favorite Discworld book, and I'm pretty sure it will stay that way. This is well worth buying, even if you're not a huge Discworld fan!"},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"I've read many books from Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, and Pyramids remains one of my favorites because of the unique setting. Most of his Discworld books takes place in the city/state of Ankh-Morpork. Pyramids, set in a Discworld-type Ancient Egypt, Djelibeibey, or &quot;Child of the Djel&quot;, Teppic struggles with the problems of being a teen-aged god. And Dios, the power hungry high priest isn't making matters any easier. It's a battle between old men, set in their ways, and the new boy king who's going to bring Djel kicking and screaming into the Centry of the Fruitbat! I also liked how the author used a teenager for a hero. A great book, and I'd highly recommend it to any Pratchett fan."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"So my friend tells me about this author, Terry Pratchett, who in my fifth decade I have never heard of. And my friend is pushing the likes of Going Postal, Thief of Time, Guards Guards, and others of Prachett's books. One wonders if my friend knew that there was a \\"proper\\" starting place into Pratchett's Discworld. :PI also decided to go against the, er, grain and enter Discworld not from \\"the beginning\\" (The Colour of Magic) but with Pyramids. So that my kids - avid fans of ancient egpyt (pharaohs and priests, tyrants and the titular ptopic: pyramids) - might take an interest in a writing style they've not encountered before: satire. Throw in an Assassins' Guild (NINJAS!) and I think I've, or Pratchett, has clinched the deal.(Yes, I realize that Prachett has written two or more trilogies for \\"younger readers,\\" including The Bromeliad Trilogy and The Tiffany Aching trilogy -- both of which I also bought for the kids and look forward to reading myself.)And although several reviewers have stated that Pyramids is not the best place to start the Discworld series, I say Phtooey. The book has a cast of memorable characters, both major and minor: Teppic, Dios (the high priest), Pteppicymon XXVII, Ptraci, Chidder, even Cheeseworth, Hoot Koomi (the double faced priest) Pthagarom, Mericet (the master assassin), Endos (the attentive listener), the tyrants of Ephebe and Tsort (read: ancient Greece and Troy), DEATH HIMSELF. And, of course, the greatest mathematician in the world.I find the book a page turner of the first Tsort. From the characterizations of Dios and Pteppicymion, the early exploits of Teppic at Assassins' School to his summons to his father's kingdom and his innocent consorting with Ptraci......I was surprised most of the fantasy elements of the story could better be classified as science fiction (i.e., Pyramid Power run amuck), but I also realize I wasn't reading The Colour of Magic, The Light Fantastic or other of the Rinceworld novels.The satire of Pyramids is brilliant. The writing style begs to be read aloud, and I found myself doing so at great lengths even though no one was around (probably a good thing) until my throat got sore (probably a bad thing). Read aloud it becomes sort of a Monty Python in print, except you're no longer dealing with print. Additionally, the book has great \\"re-play value,\\" in that it can be read more than once for amusement. I am going to have to read it a second time to pick up some of the subtleties I missed.The plot is light but fantastic. (The underlying satire probably more enjoyable). Nevertheless the story races to the climax, where all the major players: the gods, the priests, the undead ancestors of -what - Djelibeybi (\\"Jelly Baby,\\" a popular British confectionary), the King's Embalmers (one whose name is Dil, who pickles the dead kings), the Pyramids' architects (Ptaclusp and his twin sons Ptaclusp IIa and IIb), and Teppic himself collide in a rousing attempt to rouse the Kingdom of Djelibeybi from the slumber of its having fallen through a fractal in the space-time warp. Ah: pyramid power: don't ever underestimate it!And don't underestimate Pyramids. In fact, I am loath to leave the world of Pteppicymion and Djelibeybi for the wider world of Ankh-Morpork and \\"Discworld proper.\\" (I kind of rince to think about it.) Where Ive heard there are such things as dragons and wizards. I guess it's great my kids are as entranced by those topics as well, having read Tolkien. Now let's see if they can understand and enjoy Pratchett as much."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"It is obvious from reading other reviews that readers of Terry Pratchett each have their own particular favourites, and these can vary wildly. \`Pyramids' was the first of his books that I read and even though I have now read most of them it remains, in my opinion, one of the best. What did I like about it? Well, the concept of a king who was actually trained to be an assassin (rather than one who took on the role to get there) was a good start. A kingdom called Djelibeybi (you have to say it aloud) that remarkably resembles Egypt, but skewed in the way that only Pratchett's Discworld series can, was also clever. Add to that swipes at pyramidology, the way some of religions followers abuse the power they get from it, and a teenage hero concerned about all the normal things that teenagers are concerned about, and you get a funny book. Perhaps my favourite bit is that camels are the smartest creatures on the disc (maybe you have to have met some camels to really understand that). If you are a fan of Terry Pratchett, there is a fair chance you will like this book. If you've never read him before, buy \`Pyramids' and prepare to laugh."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Pyramids is yet another Discworld novel from Terry Pratchett, though it doesn't take place in the same setting as the other novels in the series. Instead, it takes place in \\"The Old Kingdom,\\" and is take-off on ancient Egypt. How does it fare?Let's call it a triple. It's wonderfully funny, and definitely a 5-star book. It only suffers in comparison to the other Discworld books that I've read, in that it takes awhile before it's laugh out loud funny. The whole book is definitely worth reading though, and your patience will be rewarded in spades once things actually start happening.The book is about Teppic, the son of the king, who has gone to Ankh-Morpork to learn to be an assassin. The first section of the book consists of scenes of his final examination intercut with scenes of his joining the assassins' school. This section has its amusing moments, but it didn't make me guffaw like the City Watch trilogy of books did. The section gives information on Teppic's character, which does inform the rest of the book, and is thus valuable. It was just missing something.There are also scenes back in the Kingdom, where Teppic's father is going a bit insane. He ends up falling off of a balcony while identifying with the local seagulls. Thus, Teppic is drawn back home to take his place. When Teppic gets back, he finds most of the rituals and values that dominate the kingdom grate with the values that he learned while he was in Ankh-Morpork. Meanwhile, Teppic's dad is dead, and he's not liking it.Things steamroll from there, and I won't give away any of the rest of the stuff. Once Teppic gets back home, things get a lot better in this book. The laughs come very frequently, and nothing is spared from Pratchett's wit. The take-off on the Trojan Horse story has to be seen to be believed, as well as the Philospher's Cafe. And next time you see a camel, you'll be wondering what's going through his head.The main problem with the book is that it seems a bit detached from the situation. In the City Watch books, most of the humour comes directly out of what is happening, making the events that Pratchett is describing feel important, at least to the characters. Pyramids, though, seems different than that. The jokes are funny, but the events that they are coming out of seem very inconsequential when you think about it. And when the event in question is as big as it is in this book (can't say more without spoilers), inconsequential is the last thing it should feel like.Still, that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the book. Some people don't like the zany, madcap type of humour that Pratchett delivers, and they should stay away from it. But it's certainly worth a pick up for anybody with a funny bone."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Time to turn a sacred cow into hamburger--Terry Pratchett, having established wizards, witches, and cranky policemen in his famed, kooky &quot;Discworld,&quot; turns his attention to ancient Egyptianesque surroudings, here the city of Djelibeybi (say it out loud) and its unfortunate pharaoh.Teppic is an unusually educated young pharaoh-to-be, the crown prince of Djelibeybi (&quot;Child of the Djel&quot;) whose father has a few seagulls in the attic, and overall is a harmless little guy. Teppic heads off to Ankh-Morpork to train to be an Assassin, but comes back home when his dad unexpectedly dies (it's unexpected because the poor guy thought he was a seagull and leaped off). Teppic is a relatively enlightening young man, who doesn't like feeding people to crocodiles, doesn't want to build a pyramid for his dad, isn't comfortable with being a living god, and doesn't relish the idea of marrying a close female relative.Unfortunately, the high priest (who is clearly insane) is holding the reins and doesn't intend to give them up to an upstart pharaoh. Teppic isn't entirely sure what to do about Dios, but he's sure that Dios's age-old ways are not the best ways. It's the century of the fruitbat, and Djelibeybi should live it that way!Among Dios's proclaimations is that the old pharaoh (who is hanging around with Death, and who wanted to be sent out to sea rather than sealed in a pyramid) be built a pyramid to end all pyramids. Enter some slightly deranged architects, who do their darndest to make it so. The problem is, the bigger the pyramid, the more likely it is to distort space-time &#65533; and this one proceeds to mess up the fabric of all Djelibeybi. Soon Dios is siccing the guards on Teppic and rebellious handmaiden Ptraci, the gods have come to life and refuse to behave &#65533; and over a thousand mummies are lurching out into Djelibeybi from their pyramids.Terry Pratchett is at his best when he takes accepted history/events/fantasy and twists them into hilarity. He takes the most absurd aspects of Egyptian culture and makes them into the bizarre land of Djelibeybi. Not even the Egyptian gods are free from Pratchett's spoofery, running around creating havoc--not to mention the enormous dung beetle carrying the sun.The teenage hero Teppic is an innocent bystander who just happens to be the sole legitimate heir of the old king, and his bewilderment at the various customs and traditions (which all date back centuries) is perfectly done. Ptraci is a typical Pratchett gal -- strong, independent, intelligent, and takes no guff from anyone, revealing handmaiden costume or none. The old king is also an enjoyable character, harmlessly nuts when he was alive, and when he died he ended up on a guided tour watching his own embalming (the poor guy has to watch his own organs being extracted, when all he wanted was to be sent out to sea), thus proving that Death is very willing to be nice. Accompanying them are Dios, the insane high priest who spends centuries controlling pharaohs, a bunch of freaked-out architects, a super-intelligent camel called &quot;You B*******&quot;, and a lot of deceased pharaohs (whose dialogue is priceless).This book, like many of Pratchett's, is acceptable for kids as there is minimal profanity, no sex, and not really any violence. Teens may identify with Teppic and Ptraci, but they are excellent characters to be read about for any age group.One of Pratchett's best novels. Also recommended are &quot;Jingo,&quot; &quot;The Truth,&quot; and so forth..."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Teppic, only legitimate son of the king of an impoverished kingdom, is sent to an assassins' school for his training.

Mysterious pyramids, a runaway handmaiden, an educated camel, and a friend from school all add to the complications leading to an interesting climax.

While his introductions may seem quite repetitive, each story is unique and causes one to contemplate sometimes weighty issues.

O. Henry focuses his curious literary microscope on the diverse lives of various residents of this famous metropolis. Some of his protagonists can claim idle-rich status, but more represent the middle class and many the poverty-stricken milieus. Indulgent readers will discover the flavor of a century past, rub shoulders with men on the other side of the law, and commiserate with thwarted lovers--all the while expecting the trademarkO. Henry ending with a Twist.But the author'sstyle reminds us of Wodehouse's moonstruck romantic pairs and even predate TV's innocuous &quot;Love, American Style&quot; episodes, in which we do not take their amorous escapades seriously. Then, to throw us off guard, he spikes the anthology with a few pathetic and even tragic stories. One wonders if he was gently trying to raise the social consciousness of the literate public.Various ethnic cgroups with their inherent city-acquired bigotry become the target of his witty pen, especially the Irish but also Italians. After all, his beloved olde New York was a true melting pot from the Ellis Island kitchen.Narrated in first as well as third person, these stories incorporateflagrant slang and one actually boasts a canine narrator! Theychallenge contemporary readers with antiquated vocabularyintermingled with literary, Biblical and artsy reference. O.

She believes imagination comes from God, though I don't consider this book religious. She abhors critics who judge but don't create. An enjoyable paradox since she critiques several pieces of writing, primarily for not being honest. She encourages free, messy, journal style writing in order find one's own voice.

Brenda Ueland proves that such thoughts just aren't true, that everyone has originality and talent. She also explains why 'constructive criticism' isn't really constructive at ALL.But this book isn't just a motivational tool - she also includes helpful suggestions for readers to actually get started on their writing.So if you want to write, but don't know how to get started, get this book - and go for it :)"},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"Brenda Ueland offers an on-going pep talk for the writer trying to find his/her place, trying to get started, or just reconsidering their craft.

I used a yellow hightlighter pen, and when I finished it, it was mostly yellow! Indeed, the title of this book should really have been &quot;The Art of Living.&quot; Even if it was written before my time, I think Brenda Ueland speaks for today's aspiring writer, painter, artist within, or creative entrepreneur... Through numerous examples, and some excellent quotes from William Blake or Van Gogh, Ueland shows you how to believe in yourself, and how to &quot;live life fully!&quot; I am now recommending that book to all my friends!

It has RUINED the aesthetics and sheer presence in the hand of an incredible, inspiring book for the creative writer. DO NOT buy this version. It looks like a vanity press gone even more wrong. The pages have no gutters, there are typos, no bio on Ms. Ueland which is VITAL to understanding the philosophy of this book. The cover \\"art\\" cheapens the subject matter (\\"Once upon a time\\"???! WHAT!!?). Ms. Ueland would be appalled to see her work presented in such a cheap way. What a disgrace. The publisher should be ASHAMED.It doesn't even have the original pub date -- 1938 -- in the nearly non-existent front matter. It reads: \\"First Printing, 2010\\" !! What the....!!? Did you know Ms. Ueland was born in 1891 and lived to be nearly 100? That info is not included in this version (surprise, surprise), but look her up online, learn about this woman, and you'll find her writings even more amazing.I have purchased dozens of copies of this book for friends and family -- copies of the older Graywolf Press version which is lovely, classy. Matches the dignity of the writing.I purchased this copy for a gift, and when it arrived and I looked it over, it wasn't fit to give. I am sending it back and just now bought an older copy from a third-party vendor via Amazon.REAL publishers: here is your chance to pick up the rights to this book and do it justice!!Here is my ORIGINAL review from January 2008 based on the Graywolf Press printing and true CONTENT presented beautifully: \\"If you're a writer, you must add this book to your shelf of writing references and \\"books to inspire.\\" A true writer's book on writing. I've repeatedly bought this as a gift for other writer friends. Oh to have been a student in one of her classes.

This book is on that list.Brenda Ueland's message is simple - yet profoundly impactful. She explains that each of us, if we are willing to trust and listen to TRUE selves - not what others think or society thinks we can become great writers (or painters or musicians).She hates critics. She believes that we all have the capacity to create great writing.. if we'll believe in our selves."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"Wow. This book was one of the best gifts I've ever received. It is incredible. I understand those, looking for something technical, would find it 'boring'. I used to be a biochemist, then a lawyer. Now, I'm a singer and landscape designer. Suddenly, it's clear: I am 'in' the world, but I am not 'of' the world. Being 'in your head' is essential (mustn't skip that step, esp for we head cases). But, FINALLY, I have experienced that what comes from the HEART is what lives forever. When I sing, people don't remember whether I got the right notes at the right time .... rather, they remember that they were deeply touched. You can touch people too!

This book gets to the core of writing, and reminds the reader of why a person loves to Create. I am 16 now, I got the book when I saw thirteen, and I still reread it every few months.

It stands the test of time because what it talks about are basic and intrinsic truths about writing and creating. Rather than proscribe exercises to work-out your writing muscles or other superficial tricks, Ueland tells you the basics of the CREATIVE PROCESS, which holds true for any kind of art. While these things are fundamental, they are not common knowledge. Many thanks to her for pointing out the building blocks in such a supportive and encouraging (and comical) way. You will want to write volumes after having read this."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I decided to read \\"If You Want to Write\\", since it was mentioned in Robert J. Ray's \\"The Weekend Novelist\\", which was immensely helpful to me in improving many areas of my writing. I had hit a bit of a stumbling block in my own writing, and, so I thought I'd see what a book of a different style had to offer. I'm glad to see that this book has gotten a new printing for 2007.I had gotten pretty good at all of the planning stages of writing; making character sketches, summaries of chapters/plot, and other related activities. But, as far as writing the actual text of the novel, I wasn't doing so well. I liked writing stories for fun, but I wasn't turning out anything publishable. When I looked over what I had written, I felt that it was lacking a certain quality, but I couldn't place what it was.The first aspect of this book that really struck me was its free-flowing, non-rigid structure. Many books that offer writing instruction are rather strict, telling the would-be author how to lay out their plot, how to write their opening scene. Not that this is always bad. 'The Weekend Novelist' has a very precise layout, of course allowing the writer creative liberties. Structure is good for keeping a person in-line and motivated about their novel, so they don't drift off to some other project. However, rigidity doesn't offer much inspiration for a beginning writer. This is where Ueland's little book comes in handy!\\"If You Want to Write\\" is peppered with valuable suggestions, coming from Ueland's own life-experience as a writer and her observations on the writing of others. Ueland's advice about writing for an audience in chapter 16 was quite useful to me: \\"...it helps often, to have an imaginary listener when you are writing, telling a story, so that you will be interesting and convincing throughout.\\" When I read this, I though, \\"Oh! This is what has been missing from my novel-writing all along.\\" You see, when I am writing my character sketches or plot summaries (or Amazon reviews!), my writing is better because I show them to people and I am KEEPING that fact in mind while writing them. When I am writing passages for my stories, I write differently. I am trying to hard to use clever words and I revise repeatedly with slight adjustments; I go into a panic, almost! The problem has been that I'm not keeping an audience in mind, since (when writing my stories) I'm not really writing to entertain an audience or for the purpose of sharing my ideas. There are numerous other helpful pieces of information scattered throughout, and the reader will probably find passages such as the above that shed light on what has been missing from their own writing.The last chapter summarizes the guidelines given in the book, which I'll abridge here: 1) \\"Know that you have talent, are original, and have something important to say.\\", 2) \\"Know that it is good to work. Work with love and think of liking it when you do it.\\", 3) \\"Write freely, recklessly in first drafts.\\", 4) \\"Tackle anything you want to-novels, plays, anything.\\", 5) \\"Don't be afraid of writing bad stories. To discover what is wrong with a story, write two new ones and then go back to it.\\", 6) \\"Don't be ashamed of what you've written in the past\\", 7) \\"Try to discover your true self.\\", 8) \\"Think of yourself as incandescent power.\\", 9) \\"If you are never satisfied with what you write, that is a good sign. It means your vision can see so far that it is hard to come up to it.\\", 10), Quote from Van Gogh: \\"If you hear a voice within you saying: You are no painter, then paint by all means lad, and that voice will be silenced, but only by working.\\", 11) \\"Don't be afraid of yourself when you write.\\", and 12) \\"Don't always be appraising yourself, wondering if you are better or worse than other writers.\\""},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"The more I read from Ueland, the more I became convinced that I had found a book that would be yellowed and dog-eared on my bedside table thirty years from now. Each observation that she makes feels so common-sensical, friendly and right at its core that it seems as though someone ought to have pointed it all out to you before. This is not the typical self-conscious guide to life or writing; it's a conversation and an excercise in encouragement."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"The book seems quite archaic in viewpoint now, and could be updated for modern readers. Still Ueland makes a great point, that you need to wrtie with soul and passion from your heart, not strive for some lofty, arty goal. She points out what is wrong with much of popular culture today, it seems more an imitation of greatness than greatness. In a sense, you can't fake soul and heart. If it doesn't come from you, the reader will know. Still, the book takes forever to make its points and Ueland's constant &quot;I'll try and tell you about it later&quot; proclamations throughout the book make you wonder if this wasn't a first draft. Like most writing books, this one is a wee bit overrated. Wanna write, do it."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"Undoubtedly Mrs. Ueland was a nice woman but this book is self-indulgent fluff.

If you already are confident that you can write, but simply haven't opened the doors to your creativity, you may want to search for other reading material."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This book is based upon Brenda Ueland's experience teaching creative writing to adults and her success at freeing many of her students from inhibitions that prevented them from writing well. It is basically a \\"pep talk\\" for anyone who thinks they cannot write or have nothing important to say. And it has some interesting insights about the mysterious nature of inspiration and the role leisure plays in creativity. [\\"Leisure: The Basis of Culture,\\" by Josef Pieper, is a more advanced exploration of this theme.] However, the book is interlaced with so much dubious philosophy that I cannot recommend it.For example, on page 129, Brenda begins with this gem: \\"I have come to think that the only way to become a better writer is to become a better person.\\" However, she then ruins this thought by saying that by \\"better person\\" she does not mean a good person \\"for a great person often does things that so-called good people think very bad indeed.\\" She does not explain what she means by a great person. But it seems to mean someone who is an independent thinker; an astute observer who does not accept social conventions or values that cannot be affirmed through their own inner wisdom. Brenda does not consider the possibility that one's inner \\"truth\\" can be faulty.She relies upon quotations from the poet William Blake (one of her great people), entitling Chapter Five: \\"Sooner Strangle an Infant in its Cradle than Nurse Unacted Desires,\\" based upon one of his noble sentiments about deferred gratification. Blake saw visions and heard voices which he believed were Divine rather than demonic. Brenda also prefers this interpretation and thus agrees with Blake's conclusion that our inner voice which says \\"Thou shalt\\" is our true conscience, while the voice that counsels \\"Thou shalt not\\" is the product of learned behavior and should be rejected. (See page 13 and footnote on page 35.)Later, on page 174, the author reveals herself to be a ho-hum, garden-variety relativist. She writes, \\"If it is true to you, it is true. Another truth may take its place later. What is truly from me is true, whether anybody believes it or not. It is my truth.\\"The problem with all this philosophy is that the author tells the reader that they too must tend toward the amoral and asocial aspects of the psychopathic personality if they want to be an independent thinker and hence, a great writer. She teaches that the end justifies the means. Whatever gets the creative juices flowing is justified. And the stream of consciousness that gushes forth, whether polluted or pristine, is art. It is art because it is true to the inner self of the artist, who has learned to cast off all restraint, fear, and ambition. (I wonder what Brenda would think about the latest notions of modern psychology that radical independence is a less mature emotional state than cooperative inter-dependence?)Finally, the author presents her view as an either/or scenario. Either you adopt the reckless and rule-less approach to writing, or you're creativity will be stymied. She does not allow for the option that one can be creative and value-oriented at the same time. Potential readers of this work should be aware that behind the enthusiastic pep talk there lurks a relativistic philosophy which may not correspond with their personal beliefs."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I ordered my book from lynn bookcase and got it just a few days later.Yes, I would order from them again.

Being a writer (Catholic Business Journal, blogs, and Amazon book reviews), an oil painter, and curious, I picked up a copy to see why all the fuss about a book that was originally published in 1938. I have since learned that none other than Carl Sandburg provided his endorsement to \\"The best book ever written about how to write.\\"Author Brenda Ueland was born in Minneapolis (my former home) in 1891, and lived on Lake Calhoun (the lake featured in the Mary Tyler Moore show's opening clip). She was knighted by the King of Norway and set an international swimming record (for over-80-year-olds). She died in 1985 at the age of 93.This book, according to many preceding me, has inspired thousands to find the creative genius buried deep within, and to express it without any regard to \\"criticism, self-doubt, duty, nervous fear, anxiety, about making a living, and fear of not excelling.\\" Ueland affirms that we are all filled with possibility, have a creative power which be kept alive in all of us for all of our lives. It is our Spirit and we keep it alive by using it.This book is a gem and is bound to inspire all to open up, explore their Spirit, and put it to good use. I would expand Sandburg's quote to - maybe the best book ever written on using our inner genius and creativity, whether it is writing, composing, or the visual arts.

This is the best book I've ever read on writing. Brenda Ueland claims there are two types of writing coaches: those who are critical, clenching types, and those who are angels, sent from beyond to encourage anyone--experienced or not--to put words down, without trying to be \\"literary\\" or too clever or cute, but simply tell a story with honesty and generosity towards the reader.

The book is directed more toward fiction writers than those who specialize in nonfiction, but some of Ueland's suggestions can be applied universally. For example, be passionate about your subject. Otherwise your article or manuscript will be as dry as a newspaper article, and just as forgettable."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I read this book when I was 13, so I can't vouch for how useful it might be to an adult reader. All I know is that no book has changed my life as dramatically as this one did when I was 13. I'm only slightly exaggerating when I say that this book has the power to cure minor mental disorders and to help you find direction in your life. Reading this book was like one long epiphany for me. It is an energizing read, written in simple, clear, vivacious prose by a woman without a shred of pomposity but with fierce, passionate beliefs about art and individualism, a la William Blake.Looking at this book from a more detached perspective, I think Ueland could justly be viewed as a proponent of American Romanticism, a scion of the nature-based (as opposed to nurture-based, or formal-education-based) philosophical tradition that gave us greats like Whitman and Thoreau. If you liked \\"Walden,\\" you'll almost definitely love this book. It's quite a bit like Walden in spirit, actually, except that its scope is somewhat narrower and it's less self-righteous and significantly easier to read."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This book will sing for you.

I'm not sure where I got this copy, but I added it to my collection. I tried, several times, to get into it, but always looked for something more substantial after reading a few pages. So, I confess: I haven't read the whole work. I did read about 50 pages, then skimmed through the rest of it. The author means well, and apparently meets the needs of some readers, but I found it to be light and fluffy, with talk about divine ego and soul and so on. I thought it was poorly edited, but I could have overlooked that to a certain degree, if the book had more \\"meat\\" in it for me.I took it off my shelves and put it together with books I'm donating to the used-book sale of my local library. Skeptical of my view? Well, the Suggested Reading list (very spare and geared to positive thinking, not writing a book) had a couple of titles about thinking yourself rich and the laws of success. I think this gives a fair idea of the mindset of the author of this slight book. The one I have is a BN Publishing copy. I had no idea when the book was written or what qualifications, if any, the author had. Perhaps it was good in its day, considering circumstances, but it had little of value for me.Want a good book for an aspiring writer? Try The Art of War for Writers.

While the language can seem a bit dated at times, the meaning shines clearly through; clearly she has taken her own advice or writing truly and focusing on the things one cares about or is passionate about. To read it is almost to become hypnotized by her major themes: you are talented, you have a story or an observation to tell, you can write really well if you are true (not trying to be writerly), you need to enjoy the act of writing and be lazy about it, you need to relax and enjoy the beginnings in hazy territory. This is a good book to read to get you back into old habits, or to help writers re-assess their long-held and perhaps erroneous beliefs about what it actually takes to be a good writer. Ueland excerpts student writing to show examples, and the pieces she uses are very compelling, strong and true. I recommend this to writers and as gifts for writers. But I wouldn't suggest it for someone younger than 25. There is something in it that would be offputting for someone too youthful, too inexperienced."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This book is more about spirituality than it is a how to on writing.

No matter how down and out you may be, wherever you may be in your life, &quot;If You Want to Write&quot; will bring you back to your higher self, reminding you that &quot;you have talent, are original, and have something important to say.&quot; Sometimes that's all one needs to hear (or realize all over again) in order to take the next step in their lives."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I remember browsing the bookstore where I worked for a book to help me in my writing endeavors. I picked this book up for that purpose and found that it was about so much more! Substitute writing in the title for anything that you want to accomplish in life, especially if it is something like writing or acting that people who really do care at the core try to convince you isn't safe. Bullocks to that!"},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"Reading this book is like having coffee with your most encouraging friend. If you're a writer or want to write, you need to this book. It will sit on your shelf waiting for those emergency times when you think you'll never write again. Somehow Brenda Ueland distilled her teaching skills into writing for each of us to access as needed throughout our careers."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"There's good reason to be thoughtful about a simply-written little book on writing how-to's that has been in continuous print since 1938. What are there - a gazillion books today on writing, all with catchy titles and \\"must-read\\" splashed on the cover? This jewel of unconventional wisdom will open universal, long-hidden synapses and open a creative flood. Treat yourself - and then go write."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This beautiful book about writing and life is probably the best I've read, and I have a whole shelf of books about writing. I've been inspired, and am finally beginning to put thoughts on paper. I've purchased two of this book and have shared it with friends in my writing class. They both have agreed with me; one saying it has changed his life."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"The woman who wrote this book will make you believe that you CAN write, that writing in your own voice is what makes you a compelling writer, and that your story - told in your own way of writing - will be interesting to the reader. This book doesn't address \\"good\\" and \\"proper\\" grammar. She simple welcomes you to write. It's lovely. It's about more than writing. It's about being true to yourself and respecting your creative self. I've given copies away because I love it so much. The only thing I feel sad about with this edition is that there is no photograph of the writer. The older versions have her picture. She's amazing with wrinkles and wild hair and a beautiful smile. I loved the book for that picture alone and I will be searching used book stores for the older version and will undoubtedly give this new book away too."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This book is so inspiring, you can't help but start your career as a writer..."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I found this book very encouraging.

It is to be read over and over: not only is it a writing guide, it is therapy. Truly a wonder."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"Some of the author's expressions are delightfully dated (written in the 30s), but that just adds to the charm. She is absolutely convinced that everyone has the ability to write honestly and well. And her enthusiasm can motivate almost anyone to write. There are lots of good ideas here, but the main value is her relentlessly cheerful belief in her readers."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"At Christmas, I came across my copy of this book, purchased in 1988. I have since re-read it many times. I also purchased a copy and had it shipped to my friend who has written 12 books on economics, Dr. George Glen Dawson. Glen, as I call him, participates in several writing groups on Long Island, NY. His inspiration to me as a mentor and friend and his love of writing showed me that he would love this book and sharing copies of it with the writing groups he participates in.This book, reread many years after it's purchase, and much additional business experience AND formal education, has shown me much about living, loving, authenticity, writing, and art.Dr. Dawson's validation of my writing has challenged me to do more of it as well.He is my \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" kind of guy, a friend, a teacher, a guide.I loved the book. It inspires me anytime I feel I am NOT up to a task or a writing assignment or living authentically for others and for myself.Read it a few pages at a time, enjoy it like a lovely, delicious dessert that feeds your mind and your heart.Thankfully, I did read this while selling advertising for The Wall Street Journal some years ago. It served me there, and it served me in graduate school a few months after purchasing this book.Thank you, Brenda Ueland.

I almost felt as if I were reading a book written by a teen. Apparently there are many would be artists of every sort, writers in particular, who have no confidence to even begin their art. After the first chapter, I began reading the book faster and faster because I got tired of reading the refrain \\"You are unique, you need confidence\\" etc. Her editor didn't catch an important missing word and the passages included for demonstration are in the same font as Ueland's, so often it is cloudy whether the paragraph is a continuation of the quote or Ueland's words. I am happy for those who were inspired by Ueland's suggestions. The ideas were valid, just overstated."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This book is great for (re)building your confidence . . . yes, you do have something important to say!

I understood what Ueland was saying, but it didn't reach me the way Cameron's book did.It's an older book and it felt outdated to me. Would recommend Cameron's or King's before this one."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"First of all - English is my second language, I am deeply sorry for my mistakes.---It is hard to describe my disappointment with Ueland's book. What a waste of time and money. It is so short, yet so painfully repetitive, filled with long excerpts taken from diaries and letters of few famous artists (mostly van Gogh, Blake and \\"Great Russians\\") and pupils from Ueland's writing class.While the author often mocks the great writers that she personally does not like (Steinbeck? Scott Fitzgerald, seriously?), her own style is desperately dull and non-inventive. Not to mention useless tirades full of Coelho'esque esoteric cliches and countless references to God and Christianity.What really irritated me was the contrast between her (self-proclaimed) modesty and frequent, mean attacks against everyone, who does not blindly flow with his or her emotions and contempt for everyone, who dares to think critically (her advice for a man that brought up his kids in rational atmosphere - \\"I think he might as well have taken them out in the backyard and killed them with an ax\\").All these tendencies culminate in the Chapter XVII, which basically encourages all people to become compulsive writers and just fill the world with nonsensical flood of words. In the last paragraphs Ueland expresses her conviction, that emotions (unlike arguments and facts) are always a great positive force. I simply can not agree with that - many mass murderers and tyrants considered themselves artists, without reason and moral introspection art can be a great destructive force, too!Ueland finishes with following words : \\"I believe this book will hasten the Millenium by two or three hundreds years\\". So much for her modesty, I guess."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I purchased this for my daughter.

Instead of repeating those well-deserved praises, I'll comment on three powerful points that Brenda Ueland advances for developing writers.First, we are all capable of writing creatively. If we consciously experience the world we live in and the people we encounter, then we can write about them. Ueland offers many excellent cases in point to prove her argument.Second, you won't learn to write creatively from what you learned in school. In fact, school might beat the creativity out of you. Sir Ken Robinson ([...]) has a lot to say in support of this viewpoint. Therefore, you'll have to look for other sources of inspiration and methods of writing to get started.Third, those inspirations and methods are readily available to you. Ueland provides many throughout \\"If You Want to Write\\" as do numerous books by the likes of Ray Bradbury, Stephen King, Anne Lamott, William Zinsser, and many others who have borrowed liberally from her.So read her 1938 magnum opus not with a mindset to critique what might now seem quaint or trite or irrelevant for today's electronic writer. Rather, read it at face value, trying those long solitary walks and writing exercises she recommends. If you haven't tried them, you'll find them transformative."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This book is a treasure and a necessity for the creative person--or anyone who believes that the human spirit has no limits.The most valuable thing about this book is that Ueland is ENCOURAGING.

I began reading this book on the Summer Solstice of June 1987 (I scribbled the date inside the book cover)and have read it in bits and pieces ever since. No matter what page my gemini mind jumps to, a jewel jumps back at me. This morning it was:\\"I used to have to drive myself to work. You cannot imagine what an uncomfortable, effortful thing it was supposed to be, to be a writer... It was my class who showed me I was working in the wrong way... I learned from them that inspiration does not come like a bolt, nor is it energetic striving, but it comes to us slowly and quietly all the time, though we must regularly and every day give it a little chance to start flowing, prime it with a little solitude and idleness. I learned that you should feel when writing, not like Lord Byron on a mountain top, but like a child stringing beads in kindergarten,--happy, absorbed and quietly putting one bead on after another.\\"Go Look Inside This Book and see for yourself what it's all about. I especially recommend it if you are a woman at midlife and beyond!

Eye-opening and at times controversial, but always honest."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"First published in 1938, \\"If You Want to Write\\" presents the philosophy of writing (indeed, of all creativity) that Brenda Ueland taught for many years at the Minneapolis YWCA. The title of the first chapter presents her premise: \\"Everybody is talented, original, and has something important to say,\\" and subsequent chapters guide readers in how to tease out their own talent and originality so that it \\"infects\\" readers. Though her details do evoke the 1930s, her observations of human nature remain spot-on to 2008.Ueland's message is encouraging and inspirational and true. My quibbles concern aspects of the book's editing (non-editing?). First, the punctuation and formatting (extra and omitted commas; footnotes) interfered with my reading and I had to re-read numerous sentences to make sense of them. Second, Ueland tends to introduce a topic but then note that she'll deal with it later; I didn't keep track of what she was postponing, but did keep wondering whether she ever got back to all of it. Overall, the writing has a somewhat sloggy (first-draft) feel rather than that of a tightened manuscript.In the genre, I'd instead recommend: Anne Lamott's fabulous \\"Bird by Bird\\"; Dorothea Brande's \\"Becoming a Writer\\" (also pubbed in the 1930s); and John Gardner's \\"On Becoming a Novelist.\\""},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I happened by this book while browsing a bookstore. I luckily bought it. I read it cover to cover the next day. I never read a book cover to cover. It was so applicable to my son and his mother and I. He is studying music. The book isn't just about writing, it's about art. It's about pursuing art for art's sake. It's about pursuing life for life's sake. It gives us permission to tell our son to concentrate on making music and that making money should not be the driving force behind it. I think an 18 year old needs to hear this, if he hasn't already figured it out. The author tells us we all know the way as children. Trash is inserted in our heads as we grow up and we then spend most of your lives trying to remove it. If you know an artist or someone that needs a lift, but this book for them. What the author wrote in 1938 stills applies today."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"Brenda Ueland, an esteemed writing teacher, was said to have written 6 million words in her lifetime of 93 years. She said she had two rules that she absolutely followed: To tell the truth, and not to do anything she didn't want to do.Euland's first chapter title states: \\"Everybody Is Talented, Original, and Has Something to Say\\". What a vote of confidence for the aspiring, timid writer. Every ensuing chapter contains fresh insights that will expand the mind, and stir the imagination.She writes of lofty things. Of poetry and sonnets. Of Shakespeare, Doystoyevsky, Chekhov, and the Third Dimension. Her observations of other writers works are captivating.When speaking of T.E Lawrence and his \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\\" she notes: \\"It is a work of genius, and the beauty of his writing has not been seen in English for a long time. I think it is because of the Third Dimension, the great personality of Lawrence behind it. Instead of him living a sedentary, literary life, polishing sentences, and cultivating a prose style, he lived a great life with supernatural standards for himself of courage, suffering, endurance, and honor. And so his book is better writing than a century of merely literary men.\\"Euland has a theory about him. \\"Lawrence seems to me like an Elizabethan Englishman, and his writing has the same quality. In Elizabeth's time, during the Renaissance, people felt that the \\"personality\\" was the important thing, not a man's ideas alone or his work.\\"She points out how that has changed. Today we might say \\"Do not pay attention to his \\"personality\\" it is his ideas that are the important thing\\".The author wears many hats throughout the book. She's not only a writing teacher, but a cheerleader, mentor, history teacher, and guide. She speaks of the need for great national literature, and that it is because of the critics, the doubters (in the outer world and within ourselves) that we have such hesitancy when we write.In the last chapter (p.160) Euland sums up her advice to the writer and artist:1). Know that it is good to work.2). Work with love and think of liking it when you do it.3). It is easy and interesting.4). It is a privilege.5). There is nothing hard about it, but your anxious vanity and fear offailure.6). Try to discover your true, honest, untheoretical self.Euland's book feels like a meditation and examination of the writing life. To me, it had a dreamy, calming quality, as if writing might be the most natural of all mankind's endeavours. Her book is a great gift for any writer or artistic person.It is one of those gems that can be re-read and referred back to for fresh insights and encouragement when the writer is feeling discouraged and bogged down. It's a reminder that we can create beauty from our creative effort and enrich our own lives, as well as others.

It was the luckiest accident of my life. At that point I had been a professional writer for more than twenty years, but I rarely enjoyed my work, and I felt all of it was disposable in one way or another. At first, reading &quot;If You Want to Write&quot; gave me an incredible, if unfamiliar, feeling of joy and self-confidence. Afterwards, I began to surprise the hell out of myself in terms of what I was able to accomplish. This simply written book states some of the most profound truths about life and creativity I have ever read. Whenever I get stuck on a project I go back and re-read it, and its warmth, generosity, and brilliance always inspire me to go on. It should almost be titled &quot;If You Want to Live&quot;, because far more than being a how-to book on writing, it makes an eloquent argument that we all can live creative lives as long as we're true to ourselves."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I will admit from the start that this book is not for everyone. It won't appeal to all writers and artists. However, I believe the book was written for people who are looking for a way to lead an authentic life and to achieve authenticity in their art. As with Natalie Goldberg's WRITING DOWN THE BONES, this book feels as though it was written just for me, and that's the true beauty of IF YOU WANT TO WRITE. If the book speaks to you, as it did to me, you may find yourself having the first great epiphany of your artistic life. Her book sits in a prominent place in my home and in my heart. I have read it many times and underlined countless passages. As I struggled to finish my first book, I looked to Ueland for support and confidence. By far the two most memorable passages for me are the one in which she describes a time she was playing the piano and was told her playing wasn't \\"going anywhere.\\" She then discusses the relationship that MUST exist between the artist and the person experiencing the art. (Her philosophy is strongly influenced by the observations of Tolstoy.) She points out that this relationship is necessary in order for us to produce meaningful art. The second passage that is extremely meaningful to me is related to the first passage. She describes the time Vincent Van Gogh wrote a letter to his brother and drew a tender image of a streetlight that he was looking at outside his window. The drawing is beautiful because it came out of his intense love for his brother and his desire to share something beautiful with him, not from a desire for recognition or fame. This is what Ueland means by authenticity, which she, like Blake, connects to the divine source existing within each individual. This book changed forever the way I view the artistic expression."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"Brenda Ueland was one of my dearest friends. Her wisdom and gentle humor has sustained me through many years. If You Want to Write is an outstanding book on not only how to write but how to live fully -- with grace, joy, humor and compassion. It is &quot;first-rate,&quot; as Brenda would say. Once you have found this book, don't let it get away from you. Keep copies handy. One year, I gave copies of the book to my family and friends for Christmas. They all loved it. It soon became one of those books that everyone must read -- for reading this book seemed to make everyone a better person. How is that? Maybe one of the reasons is because it &quot;takes the pressure off&quot; to be a &quot;good writer&quot; or a &quot;good person.&quot; Just be who you are in an authentic and joyful way -- and you can't help but be &quot;good.&quot; Open the book to any page, and you will find her words funny, creative, loving and truthful --thumbing her nose at all the pessimists in the world.Brenda had a delightful sense of humor. She jokingly insisted on renaming me &quot;Countess Francesca&quot; because, &quot;Names are very important, and Deborah is just too stern and biblical.&quot; This was just her way with everyone -- funny, uplifting and endearing. And her book, If You Want to Write, will make you feel just as special, as if she is sitting right there with you, laughing with you and helping you every step of the way. Enjoy this women's words -- hold them in your heart. Brenda is a rare spirit. Avanti!"},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"Read this book. Read it all the way through. You might say to yourself &quot;this is juvenile. This is nave.&quot; But read it. Press on. Read it thoroughly. Set your mind on &quot;accept&quot; and let the book be right all the time.Then, read it again. Keep reading it when you are not writing. Randomly pick a page and start. Read it out of order. Perhaps you'll find the Blake, or the Van Gogh; one of her students, or one of her tirades against the niggardly busy-busy world. Read it while watching T.V.(but not while driving a car!)Soon, you just can't read it anymore. Because it's tedious? Because you've memorized it? Because its pages are stained with finger oil and falling apart?Because you will be too damn busy furiously writing. And rewriting, then writing again. You will fear--with a creaky feeling in your gut--that a short break may jettison the idea you're blessed with off into the unexpressed void, then banish the next one, and the next one, like a home-run slugger on a roll at batting practice, all which demand permanence--because they all got that something. And you don't dare stop typing (at 75 W.P.M, with pauses of concentrated, exacting thought between) because you must, you absolutely soulfully must, capture this thought perfectly, then quickly move on to the next antsy thought tapping its toe impatiently behind, before it gets insulted and walks out to planet nowhere in a huff.So read it. And I hope you read it so much that you just don't have the time to read it anymore, and it is gathering dust while your page is gathering words."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"A friend gave me this book for Christmas because he knew I liked to write and told me it was the best book for writing. I was skeptical, but started the book anyhow so I could at least tell him I looked at it. I found it immediately engaging and savored every page, limiting myself to a few pages a night so I wouldn't finish it quickly. The best part is that it is an &quot;idea&quot; writing book rather than an exercise book. There is no stopping to jot down notes or pages with writing exercises. Ueland gets into ideas and the psychology of why we do and don't write certain things. It got my brain churning, and I found myself become less inhibited with a project I was trying to get to the next level on. Excellent book for the experience writer who is feeling a need to break through to some fresh material. Ueland is amazingly insightful and even though it is written in 1938, it does not feel dated."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I decided to read this book on the advice of another author, Harold Klemp. Well, I don't regret it! Being a French speaking reader, I usually take a long time to read an English book, but I took 4 days to go through this one! I used a yellow hightlighter pen, and when I finished it, it was mostly yellow! Indeed, the title of this book should really have been &quot;The Art of Living.&quot; Even if it was written before my time, I think Brenda Ueland speaks for today's aspiring writer, painter, artist within, or creative entrepreneur... Through numerous examples, and some excellent quotes from William Blake or Van Gogh, Ueland shows you how to believe in yourself, and how to &quot;live life fully!&quot; I am nos recommending that book to all my friends! But, please don't believe me... experience it by yourself!"},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I first learned about IF YOU WANT TO WRITE from one of my college roommates. Several of the students in one of his theatre classes were reading the book and he suggested that I read it as well. As a struggling Artist myself, I eventually read the book and though I remember reading it, I didn't remember anything from the book. Having recently committed myself to discipline myself in my own writing, I decided to re-read the book. In re-reading it I now understand why I didn't remember much of what I had read the first time.IF YOU WANT TO WRITE is basically an extensive letter of encouragement to anyone who wants to do anything creative. The book does not offer any practical advice about how to find an agent, how to get published, etc. The book does not really offer any practical advice about writing either, e.g. writing prompts, ideas, etc. Instead the book does offer encouragement about being passionate about one does, remaining diligent in what one loves, and practicing one's craft (whatever that maybe).I can understand why so many people have gained encouragement from this book. For someone who is a beginning Artist (of any craft) who has become frustrated or for anyone who wants to create Art but is afraid to try because of being told by someone in the past that they weren't talented, the book could just be the boost that they need. Personally, however, I just didn't take much away from IF YOU WANT TO WRITE. I wasn't inspired in anyway and wasn't all that encouraged after having read it.I'd recommend this book for beginning Artists of any sort (whether they be writers, actors, musicians, etc.) or someone who is interested in creating Art but doesn't feel adequate about their talents."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This book is just fantastic! I was looking for a book to give me inspiration on my writing and this is it! I wasn't so sure at first, I was afraid of yet another fusty, musty textbook-twin that would give helpful hints but bore me to tears. But from the first page I was hooked! &quot;...most people must break through a shell of timidity and strain.&quot; What encouragement! This book proved to me that there are other downtrodden creative people out there, people who have had &quot;contructive criticism&quot; shoved down their throats until it nearly killed them. Plus, the strain of being pressured to &quot;make a living&quot; from your writing. Instead, Brenda Ueland encourages in the most enlivening way to write because you love to! And in her mind this applies to anyone, this is not just a book about writing. It is inspiration for ANYONE who is afraid to follow their true creative spirit.She says that Van Gogh painted not because it was expected of him or because he wanted to make a profit from it, rather he painted the stars in the sky because he loved them and wanted to show other people how beautiful they are, he wanted them to be seen from his perspective so that others might share in his wonder! How can that fail to inspire all downtrodden sensitive creators?In this book, Ueland shows how to bypass all negative feedback from others, how to search inside ourselves to find our true motives for creating literature, artwork, whatever we love the most! She is able to bring out the unique creative nature in everyone (for if everyone is different, then everyone IS original!) and in the process make us happy with what we find inside."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"There aren't enough stars for this review. Ueland writes an amazing book on how to achieve our potential in anything that we do...and the things (such as trying to please other people) which prevent us from bringing forth the best from ourselves. Already I've found that I have better and brighter ideas when I write, and even when I do other things like play music.This book is one that is best read slowly...in short doses. I find that I can't read a page without having something to think about or reassess in my life and especially in my writing. I wholeheartedly recommend this book."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"Reading this book will lead you to different ways of thinking about your writing and your life. The heart behind the words shines through and you feel more like you're having a conversation with a trusted friend than reading a book. &quot;Art is infection,&quot; Brenda Ueland titles one chapter and this book is definately art by that definition. She infects you, across the boundry of time as only printed words can, with her enthusiasm for writing and her gusto for life. Throughout, she builds up your confidence and ignites your passion while also telling you that not everything she suggests may work for you. Try it, see if you like it, and if it doesn't help your writing, move on. There are no &quot;oughts,&quot; there is only your authentic voice.Also, she touches on the fact that she wrote this book about writing because that is her form of art. Everyone has the artistic spark within them and you can as easily show your particular passion through sewing, or house building or ditch digging as through writing. While a handbook for better writing this is also a guidebook for a happier life."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This is my favorite writing book (as an author of 36 published books). It is also one of my favorite books to re-read. I read it over again to experience my visit with Brenda Ueland afresh as well as to be reminded of what she teaches. Though she has gone on to her reward long ago she still speaks. She penned this book in 1938 and it still sells well. Carl Sandburg said it may have been the best book about writing he'd ever read. She doesn't deal with dry grammar and such, but deals with the human spirit and how to communicate with -- what she calls -- \\"microscopic truthfullness\\". My favorite quotes from this book, which I carry in my heart, are these: \\"Everyone is unique, talented, and has something important to say...\\" along with \\"Writing is talking on paper.\\" It is delightful to see Ms Ueland demonstrate what she teaches in her own writing and that of the humble students in her class whose writing samples she shares.

Brenda Ueland has written this manifesto for everyone who has anything in them to share to spur them on. I love the wording, I love the quotes from her favorite people, I love her artists sensibility and that she gets the way a writer's mind works. She was and is (because being that she was a writing teacher, this book screams of her living spirit) THE voice for a writer lost in their own mind, trying to latch on to guidance and do their thing.I simply love her and this book is why I do."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"Hands down, the best book on writing ever written, in English, that is.

After struggling to begin writing this book gave me the confidence to start. It let me know why I would want to write for reasons beyond money. It also gave me clarity on what I should expect from reviewers, and why I should learn to ignore some of them. A book which gives us an insight into how the great artists looked upon their work."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I was able to get this book for free (lent to me) but I would have gladly paid list price and them some for this book. Although it felt sometimes like i was reading a \\"classic\\" due to the social references and phrasing, the words Brenda Ueland shares are time and again are inspirational, often poetic while still being succinct and concise.I will admit that I did a little skimming here and there, but I do that with a lot of books. This book isn't broken down into tiny little how-to write bites; think of it more as a unit-- confidence building pep-talks, inner-editor silencing realizations, and multiple of before & after samples of writing from people who heeded her advice and wrote true to themselves.Even though I read it for free, I'll probably buy it as a pseudo-reference book to keep on my ipad for those (often) times when I need a bit of inspiration or a creative kick in the can."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This is a classic work from a bygone era.

I got worried because it seems that no version of this book gets high marks and people either are in love with the author and love the book or find it only somewhat helpful. It turned out to be OK for me.My book was published by Bottom of the Hill Publishing and to me it is well done. I understand that people have their preferences on how things look, there is mention about chapter titles being on the left in one review. This copy looks fine to me. The footnotes are at the end of the chapters not in the text as in others. There are odd spellings and words but I believe that they are common the period which this book was written. All in all the book looks good, and the cover is what attracted me, someone mentioned the \\"once upon a time...\\", which I find quaint.As for the subject matter and its presentation, I found it interesting but not fantastic. It was written in the 1930's and at that time may have been cutting edge but I know of many blogs that inspired me much more and have more relevant information. It was also difficult to follow at times.If you are interested in writing it's a book to read but don't stop with it."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I can't begin to tell you how much I enjoyed reading this book.

Wish I'd been one of her students; reading this book is as close as I'll ever get."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I found this woman to be a bit crazy. One minute she's saying that you should never ever criticize someone's writing, next minute she's telling us which sample of writing is better than the other and which we should emulate. She actually says that her students' writing was better than someone who's already been published, which was alright at first but after about 10 different examples of her bashing the published writer, I found her to be quite pompous. All writing is subjective, and I don't see what gives her the right to tell us which writing is BETTER than another, based on HER point of view. I felt like I was being yanked around by a leash. She also says we should just sit around being lazy and idle, and that it's a good thing. I'm sorry, I just don't see it her way. It's like a recipe for disaster. Anyway, that's just my take on it. Take from it what you will."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This book is considerably boring!! It provided me information that I already know.

Kawasaky reccomended it for anybody wanting to program computer software. He was RIGHT! As a musician, a composer, a teacher and a programmer I can't stop telling others how great this book is. YOU GOT TO READ IT! If you don't like I will buy it back from you.

Within the frame of the writing profession, the author talks about the need for passion, practice, and diligence to build competence and then expertise. She also covers how to have a good life along the way. While those coming to this book looking for Strunk & White, volume 2, will be disappointed, those looking for a quick boost of inspiration will be well served."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This is my first exposure to this book so I'm left wondering if all the printings are the same.

Some help me with grammar, some help me with structure, but this little book has shown me how writing can become a means of growing mentally and spiritually as a writer--and thus improve one's writing. Ueland has great confidence in us as storytellers. We all do it, whether at the end of the day or in the laudrymat. She shows how to do it on paper and gives us confidence: \\"You will find you have something to say. And tomorrow there will be more [p42].\\""},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"The best book about writing that I've ever read.

But, its subtitle is more succint, \\"A Book about Art, Independence and Spirit.\\" The book answers the question \\"Why should we all use our creative power and write or paint or play music, or whatever it tells us to do?\\"She uses examples from Blake, Chekhov, Tolstoi, Sandburg and other creative writers, and sprinkles in Mozart, Van Gogh, Monet and God. We read much about imagination and creativity, and how our internal and external critics suppress us. She explores how to bring what is inside us all to the surface and to be thankful for it. If your are exploring your imagination and creativity, be it through writing, drawing, composing, acting, programming, entreprenuering or just living life, read this book, savor it and then read it again. You'll like it."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I first read this book 2 years ago but consult it frequently.

This vague summary may make it sound difficult or boring, but in fact it is written in a friendly, energetic style. If you want to write--if you want to create, period--this book will be worth your time."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I read this book on a whim and in it, I felt not only inspired by Brenda Ueland's writing, I can read and hear her echo in many of the writers who followed her.Its amazing to think, for example, that this book was written when my mother was 6 years old back in 1938. Makes me wonder what books are being written THIS YEAR that my six year old daughters daughter, at 41 will say, \\"Wow, this voice is from 1938? And she is so present to today!\\"As a writer and a teacher of writing myself, I have spoken words similar to these crafted by Ueland: \\"No writing is a waste of time-- no creative work where the feelings, the imagination, the intelligence must work. With every sentence you write, you have learned something. It has done you good. It has stretched your understanding.\\"While the book is written in a sometimes rambly form that makes my left brained side shout \\"What was the editor thinking when s/he organized this darn thing?!\\" at the same time I think this exact feature is one which teaches by example as well. Rambly, unorganized, out of order, pieces dropped and not necessarily re-picked up... its ok. Its life. Its ok. As I just quoted \\"It has stretched your understanding.\\"My copy is heavily underlined and dog eared... even though it is less than a year old I have gone back to favored sections repeatedly.Read this one and you will have a brand new \\" haven't we met somewhere before?\\" friend on your bookshelf to enjoy for a long, long time."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This is an excellent work. It is a book of philosophy. It is a book about feeling, thinking, and living. It is a book for people with no small passions."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"If You Want To Write by Brenda Ueland begins with some of the most honest and inspirational passages I've ever read - every word comes straight from the heart and speaking directly to you. I was having a kind of religious experience and looking forward to more. And then, once the author begins reviewing long passages by her students, the book loses momentum. The tone and writing are still true to form, but it just somehow feels overlong after awhile.The overarching theme of unleashing your creative spirit does come around by the end even though it lacks the magic from the beginning. I recommended this reading for any artist who has ever doubted her own ability."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"In my world a book like this gets two strikes against it. It's non-fiction, and falls into the category of \\"self-help\\". This should immediately tell anyone how incredible it must be if I'm still giving it five stars. In 150 pages Brenda will convince you that exploring your own creativity will be the single greatest journey you can take, and show you exactly how to get started. Though it's focused on writing, this book is really about any art form. It is a how-to manual, for being a more creative person in every regard.I wish someone would've given this to me in high school. That time in my life when everything was about conforming, and acceptance. This book is encourages the exact opposite, and then makes you feel so comfortable about the break away. Every chapter has wisdom, not simply good information, but real wisdom like this:\\"I learned that inspirations does not come like a bolt, nor is it kinetic, energetic striving, but it comes into us slowly and quietly and all the time, though we must regularly and everyday give it a little chance to start flowing, prime it with a little solitude and idleness.\\"\\"That is why most people are so afraid of being alone. For after a few minutes of unpleasant mental vacancy, the creative thoughts begin to come. And these thoughts at first are bound to be depressing because the first thing they say is: what a senseless thing life is with nothing but talk, meals, reading, uninteresting work, and listening to the radio. But that is the beginning. It is just where your imagination is leading you to see how life can be better. But if you would only persist.\\""},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This is far and away one of the best books I have ever read on writing, and I've read dozens. If you're hesitant to begin, if you're blocked, if you're a seasoned writer, you will benefit from Ueland's insight and encouragement. Her writing style is easy and engaging. Not only will I read this again, I'll read it again very soon."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This book is as alive, vibrant and inspirational as when it was first written. It encourages, urges the reader to find and claim her/his own voice."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I'm a writer and have read a lot of books about writing. This is one of my favorites. Contrary to what a few reviewers said, I do not think this book is only for beginning or immature writers. I've been writing for about 25 years and it spoke to me in a place where I needed it. I believe only something like two percent of writers actually earn even close to a living wage from writing, so there have got to be ton of slightly disheartened writers out there. This book will soothe exactly where it hurts and make you feel like writing even if you never sell one article or receive a contract for one book. If you're a writer wondering if it's all worth it, read this book."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"I came across this book when I was a senior in college, it is one of those books you will remember forever. The author understands how a writer feels inside, it is inspiring, and encouraging. Definitely something you want to pass on to your children and your children's children."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This is an amazing book on writing. Unlike a lot of other books, this one will actually help you to get started writing. Go out and buy it right now if you want to Write!"},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"Originally written in 1937, this book is delightfully about how to write for pleasure, for the sheer joy of writing in your own voice, and for the enjoyment of telling a good story. Brenda does not believe in rules. \\"And now you will begin to work on your writing. Remember these things. Work with all your intelligence and love. Work freely and rollickingly as though they were talking to a friend who loves you. Mentally (at least three or four times a day) thumb your nose at all know-it-alls, jeerers, critics, doubters(p.9).\\" Brenda continues to encourage the expression of your true self through your writing on every page of her book. Her friend, the American poet Carl Sandburg, told her, \\"That is the best book ever written about how to write(p. xi).\\" She asks us to think about why we should all use our creative power and write or paint or play music, or whatever it tells us to do. \\"Because,\\" she answers, \\"there is nothing that makes people so generous, joyful, lively, bold and compassionate, so indifferent to fighting and the accumulation of objects and money. Because the best way to know the Truth or Beauty is to try to express it. And what is the purpose of existence Here or Yonder but to discover truth and beauty and express it, i.e., share it with others? (p.179). Brenda intersperses her writing philosophy throughout the book by giving examples and comparing the writing of ordinary people to the writing of famous people. In doing so, she brings out the loveliest parts and shows us how writing can be most beautiful when it is most simple."},{"Title":"If you want to write","review":"This book illustrates that the most difficult step in most things in life is the first. If you write, then you simply must just do that--write. You must do it every day. Ms. Euland teaches us that affirmation comes only from within, and that when we realize that, we care little about any artificial external affirmation anyway. She is a professor of the meaning and ascertainment of true quality.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The contrast;: A musical based on the first American comedy, written in 1787 by Royall Tyler (French's music library)","review":"The music for \\"The Contrast\\" is a combination of many American musical styles. There is the March, the Rag Time, Waltz, Show Tune, and the ballad. The lyrics by Steve Brown are still amazing to hear. Had Steve lived, what hit shows would he have written? \\"The Contrast\\" is a fun silly show with charm and style. This recording is a demo or maybe recorded from a \\"live\\" performance. No studio cast LP was ever recorded."},{"Title":"Culture as History","review":"I had the opportunity to study with Warren Susman in the early 1980s at Rutgers and the experience completely changed the way I look at history. Susman was an old-school scholar, given his place on the faculty based on his teaching and his ideas more than his publications (of which there are very few). This book covers most of Susman's major ideas, showing that history can be seen through culture as much as through politics. His piece on FDR and Mickey Mouse is probably his best-known and is included here. One of my most-cherished college memories is walking with Susman to class once, discussing movies. A great teacher who died much to soon."},{"Title":"Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Vol. 1: Mechanics, Oscillations and Waves, Thermodynamics (Physics for Scientists & Engineers, Chapters 1-21)","review":"Characteristics of this book (and ratings out of 10). Note that all ratings and descriptions are in comparison to other books.Difficulty of material: 8 (not necessarily a good thing for everyone), the book is more difficult than most freshman physics texts (calc-based), but there are some derivations that were left out or some were poor in explanation.Examples: 5, the setup of the examples appear as though they would be excellent, and the setup was a good idea. However, Tipler did a poor job in his carrying out the explanation portion of the examples. Because of this, some of the examples are difficult to follow. This is probably the most important point of the book--examples are crucial to problem solving! Tipler's text doesn't stand up.Problem Planning: 7, some of the problems have terrible setups, others are simply just vague. In one problem you have to assume a weight for the problem, although this was difficult to discern from the problem description. It was just confusing about how the problem should be approached. Tipler should have actually given the statement \\"assume a weight,\\" instead of leaving it vague. Another problem had two different masses for answers. That is simply poor planning. The positive aspects of the problem set is that, at least for some colleges, the answers to all the problems can be found on the college's website. Also, there are lots of problems to work, and the conceptual problems are, for the most part, well done.Compared to Other Books: I have 5 other physics books and this is by far the worst of them. Serway's or Young's books are FAR better. There is far more explanation and the problems are just as difficult (Serway's has even harder material in some aspects). The other texts contains more and better derivations (assuming you are looking for the hardest editions). Other books give much better material for the amount of money asked for.If you must buy this book for class, I would recommend getting an additional used book (from an author other than Tipler) for reference. You may find you use other texts more than the assigned text because Tipler's text is poor. Also, problems on physics tests are usually from other books--so working problems in other books can only help test grades."},{"Title":"Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Vol. 1: Mechanics, Oscillations and Waves, Thermodynamics (Physics for Scientists & Engineers, Chapters 1-21)","review":"It is a pleasure reading the Optics in Dr. Tipler's volume II. The part is much better than the Waves which is somewhat confusing. So I gave 4 stars to the Waves part. Actually what I wanted to say in the previous reivew is that the explanation of SOME of those mathematical expressions and of those optional sections are not very clear--like written informally."},{"Title":"Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Vol. 1: Mechanics, Oscillations and Waves, Thermodynamics (Physics for Scientists & Engineers, Chapters 1-21)","review":"What a bulky book, my all time companion during those long walks to the city library.

How I'd cuss when you got some of the answer solutions wrong! How I'd get annoyed when your problems did not occur in real world situations. How I'd struggle to keep my mind when I encountered on of those Niko problems. I still remember the dread I used to feel when I saw a three-dot problem. And the agony that a two-dot would sometimes be harder than a three dot. You gave me many hints to solve those problems, but why didn't you give sufficient explanations? Why? Why did you make me do the same lengthy problem with a differnt set of numbers and then speculate about the different results? Did I learn anything conceptually from you? I think it was all plugging in stuff, and making sense of diagrams. That's why now all that I've learnt seems like a distant memory. You are not welcome in my thoughts any more, oh bulky book!"},{"Title":"Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Vol. 1: Mechanics, Oscillations and Waves, Thermodynamics (Physics for Scientists & Engineers, Chapters 1-21)","review":"This is the best physics book I have ever seen. The text is well written, the examples are great. What sets this book apart from other physics textbooks I have seen are these advantages. Examples are set up in columns so that on the left, it tells u whats going on in english and on the right, whats going on in math. There are great section summary pages and problem solving guides at the end of every chapter. The problems are each labeled with a difficulty, and they are creative problems. There are optional sections which you do not need to read but enhance what you are learning in lecture and reading.

Although its true that most of my physics learning came from my high school teacher, the only thing he lectured on where things that came almost directly from Tipler.

For me, it is not a good choice. It is very obvious that Dr. Tipler explains those basic concepts in a very informal manner. Physics is, I believe, a systematic study of the complex phenomena of the universe. Surely we shall develop our sense of appreciation of the beauty of Nature and our creativity of modeling the physical phenomena. However, in presenting the laws of physics, there is no need of being informal. That is what I believe. Probably I haven't understood enough physics and English.

The major problem with this book has always been that the author loaded its 935 pages with Latin quotations. I tried to read it a few months ago, and, even though English translations are given directly after most of the Latin, after about 75 pages I couldn't read any further; the long passages of Latin, followed by English translations, were just too much for me. The edition I purchased from Amazon.com translates all the Latin into English, and integrates it into the text; a much better reading experience. Of course, I don't know if a fully-translated edition is currently in print; it would be nice if it were. If anyone who has heard of this book would like to try reading it, he or she will have a rewarding experience. \\"The Anatomy of Melancholy\\" is too great a book to go unread in the Twenty-First Century."},{"Title":"Building a Godly Home: God's Blueprint for Men","review":"I first read this book about 2 years ago and I now I have started my second reading. The truths contained in it are very precious. You will find yourself coming to it over and over again. From cover to cover there is a wealth of information in it. Four chapters really stand out to me - 1) The Leader in His Home, 2) The Priest in His Home, 3) The Provider in His Home and 4) The Encourager in His Home. In a world where most men have somehow &quot;abdicated from the throne&quot; and handed over the issue of male leadership to our wives, this book sets out how a man can lead his family effectively. It has nothing to do with male machoism but everything the Lord intended it to be. Let me briefly share with you a portion from the chapter The Leader in His Home.&quot;The Leader of the home builds a cohesive unit out of varied interests and age groups of the family. Peter calls that coalition building. The leader sees that the new priorities set by his teens don't get lost in the old priorities of becoming a grown-up. He listens, encourages and reinforces. But more than anything else, the leader of the home is visible when things are falling apart in the lives of his family. He is the glue that holds the family together. But when things are clicking along well, the leader steps back, encircles his family with his arms and leaves the center stage to others.&quot;I could go on and on but I would highly recommend this book to any man who is serious about leading his family to get this book. Don't just buy one; buy two, three, or even five to give out to your friends ;because if you buy only one and after reading you lend it to a friend, chances are that you may not get it back. The book is worth its weight in gold. And something else, if you buy the book read it first before your wife does otherwise you are in trouble."},{"Title":"Building a Godly Home: God's Blueprint for Men","review":"If you have always had questions about how to be the man in your home.

Be ready for change that will help you in your marrage. No more Divorce No more Fights. Okay maybe not fights but you get a great way to learn how to lead your family the Godly way.

This is a real blessing."},{"Title":"To Lie with Lions : The Sixth Book of the House of Niccolo","review":"This is an amazing series. At times I think the history is the best part of it - you must stop to check up on Trebizond, or Cyprus, try to untangle what Brugges is, figure out the connection between James III of Scotland and the later Jameses - the 15th century springs to life in Dunnett's hands. And besides the history, Dunnett creates incredible characters, with Nicholas at the center, complex genius that he is. (In what guise does Nicholas live today?) Kathi Sersanders, the lively spirit who best understands him, represents the best of us, admiring and loving, and his son Jodi seems as familiar as all of our own children. Dr Tobias, the doubting and brilliant foil of Nicholas, is a magnificent creation, (and another way to represent the reader at his/her best). Okay, so it's a (long long long) soap opera, but you just can't go wrong: at the end you have Nicholas and his loyal band to dream of, and nearly a whole century of history that you never knew existed. Sign me up for the Dorothy Dunnett tour of the world!"},{"Title":"To Lie with Lions : The Sixth Book of the House of Niccolo","review":"As with all Dorothy Dunnett's books, you need to start at the beginning of the series. If you don't, then &quot;To Lie With Lions&quot; won't make much sense. The personalities with their rich background and convoluted associations won't have any context and the threads that weave backwards, forwards, will just be a tangled mess. But....read in sequence, the unbelieveable complexity, the mystery, the totally involving history of the characters springs to life. I guess it doesn't happen to everyone who reads Ms Dunnett's books - but for me she is numero uno and a lifelong love."},{"Title":"To Lie with Lions : The Sixth Book of the House of Niccolo","review":"Dorothy Dunnett has been described as the greatest living historical novelist. Maybe she used to be. The author has always had a penchant for melodrama, a penchant which marred her earlier series, the Lymond Chronicles...but this book has gone seriously around the bend. Ms. Dunnett has a forceful prose style, a sure ear for dialogue, a keen descriptive eye and a masterly handle on her characterizations. Her plots are another matter. In To Lie with Lions, the hero, Nicholas de Fleury, survives (purely by luck) at least three separate attempts on his life. His wife and toddler son survive similar attacks, and, again purely by fortuity, Gelis barely escapes seduction by the King of Scotland in a medieval hot-tub (but hey, what's a little serendipity among friends). If all this weren't enough, it seems that Gelis, after having slept with Nicholas' father, after having claimed that Nicholas' son was not his, after having become an agent for his enemies and having conspired for his total financial ruin, was not doing all of this (as had earlier been claimed) for retribution in the belief that Nicholas had seduced and betrayed her sister. No...now it is revealed that Gelis actually felt inferior to her sister and did not think that she could keep Nicholas' love and interest unless she showed him that she was smarter than he was (a real genius, this girl). And then, after betraying the poor lovestruck lunatic in every way possible, she decides that Nicholas is the one who's gone too far (!) because he bankrupt the treasury of Scotland (and incidentally won their little game). She then goes off in a huff to cherish her moral superiority (I bet that'll show him). I've got to admit, I'll probably read the next one, but after this, I don't much care."},{"Title":"To Lie with Lions : The Sixth Book of the House of Niccolo","review":"I was a bit disappointed with the previous two novels in the series, because I found them a bit to unplausible, but this book is a stunner!! We finally find out the result of the five year feud between Nicholas and Gelis, and the ending is still a cliff-hanger, but it does explain a few things.and gets us hyped up for the seventh book in the series. Ms. Dunnett is an excellent author. Yes, the history is good, but don't get into this series just for that. It's entirely too complicated and the continuous plot is a brain stretcher. I found that I actually started to like Nicholas in this book, and I really haven't before. He is a brilliant manipulator, and his long term planning is incredible, but he is human after all. His friends and acquaintances are just as interesting. I love Tobie and was glad to see him back. He is such a foil for Nicholas and is almost like his conscience. Katelejna is wonderful, and we see more of her. I can't wait to read the next book."},{"Title":"To Lie with Lions : The Sixth Book of the House of Niccolo","review":"I have now read all of the novels in Dorothy Dunnett's Niccolo series, and like all of the others To Lie with Lions is a great read. I read it over a long weekend, and even with its 626 pages, I had to keep reading until I completed the book as I became more and more interested in what would be the conclusion to the long struggle in which Niccolo and his wife were engaging. But the problem I have is with the apparent conclusion to this relationship. The section is rushed and does not appear to follow logically from all that has been presented before; the motivations and rationalizations of the characters seem incomplete and somewhat illogical. I could present specific details, but I do not want to give away too much of what happens. Dorothy Dunnett is an excellent writer; her set-piece scenes, some of which were mentioned in the Kirkus review, are as well-written as anything I have ever read. The problem is in the psycholgy presented in this closing section. I hope she clarifies the internal and external relationships of her characters in the book to be published later this year. Even with these criticisms, the book is still very much worth reading and savoring. It could just have been one of her very best, worthy of the best of the genre and possibly even surpassing it."},{"Title":"To Lie with Lions : The Sixth Book of the House of Niccolo","review":"I love this series. But I just cannot be very positive about this book. It has more than normal of Dunnett's confused and overly complex passages. And after fighting with the book it seemed nearly all the way, Iceland offered potential for another of Dunnett's amazing climaxes. But without giving anything away, all I can say is I found the ending to be just completely wrong. Completely out of character, completely without any sense, completely incomprehensible. What a place to leave us. Well, Dunnett has taken us on the emotional rollercoaster before. Has she just delayed the conclusion to the next book... I'll be reading it as soon as she has it ready."},{"Title":"To Lie with Lions : The Sixth Book of the House of Niccolo","review":"This is the sixth book of the Niccolo series. Here, the plot centers on the center of Europe: The Duke of Burgundy and the King of France and the King of Scotland: Nicholas serves them all to achieve success for his grand plan.The competition between Gelis and Nicholas continues, only this time she lives with Nicholas in Scotland and their son, Jodi. Living together does not mean the race is over, only that it intensifies. The outcome will soon be revealed!In this chapter, the author continues her description of Scotland, but also of Greenland and the great market for Cod that exists between this country and the great Hanse Merchants of Germany. Once again, Nicholas is able to beat his competitors and gain more wealth.More descriptions of new places, new people and customs and all told with incredible with and knowledge.I can't wait to read the seventh chapter...."},{"Title":"To Lie with Lions : The Sixth Book of the House of Niccolo","review":"Not since I was a child gobbling every book in sight have I been so involved in a series. I read straight through the series during August and September and then finally emerged for air.I found the tale engrossing, entertaining, and complex and am ready to start on the Lymon series."},{"Title":"To Lie with Lions : The Sixth Book of the House of Niccolo","review":"I actually own every book Dorothy Dunnett has written, purchased the Niccolo Series of 8 books because I wanted to reread them on my Kindle. I mostly read historical fiction, am a voracious reader so have what I hope are high standards. Dunnett, who died in 2004 (I think!) is, to my mind, among the best. Her books are well researched, filled with actual historical persons, are a combo of mystery and history set in incredible locations (Scotland, Venice, Cyprus, Constantinople, Trebizond, Rhodes, Bruges, Burgundy) and during incredible times in history. Her protagonists are well developed, her novels are page turners. I highly recommend her to anyone interested in the time period covered by her 2 series- 1400s-1500s."},{"Title":"To Lie with Lions : The Sixth Book of the House of Niccolo","review":"If you love well written historical fiction, then Dorothy Dunnet's House of Niccolo series is the one for you. This particular volume takes place in Scotland in the mid 1400s and continues the adventures of our protoagonist Niccolo. I don't want to give any of the story away - but lets just say that in this volume we see our hero in a less than heroic light as many of the events of the previous volumes come to a head.Excellent writing, unbelievable research and stellar characters make this one of my favorite series. Read them all!"},{"Title":"To Lie with Lions : The Sixth Book of the House of Niccolo","review":"Have just finished the sixth volume of Dorothy Dunnett's House of Niccolo series, and I'm going through withdrawls. An accomplished portrait painter, she paints a vivid, detailed, portrait of Europe at the birth of the Renaissance. Set thirty years before Columbus sails, this series is packed with complex compelling characters, cut-throat political intrigue, pageturning action, witty dialog and narrative, and one of the most unique love stories ever to grace a novel. I heartily endorse all of the books in the series, and anything else the author writes.To Lie with Lions is the sixth episode in the life of Nicholas de Fleury a true Renaissance man. A former dye shop apprentice, he has used his genius ,charm and bravado to accumulate wealth, respect and a loyal following of friends and associates. He also makes deadly enemies. Traveling from Edinbourgh to Byzantium, Africa to Iceland; he takes advantage of every opportunity he can devise, to outmanouver the competion. He is driven by personal demons to succeed at all costs. To Lie with Lions was slightly less satisfying than some of the others in the series, so I rate it a nine. I'm hoping that with the re-release of the author' s earlier series, that perhaps the earlier volumes of this set will also be re-published as they are difficult to get. I await with bated breath the next installment in this series."},{"Title":"To Lie with Lions : The Sixth Book of the House of Niccolo","review":"Nicholas finally has his revenge. Riberac and the St.Pol have been disgraced, defeated by the child they denied. As with all acts of revenge the price of the plot is very high. Nicholas has paid it by loosing all he loved. Although this was not one of Ms. Dunnett's best, it did hold my attention. Politics, adventure and the growth trade make this installment worth the time it takes to read. Fans are still waiting for Nicholas to find real happiness. He is now further away from being fufilled than ever before."},{"Title":"To Lie with Lions : The Sixth Book of the House of Niccolo","review":"It's not often that I start reading a book and won't finish. It has to be pretty bad for me to drop it, and this book achieved this level. I didn't care anything about the characters, I didn't care anything about what was going on (when I could figure out just what was going on), and the writing was stilted. Boring, at times predictable, and uninvolving."},{"Title":"Neural Networks for Modelling and Control of Dynamic Systems: A Practitioner's Handbook (Advanced Textbooks in Control and Signal Processing)","review":"This is an excellent book.

The authors have also a WEB site where additional information and the toolboxes (MATLAB format) can be found.The programs work an they are easy to understand and run.I first tried the toolboxes (the user manuals are included with the toolboxes) and then ordered the book.

The authors give a recap of decades of progress into using multilayer networks in a feedback mode. Key sections of the text discuss the weighting of the nodes and how you can realistically compute these weights.But the emphasis differs from most existing texts on neural networks. Here, the authors explain how you might control a dynamical system that could exhibit pronounced nonlinearities. The book is pitched towards someone from control systems theory. The latter has been highly developed, to handle both linear and nonlinear systems. However, if you consult standard texts on control systems, neural networks rarely (if ever) garner a mention. This book tries to correct that deficiency."},{"Title":"Neural Networks for Modelling and Control of Dynamic Systems: A Practitioner's Handbook (Advanced Textbooks in Control and Signal Processing)","review":"The book is straight forward and useful. However, I would like to see more examples using MATLAB."},{"Title":"On Foot: A History of Walking","review":"This book appealed to me because I am a walker. In addition to being an expert long-distance hiker and backpacker, I also walk extensively throughout my town for commuting and running errands, often taking up to two hours a day to walk distances that everyone else drives in a few minutes. It's a very easy form of exercise and I buy far less gasoline than others, saving both money and natural resources. Walking also provides philosophical comfort, but in today's society it is very difficult to explain that to the car-obsessed multitudes, who seem to have forgotten that walking is even possible. Amato covers all these issues, along with walking's place in human history and in the human spirit. Walking was one of the key factors in making proto-humans into full humans, and it was the force that encouraged people to spread across the Earth and construct entire social orders and landscapes. And walking has always been an affair of the mind and soul as well, which is a key running (walking) contention throughout Amato's narrative.Sadly, that great philosophical pretext becomes a pretty unfocused and repetitive book. After the basic philosophy is taken care of, Amato simply offers a rather watered-down cultural history of Western Europe and America, often trying to force walking-related vignettes and episodes onto an unfocused historical analysis. This analysis is too high-level and arbitrary to serve as an informative history, and also detracts from the intended focus of the book. And while it's not fair to demand that Amato cover other regions and cultures, it would be nice to learn about how non-Western cultures view the art and activity of walking (and not driving), as this could shed some real light on the obsessions with transportation and convenience that have ruined the fun for walkers in the West. Granted, the basic focus of this book remains fascinating throughout, but the overall result is boredom and disappointment. But it was still worth it for me to walk to the library to check this book out, and now I will walk back to return it. Amato, and most of his readers, will understand why I enjoy doing that.

Joe Amato has a genius for providing insight into an activity most of us take for granted -- walking -- and making stirring connections to the world around us. -- R. Kelly"},{"Title":"On Foot: A History of Walking","review":"I really enjoyed the \\"walking\\" pace of the book. The pace lent itself well to stopping off at different points through history and exploring walking's relationship to them in more detail. Lots of great information... I truly enjoy the author's unique style of storytelling."},{"Title":"On Foot: A History of Walking","review":"This book is fascinating lens through which to view the broad strokes of western history over the last 800 years. Amato writes with an approachable scholarship about the role of foot transport in western religion, class distinctions, the evolution of urban places - particularly since 1800, and walking as a bobo luxury.His work shares a subtitle - \\"A history of walking\\" with Rebecca Solnit's Wanderlust. Try them both as they complement one another quite nicely."},{"Title":"The Pattern","review":"I don't know much about Mignon Eberhart, only what I learned from the biorgaphy that came out a few years ago by Cypert, who leans heavily on her connections with Gertrude Stein. Long ago, probably in one of the Ellery Queen anthologies like \\"The Female of the Species,\\" I read on, then another, of the Susan Dare stories, and went on to read the whole collection several times. I knew of a few nurse stories too, though never bothered to read them. Cypert's collection of Eberhart's stories for Crippen & Landru was quite an eye opener, though, so I was determined to give her a new chance. Maybe \\"The Pattern\\" would be a masterpiece.The novel takes place on a lakeside resort outside of Chicago, where wealthy families keep rustic summer homes and boathouses on an adagio of islands nearby. There's a lot of rowboat, motorboat and canue action keeping them linked. Eberhart is superb at atmosphere and I could almost feel the loneliness of these pine-smelling islands and the creak of a pair of high heels mincing down a wooden pier at night. Half of her talent is describing silence and the other half, describing darkness, or so it sometimes seems. The novel reunites a pair of star-crossed sweethearts, Jerome Gable and Nan Bayne, whose engagement was broken three years ago by the machinations of an evil femme fatale, beautiful Celia, sort of the \\"Nofret\\" of the Midwest if you know your Death Comes as the End. Celia has since married Jerome and poor Nan hasn't been able to revisit the islands since, she just can't bear the heartbreak. A rabble of older friends has brought her out at last, and she hasn't been there even 24 hours before hunky Jerome tumbles back into her life and love brings them together once more. That night, Celia is brutally murdered, and her body is sent drifting out across the silent, spooky lake, in am untethered canoe. By some odd coincidence, Nan's boat actually collides with it. Next day comes and the obvious suspects in Celia's death are Nan and Jerome, who are hounded a suspicious constabulary and by the suspicions of their own friends.We are mostly in Nan's head throughout the next week or so, though sometimes Eberhart cheats a little to tell us what Jerome is thinking, mostly vapid thoughts like, \\"He would die a thousand deaths rather than hurt his poor little Nan again.\\" But, we get the picture that both are innocent. There's a handful of servants around, notably Celia's mercenary mini-Me of a maid, Marietta, and there are some gruff, if noble townspeople, but the other characters are mostly high society Tracy Lord and Addison DeWitt types that take a lot of distinguishing from each other. At the eleventh hour an actual hoodlum slash hitman enters the story, disrupting all the alibis, since Nan realizes that all you had to do to kill Celia was hire this guy, and you could be playing whist and bridge all night long with millionaires who would alibi you solidly, and you would still be at least morally guilty as the one who has been running from cabin to cabin placing large black widow spiders in Nan's heirloom slippers. I don't really remember this plot happening in any other GAD mystery (the hiring of a hitman by one of the main characters), and it's pretty well done here. I wonder why Eberhart never lets us see Celia (nor any of the other subsequent victims) in action before her death. We see plenty of her chicanery in retrospect, but never any real scene for her. To me, it would be sort of like having Linnet Ridgeway locked up in her stateroom, never allowed to interact with anyone, before we see her corpse in Poirot's arms.I realized that the book could have been much much shorter, but Eberhart also has a mania for telling us who was where and when they left. Paragraph after paragraph will begin, \\"And then Maud left the party, beautiful Maud with her cunning green eyes and her monocle,\\" or, \\"Frieda was the sixth to go, mysterious Frieda with the ivory neck and the keen sense of paradox. What was Frieda thinking as she stepped into the pony cart and gently nudged old Bessie with the poolcue?\\" Kind of slows things down when you have to see everybody arrive at a scene, one by one, and then you have to see \`em all depart, especially when you know they're all going to get together in the very next chapter at the inquest or the brunch.The Pattern? What is the pattern? I won't say how it all turns out, but believe me, Eberhart might as well have called this one, Spiders in Cold Cream Jars and it would still have been a spooky chiller of murder among the rich and the want to be rich."},{"Title":"My Life and Loves","review":"This book reads like a 14 year old 's collection of sexual fantasies. The author describes his various sexual encounters in great detail (yawn) but a smart reader wil probably suspect that all the author did was masurbate excessively throughout his entire life.

If we hadn't heard of you from elsewhere, why would we want to read your autobiography in the first place? Well, in this case the answer is fairly obvious (for certain of us, that is, not me), but, on the other hand, anyone can do that, especially if he's allowed simply to manufacture the anecdotes.In short, you're wasting your time bothering with this boastful, swaggering, blustering imposture."},{"Title":"My Life and Loves","review":"I really don't know how many of My Life and Loves volumes have been sold worldwide but it seems to me that most of my friends in different countries all found this book in their dads library and usually well hidden behind other books.....The five volume book of almost 1000 pages is a faboulous look into 19th century world and a compendium of famous and not so famous people of the era ,,,Not only does the author deal with socio-economic and religious thoughts and beliefs of the time but he takes the dryness out of historial perspective by peppering the book with numerous erotic escapades of the tenderest nature ....If all history books were as good as this one I would have certainly gotten a PHd in History .....This book is a MUST HAVE for your erotic library ...

His work on Shakespeare, which is good, cannot hold a candle to this splendid autobiography. Scoundrels always charm us and Frank was one of those delightful scoundrels that mesmerized the dinner table.

I doubt that many read every word, and now could never imagine reading ALL of it. However, if you want to understand something of 19th Century English literature and life, I think you need to read at least half. Just expect to be very weary of Frank Harris after a bit.

It's not a brain-chemistry imbalance of genetic origin, requiring life-long drug therapy--it's as simple as being hurt, denied, and abused, often in subtle ways. We aren't in some way--genetically, spiritually, intellectually, designed to be self-destructive--we are warped by early experience to devise clever, yet universally self-limiting strategies to protect our most intimate selves. Ms. Ehrenberg exposes this with insight, humor, and most importantly, freedom to expose herself, in a way that is unusually daring, and, as in her therapy, liberating to those who experience it. I was helped greatly by this book, and recommend it to anyone who feels in any way limited by their fears of being hurt."},{"Title":"The Intimate Edge: Extending the Reach of Psychoanalytic Interaction","review":"Whether you're in the therapy room, or out in the real world, you'll gain strength and compassion from this excellent book.

To some degree or another, we've all been hurt, abused, neglected and she clarifies how to keep a relationship &quot;grounded, so that it does not become ambiguous and terrifyingly open to unfounded assumptions&quot; so that the relators do not lose touch with one another. The answer is in attending to the sublest interactions and clarifying the immediate moment -- in other words being fully present with the other and talking about what's going on. Easily said! How rarely put into practice! For those of us in the helping professions, this book in invaluable, but it probably would benefit anyone interested in the intricacies of human relationships.

Toews - emeritus Professor of New Testament at Mennonite Brethren Biblical Seminary and former President of Conrad Grebel University College - has provided a noticeably fresh, vigorous, and crucial interpretation of Romans.Toews explores each passage of Romans in four sections: a preview, explanatory notes, comment on the text in biblical context, and comments on the text in the life of the church. Toews excels in keeping the big picture in view, while offering breakthrough translations, eye-popping structural analyses, and a cornucopia of insights derived from Jewish and Greco-Roman history and current Pauline scholarship.According to Toews, Paul's thesis and gospel is that God's end-time power has arrived to save or set-right the world, both Jews and Gentiles, which is revealed through both the righteousness of God and the wrath of God (1:16-18). According to Toews, Paul's thesis is then expanded in three major arguments.In the first argument, Paul describes how the wrath of God is poured out impartially on all humanity (1:18 - 3:20).In the second, Paul explains how the righteousness of God is revealed through the \\"faithfulness of Jesus\\" (3:21-26) and through God's power \\"to make people righteous\\" through faith(fulness), exemplified by Abraham (4:3-25). This means peace with God (5:1-11), solidarity with Christ (5:12-21), liberation from the sin as power, which exploits the law, and submission to the Spirit, who fulfills the law in us (6:1-8:11), and incorporation into the family of God (8:12-39). Since this argument raising questions for Jews, Paul is then forced to explain the Jew-Gentile relationship in God's plan (9:1-11:36). I found Toews' explanations very helpful regarding the difficult and debated chapters of Rom 9-11.In Paul's third argument, the revelation of God's righteousness is revealed in the righteous and faithful community (12:1-15:13), characterized by sacrificial living, non-conformity, and transformation (12:1-2), renewed minds and loving relationships (12:3-16), commitment to the \\"political realism\\" of non-retaliation, paying taxes, and loving neighbors (12:17 - 13:14), and tolerant welcoming of one another (14:1-15:13).For many readers, studying Toews' commentary will be like reading Romans again for the first time. First, Toews embraces the New Perspective on Paul. Second, he offers unique translations that are occasionally awkward, often refreshing, but always grammatically and semantically justifiable. And third, he masterful elucidates Paul's apocalyptic, especially sin as an enslaving cosmic power (distinct from acts of transgressions) that can only be overcome by grace and the Spirit.Written for the Believers Church Bible Commentary Series, Toews places Mennonites and Anabaptists in conversation with Paul, which is, of course, unparalleled by any other Romans commentary. For example, after analysis of Rom 5:1-11, readers hear the story of P.M. Friesen making peace (149), after Rom 5:12-21, Sebastian Franck expresses his opinion on \\"original sin\\" (167), and after Rom 13:1-7, Menno Simons speaks out on what we owe civil magistrates (326).Unfortunately, the commentary suffers from occasional repetitiveness, awkward phrases (Toews represents the Greek too literally at times), and an unconvincing argument that the \\"I\\" of Rom 7:14-25 represents collective Israel (Toews 194-7).Still, Toews' commentary is a brilliant gift to the church and deserves attention by scholars and careful reading by all."},{"Title":"Romans (Believers Church Bible Commentary)","review":"From the book:This commentary on Romans is a rich gift to the contemporary church, its lay leaders, pastors, and scholars.

Richard Smith and Eddie Creek do an admirable job of summarizing combat ops flown by Germany's bomber units in this period. Though defeated over England, Germany's Junkers, Dornier, Focke Wulf and Heinkel bomber units were still a force to contend with and contributed mightily to the initial successes in North Africa and, especially, Russia.The author's comprehensive text is well served by almost 200 black & white and color photos and 15 Tom Tullis color profiles of Ju 88s, Do 17/217s, FW 200s and the old He 111 warhorse. Photographically this volume really stands out for presenting so many, previously unknown camouflage schemes.

Even in the Internet Age, I reasoned, a sole-authored guidebook would be more useful than endless googling through Wikipedia pages, right? Sadly, after a month with this book, I'm not so sure...The goal and format The Sake Handbook is a good idea -- this is no coffee table book of beautiful pictures of sake bottles. Instead it introduces the reader to sake through the brewing process, explaining a welter of names and methods slowly and logically as it takes you through the production process. Subsequent chapters take you through Japanese tasting terms, different kinds of sake, drinking vessels, and so forth. These chapters successfully keep the reader from entering Overwhelm Mode by repeatedly defining Japanese terms when used (a glossary is also included, which is good). The prose is clear, although it also seems repetitive and padded -- I'm not sure if the author was trying to lengthen this already-short book, or simply an attempt to make the volume welcoming to readers. Often, however, it just makes it hard to find information. The chapter on Ginjoshu, for instance, doesn't actually explain what Ginjoshu is until you are a page and seven paragraphs in to it. Sometimes authors write forgetting how little their readers know compared to them -- it seems like this might be the case here, where long digressions and reflections get in the way of serious information. If anything, much of the text could be reduced to helpful tables and charts which would orient the reader to topics like brewing method, taste terms, and so forth.It get worse. Some of the chapters of this book are downright unhelpful. The section on 'collecting sake labels' is not actually about collecting sake labels but a discussion of the most common kanji characters that appear on sake labels. Readers searching for tips on getting labels off bottles, descriptions of how collectors organize their collections, etc. will have to look elsewhere. The chapter on sake bars in Japan and wholesalers in the US -- 37 pages -- will not be of use to most readers. Perhaps the intended audience is anglophone expats in Japan? At any rate for those of us in the rest of the world this section is of little use -- the list of wholesalers in my state is already out of date. Honestly: who needs a phonebook when you have Google?The most egregious problem with the book is the main section: the 100 pages of recommended sake to try. This section consists of pictures of sake labels and one paragraph reviews of the sake in question. This is the expert, value-added core of the book -- it could be used as a guide for first-timers looking to try different sakes, or to read about sakes they have tried at a restaurant or bar. Unfortunately, the sakes are organized by the geographical region of their brewery, from north to south. It's ridiculous. This essentially means it is impossible to browse the list on the basis of any of the criteria a reader would actually use: alphabetical listings of brands, types of sake, flavors, suggested lists of sakes for tastings, and so forth. The index does list brands, so the book is not a total waste, but it is certainly a disappointment.Let's face it: compared to the relatively well-written Wikipedia page on sake and the many brewery website out there, Gauntner's book falls short. If you are not good at using the Internet and want to learn more about sake, it will do the job. But at base the book's value proposition falls short: despite assertions to the contrary, you can beat free -- but in order to do so you need to curate information better than this. A useful book, but I have to admit I'm a little disappointed that I bought it."},{"Title":"Sake Handbook (Yenbooks)","review":"Every time I read online reviews...whether on Amazon.com or elsewhere...I always end up shaking my head and rolling my eyes heavenward. Why? Because there can be a dozen reviews rating a product or restaurant with 5 stars but there will always be one or two sourpusses who slam and demean it. Such is the case with reviewer \\"Alex Golub\\".First, after letting us know how he decided to \\"...bite the bullet...\\", he complains that the text is too long and should \\"...be reduced to helpful tables and charts...\\", kind of like a child's picture book, I suppose. To paraphrase the emperor in that wonderful movie \\"Amadeus\\": \\"There are too many words! The human brain can only comprehend so much!\\" What's hilarious is that this \\"scholar's\\" review is exceedingly verbose so it becomes a case of \\"Do as I say, not as I do!\\"In the next paragraph, he complains about the chapter on \\"Collecting sake labels\\". First, he is disappointed because he was expecting to learn how to peel the labels off a sake bottle to add to a collection. Well, Brother Golub, you can \\"Google\\" that info. Then, he complains about the author's explanation about the various Kanji characters one will likely encounter on a sake bottle and here his ignorance begins to reveal itself. Any real sake aficionado who doesn't read Japanese will appreciate this section because those characters make specific references to the various qualities of that particular brand: dryness/ sweetness, the style of sake (clear, milky, fortified, etc.) and will help ANY buyer choose the right kind of sake when trying an unfamiliar brand. And then, to quote him, \\"it gets worse\\" when he pronounces (in sonorous tones) that the list of Japanese sake bars and U.S. wholesalers will, by golly, \\"...not be of use to most readers...\\" and that the list is already outdated. Of COURSE the wholesalers' list is probably outdated! The publication date is 2002 and liquor wholesalers are notorious for constantly changing. Again: \\"Google-ing\\" the ones you're interested in will reveal updated info or inform you that they are no longer in business under that name. I have used my own suggestion when tracking down an elusive sake I am curious to try with excellent results.As for the \\"...most egregious problem...\\" in this book, listing the breweries by geographical location rather than alphabetically, shows us that \\"professor\\" Golub is a neophyte poseur who is only interested in impressing us with his superior erudition. Besides the rice, the real backbone of sake is the water used to create it and the best breweries use a local source of water. The hardness, softness and acidity will strongly influence the finished product. So location is everything.Finally, I find it interesting that all the other reviews...including one by a master sake brewer in Oregon (the best U.S. made sake I've had to date!)...all give this book 5 stars. Only one other reviewer gave it 3 and that was only because it wasn't a coffee table book with lots of beautiful photographs.Alex Golub should follow his own advice and stick to Wikipedia!I'll just leave it at that."},{"Title":"Sake Handbook (Yenbooks)","review":"Ah, sake. This rice wine has been around for thousands of years, and is part of many traditions in Japan. As Japanese food styles have become popular across the globe, so has this fine drink, which can be served both warm and cold. To learn more about the history of sake, and to learn how to choose a good brand, this book is invaluable.To start with, The Sake Handbook goes over each step involved in making sake. Reading through the intricate processes involved helps you understand why there are so many varieties of sake, and why each one has a different flavor. One key step, for example, is the polishing step. The inner part of the rice generally is of higher quality than the outer portion, so the more 'extra' that is polished away, the finer the sake.Next, Gauntner goes over the various types of sake, and how each is unique. Some of these terms are:* Junmai-shu is pure rice sake. Only rice, water, and the koji mold are used to produce this top level sake. It ends up tasting heavier and fuller than other types of sake. It uses less than 70% polished rice - this means they have \`ground away' the other 30% of impurities.* Honjozo-shu has a small amount of distilled ethyl alcohol added during the final stages. They then add water later so the alcohol content stays the same. This sake is lighter and dryer than other types. It can be served warm.* Ginjo-shu uses 60% polished rice. It is also fermented for longer periods of time, giving a complex and delicate flavor.* Daiginjo-shu is just like Ginjo-shu, but polished to 50% of the original size. It takes even longer to brew and complete. Futsuu-shu - any sake which does not fall into one of the above four categories.Gauntner describes how sake is tasted, and how an individual can learn to distinguish between various sakes, and figure out the 'type' best suited for his or her palate. To help with this, the entire second half of the book is dedicated to a brand-by-brand evaluation of the best sakes on the market. This is invaluable! No matter if you're in Tokyo or Chicago, you can bring this book in with you to a store or restaurant and compare with ease the various sakes available.There even is a section towards the back listing the best sake restaurants in Japan.

She is feisty, determined, pig-headed, independent, a man hater and a survivor. And yet ultimately, she is an innocent. When she is forced to fight back against her accusers, the violence makes her question her own sense of being a decent person. This raises some interesting philosophical issues of guilt and innocence, and also gives Tompa a depth that is unusual.This book has some truly outstanding scenes. For example, Tompa's woozy reminiscences while she is informed that she will be handed over to the aliens is a marvellously surreal moment. The love scene was gripping, exciting, and yet completely in good taste. And the ending.... If someone had told me the ending when I was halfway through the book I probably would have said that it couldn't possibly happen without straining my credulity to the breaking point -- yet when it develops that Tompa is triumphant, in a tragic sort of way, the moment seemed almost inevitable.

The bond they forge transforms our heroine and, we are given to hope, an entire society. The humor that comes from mistranslations and cultural differences contributes to Hoornaert's delightful voice, even as he explores the complex themes of justice, sacrifice, and the individual's place in society.

Do you want a dozen pages of that kind of hokey, over-staging? Me neither. This second-in-a-series doesn't match the quality of the first one. Frankly I was unimpressed by a number of the photos that seem more like the discards from a better project--focus not clear, composition not the best, artistry not of the highest level--especially the black-and-white ones and some of the ones by Klein, which look more like ordinary amateur snapshots. But then there are some striking photos, too--the kind you'd like on an artsy screen saver. It's a mix of the good and the not-so-good, and for that reason I think this paperback is pricey for what you get. I'm also put off by the inclusion of some old Calvin Anderson photos that have been around for years--and they aren't even from among his best ones. If money isn't an object for you, go ahead and get this one.

According to Jon Elster, all possible procedures are permutations of three ideal types: arguing, bargaining and voting.Voting involves the aggregation of individual preferences. The typical example is the referendum by secret ballot. To be democratic, the principle of majority rule must apply. A fine procedure, we might say. But surely it is misplaced optimism to believe that some sort of invisible hand will guide the mass of probably uninformed voters towards mastery of a complex issue.Bargaining, on the other hand, involves interaction between participants. The isolation and anonymity of the participants is removed, and decisions are arrived at after those that command the weightiest resources ( eg. money, control of the army, authority over demonstrators ) make an agreement in exchange for various concessions.Arguing similarly involves participant interaction, but appeals are made to impartial reason rather than partisan interest. The deliberations of the jury room are the model for this procedure. If 'voting' has its roots in Rousseau's theory of democracy and 'bargaining' belongs with the liberal democratic tradition of Dahl and Schumpeter, 'arguing' is firmly rooted in the republican tradition. Elster cites Pericles' eulogy of Athens: instead of a stumbling block, discussion is &quot;an indispensable preliminary to any wise action&quot;. The idea turns up throughout history: Burke's speech to the electors of Bristol implies a deliberative model of sorts.Its most recent incarnation was partly a result of Habermas' influential theory of communicative action. Habermas' claim that speech 'does' things ( from Austin's speech-act theory ), and is primarily oriented towards understanding and consensus, was ideally suited to revamping the theory of deliberative democracy. Despite being an heir of Kant and Marx, Habermas does not really get away from the republican mindset inherent in the model. In this sense, the elitist implications of deliberative democracy worry me . . .Elster's volume fleshes out some of these worries in a reasonably comprehensive way. Susan Stokes' essay 'Pathologies of Deliberation' is well worth reading, as is James Johnson's 'Arguing for Deliberation: Some Skeptical Considerations'. Elster makes the important distinction between deliberation in the making of a constitution and the level of deliberation in the final constitutional document.Of the remaining essays, Cass Sunstein's 'Health-Health Trade-Offs' is the stand-out, managing to locate the debate in solid empirical examples. Sunstein's conclusion that must find a balance between 'voting' and 'arguing' struck a chord and reminded me of its applicability to the current hot political topic of GM food: how can we balance voter's 'gut feelings' against GM food with a vigorous scientific and public policy debate which is increasingly pointing to its advantages?Deliberative democracy is not simply abstract theorising. It is very much located in the politics of modern societies. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Deliberative Democracy (Cambridge Studies in the Theory of Democracy)","review":"Very interesting the multidisciplinary approach. A startign point to explore the basics of deliberative democracy. As economist I founf the book really ispiring."},{"Title":"Cubans in Puerto Rico: Ethnic Economy and Cultural Identity","review":"Having read the orginal text of this book (&quot;Los Cubanos en Puerto Rico,&quot; published by the University of Puerto Rico Press) I found plenty of interesting information about Cuban exiles and immigrants residing in Puerto Rico. Since both Cuba and Puerto Rico were the last two Spanish colonies in the New World, their histories are closely interwoven with one another. The adoption of the battle flag design both countries use for their national flags, the language, food, and climates illustrate the similarities both islands share with one another. Being related with one another and having a similar oppressor, Cuba and Puerto Rico are the truest sister islands the world has.Due to events in Cuba, especially the Revolution of 1959, many Cubans immigrated and left their island and many settled in Puerto Rico. The island, as a U.S. Commonwealth offered Cubans security, U.S. citizenship, and an environment where they were able to live the lives they once lived in pre-castro Cuba. Unlike Cubans in Miami, Cubans residing in Puerto Rico are less political about what is happening in their island, and many have intermarried with prominent Puerto Ricans families and unified their cultures together. The author does a wonderful job in utilizing statistics, polls, and surveys on attitudes this community has. While many outsiders of Cuban-Puerto Rican politics might not see the relevance of other latino groups moving into other Latino countries, it is still important to know what can go right and wrong in those places, because it will clearly have an effect here in the United States. Places like in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles will see mass immigration of newly emerging Latino groups moving into areas once occupied by another Latino group (e.g. Mexicans moving into New York's Puerto Rican-held &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot;; Nicaraguans moving into Cuban-held Hialeah, Florida; etc.)Whether you are a great consumer of Bacardi Rum (originally from Cuba the Bacardi family resettled in Puerto Rico), a fan of singer Carlos Ponce (although he is proud of his Puerto Rican roots and culture, his parents are Cuban immigrants), or just want to learn more about Cuban-Puerto Rican relations on the island, this is an excellent book. Although tension between both communities exist somewhat ion the mainland U.S. (mostly due to opinions on the Elian Gonzalez case and the release of Puerto Rican nationalists by president Clinton), it shouldn't be a reason not to read this book. A must have for Latin American history and politics readers/students."},{"Title":"All beautyfull & foolish souls","review":"This is the one book of poems that has mattered to me the most. It changed the way I looked at the world as well as the way I looked at language. If you can find this book and read it two or three times--live with it, in other words--you will rediscover the magic in poetry, far, far away from the Iowa City crowd, the Pulitzer people and all the academic poets in all the university MFA writing programs fighting for literary immortality. These poems will live forever in my heart and, I would hope, in the hearts of anyone who reads them."},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"While I enjoyed many aspects of this book, a few left me unsettled. First, DiMercurio did a wonderful job building some of the characters, so you actually care about who dies and who lives. Secondly, the detail about the inner workings of an exploding missle is interesting, but only up to two times. Lastly, he spent waay too much time describing the miserbale deaths of Americans, while only glossing over the deaths of the murdering scumbag bad guys. When you read a book like this, you want to see the bad guy suffer. Well, DiMercurio would rather gloss over it.Great book, but the end was dissapointing and not in sync with the rest of the story. My guess is that he was late on finishing the end."},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"Im a Malaysian who really got hooked up with all the submarine action stuff. Buying the Threat Vector was purely an accident because i always go for any book featuring submarine warfare no matter who the author is.After reading the Threat Vector, my perception about submarine warfare had totally changed. The book has a outstanding plot combined all those super modern and high-tech gadgets. I also love the characterization of the story, the captain, the female XO and ultimately, the submarine itself(the second one).Unfortunately, i find it very hard to get M. Demercurio's books here maybe because his name is not well known as Clancy, King etc yet.However, thanks for the story and i hope to find more of your works soon."},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"Once again a technothriller with imagination and a view to the future. I find in Dimicurio what we all expect (and is no longer delivered by) from Tom Clancy. I look forward to him developing plots that become broader then the usual suspects."},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"This book has a good story line, but it has a few problems:1. A submersible sneaks up on a high-tech submarine that can later detect submarines miles away.2. When the Red Chinese start to attack the White Chinese, the U.S. knows everything about their actions, but the White Chinese are taken completely by surprise.3. A submarine receives a message to get out of an area as fast as possible. They obey and are racing out of there when they are hit by a torpedo. Later, the captain (who escapes) says that they were at \\"5 knots\\". That's a big difference from the 40 knots they were really at. Not only that, but the 5 knots story is repeated twice.4. The author overdoes his desciptions. He puts a lot of detail into not only people's looks, but also things like explosions.Overall, this book could have been a lot better. I would still recommend it if you are just looking for a military fiction book to read. If you care about details, you probably would not like this book."},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"I agree with the Folk from Nebraska. I was really disappointed with this book. The Authors website is exciting and well written. One of his other books (Pheonix/) was good enough to cause me to seek out his others. &quot;Piranha' is trash, pure and simple. I did read it cover to cover, but only out of idle curiousity, and a sense of'he can't really be going to do that !'.I will persevere with this author - I hope this is an aberration."},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"... it is a good book - lots of action, gadgets, tension and a bit of romance. BUT - let me ask you this - how the [heck] does a submersible submarine get within cooee of a supposedly state-of-the-art nuclear submarine without being detected, and not only do that, but also dock with and enter it with an armed force, totally surprising the crew?. Considering that later in the book those same submarines are able to detect enemy submarines that are miles away, it makes this premise a mite unbelievable. Some may say a small point, but unfortunately the entire plot revolves round the stealing of the Rising Sun submarines in the first place.And also - the US command actually believes that ALL SIX Rising Sun submarines sank AT THE SAME TIME. Come on - one sinking, maybe, two possibly, but all six?So ...yes I agree with the absurdity of a submersible sneaking up on a nuc sub and taking it over (did I mention not once, but six times??).And ... yes, it is an exciting book etc etc. It's just a bit far fetched in some areas.So, three stars from this reader..."},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"Those among my fellow reviewers that lauded this book for realism must be blissfully unaware of the most fundamental aspects of naval warfare.Imagine the largest task force of the U.S. Navy sailing into harm's way at 40 knots with no anti-submarine screen, in tight parade formation, ready for the picking. It's insulting. When you add a mini-sub docking to a larger one without so much of a ping heard in the target sub, even the base premise for the book falls through.Of course, it's the only way for Mercurio to bugle his hero like John Wayne in a bad western. While PAcino, as a recurring character should, has depth and is attaching, all other characters are pathetic one-liners. What a joke!"},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"Good experience.

I will read the rest of Michael DiMercurio's novels from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"The best sub thriller, I have read this one is &quot;Un Put downable&quot;. From the begining until the end this book demands to be read, the main character Admiral Pacino unlike the lead characters from some other authors is actually believeable. This book will take you from tears to victory cries. For those that like this type of reading it is a must have, as indeed is the rest of the series.I thoroughly recommend this excellent book and egerly look forward to more from Michael DiMercurio, who by the way I would never have found if it had not been for Amazon books.Thanks Michael"},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"111 ships and 20 submarines sunk, numerous aircrafts and choppers downed, plus one surviving sub and another damaged sub. Sunken vessels include three latest version of US aircraft carriers. MiG51s, F-22s, great stuffs. On top of that you have a malfunctioning sub operational software.In the near future, China has recently had a civil war, thus, Red and White China. The Reds are losing fast, thus, they have managed to obtain stolen subs. Not to be confused with ordinary subs, they are the most advance Japanese model being tested for their seaworthiness. Lots of naval actions.Michael diMercurio explained the armaments and submarines involved in his plot so deftly, that one might imagine they are real. Submarine and military fiction enthusiasts will be thrilled.The only thing diMercurio is flailing behind are the Asian pronounciations of the names. He should have done a couple more hours of research on the names.Overall, an excellent four-star fiction read."},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"As a longtime fan of Michael DiMercurio, I found that this was one of his best books yet. It kept you turning the pages, eager to see what would befall his characters next. You fall at the tragedies and can feel your pulse race at the action as it hits top speed. His characters are well defined and contain plenty of depth, wholly believable, his knowledge of submarines and warfare, as well as the cutting edge of new technology is first rate, and his insight to the politics of the military and government add more than a little realism to his work. VADM Pacino is a great character, and is pivotal in all his books. He is at once human and superhuman in his qualities as a person, and strength of character and actions, and his struggles and triumphs in his personal life are an additional driving force in each book, but especially this one as he struggles to take control of his life once more, adding to the tension of an oncoming war with Red China. Can't wait for the next one to come out!!!"},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"Michael DiMercurio has done it again. From the opening pages the action starts, and he keeps it going right to the end. DiMercurio gives us another look at futuristic technology that may very well appear some time in the future. His knowledge of submarine warfare and the way he uses this knowledge in his books is like no other. The way he writes it makes you feel that you are there."},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"Mr. DiMercurio did a fantastic job with this book! The story flows very good and is one of the best story tellers I read. The plot is a very believable and easy to understand. The detail he gives you on the SSNX submarine is great. Admiral Chu Hua-Feng is a great enemy who does not hold any torpedos, he uses his arament to his advantage. The Rising Sun Class submarine in this book are also described very well. If you are deciding to purchase this book I highly recommend it! It was definetly worth it!"},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"As a longtime submarine novel fan, and one of DiMercurio's biggest supporters, I am happy to endorse 'Piranha: Firing Point' as easily one of the best adventure/sub novels ever written. DiMercurio rely's upon his previous history as a submariner in this yarn about a broken-in-two China ready to spark World War III. Obviously America cannot stand idly by and allow this to happen, but first we have to understand that it IS happening right under our noses.Japanese subs are being hijacked and only Pacino's mentor realizes this, but nobody seems to want to accept his theory and ultimately rejects his advice as ramblings of a dying man. Rejected by everyone except Michael 'Patch' Pacino, decorated American Sub Hero. Once this theory has been proven, the race to avert all-out war is on.I found the SSNX to be DiMercurio's finest creation-under-the-seas to date and very much worthy of a novel such as this. I applaud the storyline that while not necessarily torn from the headlines, certainly COULD become fact any day. If you have read DiMercurio's previous submarine tales, you are in for a treat with this latest offering. A fine sub tale told with style and a great deal of adventure."},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"This is my first read from author Michael Dimercurio. In my opinion he ranks up there with the Larry Bond's and Tom Clancy's of this genre. The book was non-stop action from cover to cover with well developed characters (not over developed). He is most definately a good story teller - without boring you with too many details. I just purchased Barracuda Final Bearing and I'm looking forward to reading it."},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"A look into the possible future of submarine warfare.

Flash forward and I had a few ideas, bought this book, presto. The series is as good as I remember and I can enjoy it more since I now know what's going on lol. I'd recommend the series to anyone who likes military drama (Not emo drama, just drama) and to people who like navy anything."},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"Once again, author and former submariner Michael DiMercurio has provided me with hours of reading enjoyment and once again, I have but one regret--that the book ended too quickly. I had bought this book only a few days after hearing that THREAT VECTOR was out and I wanted to read this one first, to keep the continuity of the series intact. As I said previously in my review of BARRACUDA FINAL BEARING, Mr. DiMercurio knows his subject matter and unlike other technically trained people, he ACTUALLY HAS THE ABILITY to write! Michael DiMercurio has written a very plausible and believable story about the break-up of China (through a civil war) into two distinctly separate entities. One is the old but familiar Red China. The other is Free China, a country more western in philosophy and outlook. However, the losers in the civil war can't stand the fact that they've lost and want to regain that part of the country which has successfully seceded. The author provides a very well developed antagonist for this book, as well. Chinese Admiral Chu Hua-Feng is a person to be reckoned with. He is in many ways the ideal literary enemy. DiMercurio imbues him with qualities that make him detestable but at the same time, understandable. He provides the focal point for keeping the reader's interest in what the Red Chinese are doing and unfortunately for our American hero, VADM Michael Pacino, he is also the perfect military match. But as anyone can guess, Michael DiMercurio has something else up his author's sleeve and he deals those cards just when they are needed most. I have read all of the Michael DiMercurio books to date (in the order written and released) and what I really enjoy most is that the author continues to keep the story lines fresh and me wanting more. As I said above, I just wish I didn't get through them so quickly because then, I would be able to savor the tension a little bit longer. Speaking of tension, that's something I have noticed that Michael DiMercurio is excellent at. In fact, I'd say he's an expert. From what I've read of the art of writing, that's a very valuable skill to be able to employ. Michael DiMercurio has done that well in ALL of the Michael Pacino stories to date and yet, each new encounter is as fresh and interesting as the ones that came before. In my reader's mind, that is the sign of an accomplished writer. Another aspect of these novels that is also handled well are the technical details of submarine warfare, powerplants, navigation and &quot;fighting the ship.&quot; Although Mr. DiMercurio has two engineering degrees (one from the Naval Academy and one from MIT), he has the great skill to be able to write for the lay reader who does not possess his technical education. That ability, in someone so technically educated and trained, is a gifr not to be overlooked.Mr. DiMercurio's description of America's latest submarine, the SSNX is actually brilliant in its simplicity and yet it is the simplicity that makes the inner workings that much easier for us &quot;non-techies&quot; to imagine. When I read this book, I actually felt and believed that I was in the control room with Admiral Pacino. I felt his tension, I knew what he had in the way of resources and knew that he knew that failure was not only &quot;not an option,&quot; but that failure could have the gravest ramifications for the United States as a whole.I read somewhere that Michael DiMercurio has more mainstream writing in the pipeline for his publisher(s) and readers. I do not know what genre or type of story line he has in store, nor do I know who his new characters will be. You know what? I don't care. This author has already captured my attention and loyalty. In essence, I'm actually looking forward to the trip because I'd like to see where this really skilled writer will be taking us.As a loyal reader, I also have a couple of other comments I'd like to leave here as well. The first is a rhetorical question. Why haven't any of these books been optioned as movies? Secondly, why were the schematics at the front of the books deleted? I never understood why those valuable descriptive tools were eliminated.I'd also like to make a comparison here, as well. If Michael DiMercurio's &quot;mainstream&quot; fiction is as good as his undersea warfare novels are, I truly believe that we will be hearing more from this very talented author. And Michael, if you need someone to read your draft(s), let me know. I volunteer."},{"Title":"Piranha: Firing Point","review":"Another winner from DiMercurio! This is his best novel yet of the ones I've read so far, and contains some great action scenes and imaginative technology of the future, which doesn't always run as planned, note the SSNX, a brand new high-tech sub in a combat situation. The description of the new supersub is so highly detailed yet easy to understand, even for non-military readers. The story concerns a war between divided states in a new China escalating, and US navy units sent to deal with the Chinese's latest acquisitions, a Japanese Rising Sun-class sub, are attacked with plasma explosive torpedoes and sunk. So enter our hero Admiral Michael Pacino and a host of ongoing characters with the very latest weaponry and subs available to try to avert a major world war!

The animated version wasn't bad at all (I own it). But the book is better than either of them. And, like all the best kids' books, this one, though written for 8-14's, can still be enjoyed when you're way past childhood.Disney necessarily simplified the story and characters for his movie versions, cutting out a lot of the subtle characterization and background that makes the book seem so completely plausible. Here, instead of \\"Roger and Anita,\\" we have \\"the Dearlys,\\" a businessman and his bride, who are \\"owned\\" by Pongo and--not Perdita, but \\"Missis\\"--and have not one \\"Nanny\\" but two, \\"Nanny Cook\\" (a real cook) and \\"Nanny Butler\\" (a real butler). We learn of Cruella deVil's sinister family history, her furrier husband (never mentioned in the films), and her obsession with furs. We learn that her employees, the Baddun Brothers, dream of appearing on \\"What's My Crime?\\" Many of the Pongos' pups--Lucky, Patch, Cadpig, Roly--are fleshed out as they never were on the screen. The sheepdog Colonel is less of a buffoon and more a shrewd strategist. The drama of the puppies' births and early lives is much better portrayed, as is the journey of Pongo and Missis to Suffolk to rescue their stolen family, with introductions to the dogs that help them on their way--the hospitable Golden Retriever, the aged Spaniel and his \\"pet,\\" 90-year-old Sir Charles, the flighty Irish Setter whose efforts come to naught through a fire, and the tough Staffordshire who occupies the moving van the Dalmatians board to shorten their homeward trip. Cruella's white Persian cat is here too--a clever animal \\"biding her time\\" as she waits for the opportunity to settle the score for her drowned litters--and so is the sheepdog's \\"pet,\\" two-year-old Tommy Tompkins, who lends his toy hay-cart to the army of London-bound dogs. Yet despite a certain anthropomorphization, all the animals are recognizably animals; they behave as such and don't do anything you couldn't visualize such creatures doing. The humor is much more subtle than in the films, no doubt reflecting Smith's British personality. There are episodes like the brief rest in a country church and the Dalmatians' revenge against Cruella that would have made great theater. I still enjoy the animated version, but I keep coming back to the book."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"There are wonderful parts of the book that are skipped over in the Disney movie. For example, Cruella de Vil has her own history- she's married!- which adds a lot of depth to the plot. And the combining of Perdita and Missus into one character in the movie was really awful, since Perdita has her own sad story that deserves attention.I love this story. It's utterly charming. So many wonderful characters. So much fun. if you can get this book for your child's collection, do it. The movie just doesn't cut it."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"This book is wonderful. When Disney changed it into a movie, the story lost many of its special touches, and the story was no longer told so much as shown from the dog's perspective.The main plot of the story is similar to that of Disney's animated movie, but contains many small differences, and more detail. These differences are what make the book as good as it is. In the book, right after Pongo and his wife Missus Pongo have their 15 puppies, everyone is worried about how one dog will feed 15 puppies without losing strength. The solution to their problem comes in the form of a stray Dalmatian, found on the side of the road, whom they name Perdita. Perdita has a history of her own, and her sub-plot is one of the many things that add depth to the story, but were lost in the movie.The story is told, continuously, from a dog's point of view. It is mentioned how humans believe that they own dogs; whereas the truth is that the dogs own them. Pongo and Missus continually refer to their humans as their pets, and one can see that mentality in their conversations. All the dogs in the story seem to enjoy doting on their humans. Another interesting quirk is how the dogs are \`married'. Pongo continually refers to Missus as his wife, and she calls him husband. A dog's marriage ceremony does not seem to take very long, or require a priest or government official. Two willing dogs can run off into the forest, and when they come back, be married. Puppies will most likely come soon after.Throughout the book are scattered illustrations. These pictures are done in black, white, and shades of grey, and look like well-shade pencil drawings. They are beautiful, and very life-like.A wonderful book, it is much better than Disney's movie. Full of fun tales, even in the midst of the puppies flight from Cruella's house.Loggie-log-log-log"},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"I won my tattered, dog eared, Disyned-fied copy of \\"100 Dalmatians\\" in a school auction when I was 7 years old. I learned to read late because I'm dyslexic (hence any bad spelling you may notice) so this was the first real chapter book that I ever owned and the very first I read.It was great. This is a fabulous novel for all ages but especially for kids. I'm not going to re-hash the plot because I think the whole world knows it by now. The themes of good parenting, loyalty, and of course, good, intelligent, kind dogs are things that every child should learn. It is true that this book contains some talk of puppy killing, which didn't disturb me, and I'm guessing that today's 7 year olds wouldn't be scared by it either.Another reason to read, or let your child read this book is that it will encourage a love of dogs, and having grown up with dogs every minute of my life, I can tell you having one (or more) helps immensely in all kinds of situations, social and otherwise. It provides an example of love and loyalty, as well as the responsibility involved in feeding and caring for a dog. However on that note Dalmatians, contrary to the lovable Pongo, Missus and Perdita in this book, do not make good dogs for children. They don't have the temperament for it. If you read this book and decide to get a dog for your child (an excellent idea) I recommend a good old fashioned mutt (they're smarter because they're not inbred) or a border collie, which can actually be trained to be nannies for children because of their sheep herding instincts.Anyway, five stars. Great for the whole family, and an excellent way to encourage reading in a child of any age. At 18 years old I still love reading this book. And the sequel, \\"The Twilight Barking\\" isn't half bad either."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"This is a charming and delightful book that is deserving of its status as a classic of children's literature.It takes a dog's eye view of the world, and features as its heroes Pongo and Missis, a pair of Dalmatians whose litter of puppies disappears one day.As they set off to reunite their family, they find themselves in a struggle against the illegal coat-making operation of one Cruella Deville, an iconic villainess whose name and passion for high temperatures hint that she may be the devil incarnate.The book becomes a fantastic quest book that takes place in the heart of England. The adult dalmatians find friends and foes along their path, and end up liberating nearly a hundred little puppies.Smith has fun with the details and logistics of feeding, disguising, and transporting the refugee puppies, and young readers will enjoy learning the particulars of the secret lives of dogs.The original animated movie adaptation is a good and fairly faithful movie in its own right, but the book is better by far.Some parents might shy away from the book because of the gruesome idea that Cruella literally skins her young charges, but I think that the darker elements are an integral part of the winning tone, which refrains from talking down to children.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"Most people are probably familair with the Disney adaption of this book. However, even I was surprised at how much Disney cut out of the film version.In Dodie Smith's book, Pongo, Missis, Perdita, and the 15 puppies take on dimensions only hinted at on the silver screen. We can feel Pongo's and Missis's agony as their children are stolen. We are with them as they cross England as they trek to Hell Hall to attempt a rescue before Cruella has the puppies skinned for fur coats. And everyone will shed a tear as, after days of trudging through the snow, avoiding the De Vil woman and local dog catchers, make it home in time for Christmas with the kindly help of a boxer and a removal van.This is a wonderful, charming book that you won't be able to put down and that you will find yourself coming back to again and again."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"We bought this audio book hoping to wean our young children (who enjoyed both movie versions of this book very much) off of movies and get them more interested in \\"real stories.\\"I have to tell you that this story far exceeded my expectations. Not only was it a fun story that my children enjoyed immensely, but one with subtleties, humor and bits of truth sprinkled throughout that had me listening and laughing right alongside them.There are a lot of dog stories out there and I admit to being a dog-lover (well at least of big dogs), but this is a lot more than just a dog story. Certainly there's a great deal of humor, adventure and ... Dalmatians... but underneath all that you get many tidbits of truth that are applicable to life itself.Martin Jarvis does a fabulous job in narrating this unabridged classic. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"Completely and utterly charming. I very much enjoyed listening to this book (there's just nothing like a British actor, reading to you!), and can see myself reading this to my children in just a few short years. Of course, we've seen the movie, and while the folks at Disney did their best to remain true to the story, there just isn't anything like reading (or hearing) Dodie Smith's words come alive on the page. Just fabulous. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"I'll start by saying that I grew up with the Disney movie, which I love very much. I had just recently purchased a VHS tape of the movie and watched it, only to be reminded that it was based on a novel (during the credits). So finally I went online and decided to buy it.The book is very different from the movie, much more involved with the dogs' world than the humans', which I liked. It seems Disney left many characters out of the movie, and changed most of the ones they kept. For example, Perdita is a lost, liver-spotted dalmatian that \\"Mrs. Dearly\\" finds alongside the road, who helps foster the 15 puppies birthed by \\"Missis\\", who is Pongo's actual wife. Perdita later finds her lost puppies at Hell Hall and is reunited with them, along with her husband who is taken away after they are \\"married\\". Other left out characters include an old Spaniel, a Staffordshire Terrier, Cruella's Persian cat, and a show dog.Cruella DeVil's husband, who is a furrier (one who makes animal skin coats) is never mentioned. \\"Saul and Jasper\\" in the book are replaced with \\"Horace and Jasper\\", and there are two nannies (Nanny Butler and Nanny Cook) instead of one.I found two typos in the book (my copy, at least), one is where \\"that\\" is misspelled \\"tht\\" and a stray parenthesis mark.This book has a certain charm and a clever way of portraying the way dogs think and act. The emotions are strong and well-portrayed in each character, and you definitely get a feeling to how they are coping with situations in the story. The one I felt was the strongest was Missis having to deal with life outside a warm cozy fire and all the comforts of home as they search for their children.Overall, I like the story very much, and I'll probably re-read it over and over as time goes on."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"This is one of those books I found as a child AFTER seeing the Disney movie and reading that it was based on a book. As usual, the book is so much better! If you've never read this book, but you're fond of the movie, or of dogs, you will love it. The story is truly heart-warming, and I love that certain scenes are oh-so familiar if you've seen the movie, but so much of the story is completely new! Did you know Perdita is NOT the name of the \\"leading lady\\"? That's all I'll say about the actual story, but please, read it for yourself, even if you don't have kids. It's a wonderful read-aloud book, too--the first time my husband ever heard about this book was when I made him lie down and let me read it to him. We didn't have a child then, so now we get to share it with our son, too. Truly, a wonderful book. However, just so you know--the second book is not nearly so good! I own both of them, but I probably won't read the second one more than one more time, when I read it to my son. It's just not at all the same thing--aliens in London? Anyway, read 101 Dalmations and I know you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"An all time classic, appeals to all, weather you are 5 or 55, if you just go on the film versions you are missing out as this marvellous tale offers so much more. I am 24 year old bricklayer and I read this to my two kids, who are 8 and 6 and they love it."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"This book is a funny, incredibly imanginative book! I loved every word of it and couldn't put it down. There is so much more to the story then the Disney movie! Buy this book!"},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"I am well on my way to reading this 101 times!! I started at age 11 and still enjoy it at age 33. Dodie Smith really makes you believe in the dogs and the world she has created. I often use 101 Dalmations as my &quot;de-stress&quot; book during stressful times in my life or if I have just finished an intense, or emotionoally charged book. This can be read alone or to your children. Don't let your children grow up with only the Disney version, introduce them to the REAL 101 Dalmations."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"My father first read this book to me when I was five years old.This book wasn't written with Disney in mind and it's a great bookjust the same. The characters are extremely well defined and perfect for the small (5 to 10 years) child. It does require significant reading by the parent because it isn't a Disney picture book. It has approximately 200 pages and it's adult print.I've had this book read to me numerous times and I've read it at least 15 times myself. Whenever I get depressed this story always picks me up. Just so you know where I'm coming from I'm a 25 year male old Air Force veteran and university student. If this book could win me over it can win just about anyone over. Trust me, it's a great book."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"This book is quite different from the Disney movie, and therefore much better. Pongo's wife is not named Perdita, but Missus even though there is a Perdita here. Some of the names of the dogs have been changed as well and there are many events that happen here that didn't in the movie. Dodie Smith is a very funny writer and she makes you feel as if you are one of the characters. Read this book!"},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"Great book! I loved it! This book was so good that even adults would enjoy it! Dodie Smith did a great job on this one! I recommend this book to all children and adults!"},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"Though Pongo and Missis are exactly the BEST couple(Missis is not the sharpest tool in the shed whiel Pongo is a genious in a dog's boddie)they provide inchanting adventure's a they scearch for thier pups.

It is very believeable although it is clearly fiction. This book is one of the best books I've read and believe me,I've read alot of books.Although Disney did a wonderful job on adapting the book, the movie can't do it justice, because, unless you want another three hour movie, you can't get all the details in.Like in the movie, Pongo and Missis (later know as Perdita) set out to find the pups. However, the book also has many sub-plots that the movie does not(ie. Mothers losing their kids and still loving them). It was the ovious thought put into the book that wasn't in the movie that inspired me to get the sequel, &quot; The Starlight Barking&quot;, from amazon.com All in all, the book is a must have for dog lovers and those who liked the movie, you'll LOVE the book."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"Pongo and his new wife Missis, along with their two human \\"pets,\\" are delighted by the arrival of puppies, but their joy is shattered when the puppies mysteriously disappear. The two dogs do some sleuthing to find out where their puppies have gone, and embark on a cross-country adventure to rescue them from the diabolical Cruella de Ville.There is a genre of 1950's British children's literature, usually populated with animal characters, that is charming and enjoyable for both children and adults. This is well written, with high action and suspense, appealing characters, and quite a bit of understated humor.There is an unfortunate (and blessedly brief) scene reflecting a male attitude of superiority toward females, in which Pongo and a male spaniel laugh together \\"in a very masculine way\\" at Missis' inability to tell right from left (p. 91). This attitude does not permeate the rest of the book, however, and the story loses nothing in the deletion of the exchange. It might be enough to explain that the spaniel thought Missis was not as smart as he because she was a lady, but that he was wrong because God created individuals with varying levels of intelligence, unrelated to their gender.Apart from this small blemish, the story is full of humor, marital and filial loyalty, kindness, generosity, courage, and sacrifice for the sake of those we love. Although the reading level is in the 8-12 range, it will appeal to younger listeners as well."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"Dodie Smith crafted a masterpiece of humor, beautifully wrought characters, and the power of love.

I have reread it once every ten years or so ever since. The author really captures Pongo, Missis, and Perdita as dogs in a human world. They can think and talk to one another, but they otherwise are still dogs. The love and devotion they show in finding and protecting their puppies is heartwarming to me even as an adult. I highly recommend this book to young readers and the young at heart."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"I am a huge fan of the animated film but there is nothing that comes close to this book I LOVE it"},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"This wonderful story brought back some great memories when I read it to my own daughter. It is so much better than the movie could ever be."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"Many of Walt Disney's movies were based off of classic books. 101 Dalmatians is a great book, told from Pongo and Missis side. True, Disney took some parts out and added some parts in, the stories are vaugly similar. I love the movie (the animated one, the real-life one just confused me) and I now love the book!!!!"},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"Impulsively went back to read my childhood favorite of oh-so-many years ago. Still a cute story and a rousing \\"noble\\" adventure, but definitely sexist in the manner of its time.I particularly enjoyed the delicate description of how Perdita \\"got married\\" and the emotional complications of having an attractive young female dog suddenly appear in Pongo's family. And the breezy overview of how Mr. Dearly came to be suddenly wealthy is very amusing - much like Monty Python's \\"How to Rid the World of All Known Diseases.\\"I don't know that I would give this book to a child today without a bit of framing discussion, but it certainly was a pleasure to reread it myself. As everyone notes, it's much much better than the animated movie."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"I read this book to my grandchildren and they loved the story. They had seen the Disney presentation and were familiar with that story. This one was more detailed and we learned about brown and white dalmations.

To this day when I hear dogs barking at night, I wonder....I now have three children of my own and have purchased the book for my oldest son. I just caught him with his book light, under his covers after \\"lights out\\"!"},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"It is funny. It is exciting. It has an endearing warmth to the heart. Pongo and Missis, a younge married couple of dalmatian dogs, live with Mr. and Mrs. Dearly, a younge married couple of humans. Fifteen delightful puppis are born, to be adored by all. And then-the puppies are stolen. Bye whom? Top men at Scatland yard are frankly baffled. But one of the keenest brains od Dogdom was at work-Pongo had a clue! Nearby lived a sinister woman named Cruella de Ville who had a pasion fo furs. She had shown a marked interest in the puppies-and been heard to wish she had a white fur coat with black spots. By a way known only to dogs (sesret though noisy), Pongo got all the dogs of England to help trace the pups-to a mysterios house in deepest Suffolk. Then he and Missis set out to the rescue. They traveled by night, befriended by many generous dogs. But the recsue turned out to be an even greater task than Pongo expected, for the mysterios house was nothing less than a dalmatian fur farm, guarded by the adominable Baddun brothers. Many dangers had to be faced. Adventure follows adventure as the suspense mounts higher and higher. Ther are many suprises of all is the one the Dearlys get, on a snowy Christmas Eve near the stories triumphant end. Dog-lovers of all gaes will delight in Pongo, Missis, and their family, espesially the tiny Cadpig, who is crazy abot television. Then ther is Perdita, the touching lost dog.And a great dane, a gallant spaniel, a shrewd old sheepdog, and many other dogs of varios breeds play important parts-not to mention a couple of cats,a horse, and some kindly cows. Animals, humans, London, and the country seen are charmingly portrayed in this heart touching tal like no other. A must read."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"The book I read aloud to my 7 year old daughter is the 1956, 1957 Copyright with a yellow hardback cover with drawings of dogs on it. The illustrators are Janet and Anne Grahame-Johnstone.This book is fun and exciting and is more enjoyable than the Disney cartoon version. You will be surprised by the Dalmation Perdita in this book. She is not what you expect. Also, you will not find out where the \\"101th Dalmation\\" comes from until the last two chapters unless you are very, very perceptive. I kept coming up with 100 total Dalmations until the very end.This book is a must read for everyone; but, you will probably have to borrow it from your local library. This book needs to be rereleased."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"101 Dalmations deserves ongoing mention as an excellent audio that will appeal to a wide age range. Martin Jarvis' smooth voice provides a clear, unabridged production bringing to life the classic story of a host of puppies who must escape the cruel Cruella de Vil in order to get back to their home. Cruella has a fur coat in mind - made of dalmations. The whole family will find this fun and a fine listen."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"Whatever their merits, none of the film adaptations come remotely close to capturing the spirit of this lovely, charming, funny and yet melancholy novel. I first read it when I was nine years old, and then re-read it over and over more times than I could ever count. It is quintessentially British -- as a child growing up in the western U.S., I fell in love with the utter Englishness of this story, so foreign to my modern, suburban world. (On a trip to London when I was twenty, I had to visit Regent's Park and the Inner Circle, and tingles went up and down my spine, as though the spirits of Pongo and Missis were still lingering there!) This book has everything for a young reader -- adventure, romance, mortal peril, and a happy ending. It speaks volumes about the powers of love and faith, without being a \\"message\\" book. All the characters, major and minor, are fleshed out and full of life. Cruella de Vil has, of course, become one of the great villains in childrens' literature, but most of all I remember brave Pongo and Missis, gentle, heartbroken Perdita, the puppies, and the friends they meet on their journeys. The images of little Cadpig in the church on Christmas Eve, and the kindly old spaniel and his master, have stuck with me all my life. I absolutely love this book. It is one of the greatest works of literature for children ever written.As a side note, older readers (teenager/young adult) might want to check out another Dodie Smith novel, \\"I Capture the Castle.\\" Like the Hundred and One Dalmatians, it is a beautifully told story, full of atmosphere, vivid imagery, memorable moments, and living, breathing characters. It is a coming-of-age story about first love that reads like a modern-day Jane Austen, honest, funny and poignant. If only Ms. Smith had written more books. . ."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"My wife purchased this to read to our daughter, it is not the classic story.. but simple matter of fact rending of the disney version of the original book.. The text is dull and uninspiring, and lacks all the little details of the original that spark a childs imagination."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"I owned this book by Dodie Smith when I was a boy. I loved it and from this story I developed an even stronger love for dogs and animals in general. Written in a most loving way, the story takes us beyond the later Disney film's watered down presentation of the story and dives deep into the realm of dogs. We discover the magic of \\"dogdom\\" and how dogs of every kind communicate with each other and with their humans (as Dodie states, and I am certainly paraphrasing, dogs own their humans, but let them think they own the dogs because it is so sweet!)I have only one complaint about this publication of the book. the illustrations are just short of atrocious. I had an earlier edition of the book that had wonderful drawings that clearly were created with a real understanding of the story and what Dodie was trying to say. The illustrations in this edition look like they were pulled from someone's generic dog clip art. They are technically fine in their own right (I could NEVER draw like that), but they just don't capture the magic of the book.If you can look past the illustrations, this is a wonderful story and a well written book.101 Dalmations has appeal to dog lovers of all ages, breeds and sizes.Dodie Smith - Thanks for leaving this gem for all to share."},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"wow, what can i say about this book?? how about absolutely amazing?? this book is truly a book to read to your own kids, or to little ones. it is full of cute picuters,and it will make the kids laugh"},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"I really liked this book, and it has been a classic with me since i have been growing up.

The dogs are very similar to children - they call their owners &quot;pets&quot; and believe they shape the behavior of the people around them. Pongo and Perdita also have an extensive network of dog informants (tapped into when they &quot;walk&quot; the owners). This novel also struck me as an excellent introduction into British post-war life for children (I always thought it especially wonderful that the male owner was some type of British tax genius with lots of connections in the government). While Cruella deVille is not quite as scary as the Disney character, children and adults everywhere can appreciate and identify her with people who see animals as only something to provide a service or product for them - not as creatures with emotions and thoughts of their own deserving of life. A wonderful anti-fur demonstration is included in the climax of the novel. All interested readers should be sure to pick up Smith's sequel as well!"},{"Title":"The 101 Dalmatians","review":"This makes a great bedtime story for kids.

I definitely would read it again and recommend it."},{"Title":"Dynamics of Contention (Cambridge Studies in Contentious Politics)","review":"If you are an academic involved with the field of social movements, you need to read this book, simply because so much of the current debate in the field is about it. If you are not such a person, don't bother. Dynamics of Contention is immensely disappointing. Within the field of social movement studies, the authors are supposed to be the equivalent of Olympic-level divers--but what they deliver is a spectacular bellyflop. I give the book two stars because the core ideas lying behind it are good. The authors want to break down the artificial academic barriers separating various fields that all deal with \\"contentious politics\\"--social movements, revolutions, ethnic conflict, etc. They also want to move beyond their own structurally oriented work, so central to the academic field of social movements, to try to incorporate the ideas of their cultural constructionist critics, plus introduce more of a focus on social relations. Instead of trying to create an invariant model, they want to search for patterns that recurr in widely different types of social conflicts, with different outcomes. Finally, their methodology of comparing unlike cases to find the common patterns is intriguing. Unfortunately, they never really develop a solid intellectual framework for all this. They identify some common patterns, but never explain the dynamics underlying them or why they are so common. They are rather inept in their attempts to bring culture into the picture, engaging in very thin description. In their attempt to create a more relational approach, they completely abandonn all the valuable structurally oriented work they've done. Finally, despite their attempt to focus on relationships and dynamic social actors, human agency--as in so much academic work on social movements--falls out of the picture. Although the authors obviously put a lot of work into this book, it just does not come together."},{"Title":"Dynamics of Contention (Cambridge Studies in Contentious Politics)","review":"Charles Tilly and his colleagues' effort in Dynamics of Contention is a colossal one. They aim to develop a new way of looking at contentious politics and try to gauge similar patterns in what have so far been regarded as distinct phenomena. Such an effort ends up having merits as well as handicaps, though. I will try to address three issues in this paper (one merit and two handicaps).The place of case studies in comparative research has long been an issue of debate. Given that all empirical analyses in Dynamics of Contention are eventually case studies, the virtue of the arguments developed in this book might support/undermine the overall virtue of case studies regarding comparative research. Obviously, the arguments and conclusions of Tilly and his colleagues cannot be generalized from their pair-studies, and these scholars admit this from the very start anyway. Yet if we consider theory-building a process comprising of several steps, rather than an end point where we finalize our propositions, case studies become useful tools that we can benefit from in most of the steps of theory building. What makes case studies in general and Tilly and his friends' research in particular important is that via thorough analyses of individual cases, this type of research is better equipped to capture the \\"mechanism\\" and \\"processes\\" that connect relevant phenomena. And this gives them a relative advantage over large-N studies in speculating about causal relationships. Indeed, then, if Dynamics of Contention is not a theory-building research, it is a very good hypothesis-generating one.Yet it seems to me that Tilly et al. are doing what Sartori once criticized as excessive abstraction. The primary aim of the authors of Dynamics of Contention is to go beyond the previous static approaches and develop a dynamic approach to contentious politics. Though this sounds very exciting and promising, Tilly and his colleagues seem to achieve dynamism mostly through emptying the substantive elements of their arguments. Their relational approach focuses on the general question of \\"how\\" contentious politics influence social life; but this approach has very little to say about more concrete questions like \\"who\\", \\"what\\", or \\"when\\"; all these substantive questions are left to be answered by the specificities of \\"episodes\\". As such, all Tilly and his colleagues end up create is a model rather than a theory.Finally, after reading the section on democratization -where I felt most at home-, I started to doubt the novelty of Tilly and his colleagues' dynamic approach. Tilly et al. criticize the previous research on democratization for focusing on conditions rather than mechanisms. They then offer a dynamic account of democratization with mechanisms operating on three domains: public politics, inequality, and networks of trust. Yet it seems to me that these three domains have already been identified by the current literature on democratization. Moore's (1966) classic book illustrates the changing public politics as a result of changing economic conditions; Rueschemeyer et al. (1992) argue that the central dilemma of a capitalist economic development -increasing inequality between the capitalist and labor classes- was the primary cause of the development of democracy in the Western world; and finally Lipset (1959) and others contend that rising civic virtues as a result of educational and demographic improvements, which alter existing relations of trust, play an important role in democratization. Tilly and his colleagues might still criticize these accounts for being partial. Yet in this case, what we need would be a synthesis of some current research, rather than a novel approach which they try to develop."},{"Title":"Dynamics of Contention (Cambridge Studies in Contentious Politics)","review":"This book is ambitious in scope in both good and bad ways. The value added is that the authors try to break down disciplinary walls in the study of contentious politics. However, this ends up with a broad, unwieldy framework that essentially boils down to \\"it depends.\\" There isn't a whole upon which to base social scientific research or test hypotheses. Moreover, when the reanalyze the cases of the U.S. Civil Rights movement and the French Revolution, their \\"new\\" framework doesn't really add anything to the traditional version of those events. It's worth heeding their clarion call to take a more nuanced view of the interactions between identity and action in contentious politics, but this work alone doesn't really add much more to our understanding."},{"Title":"Logic For Learning","review":"This book gives an introduction to computational logic and machine learning in the context of higher-order logic, and also serves as a rudimentary introduction to functional logic programming languages. My interest in it was stirred by its emphasis on comprehensibility in learning, its attempt to discuss inductive logic programming and the construction of inductive decision trees in a higher-order logic context, and to see whether or not I could use the ALKEMY language for practical applications.In chapter 1, the author takes the position that higher-order logic meets the needs of knowledge representation in that it can represent complex individuals, is able to formulate the hypothesis language precisely, and allows the computation of values of a function in the background theory on an individual. He also justifies the use of types in the book, claiming that such a use will result in a &quot;substantial payoff&quot;. The author identifies seven different learning issues that he will study in the book. One of these concerns the representation of individuals. Another concerns the specification of a signature for the target function whose definition is to be induced. The third learning issue deals with the training data, each piece of data giving the value of the target function for a particular individual. The fourth issue deals with the need for a background theory, which is a collection of definitions of the functions that act on the individuals. The fifth issue concerns the hypothesis language, which specifies the functions in the background theory. The need for evaluating the predictive power of the constructed hypothesis is the sixth learning issue.The last issue concerns the requirement of comprehensibility of the hypotheses returned by the learning system. The hypotheses must provide an insight and explanation of the data, rather than merely a &quot;black-box&quot; with possibly high predictive power.Chapter 2 gives an overview of the syntax and semantics of higher-order logic. The author clarifies in detail what is meant by &quot;defined inductively&quot;, and proves a principle of induction on the structure of types. The importance of the collection of parameter-free &quot;closed&quot; types is brought out, and the author gives examples of various types that have been used in logic programming. Type substitutions, terms, subterms, and term substitutions are all defined in great detail, and many examples of each are given. Term substitution can be tricky and does not merely involve the replacing of a free occurrence of a variable by a term. He also shows, in the context of term substitution, that one does not need to do run-time type checking in logic programming. The model and proof theory of this theory of types is developed at the end of the chapter.In chapter 3, the author how to represent knowledge in logic theories. For machine learning applications, a particular set of terms, called &quot;basic terms&quot; are used to represent individuals. Basic terms are defined in terms of default and normal terms with a suitable equivalance relation put on the normal terms. In higher order logic, sets are represented essentially as characteristic functions, i.e. as predicates. The concept of a default term arises in this method of representation, and is defined inductively in terms of default data constructors. Default terms are then used to define (inductively) &quot;normal terms&quot;. A notion of equivalence of normal terms is defined, and a strict total order is put on the normal terms in order to allow one to select a single representative from an equivalence class. The &quot;basic&quot; terms are then defined. The author shows that the normal equivalence relation is the identity on basic terms, and this allows him to define a &quot;basic form&quot;. He then shows how to obtain the basic form of a normal term. Several different metrics and kernels are defined on the basic terms.The author addresses the construction of predicates in chapter 4, this being done incrementally via the composition of transformations. The author then defines a larger class of predicates, called the &quot;standard predicates&quot;, along with a subclass, the &quot;regular predicates&quot;. The &quot;background theory&quot; is the theory consisting of the definitions of the transformations. After placing a relation of strict total order on the standard predicates, the regular predicates are defined by induction on the number of transformations in a predicate and in terms of this ordering. Every standard predicate is shown to be equivalent to a regular predicate and an algorithm is given for constructing this regular predicate, the resulting regular predicate being called a &quot;regularization&quot; of the standard predicate. Then predicate rewrite systems (PRS), are studied, and related to machine learning as a generation of a search space of standard predicates.To determine when one predicate logically implies the other, the author defines an implication &quot;preorder&quot; on the space of predicates, which then allows the characterization of a PRS as &quot;monotone&quot;, and a notion of &quot;regularization&quot; of a PRS.The goal of the next chapter is to develop a computational formalism by viewing programs as collections of definitions or &quot;equational theories&quot;. A computational model for programs is developed which is decidable, and which contains the familiar notions of equality, connectives and quantifiers, etc. The author introduces his notion of &quot;programming with abstractions&quot;, which he claims allows the functional programming paradigm to be done in a logic programming style.The last chapter is an overview of the (publically available) ALKEMY system for (binary) decision-tree learning, The author gives a detailed description of the decision-tree algorithm used by ALKEMY, which has as input a set of examples, a predicate rewrite system, and a parameter. Examples are composed of a basic term and its class, and the algorithm constructs a decision tree by labeling each leaf node of the tree but its majority class, and then performing error-complexity post-pruning on the tree. The author gives several examples of the use of ALKEMY, such as the East-West challenge game, Bongard pattern recognition, the Musk problem, mutagenesis, and a molecule recognition problem from chemistry."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I have the authors other books and was disappointed in this one, it was hard to finish reading the book."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I had no idea Steve Martin was an author, and a great one at that.

Still in all, it read very easily and I enjoyed it overall."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"It should probably be no surprise that Steve Martin (I wish I knew him well enough to just call him Steve) would come up with such a character as the wildly-imagined-yet-perfectly-plausible \\"hero\\" of this story.

Reading on the Kindle means that I can not pay attention to how much is left in a story, and when this book wrapped up and I looked up from my glowing screen I was sad it was over.I was quite pleased to find out that it is THAT Steve Martin who wrote this, and that in addition to his other talents, he's also a good writer.

I don't know exactly if it's that I think I'm stuck in my head the way Daniel is, but I'm fine with that. Daniel's relationships are nearly the most real I've ever encountered in a book. I quickly got past the mental image of Mr. Martin as I listened - his voice is now both that of Mr. Martin AND of Daniel. It's refreshing to read the first person account of a rather marginalized family member."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Not only is Steve Martin hilariously funny-- he also is a very talented writer and novelist.

At the beginning it seems that his words lack heart, but once you give in to his story his succint style paints vivid pictures. \\"The Pleasure of My Company\\" tells the story of a Daniel Pecan Cambridge's journey from OCD to a modicum of normalcy. And after all, who doesn't have their private rituals or inner quirks? I enjoy Martin's ability to write with humor but not camp."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I wish Steve Martin would spend more time on projects like this and less time walking into walls, falling down, mugging with Queen Latifah. Here is an intelligent and perceptive soul selling himself short because--well, I don't know why.He has money, he has fame. He can chuck projects that are beneath him and give us real art. Instead he gives us a remake of The Pink Panther.But history will ponder over that one. I'm here to ponder over his second novella. (He calls it a novel but it's really a novella; it's as short as his first effort, Shopgirl, if not shorter. The book only feels thicker because of wider spacing and bigger type.) The Pleasure of My Company is about an emotionally-disturbed but insightful and sensitive man who longs for a normal life, and fantasizes about it in his head, while watching the world from his second story window. Demons keep him from even being able to go straight to the Rite Aid up the street to buy his medication. His relationships with women are all in his head--fantasies of considerable complexity and depth, but fantasies all the same. Many of the themes of Shopgirl are here as well--loneliness, journeys to find oneself, the impersonal ness of LA, the longing for female company, underdeveloped souls, emotionally-distant and scarred fathers. This is a Steve Martin you never knew.For the first half of the book there's not much plot. In fact, he could have trimmed twenty pages. And even when the plot takes off, it's not original or unusual. But that's not the point. Readers of Shopgirl know that plot is not why we're here. We're here for surprising, simple, direct insights into people and how they tick. And after a career of pratfalls and silliness, it appears Martin has spent his time observing and examining the world at great length and depth. And, as in Shopgirl, Martin's little observations about life--the literary equivalent of a Vermeer painting--are presented with quietness and humanity and humility. That's what makes this work a cut above superficially similar cloying stories such as the film Forrest Gump, just as Shopgirl was a cut above standard chick-lit such as Sarah Dunn's Big Love and Nicholas Sparks' pure drivel (if I may borrow a term from Mr. Martin). The ending might be a bit predictable, but we observe a lot of interesting inner drama along the way.This is a short book, but not a short *read,* because you'll keep pausing with it on your knee as you reflect. There are some humerous moments, such as the main character's participation in one of those TV \\"crime stopper\\"-type shows, but don't expect laughs on every page: this is not a *comedy.* It's a divine character study. The subordinate characters, from Zandy to Clarissa to Elizabeth, are drawn with fine detail right down to the pantyhose they wear and the perfume they exude. The male characters--what very few of them there are--maybe aren't as sharply rendered, but Martin excels at characterizing and understanding the female heart better than the male. As with Shopgirl, after finishing this all I can say is, Thank you, Steve, and more please."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin, that wild and crazy guy, never fails to amaze his readers with his talent and humor. From melancholy love stories such as Shop Girl, to insanly hilarious bits of nothing, like Pure Drivel, Steve's comic genius is unrivaled.The Pleasure of My Company is as charming as it is funny. Even as readers laugh at the poor, obsessive compulsive hero, they find themselves relating to his thoughts and struggles with life, love and concrete curbs. The Pleasure of My Company is a must read for anyone that has ever had a crush, a broken heart, and an unyielding desire to touch all the corners of every copier at Kinko's."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"After reading 'The Pleasure of My Company,' I am astounded at Steve Martin's writing talent! He does a wonderful job in this narrative/stream of consciousness of Daniel Pecan Cambridge, a neurotic thirty-something who has a rather dull life. You may wonder, why would someone want to read about a person who has just a boring life? Well, from Daniel's voice, things are just hilarious! I wasn't laughing all through the book, but there were definitely some unavoidably funny parts, especially when he unveils his many 'loves' and neuroses.'The Pleasure of My Company' is incredibly creative, and has a wonderful perspective. The observations made by the protagonist, with Martin behind them, are amazing and intricate, which mirror Daniel's own seemingly bland life. He gives good insight to life, to the little things, to relationships, and to many other unsuspecting prey. Analogies are thoughtful, and the writing is gorgeous!This book was rather short, though. It was a great summer read, and it is easy to put it down, and then pick it back up, as much of the book is a series of vignettes that do not immediately come together - almost like a diary. 'The Pleasure of My Company' will probably not go into the annals of great literature (that can be argued, but not by me), but I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a shorter, light (yet thought-provoking) read."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I loved this book by Steve Martin. It was very insightful and I laughed and cried. OCD and family relations, career problems and romance, are all covered in this short and easy read.Get it, you will love it too!!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This book was enjoyable and could be read in many different ways - as the story of a flawed man, a neurotic, or even a love story. By the end I had actually come to the conclusion it was a love story of sorts - how the pursuit of love, the affection for others, and social contact in general, helped Daniel to start to overcome his issues. The story is of Daniel, a man who is troubled by his social maladies and psychological ones as well. He exists in his own world that plays out mainly in his head and every human contact or outing requires significant pre-planning. Some of his neuroticisms are quite funny (ie the Rite Aid outings) and kept the book light. It was an emotional book because at times you will be laughing at Daniel, feel sadness for him, feel sorry for him, and experience happiness too. This was a fine little read with many strong points. I missed having \`chapters' in the book, but something about not having them made this read more like a stream of consciousness by Daniel more than an actual book."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"How many more dimensions of true talent can this man master.

It wasn't until I read Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime that I knew the problem. The main character lacks authenticity. You find empathy for Haddon's autistic character even though he's not asking for it. Steve Martin's attempt to promote empathy in the reader is contrived. It is not bad but if you read Haddon's novel you will see the difference between good and brilliant writing."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Daniel's granny always told him that \\"finally we do become wise, but then it's too late.\\" Daniel has always believed this to be true and has resigned himself. He lives alone, and is ruled by a number of compulsions and obsessions. But he does yearn for love.The story of this gentle soul indeed engaged me. And I enjoyed the prose. His obsessions are portrayed very realistically, and indeed the world is full of people stranded by their own worries and rituals.I was bothered by the story line of his home therapist becoming so enmeshed with him personally. During a home visit, her ex husband had emerged following her baby sitter and son outside. When the ex becomes violent, Daniel comes to the rescue. Her remaining personally embroiled with him is so unethical and so irrational that I couldnt escape that part of the plot.The story of Daniel escaping his own prison is compelling, but carried on the device of the therapist's personal part of his life, I couldnt fully engage."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"The greatest obtacles are those we impose upon ourselves. As for the deepest wounds, they tend to come from those who love us considerably less than by all rights they should. This wonderful little book eloquently expresses both of these points. It belongs to that popular category of fiction which is narrated in first person from the perspective of a character who is emotionally and/or mentally challenged, thus magnifying commonplace exploits to Mount Everest proportions. I'm looking for a shorter term to name this genre so that perhaps I will be given official credit. The Pleasure of My Company falls into this category, yet also rises above it in spite of its brevity. The book is not a single word longer than it needs to be yet manages to elicit an impressive number of smiles and chuckles, then closes with a flourish that tugs at the heart.

As Daniel minces his way through his odd life, I can't but identify with life in his mind that is rehearsed oh so much. His character underlines the saying: Many terrible things have happened to me, but few have actually occurred. His most memorable quote from this novella: Thinking too much...creates the illusion of casual connections between unrelated events. So true for those of us who don't consider themselves crazy.

In spite of all his rules and quircks Daniel falls in love 3 times, wins an essay contest (well actually 2 since his &quot;alter&quot; ego writes the other essay), baby sits for a little boy, learns to walk across a curb and figures out his life through mathematical squares.The book is quite entertaining with Daniel having to follow all the rules in his head. However, it seems like the ending was cut a little short.

Some of Daniel's peculiarities merely make his life difficult, such as his need for the aggregate wattage of lit lightbulbs in his apartment to equal precisely 1125 at all times. But others virtually preclude normal conduct. Most awkward, perhaps, is Daniel's inability to step over curbs: he can only cross a street when two scooped-out driveways lie directly opposite one another. This requirement makes an adventure of Daniel's frequent trips to the local Rite Aid, and it complicates his attempts to woo the real estate agent showing apartments across the street from his own.Steve Martin's chronicle of Daniel's self-imprisonment, narrated by Daniel himself, is a sweet story filled with often gorgeous prose. Martin's writing is both delightfully precise (\\"Let me tell you about my mailbox. It is one of twelve eroded brassy slots at the front entrance of my building.\\") and quietly funny: \\"I never have interfered with a relationship, out of respect for the guy as much as for myself, but Brian is a dope and Philipa is a sylph and I am a man, even if that description of myself is qualified by my failure to be able to cross the street at the curb.\\" The Pleasure of My Company is a quick read--163 pages and chapterless, with an ending that is perhaps too abrupt--and it is well worth a look. You'll leave the book appreciating, quite possibly madly envious of, its Renaissance-man author's highly re-readable prose style.Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"...

These characters could not exist without the social/ geographic/psychological landscape of LA. Steve Martin has always had a love/hate relationship with the city and he plays it out here.In a world where someone like Daniel would never be considered a winner, this little book proves those views wrong. I like that this book is able to have depth without stooping to \\"sappiness\\". It embraces the inherit funniness of doing silly, pathetic things and by doing so Martin gives his characters a depth, a warmth, a humanity that is often lacking in books today where both the narrator/author and the characters they describe are so blissfully ignorant of their own state in the universe that you can have no love or empathy for them. You will not find that kind of hyperbole here. This is territory he covered in Shopgirl, another gem.Some stories imprint themselves upon you and remind you to look at your own life and the lives around you more carefully, to pick up all those little cues to character and dare I say moral fiber that often go unnoticed in a world where louder is seemingly always better; to form a story from these descriptions, step back and realize something profound about relationships.

You're getting your friend's side of things and it doesn't occur to you that your friend is wrong or crazy. Daniel Pecan Cambridge is off. He's delusional. But you're getting his side of the story, so you empathize with him. Because he's sane about his insanity. Because, in spite of his quirks and idiosyncracies that seem really out there, we all have our individual quirks that others think are weird, so we relate to Daniel. So we like Daniel."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"OK, I'm the only guy in the world that will confess that I didn't used to find Steve Martin funny. I thought his &quot;wild and crazy guys&quot; skit was silly and actually walked out of &quot;The Man With Two Brains.&quot; Now, years later, I find him to be a smart writer. I live about 100 miles south of LA but this book gives a great flavor of what it must be like to be an obsessive compulsive in LA. Daniel Pecan Cambridge is the main character; he needs you to know about the wattage in his apartment, about the curbs in his neighborhood, and what makes him average. In all of this I found him to be endearing and was actually rooting for him in his romances. This is one of those rare books that sucks you in and makes you feel like a friend."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I really enjoyed Shopgirl, but fell in love with the Pleasure of My Company. I often hestiate to buy a novel in hard cover (one might call me budget conscious? ) that is this short--however, it worth it. I read the book in just a few hours, but it will stay with me for a long time. Daniel is a wonderful, warm, and slightly sad character. I loved the first person narration. Daniel is obsessive-complusive and Martin nails down his inner life. His hilarious attempts at romance, his nutty essay, his road trips are all spiced with humor and a twinge of realism. Martin's writing is warm and honest. The ending is so wonderful, it might move you to tears (I will say no more so as not to ruin it). I was quite impressed by a modern man who works to solve his own problems instead of blaming others (his attempts at therapy are also humorous). Martin dispels, intentionally or not, so much of our addiction based culture. Daniel learns strength and tries to conquer the world on his own terms--with a quiet heart. A beautiful little story. Martin is fantastic."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"All seems to be going well for Steve Martin these days. His movie career continues apace with the occasional hit and he continues to develop as an author. The Pleasure of My Company is a distinct improvement over his debut story, Shopgirl.Though not noticeably longer, The Pleasure of My Company gets tagged &quot;a novel&quot; whereas Shopgirl was &quot;a novella;&quot; still, I'm willing to forgive since this book has the depth. Martin has made a wise move by focusing on a single character, Daniel, this time around. Martin's main talent lies in characterization and wry commentary and Daniel gives him an opportunity to do both. This streamlines the story and makes it much more interesting.Daniel is a mentally disturbed young man whose ability to leave his apartment is very limited because of his obsessions and phobias--his inability to step off of curbs, for instance, or his obsession with thinking of things in terms of magic squares. Still, he attempts to reach out to the world around him: entering essay contests, joining MENSA, trying to meet the realtor across the street or the pharmacist at the Rite-Aid. Eventually, as his obsessions shift and he gets a little luck, his world begins to open up.Admittedly, I'm a little tired of the mentally disturbed protagonist but Daniel is an engaging character mainly because he is basically a nice guy and he struggles to overcome his problems instead of giving into them. And the observations of the unbalanced often hold more truth than the lives of the &quot;normal.&quot; Though there is nothing mind-bendingly fantastic here, this brief read is a good one."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and I must say, while I was reading it, I kept saying to myself..&quot;I can't believe how talented Mr. Martin is.&quot; I have always been a big fan of his,and I really enjoyed his first book, the Shopgirl. But something about this one grabbed me even more than his first, and I read it without putting it down, I was so involved with Daniel,the main character, and his life.I have to admit, at first I felt a little guilty laughing at the main character's behaviors, but then I decided I wasn't laughing at him, kind of with him. I started thinking about the things I do that are strange, (I won't go into them here, anybody that knows me, feel free to ask, I'll explain), and realised I am just lucky any strange behaviors on my part have not been the kind to interfere with my leading what some people call a &quot;normal&quot;life. Then after I got over my guilt, I allowed myself to laugh at everything I found funny, which was a good thing, I laughed out loud quite a lot.I also had a couple of places with some tears. So what I am trying to say is, read this book and enjoy. I will probably read it again one day, just because I enjoyed it so much, and I am finding that I really miss Daniel."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I have been a huge Steve Martin fan ever since I saw Father of the Bride as a little girl. When I discovered that Mr. Martin was also an author, I raced to the book store and picked up copies of Shopgirl and The Pleasure of My Company. This book in particular (The Pleasure of My Company) absolutely blew me away. It is clever, sensitive, touching...just absolutely brilliant. Steve Martin really showcases his talent in this book by telling the story of a man living with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), using just enough humor to keep the story lighthearted and fun, but enough candor to provide a very insightful look into the lives of people living with OCD. Once I started reading, I simply could not put the book down. When I finished the book, I gave it to my mom and she couldn't stop talking about how much she loved it too!! I definitely recommend this book as an enjoyable read for anyone."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Ok, I'll admit it! I picked up this book because I love Steve Martin's comedy. I think his stand-up is great, I've always enjoyed his movies, and Pure Drivel -- his collection of comedic essays -- is one for the ages.This book is a little different. There are still some extremely humorous passages, usually focused around the main character's neuroses. These comedy bits are right on, and every bit as entertaining as the neuroses of the characters Steve Martin brings to life in his movies.In addition to these bits, there is also a tragic story of an obsessive compulsive man trapped in his apartment by his own fears. This story is infinitely deeper, darker, and even a little scary. Martin does a great job of explaining how these problems developed by an examination of the man's past, but I'm still left wondering about the manner in which the problems were solved. Though &quot;love conquers all&quot; is a charming thought and a great movie plot, I'm not sure it would conquer problems as quickly and cleanly as it does in this book. (Though, who knows, maybe I just haven't met the right person. ;) )Overall, though, a highly entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I L0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0VED this book! The first page engages the reader and keeps a tight hold of them throughout the book with only a slight interruption towards the end as one pauses to think, \\"Darn, I'm almost at the end.\\"The story is poignantly written with an undercurrent of sweet gentleness and compassion that Mr. Martin has mastered as his own unique style. It's also hysterically funny! This is the first book I've read where I found myself laughing obnoxiously out loud in quiet places. I've never \\"read\\" slapstick moments so vividly that I was able to see the hilarious action as if I were watching it on a movie screen. That's talent, real writing talent.Most of the side splitting moments are so hysterical because our hearts go out to the main character, Daniel, who was written succinctly and brilliantly. I felt a kinship with Daniel. As I was laughing at him, I found I was actually laughing at myself and perhaps some of my own OCD behaviors. In between the humor and gentle, soulful moments are layers of thoughtful, intelligent insights presented skillfully as an integral part of the story. Steve Martin is a fabulous writer.THIS BOOK ABSOLUTELY ROCKS! I couldn't give it a more than five stars...because you can't...so here are some more: stars, stars, stars, stars, stars, stars, stars, ad infinitum."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"The Pleasure of My Company is a novel told from the point of view of the protagonist, Daniel Peca Cambridge. Daniel is an obsessive compulsive and a mathematical savant. He is completely benign, and even describes himself that way, albeit deprecatingly.Daniel describes his days and the challenges of life for someone who can't step off curbs or allow the lights in his apartment to be switched such that the total number of watts lit at any time differ.He describes his adventures, which include falling in love three times, winning a contest two times, and learning to love someone enough to overcome some of his obsessions.Altogether, this is a charming narrative with memorable characters. I will add just a few words on the format. I like that the book is thin. Lots of books aren't really any longer than this one, but the publishers/printers make them look longer by putting fewer words on the pages and using thicker paper. This one is not deceptive--it's a quick read, but the boks is as long as it needs to be."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin is one of the most talented, creative and intelligent individuals in Hollywood. Who else can lay claim to being such an exceedingly gifted comedien, actor, playwright and author?!After reading The Pleasure of My Company, what struck me as most impressive was that not only did Steve Martin write a second terrific novel but this novel is nothing like his first! Far too many writers can work in only one style, and while their writing is solid each novel seems to mirror the first.In The Pleasure of My Company, Steve Martin takes his talent in a decidedly different direction from Shopgirl. In fact, I wasn't even sure I was going to like the novel at first; the main character takes a bit of getting used to. His neurotic quirks and his tendency to overthink everything are, at first, fairly annoying. By the end of the novel, however, I was shaking my head in admiration. Steve Martin has constructed a story of sweetness and warmth; Daniel Pecan Cambridge ends up being one of the most likeable protagonists I've encountered.Yes, he has his idiosyncrasies but he also completely lacks pretense. In and around Los Angeles, this makes Daniel a compelling individual of rare integrity -- the opposite of Get Shorty's John Travlota, Swimming with Shark's Kevin Spacey or The Player's Tim Robinson. Hollywood does come to Daniel, in the form of Crime Show, but he remains blissfully uncorrupted. His neighbors enjoy his company because he asks nothing of them.Technically unable to function in society, Daniel is visited weekly by a young therapist. When her own life comes unraveled, its Daniel who provides the support and assistance she needs. Through this reversal of fortune, Daniel finds his focus pulled away from himself. Happily helping Clarissa and her young son, Daniel has less and less time to sustain his neurotic habits. As others begin to depend on him, Daniel's self-confidence grows.You can't help but root for Daniel as the story develops, and he builds a life outside his apartment. When his selflessness is rewarded we all enjoy a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin has written the perfect novel here: Compelling, witty, gentle, and pure joy to read. Anyone tired of crime and violence novels will love Daniel Cambridge, Martin's first person character in PLEASURE. Though his mental stability keeps him confined to out of work status at his California apartment, Daniel finds attractive elements in each of the women he desires. Charming them each in his non-aggressive way, Daniel eventually finds the love of his life through selfless, altruistic acts by merely being his sweet self. Martin seems to know much about women with his honest observations and descriptions of their inner and outer beauty. You almost wish he would pass along his secret to being a gentleman, but he is subtler than that. Quite simply, Daniel is a man you wish you knew in real life.What is delightful about this novel beyond the brilliant prose and soothing descriptions, is knowing that when Steve Martin tires of acting we will be enjoying his novels. I have been a Steve Martin fan for years, reading most of his offbeat books, and listening to all of his comedy albums. I found SHOP GIRL to be a surprisingly fun novel to read. Martin has raised the bar for himself with PLEASURE and I look forward to additional, and longer stories. Steve Martin is truly a talent to be cherished.Read this book. You'll be glad you did.Steve, write more and longer books!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"When I saw Steve Martin had written his first novel (Shop Girl), I picked it up and read it, curious to see if he writes as well as he performs. And, yes he does indeed. What we see in his writing is not just funny wit and humor but genuine heart, understanding and compassion for his characters that become so real you will feel like you know them.In this short novel, The Pleasure of My Company, we are taken into the strange world of a young man essentially trapped into living within the confines of one square block of Santa Monica. In this review I won't talk about the wonderful humor that is used to make this book so much fun since other reviewers have done that already. Instead, I'd like to address some key points that seem to be missed by other reviewers, especially some of the few negative reviews.First, this is a story about a man, Daniel, trapped by not just by some neurosis with a catchy name. He is trapped by phobias so severe that he is unable to cope with something as seemingly simple as walking over a curb. He's trapped by damage done to him by unloving parents. He's trapped because the world has proved to be too hurtful and he has shut down in response. This is a story about how this most injured and disabled man touches the lives of others and essentially saves them. And it also a story about how others, for brief moments in time, enter into the life of Daniel, reach out with sincere love, and gently lead Daniel over the curb he couldn't cross and eventually help to enable him to a huge breakthrough in which he not only copes with life but outright conquers it.Significantly, some of the characters in the book don't even realize the extent of Daniel's disabling phobias and don't even realize that they are leading Daniel out of the tiny little box he lives in. Yet, because they made themselves available to Daniel, great things happened without their even knowing it. And, isn't that true for each us? We touch and influence people in ways we don't know - either for good or for bad. And people likewise influence us in ways we may not recognize at the time, and may thereby affect the direction of our own lives. I don't want to spoil the story or the ending so I won't say more. But wow, some reviewers just didn't get it at all. I don't see how you can read this book without coming away feeling great. Steve Martin, thank you for sharing such humor and truth with us."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Having been a huge fan of Steve Martin since his first appearance on Saturday Night Live, I was bowled over by this book. His keen observations and hilarious descriptions of events and people had me in tears at several points and at others I wanted to weep in sympathy for the hero of the book. I have since read Shopgirl and found it to be nearly as entertaining but in a different way. I hope Steve Martin continues to write and hope he will one day write a full-length novel to prolong the fun!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"First of all, I really enjoyed Shopgirl, but it ended too quickly. I did have the same result with The Pleasure of my Company, but it was still an enjoyable ride.There are some people who do not find this book funny, and I guess that's understandable. Some people would not find someone with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder humorous. But, since some people have a little of it in us (making sure that nothing touches electrical outlets, not stepping on cracks, etc) there is a subtlety of humor that gets to you. It does feel, very obviously, Steve Martin but there are not tons of laugh out loud moments. There are chuckles, and it was fun to read, starting at the beginning, where the main character thinks that Mensa had a clerical error in his IQ score, when leaving the 1 off of the 90. This is obviously someone who thinks a bit much of himself.Daniel Cambridge lives in Santa Monica, right across from the beach. He would probably enjoy going there, if he was able to step off of the 8 inch curbs. Instead, he makes treks to Rite Aid, to pick up his prescriptions and stare at the pharmacist Zandy, while he enters an essay contest of why he is average, sponsored by Tepperton's Frozen Apple Pies. \\"I am average because... I stand on the seashore here in Santa Monica and let the Pacific Ocean touch my toes, and I know I am at the most western edge of our nation, and that I am a descendant of the settlers who came to California as pioneers. And is not every American a pioneer?\\" he writes.He doesn't do MUCH else except get visits from the student therapist Clarissa, staring at Elizabeth the realtor across the street, and slipping Quaalude into drinks for his upstairs neighbor, because, he believes that, when she gets drugged, her relationship with her boyfriend is better. Explain that logic.When I read the paragraph about his walking by Elizabeth the realtor, trying to impress her, I couldn't help but laugh out loud.\\"When I hit the street, I encountered a problem. I had forgotten to wear sunglasses. So, as I walked by her, facing west into the sun, while I may have been an aloof figure, I was an aloof figure who squinted. One half of my face was shut like a salted snail, while the other half was held open in attempt to see. ...Elizabeth looked over (I intentionally scuffled my foot, an impetuous betrayal of my own plan to let her notice me on her own), I was half puckered and probably dangerous-looking.\\"To me, this man seemed a very strange individual, and these are the best people to read about, because there was unpredictability at every turn."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"&quot;The Pleasure of My Company&quot; isn't quirky in the way that David Lynch films are quirky, but it's unusual in that the lead character suffers from some sort of mental problems, including obsessive/compulsiveness. The character, Daniel Pecan Cambridge, is still wholly sympathetic and likable, and &quot;The Pleasure of My Company&quot; tells the tale of how he came to find happiness.Much like many of Martin's movies, the book is warmly human and ends on a touching and sentimental note. On the way, Martin does a good job of taking the reader through Cambridge's neuroses and showing how he manages to climb out of the morass that he's fallen into.As a matter of craft, Martin is skilled in creating sympathetic and layered characters who compel the reader to learn more about them. However, Martin gives in to a tendency to use too many adjectives and awkward vocabulary, apparently only to make his writing more lyrical. This is not a fatal weakness of the book, but it becomes distracting at times.All in all, this is a quick and pleasant read."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I purchased this book after People gave it rave reviews, which is hard to come by in that magazine. I came home from the bookstore, sat down and opened the book, and did not put it down until I was done. Thankfully, the book is only about 160 pages long. I found his writing to be smooth and humorous, and strangely realistic. I do not personally have this disorder, but I have known people who do. When they have tried to describe how they feel it was exactly how he did in the book. I enjoyed all of the characters, even the ones you do not get to know well. I hope this gets made into a movie someday!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Knowing and loving someone with OCD I found this book like looking into a mirror of my life. I think anyone that has had a relationship with a person who's life is challenged by this disorder will find that Steve Martin's story helps in understanding how the mind of your loved one works, and how strangth can be found in the smallest things to fight the biggest battles (like curbs). I thank Mr. Martin for writting this book and giveing others a look at what life is like for many living in a world controlled by obsessive thoughts and the peopel that love them."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"First off, this book is not Shopgirl.That is, for me, it didn't leave the same indelible impression that the comic genius' first novella left me with. It is a remarkably quick read, and contained passages that had me laughing out loud. One particular passage that has stayed with me had to do with seeing someone -- a non-comedian -- actually do a double take in real life. The book left me with an undeniable impression of the pain that a neurotic, obsessive-compulsive guy must feel every day.That being said, I think Mr. Martin took some easy ways out to end the story. I don't want to give anything away; I'll just say that for a story so unconventional in its ability to make entertaining pages and pages of describing someone who has trouble doing anything, I felt neither the tremendous change that would have been necessary to justify the main characters sudden ability to act, nor the subtle build up to said action.This book, nonetheless, made me laugh and laugh hard, and for that, I am grateful."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This book was fantastic. Some have said that the lead character isn't likeable...likeable or not, Martin has created a character that simply magnifies all that lives in each of us. Anyone that feels they occasionally live inside their own head a little too much will fall over laughing while also starting to wonder if they are truly neurotic, not normal, while reading this book. The ending is fantastic...Martin is great with words, incredibly humorous, but also has something to say. I was very surprised with how deeply this little book touched me."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"It's good to see authors embracing literature and taking chances. Martin does not create an overly likable lead character which is a dangerous chance to take, but it works to both humorous and moving advantage. Rikki Lee Travolta did it with his book My Fractured Life to great success. I'm glad to see Martin follow a similar path to an equally enjoyable outcome."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I fell in love with Daniel Pecan Cambridge by the end of the first chapter...and loved him even more by p. 172. Daniel is a character both winsome and quirky. His obsessive-compulsive disorder causes him to shut out a major portion of his surroundings...can't get over those curbs. He is infatuated with several women in his current life. But it his heart of gold that shines through and makes this a wonderful little book. When he wins a contest for &quot;Most Normal Person in the USA&quot; we laugh at the irony. His journey home is touching. Steve Martin just so subtly lets us know why Daniel is the way he is. An author who can make me laugh and shed some tears within a few pages gets a big thumbs up in my book. This is an endearing story, just a little better than &quot;Shopgirl.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I read this whole book outloud to my girlfriend in one seating. The funny parts (which is 3/4 of the book) I had to read with tears running down my cheeks from laughing so hard. Before this I had read Shopgirl, and loved it! But, this one has blown me away, with it's perceptiveness and spontanaity. It's one the best books I've ever read, and the only other one that has made me feel this good is Will Durant's &quot;History of Western Civilization&quot;, and I would say this one is allot easier and enjoyable than the latter. What do these books have in common they are all a glimpse into people and their practices. I think this needs to be made into a movie as well as &quot;Shopgirl.&quot;Who knew Steve Martin had this kind of writing talent? He has the pure prose of Bukowski with that touch of inspiration that I could not ascribe to any other writer but Steve Martin.Read it and loved it!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Martin's career fascinates me because I see him enter a new field at a certain level and then improve on subsequent outings. He's always been good enough from the get-go to earn the indulgence of fans and financers, which of course buys him time. People will take a chance on Steve Martin. Pure Drivel, his collection of short, humorous essays, bettered his first effort, Cruel Shoes (much of which reworked his standup routines). Roxanne, his sharp adaptation of Cyrano, seemed to come from nowhere, if we consider his previous screenplays -- The Jerk, The Man with Two Brains, and Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid. L. A. Story (one of my favorite films) revealed a screenwriting talent of the highest caliber. Likewise, after Shopgirl, a rather self-conscious, too-careful effort, Martin comes up with The Pleasure of My Company.Martin has always used words sparely and elegantly. Here, however, he manages to give the impression of having loosened up a bit, of taking artistic risks with his characters. The characters of Shopgirl were a little too easy and too familiar to readers of New Yorker fiction. One always sensed Martin's controlling hand in their actions, and the best parts of the book seemed to be the by-the-way observations of Southern California culture. In Pleasure, one actually cares what happens to the hero -- a self-absorbed neurotic so inside his own head that he has, essentially, withdrawn to the rooms of his small apartment. Among the many ironies, he enters (twice!) an essay contest on why he is the Most Typical American. As in L. A. Story, Martin's somewhat surreal view of life (in this case, explored through a character suffering from world-class obsessive-compulsive disorder) turns out to be, not really nightmarish, but a sense of wonder toward the ordinary world."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I found this story to be light-hearted and witty.

I grew up watching his movies and when he started writing, I read his books too. I think \\"Pure Drivel\\" is one of the funniest books that I have ever read, and although it is not my favourite book, I think \\"Shopgirl\\" is excellent. This is why it pains me so much to say that \\"The Pleasure of My Company\\" just didn't work for me.\\"The Pleasure of My Company\\" is a first person narrative from the point of view of obsessive compulsive Daniel Cambridge. The first person narrative allows the reader to experience first hand each and every one of Daniel's many neuroses (such as only being able to cross a road where two driveways are parallel to each other), but after about four pages this just got on my nerves. To me, Daniel never felt like a real person, he felt more like a character in a stand-up comedy act (which isn't surprising, given Martin's stand-up background), and as a result, I just couldn't relate to him and couldn't really get in to the book. Martin's writing style is very stilted in this book (I think this is intentional, in order to highlight Daniel's neuroses), which makes matters even worse. By page 16, I found myself skimming through passages in order to get to the end all the more rapidly.Based on Martin's previous efforts, I will probably still read his next novel. Nevertheless, I desperately hope that it is better than this book."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Daniel Cambridge observes life on the block. He rarely actually moves off his block, as that would entail crossing the wide open spaces, perhaps encountering the unfamiliar and the undesirable. If the kerbs don't have a flattened space to cross onto, he isn't doing it. Life gets complicated too when you have a yearning for people who don't live on your block. The local pharmacist Zandy is in both ways accessible and inaccessible as at least he can physically make it to her store. But he reserves a greater love for the local real estate agent, and then there are his in home visits from a psych in training. In training for what isn't certain to Daniel, but he feels he gives good value to the cause.Crippled by anxieties that rigidly control and suppress his life, Daniel is his own captor. Aware of that yet not certain how to change, Daniel lives for the small interactions with others. It was quite something to be briefly questioned when Bob from downstairs was murdered. As if, he was capable of interacting with another to such an uncontrolled degree. Life begins to change in small increments when he wins a contest for the \\"Most Average American\\". It's almost funny when he wins it twice, but how is he going to explain that one away?This is almost a one room story with Daniel and his limitations being the stars. Daniel's various compulsions and concerns are pretty irritating to read about in such fine detail and I'm not entirely convinced that collectively they create enough substance to qualify as an entertaining read. This is a study in minute detail of (presumably) obsessive compulsive disorder, paranoia and anxiety attacks that have bound one man up in a multi-faceted and complicated universe of his own making. Steve Martin always manages to have his character maintain his dignity and sense of self under fire, as overestimated as that fire may be. This novel will get the sympathetic smiles if not the laughs."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Listening to Steve Martin tell the story makes it difficult to imagine the main character as someone other than himself.I kept picturing Steve Martin in these situations, since he was the one speaking. That said, the story is funny, touching and very enjoyable. But you might want to read the book instead."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"In SHOPGIRL, Steve Martin proved he could write a good, engaging novel. In THE PLEASURE OF MY COMPANY, Martin proves he can tell a great story!Daniel Pecan Cambridge wants what everyone wants: love. As the title suggests, Daniel spends a great deal of time alone. He lives out his days almost exclusively in his antiseptic, highly organized Santa Monica apartment. He ventures out only if he can navigate the 8-inch-high curbs he fears and avoid gas station attendants in blue hats. Daniel has obsessive-compulsive disorder.His search for love fills the book. It sends him to the local Rite Aid via a safe route to ogle Zandy, the young blond behind the counter: &quot;The Rite Aid is the axle around which my squeaky world turns, I find myself there two or three days a week seeking out the rare household item such as cheesecloth.&quot; He dilly-dallies, checking out earplugs and &quot;liquid-filled shoe inserts that claim to prevent varicose veins&quot; while watching Zandy from afar. Killing time he even enters a contest: the Tepperton's Apple Pie Most Average American Essay Contest --- not once, but twice. Once as Daniel Pecan Cambridge and the other time as &quot;Lenny Burns.&quot;The love search also sends him across the street to the polished Elizabeth, a real estate agent dealing with condos in his neighborhood. Daniel is obsessed with her, and fabricates meaningful exchanges out of experiences that are as mundane as passing each other on the street. He asks himself how he should talk to her: &quot;Act like myself,&quot; he suggests. And then we peek into the workings of his mind. Rejected by Mensa (a clerical error, he estimates), he ponders the expression &quot;Act like myself.&quot; &quot;Let's say my shopping list consists of two items: soy sauce and talcum powder. Soy sauce and talcum powder could not be more dissimilar. So here's my point. This question I'm flipping around --- what it means to act like myself --- is related to the soy sauce issue. Soy and talc are mutually exclusive. Soy is not talc, and vice versa. I am not someone else, someone else is not me. Yet we're available in the same store. The store of existence. This is how I think, which vividly illustrates Mensa's loss.&quot; And vividly illustrates Martin's talent.Elizabeth and Daniel do eventually speak in Daniel's plot to get to know her, but he inflates the significance of their &quot;relationship&quot; in his mind so much so that when he turns his affections elsewhere, Steve Martin, in a beautifully descriptive and funny passage, compares Clarissa (his new object of affection) to Elizabeth: &quot;She reflected light; Elizabeth sucked it up. Clarissa was a sunburst; Elizabeth a moon pie. So now my preoccupation with Elizabeth became a post-occupation as I turned my Cyclops eye onto Clarissa. Yes, I would always love Elizabeth in some way, and one day we would be able to see each other again but it was too soon right now. Better to let her handle her own pain, with her own friends, in her own way. But Elizabeth was at fault here. She had destroyed whatever was between us by making a profound gaffe: she met me.&quot;And then love sends Daniel to Texas, to the home of his family, and it's there that we discover the genesis of Daniel's disorder and that he is in fact capable of true unconditional love. It is no wonder that he wins the &quot;Most Average American&quot; contest --- not once, but twice. Despite his debilitating disorder he is the average Joe. And Steve Martin has written a tremendously tender and comic story about being that average Joe who counts ceiling tiles, adds up the household light bulb wattages, and harbors a host of other protective defenses and rituals rendered funny with Martin's clever pen.--- Reviewed by Roberta O'Hara"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I can't say I really enjoyed &quot;The Pleasure of My Company&quot;, and much preferred Martin's first work, &quot;Shopgirl&quot;. I'm not sure that many people would read this book, if it weren't for the author's fame in comedy. But it is worth a read, particularly if you know someone that has OCD, which generally escalates as people reach the age where they have to begin their own, independent lives. Martin has a light touch with his humor, although he has difficulty with the resolution of his stories, preferring to paint the characters in depth, and then just fade away. Since he can do that in comedy, but not in novels, he is not as successful here.The hero of Steve Martin's new novel (novella? only 163 pages) suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and has a tad of the autistic savant thrown in for good measure. Daniel's somehow ended up living alone in Santa Monica...&quot;Santa Monica, California, where I live, is a perfect town for invalids, homosexuals, show people, and all other formerly peripheral members of society. Average is not the norm here.&quot;Living alone, Daniel doesn't have a job anymore, although he used to use his skills as a math wizard at Hewlett-Packard, where he was employed as a business communique encoder. He had to leave that job when he weaned himself off his meds and he could no longer allow himself to create a code whose ultimate end was to be decoded. Now Daniel lives on public assistance, with help from periodic cash infusions from his Granny.There are several wonderful treatises on Daniel's trips to the Rite-Aid, which is &quot;splendidly antiseptic&quot;. We suffer through his neuroses every time he steps outside his apartment, in trips which must be planned perfectly, to not upset his equilibrium. Much of his inner voicing is consumed with his attraction to a variety of females who slide in and out of the periphery of his existence.Martin has a writing style that throws out the edge of Daniel's obsessions in a disarming way.&quot;The next morning, I decided to touch every corner of every copying machine at Kinko's...&quot;,and he treats his hero gently, with feeling. Somewhat funny, and somewhat poignant, Daniel's life escalates quickly at the end of the book, in an almost too pat fashion, but then, without the happy ending, it would be pointless to explore Daniel's world and walk away unhappy.Recommended with reservations - don't expect it to be wildly funny. If you have or know someone with OCD, it offers a rare insight through humor."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"The main character is obsessive compulsive and the book recounts his thinking through his neuroses, infatuations and events in his life. He has an uncanny insight into his own insanity (as he refers to it). Many of the character's infatuations were reminiscent of a pubescent teenager's. His analysis of the \\"relationship\\" he was fostering with a real estate agent he never met but had seen was humorous.I did not find the character very likeable. He was not sympathetic in any way and frankly, I got tired of his rantings. Nor did I find the book hilarious as the reviews had promised. Several of the scenes resonated with Steve Martin's comedic voice and I could imagine him playing the part. This was what made Shopgirl so incredible - it was well-written and you could not imagine it was Mr. Martin doing the writing. This book seemed like more of a screenplay than a novel.The ending was pure Hollywood; again making it seem more a screenplay than a novel. After loving Shopgirl, this was a huge letdown. The writing is still good and that is what got it to a three star rating. I can not whole-heartedly recommend this book as I can Shopgirl."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Daniel Pecan Cambridge, the winner of the Tepperton's Pies' Average American Essay Contest and main character of Martin's novel, is really something more than a nebbish...but not much more. An obsessive compulsive who fears nothing more than curbs, Daniel nudges the narrative with his odd hopes and transparently grandiose expectations. He maintains, throughout, a gentle voice that never rises above a whisper. To call this novel \\"whimsical\\" is to finish it with one word, but Martin has an odd style that begs that one word. Nothing in Daniel's mode of expression conveys his malady--that approach seems a step too artistically virtuous for Martin--and, other than Daniel's quirks, he seems flat, in every way average. Things happen in this book--interesting and funny and creative things--but none of them attains the urgency to which a hungry writer might aspire. To offer faint praise, this novel was quite diverting. However, Martin composes like writing is his hobby. Though a reader might smile or feel warm at moments, the overall effect of this novel is so muted it sometimes seems half-hearted."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"We all know Steve Martin as a funny, witty actor and comedian, but I am afraid too few people know what a talented writer he is. Martin has a wonderful writing style, in which he transfers his comedic voice to the written page. This wonderful novella tops \\"Shopgirl\\" (another example of his brilliant writing talent) in its originality and compassion. It's funny and fresh and enchanting, and those are not qualities easily achieved in a novel.\\"The Pleasure of My Company\\" centers on Daniel Cambridge, a man who is afraid to leave his house, except for his angst-ridden outings to the local drugstore, which he does carefully, one hilarious step at a time. Just crossing the street can be a challenge for our hero Cambridge; his life is full of obsessions and neuroses. Despite its humor, this is a tender tale, a portrait of loneliness, and one man's attempt to engage to world around him despite his psychological limitations (by babysitting, by winning an essay contest, and by attempting to get the girl of his dreams). His quest is compelling and sincere, even when you are laughing out loud.The book is so good you will find yourself slowing down to make the story last, and when you finish, you will find yourself wishing for more. I only hope that Martin commits this novella to film in the way he did with \\"Shopgirl.\\" Martin is a wonderful writer, whose talent and insight into the humor and humanity of life are unparalleled. This is a wonderful book, but oh too short. Let's hope Martin continues to write many more."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"The book jacket describes the main character as a \\"modern-day neurotic yearning to break free.\\" At first, I wasn't that jazzed up reading about his various neuroses, but Daniel Pecan Cambridge grew on me. I loved Shopgirl almost instantly but I grew to love Martin's second novel as I read more of it, with my attachment to it coming to a crescendo just as I read the last page. (damn!)While I don't join Daniel in his insistence on a constant total of wattage from indoor lighting, the book got me thinking about the more subtle barriers I put in place to avoid doing the things I want to do but don't -- I know I'll be happy after doing those things, but still I avoid them. All those nights I waste watching television shows that mean nothing rather than have to make a decision about what I want to do with my time. All those mornings I hit the snooze button 10 times rather than wake up and have time to write. All those times I make excuses that I can't exercise rather than just do it and feel good about my body and my health. This book made me wonder: What am I afraid of?"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I'm not a great fan of Steve Martin the comedian, but the back cover of this book was intriguing enough to capture my attention. This is a great story, of love, of being on your own, of having set ways that drives you nuts and that can keep you from living your life to the fullest. I highly recommend this to anyone - it's different, funny and touching."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin isn't just brilliant as an actor but as a writer as well. I finished this book in one night. It was so captivating that I just couldn't put it down. Steve Martin is amazing in his powers of observation and subsequent articulation of the behaviors and habits of humankind. Daniel Pecan Cambridge is sad and yet hysterical at the same time. Either way, you will definitely end up loving him and his story."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an honest and in-depth story about an interesting character. You might expect Mr. Martin to fill these pages with slap stick, in-your-face comedy. Instead you will find a subtle and well crafted humor that transcends the \\"one liner\\" mentality. Several months after reading it my wife and I still bring Daniel Pecan Cambridge into our conversations occasionaly because this is one character who made a long lasting impression on us!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"\\"The Pleasure of My Company\\" is such an amusing book, it is wonder Martin has not written more fiction. I really enjoyed reading Martin's other fiction work \\"Shopgirl.\\" While this book lacked many of the laugh out loud funny parts of \\"Shopgirl\\" it is a more than adequate sequel in the Steve Martin fiction collection.Daniel Pecan Cambridge is a unique character. He has an irrational fear of curbs, he rarely leaves his apartment except to go to places he is most familiar, he must always have 1125 watts of light, and possesses an assortment of other idiosyncrasies that develop as you read the book. His life is thrown out of whack when he begins leaving his apartment more frequently. While leaving his apartment, he develops two failed romances, becomes a temporary foster father, and wins an essay contest. This is an eventful storyline for a man uncomfortable in leaving his apartment which throws his life into a humorous series of conflicts.Martin show skill in his writing in \\"The Pleasure of My Company\\" with diatribes against such popular cultural icons as the energy drink Red Bull. More importantly, Martin creates a charming and likable character in Daniel Pecan Cambridge. It is a great read."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"An amusing, sometimes silly, always moving story about a brilliant but psychologically damaged recluse struggling to regain contact with humanity. Parts of it are \\"laugh out loud\\" funny, and parts stimulate you to think about how difficult it can be to get along in this frequently threatening world. Martin's humor is flowing and intelligently written. Delivers a powerful message for the relatively little time it requires to read through."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin may be known for his acting and comedy, but he should not be discounted for his writing. He translates well from one role to the next. I was a bit hesitant at first, but his success as a screenwriter/playwright convinced me to try his fiction. I was not disappointed. Although the story is short, its characters are so fresh and real that you wish the book had more pages. Martin's portrayal of obsessive-compulsive behavior was so hilarious and dead-on that I wondered if he had been studying me.You can read this book in one sitting, and you will enjoy the story and Martin's intelligent writing.rdnewman.com"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This is an excellent book that I hated to see end! Steve Martin fully captured the humanity of his lead character Daniel and in a poignant, yet at times, witty way. I would highly recomment this book!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin's &quot;Shopgirl&quot; was a thoughtful, deliberate, and surprisingly tender novella. His second, &quot;The Pleasure of My Company&quot;, is lighter and joyfully funnier, with an indefatiguable sweetness that spans the entirety of the novel. If you liked &quot;Shopgirl&quot;, you'll love &quot;PoMC&quot;. If you tried &quot;Shopgirl&quot; but wished for more of Martin's legendary sense of humor, try &quot;PoMC&quot; and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I get the feeling when reading this book that Martin was distracted.

Instead, it reflects the character's ultimate uncertainty if his company, to himself and others, could be deemed \\"pleasureable\\".The book is a fine, albeit uncomfortable travel into the mind of a victim of OCD (or is OCD the victim?). The majority of this book I spent feeling uncomfortable while reading the book, hoping it would lead somewhere. Lead to a resolution somehow for Daniel, the main character. Yet, amidst my discomfort was intrigue, sympathy, empathy and hope. And I was educated about those afflicted with OCD as one may not be by reading dry publications about the illness.It was an unexpected style from Steve Martin, and yet, not so unexpected in the style of writing. I can easily see how this book might translate to film and honestly hope that Martin follows suit here, as he did in making Shopgirl into a film.Daniel, in The Pleasure of My Company, is a hero, a man with heart who is probably as \\"normal\\" as the rest of us. And as an earlier review states, \\"it makes me wonder what I am afraid of?\\""},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I am a big Steve Martin fan, but I was disappointed with his first novella \\"Shopgirl.\\" I'm not saying it was bad, but I personally I didn't enjoy it and didn't laugh a single time. This book on the other hand is a great read. I really liked the absorbing first-person narrative. It's so personal and introspective. I read this whole book in one sitting; it was that enjoyable. And unlike \\"Shopgirl\\" it's actually funny, albeit in a subdued way."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This book, by Steve Martin, actually caught my eye at a library bookstore. For only one dime, this book sat there, in mint condition, like it had never been read. This is the first book I have read by Steve Martin, and it definitely won't be the last.The heart of the book, the main character, Daniel, has a lifestyle that is based on OCD-like behavior. He is afraid of curbs. He creates intricate pathes to places, most often Rite Aid, by using swooped out driveways that are across the street from one another. Though his behavior is peculiar, it's hard not to love the character because he does his best to maintain a somewhat normal life, even though his mental problems restrict him from ever reaching his full capability as a person. I have a family member with OCD, and I have to say that Steve Martin did a brilliant job capturing what it's like to live inside a World where you fear the unusual. Whether it be fear of curbs, light bulb wattage, or fear of closed bedroom doors, Daniel is an intricate character that you want to know more about.I would definitely reccommend this book to others. My only complaint is that it is so short! I read it in two nights, and as a slow reader, that's an unusual accomplishment. It left me wanting more!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I enjoyed this book far better than Shopgirl, mainly because Daniel Pecan Cambridge was a well-developed character and a downright charming narrator. We never know what is \\"wrong\\" with our narrator, but he lives on state support and has a state-funded psychologist visit him. He has irrational fears of curbs and certain public places, and plenty of compulsions, but he's carved out his niche in the world and is well-liked by many. He's inherently likable.The characters in the novel are beautiful. One of my favorites was Phillipa's rough and tumble boyfriend who just could not be ruffled by any of our narrator's neuroses. He was perfectly calm about Daniel riding in the car with his pants slightly off to prevent them from wrinkling.There are some strange developments at the end of the novel (which other readers found implausible and Hollywood-like). I accepted these plot turns entirely in the spirit of this offbeat, quirky novel, and I enjoyed how it all turned out."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin's The Pleasure of My Company is one of the best books I have read in years. The unique character Daniel Pecan Cambridge suffers from a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder, which requires him to have all the light bulbs in his apartment to have a total of 1125 wattage of light. Daniel hates curbs, and is forced to cross streets at driveways and crosswalks only, which makes his journeys outside of his apartment interesting.Daniel's two unique tries for love makes this story hilarious, but still romantic, in Martin's unique voice. He develops Daniel perfectly and we can all relate to him even without having obsessive-compulsive disorder. Daniel is such a loveable character even after seeing his unique quirks and interesting habits. I loved how Martin added humor to Daniel's misfortune so we could all laugh at our own quirks and habits.One quirk that I found fascinating is Daniel's magic squares. We can follow his relationships throughout the story through his relationship magic squares. Even more impressive are the magic squares he completes using numbers, where all the numbers in each row and column add up to the same number. This is an unbelievable talent for Daniel, like his other habits, but Martin does such a great job, I have no problem believing this wacky character.This was the first book I have read by the celebrity Steve Martin, but will not be the last. I was never a huge fan of Martin's work as an actor and performer, but I definitely love him as a writer. He is talented at developing characters and keeping the reader interested throughout the book. I loved this book, and hated when I was near the end. I enjoyed this book as much, if not more, than any other book I have read lately. Martin has definitely gained another fan, among many I'm sure. I have heard Shop Girls is supposed to be as good, so that will be my next purchase at the book store."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Being a huge fan of Martin's first novella, Shopgirl, I was a bit skeptical when reading the first few bits of this novella. It starts a bit more absurd than Shopgirl, and I was starting to prepare myself for a return to the zaniness of his earlier years. What I loved about Shopgirl was that it was a turn from the absurd, and was a beautiful snapshot of ordinary people in not so extraordinary circumstances. In its simplicity it was complex. As I delved deeper into The Pleasure of my Company, I started to find this same sort of simplicity and personal touch. It was a bit reversed, though... it was somewhat extraordinary people in ordinary circumstances. It was a beautiful string of moments of real human interaction that brought out the strengths and the follies of the characters, making each one complex and each one, above all, human.One thing that, for me, made it a somewhat stronger piece, was the fact that even though things kind of tied up nicely in the end, there was a certain uncertainty, and there was a little more dynamicism. Characters seemed to change so much more than in Shopgirl, and perhaps it took characters that went to extremes to begin with, but it worked.I highly recommend this book to any looking for a powerful book in a small package."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Most of the reviewers describe this book very accurately. It really was a pleasure to read. It was humorous and touching. It was so much better than the vast majority of books I read, that I had to give it 5 stars. If you are reading this review trying to decide whether to read it or not, do yourself a favor, don't debate any longer--read it!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"If, like me, you only know Steve Martin through his t.v. and big screen personna, you're cheating yourself. The Pleasure of My Company is like holding the source code for Mr. Martin in your hands. His effortless ability to turn a phrase while turning things on their head is 100 times more poignant in print. Not the laugh out loud kind of schtick we're so used to, but a quiet, intelligent, fun read that will, intentionally or otherwise, make you feel closer to the man you thought you knew."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I had such an unexpectedly strong reaction to this novel. Martin's prose is simple yet eloquent; its beauty sneaks up on you. I fell in love with the main character--his quirks, his fears, his gentle heart. There is a genuine sweetness to this novel, but it never feels forced or overdone. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys unconventional characters and skillful writing."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I wasn't too sure what to expect.

Actually, the guy is getting better and better, which is a surprise because he was pretty great when he started."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin's, 'The Please of My Own Company,&quot; reads like an exquisitely crafted character study that a top-notch actor would create while prepping for a role. Readers are treated with colorfully fleshed out character portrayal, smidges of interesting backstory and a skeleton of a story that manages to keep things just interesting enough without bogging down the light, effervescent flow of Martin's prose. Martin also proves that he's quite adept at culling the inner-voice of his characters as he meticulously brings to life everey bit of minutiae involved in the thought process of an OCD riddled character attempting to overcome obstacle after obstacle (in this case figuring out how to cross the street, the right amount of light bulb wattage to keep lit, etc.). The end of the tale might come across as a bit too Hollywood in its payoff but nonetheless it satisfied and made for a great read on a 2 1/2 hour flight across 4 states."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Most of us are familiar with Steve Martin the comedic actor and not Steve Martin the author. Well, it's about time we all took a closer look at Martin the author because the guy CAN write. Not only is The Pleasure of My Company well-written, but it's also thoughtfully constructed. For people who are expecting this novel to be the literary equivalent to Martin's cinematic slapstick physical comedy will either be pleasantly surprised or sorely disappointed. TPOMC has a Zen-like quality to it, which originates from the character's constant and often witty introspection. This calmness is in direct opposition with the character's numerous disruptive habits stemming from his OCD and the problems that arise from this conflict, along with the character's steady transformation, makes for a delightful and entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This is a wonderfully written book with depth, charm and humor! Kudos to Steve Martin! Thank you!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"&quot;Pleasure of My Company&quot; is a great book that detours from Steve Martin's previous territory but is still very witty. I found it fun and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I bought the Pleasure of My Company on audiotape. Steve Martin narrating the book brought the character, Daniel to life. It was like listening to the &quot;secret neurotic thoughts of Steve Martin.&quot;Steve makes Daniel, a character you want to root and cheer on -- a true underdog. Daniel can be seen as strange and borderline creepy but he brings in such detailed logic of why &quot;he does what he does&quot; that I understand his fears. I myself can not step off curbs or turn on lights without thinking of Daniel.I love the fact that Steve uses common stores like Rite Aid and Kinkos as a central part of Daniel's day. I took away from this book realizing we are all human and to some point, we are all a bit common, but we all have a story and hopefully, a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this book. I've experienced some of Steve Martin's other writings, and found him to be capable of brilliant moments, but not really sustained brilliance. So, reading this book, I was delighted to find that he is more than just an actor with a hobby - he possesses real talent. In fact, if I weren't familiar with his film career, I'd have assumed that I was reading the work of an established fiction writer.That said, I felt as though he did a great job of teasing out some complex issues, and that he didn't quite do his work justice as he raced to end it in the last 20-30 pages. Perhaps he was days away from starting his next Queen Latifa project and quickly had to slap an ending on the thing. In the end, we don't get satisfying closure with many of the characters we've been asked to care about, and there's a tacked-on quality to the final pages. Still, the book rings true, and provides an unforgettable protagonist."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This book tells the story of a few life-changing months in the life of a young man, Daniel Pecan Cambridge. Yes, he is a man with numerous obsessions and compulsions, and his analytical talents are extraordinary, but these are not his defining characteristics, in my opinion. He is a tender-hearted man whose mind often gets in his way, and who thus is (mostly) isolated from mainstream society. Even though his neuroses surpass those of the average person, I found him easy to relate to, and therein lay my enjoyment of the story.I listened to this book on CD, and I think hearing the author himself reading it drew me in even more than I think I might have been drawn in otherwise. It's not hilarious, but it did make me smile and even laugh out loud at some points. I very much appreciated Daniel's humanity -- it's one thing to make a character with a label (\\"look, here is someone who has OCD\\"), quite another to make a character that is truly human, and I think Steve Martin admirably succeeds at the latter, and not just with Daniel but with other characters as well. My only complaint is that I wanted more -- five hours (I believe the hardcover is under 200 pages) just wasn't enough.If you love Steve Martin's stand-up, you might not enjoy this book. However, if you like his movies, you might want to check this out. It's sort of like L.A. Story without all the wackiness (e.g. the sentient freeway sign). And for those who are ambivalent about Steve Martin, or dislike him, don't let that keep you from reading this book, because, famous author aside, The Pleasure of My Company remains a sweet, entertaining novel."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Through the insightful, albeit troubled eyes, of a man tortured with phobias and insecurity, Steve Martin establishes powerful themes: Friendship; the power of youth to inspire; hope; &quot;finding one's own way&quot; despite the perception that the stars are not in alignment; and, most importantly of all, the fantastic way of how the unexpected can positively change one's life. The book is thoughtful, funny, and extremely well-written. I especially like the use of the first-person approach as we get into the mind of the lead character, living his life and understanding how difficult it can be to like oneself, tackle sidewalks and curbs, yet someone know that everything will work out. I won't give away the plot of this book, but I will recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I couldn't get past the first 20 pages or so of this book.

I'd rather read about someone who gets on the court and plays the game of life, not someone who lets life pass them by."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin seems to have really hit the nail on the head concerning the struggles of dealing with obsessive-compulsive disorders and neuroses in this book. Given, some of the compulsions might seem a bit unrealistic, but most compulsions in truth are just that. Being able to watch a person fight everyday life in a struggle to just be is illustrated incredibly well in this book, and with a perfect blend of humor and compassion. The book might seem a bit dry at first, but it truly needs to be in order for the reader to understand the stresses that an often illogical and irrational world can place on a person who fears the illogical and irrational. As an obsessive-compulsive myself, I would like to offer my most heartfelt congratulations and thanks to the author for his just-delicate-enough handling of such a sensitive subject matter. This book truly proves that Steve Martin is too brilliant of a man to be restricted to one form of media. If I could give this more than five stars, I would."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin is perhaps my all-time favorite comedian, and he has been for quite some time. He stole that personal rank after I watched his best film, &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles,&quot; a film that also solidified my love for John Candy, and the first comedy of the 80s starring two comedians (not exactly known for great films) that proved to me that sometimes you shouldn't judge a film by its cover.What makes me prefer Steve Martin to someone like Jim Carrey or Chris Farley (who I despise), is that he actually relies on pure humor and old-fashioned comedic talent. But he ALSO does slapstick physical humor very well -- watch him run in &quot;Planes...&quot; and you'll laugh yourself silly!Yes, Martin is also very smart in real life, quite shy and an adamant collector of rare arts. There's a lot of quality and beauty lurking within his soul, and it is all unleashed in &quot;The Pleasure of My Company,&quot; which isn't as laugh-out-loud hilarious as it is touching and uplifting.Daniel Pecan Cambridge is 29, 31, 33, or 35, depending on how he feels on a given day. (His real age is revealed at the closing of the book.)Daniel has obsessive-compulsive disorder, and this novel -- told through a first person narrative -- is essentially Daniel's journal and memoirs, beautifully written by Steve Martin in a simple, elegant, fast, and amazingly smart fashion. (I also noticed that the paragraphs had a space in between them, something not usually done in novels.)Because I missed out on Martin's first novella, &quot;Shopgirl,&quot; I saw &quot;The Pleasure of My Company&quot; at my local commissary and was eager to read it soon. The book is only 162 pages long (not counting the acknowledgements and so on), and so I read it in about a day -- but it's a very good book.Not quite as rude or laugh-out-loud as one might expect, this is truly a beautiful book that Martin has written. And although he nails obsessive-compulsive disorder perfectly, with the character coming off a bit like Nic Cage's in &quot;Matchstick Men,&quot; he doesn't poke fun -- it's the story of a restrained, lonely man who learns to open up to the world.Beautiful."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Whatever one's opinion may be of Steve Martin as actor/director/screenwriter/painter/etc, his reputation as a fabulous novelist is fast growing and appears to be well-deserved. Martin's latest book, The Pleasure of My Company, revolves completely around Daniel Pecan Cambridge, a \\"benign\\" obsessive-compulsive personality who is endearing and funny and very, very real. Martin's ability to relate specific personal details and the fine-tuning of Daniel's inner monologue make the character strikingly authentic. And while there is a lot of laugh-out-loud funny stuff (like the fact that Daniel thinks a jogging suit consists of khakis and loafers, or the scene following this athletic foray that involves some wayward Mineral Ice) Martin does not miss his chance to create a character searching for a fulfilling life. While Daniel's past history is not too detailed and a small segment hinting at a past hardship with his father is vague and a little distracting, overall the reader understands Daniel's self-imposed failings and cheers at the smallest of his accomplishments. An exquisite character study and a truly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This novella centers around Daniel Pecan Cambridge, a neurotically average man residing in Santa Monica. This man, so average in fact that he wins the most average american twice, both receedes from and engages the outside world. Steve Martin's character is so real and so endearing that I felt intertwined in the bustling, mundane and exciting world of Daniel. Steve Martin's understanding of human thought, stream of consciousness and human neuroticism is so strikingly absolute that I sink completely into his work. Not only did this work cause me to go into uncontrolled fits of laughter, it quieted my soul and warmed my heart. I, being a writer myself, only hope that I can write something that connects with others the way that this work connected with me. I think that behind the painted facade there is a bit of the canvas where the character Daniel resides within me and within us all. This work is one of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring yarns to be spun in quite a while. Awesome...Awesome book!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"\\"Pleasure\\" was not only a fun read, but a satisfying one as well. Tightly written, he doesn't lose his way at any point in the story.As a streak of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder runs through my family's history (though nowhere near as severe as the protagonist's) I can say that Steve Martin described the inner world of those with the disorder clearly; in particular that they aren't dumb or mentally divorced from reality, even if they do act oddly at times. But this isn't a dissection of OCD--it's a funny, interesting and humane story about a life on its edge & a chance at self-redemption. I read it straight through on a Saturday night & slept through Sunday!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Contrary to what others have commented, I found this book very warm and enjoyable. I laughed out loud and found myself grinning as I read this book. The way Daniel thinks, acts and talks makes his character enthralling. I'm not saying Steve Martin is today's best writer by any means, but his style is unique and a pleasure to read.Its nice to see that you can pick up a novel with an original story, character and setting and break away from the Grisham/King/Brown/Koontz universe we live in. Readers need something new, something different, and those authors stopped doing that long ago. Steve Martin's book is the cure to conquering your mainstream fiction addiction.While some criticize the ending, I enjoyed it. Daniel deserved what he received and his journey throughout made for a funny, sobering and enjoyable experience.Martin, as a writer, suprised me greatly. He has a great writing career ahead of him and I cannot wait for his next book to come out."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Reading a Steve Martin book, I expected something hilarious and shallow, but I enjoyed every part of this book thoroughly. A simple narration yet with great depth and insight. It is so hard to portray the suffering of someone's mental illness and be true and show how sad it is, and I applaud Martin for such a great job. You explore someone else's life through their eyes and mind, feel their pain- although sometimes they can't realize that- their sadness and how life seems so complicated and troublesome, nothing is so easy even crossing the street is a dilemma. You live with Daniel day in and day out till he reaches a point when he realizes that he has to change and that was the personal growth of that 33 year old boy genious.A great read!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Daniel Pecan lives in an average apartment building in Santa Monica, California, where out of the ordinary is completely normal. From his fear of the six inch curbs outside his home, to his complete inability to approach women, to his obsession with on sale ear plugs at the rite aid down the street, Daniel is perfectly fit for the setting in which he lives and the novel takes place. He not only has huge insecurities and problems with low confidence about himself, but problems with exaggeration and lying to the public to make himself someone he's not. &quot;The challenge was not how to present myself as average, but how to make myself likeable without lying.&quot; (Martin, 9). As new characters are introduced throughout the story, Daniel continues to face the challenge of complete honesty with people, and with himself.The novel &quot;The Pleasure of my Company&quot; written by Steve Martin consists of a great deal of humor and sarcasm, and honestly but comically confronts the ideas of people's everyday insecurities about themselves as people live their lives from day to day. &quot;Just at the moment Elizabeth looked over, I was half puckered (from the sun) and probably dangerous looking.&quot; (Martin, 16). The main character Daniel Pecan, thirty-three of Santa Monica, California has trouble not only making any kind of contact with women, but simply walking by one without feeling the need to deeply analyze it after. His humor and insecurities about and with women are what make the story what is it because without the comedy, the plot would not move well along throughout the book.I Strongly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good laugh, excessive sarcasm, and an extremely twisted story line that will keep you wondering throughout the book. Steve Martin's way of developing the character Daniel is hilarious and makes it nearly impossible to put the book down once you begin reading. More than usual, the main character in this story is difficult to figure out, but easy to get to know at the same time, which keeps it constantly interesting and comical. Overall, the story is well worth reading due to the clever and sarcastic humor, and interesting setting and plo"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin's second novel is a novel of paradoxes. The main character, Daniel Pecan Cambridge, is the embodiment of these paradoxes: he is lonely, but has much love to give; he is logical to an insane degree; he is a social outcast in many senses of the phrase, but fancies himself a catch for any woman.The novel is extremely well-written and does a fantastic job of immersing the reader in the story and connecting him or her to the characters. It is easy to believe and identify with every character, and Martin definitely creates some memorable ones, especially Brian, Philipa, and, of course, Daniel himself. The humor is subtle, quirky, and endearing without undermining the novel's tone and emotion. It is admirable that Martin does not fall into the trap of creating a stereotypical character with mental illness. He instead portrays the everyday through anxiety- and compulsion-tinted glasses.I felt that _Pleasure of My Company_ is more evolved compared to _Shopgirl_. The characters are more fully realized, as is the storyline. _Shopgirl_ is also a unique and beautiful novel, however, and should definitely not be missed. Fans of Martin's humor and films may not find the actor/comedian's most prevalent personality obvious in these novels, but instead may gain a new understanding of another, more private facet of his personality."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin's brilliance never ceases to amaze me. His dry, biting, and intricate style is always dead-on. What makes Martin such a great writer is that he is such a keen observer of human nature and most importantly, of human flaws. His latest book takes this idea to a new level.Daniel Pecan Cambridge is certainly flawed. Through humor, we see what it's like to be virtually crippled by OCD and paranoia. Although the ending is a wee bit simplistic, I believe it is probably necessary for the novella form to really work. Martin captures so wonderfully the loneliness of Southern California life, and getting inside the mind of Daniel is a treat. I'm glad that Martin uses this first-person style of narration.Steve Martin is creative, interesting, and downright hilarious as a comedian. As a writer, he proves with this second novella that he is all of these things and more."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This is a fun and witty novella from the perspective of a man living with OCD. I enjoyed the story and laughed out loud several times. I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed with the ending, but maybe only because I didn't think this was a love story and wasn't expecting it? In the end, its a worthy read."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Anyone who has been paying attention for the past couple of decades knows that Steve Martin is considerably more than a wild and crazy guy with an arrow through his head. Among other things, he's a very talented author of fiction, though he prefers novella-length to the epic. He's also rather less interested in action plots than he is in the investigation of unusual characters (not unlike himself, one presumes). The narrator of this little gem is Daniel Pecan Cambridge, who may be twenty-seven or thirty-eight, or any age in-between, depending on how he's feeling that day. He's not a dummy -- in fact he's smart enough to have applied to Mensa, though he's not sure they scored his test correctly -- but he does have a variety of behavioral limitations he has to deal with, all of which he's well aware of. In fact, he sees them as voluntary decisions on his part. (He could do something different. He just doesn't want to.) For instance, the light bulbs in his apartment have to total 1125 watts, when lit. (And those thirty-watters are hard to find.) He can't cross the street except by going down a driveway and up a matching one on the other side. Stepping off an eight-inch curb is not an option. (\\"Who designs these things, Daffy Duck?\\") There's a little of the Rain Man in him, too; he can tell you instantly what day of the week any date in history fell on, and he creates large complex magic squares in his head, which helps calm him when he feels panic approaching (as when some motorist callously blocks a driveway, trapping him on his own block). He lives, of course, in Santa Monica, the perfect town for people like him. (\\"Average is not the norm here.\\")Daniel manages to function, though, more or less. He's even on friendly terms with several young women (some of whom actually know he exists). There's Philippa, upstairs, with Brian the Brainless Boyfriend, and there's Elizabeth, the real estate agent, whom he watches as she tends her \\"For Rent\\" signs, and there's Zandy, the California Girl behind the pharmacy counter at the Rite-Aid. And there's Granny on her pecan plantation back in Texas (hence his middle name), who is the only one in his family who actually understands and accepts him, and who sends him money on occasion. And, of course, there's Clarissa, the student shrink, who pays him twice-weekly visits, courtesy of the State of California, and whom he analyzes more closely than she appears capable of analyzing him. But then certain disruptive influences enter his life, and he finds himself behaving outside his usual rigid formulae. And before he knows it, everything is changing.Having read a number of the author's works now, and seen several of the films for which he wrote the screenplays, I suspect I could read his next book without seeing the author's name on the cover and immediately identify it as his. A lovely way to spend an afternoon."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I recall well my first encounter with Steve Martin the comedian on what was likely the Tonight Show hosted by Johnny Carson decades ago. His stand up comedy routine included delivering a monologue with a staged arrow sticking out of his head; the quintessential 'wacky and crazy guy'.While a seasoned club performer - he writes about these live performances in his autobiography \\"Born Standing Up\\" - his genius transcends this singular art form. Steve is, as is the case with many performers and writers, a keen observer of human behavior. His unique talent enables him to express these observations through performance (comedy) and via the written word.His novel 'Shopgirl' caught my attention when it was mentioned during an 'Imus in the Morning' broadcast. The book was adapted to a screen play. Both book and movie defined Steve's ability to take a more serious look at life's foibles. His book 'The Pleasure of My Company' takes this a step farther. Using a first person narrative the author provides a humorous and telling account of a main character who displays all the behavioral characteristics of an adult Asperger's patient. A life in the familiar setting of Santa Monica (with a road trip to TX) provides the backdrop to bouts of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), a facility for creating magic squares and figuring out the day of the week on a calendar years in the past and future. The later phrases a funny account of figuring out paid interest relating to an investment bond's maturity.I enjoy books with an ending that brings a story line to a satisfying conclusion. Complete with a happy ending, I genuinely enjoyed \\"The Pleasure of My Company'."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I love Steve Martin. Whether it's his stand-up, his movies, his books, his banjo playing, or his good taste in art...the man is accomplished on so many levels. Whether writing comedy routines, movies, music or novels, Steve Martin always composes pieces filled with intense imagination, deft wit, and his signature wry sense of humor.I read The Pleasure of My Company in the span of 3 hours. Once I started, I couldn't stop. You fall in love with the character(s) and the world in which Daniel Pecan Cambridge insularly lives.There were aspects of this book which reminded me of The Jerk, which Steve Martin helped co-write back in 1979. And while Daniel is far superior to Navin intellectually, there is a certain je ne said quoi which the two main characters share.If you're looking for a beachside read, a novel for a flight, a good bedtime story, or a book to just make you smile...The Pleasure of My Company is an all-around winner."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"The Pleasure of My Company is a first-person narrative whose central character, Daniel Pecan Cambridge, is a little ... idiosyncratic? Odd? Neurotic? Abnormal? All of the above? You be the judge: He can only cross streets at driveways symmetrically opposed to one another, the total output of light in his apartment must always equal 1,125 watts, and in attempts to find love, usually comes across more stalker-like than Casanova.Throughout the short novel, Daniel fantasizes about wooing three different women -- and makes embarrassing attempts to actually do so; deals with passing the of time now that he's unemployed (acting as an extra in a crime show, for example); and is caught in a bizarre lie after entering the \\"Most Average American\\" essay contest, in which he submits one essay from himself, and another from a fictional person.The story begins a little slowly and tediously, being almost too sharply written for its own good (in fact, I nearly put this back on the shelf after the first few chapters). Steve Martin clearly has a firm grasp of language and writing, and his cleverness for storytelling is quite evident. But once beyond the opening pages, a tender, heartfelt story takes shape, that is both humorous and touching, and well-worth finishing.Whether you're a fan of Steve Martin's vast comedic work on screen and stage or not, I definitely recommend The Pleasure of My Company, as it will make you a fan of his writing."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Let's just keep this short and sweet. I love Steven Martin, that said I did go into this with a bit of a bias I already wanted to like it and as soon as I saw the cover art I was hooked. The synopsis alone had me in stitches. I also slightly identify with the protagonist and his many neuroses, though some are absolutely ridiculous. As long as you're the type who sees humor in everyday life and can get past asking why/how someone becomes this way and just enjoy the story that unfolds about how this man learns to allow people into his life and actually starts to like it.

I was not expecting much, but I am now very happy that I read this book. It turned out to be very, very enjoyable. I was engaged in the story the entire time I was reading it. The book is quite humorous and laugh out loud funny in several parts. As the story gets going, it also begins to have a heart (but not in a sappy way). I was thoroughly satisfied and happy after finishing this book - although also sad because I didn't want it to end.

Having read Martin's other books, Shopgirl and An Object of Beauty (both which I really loved, by the way) I decided to read this little novella. I'm so glad I did, because Daniel Pecan Cambridge, the main character, is the type of character that stays with you. He is highly flawed and has many OCD-like tendencies- the sort of person that society normally casts aside and labels as \\"freak\\". But Martin really gets into Daniel's head- and ultimately ours as he leads Daniel down a path where he fights to lead a life that is not dictated by quirky fears. There were many moments in this book where I literally laughed out loud- it is so humorous and heart warming and at the end I found myself welling with emotion- the proverbial lump in my throat that only occurs with the most prosaic of prose. 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"The Speed of Dark, by Elizabeth Moon, is about an autistic man with \\"savant syndrome.\\" It really gave me an \\"insider's view\\" of what it would be like to... see the world through a different lens.The Pleasure of My Company, by actor/writer/comedian/playwright Steve Martin, is another story about a man with an alternative view to observing the world.Daniel Pecan Cambridge lives in Santa Monica, California. His neuroses have restricted his travel (even in his local neighborhood), his interactions with other people, and his employment. He really has no friends, but that's okay; the self-imposed rules that he must follow daily for just living are all-consuming.There are some people, however, that pique his interest: the therapist intern who visits weekly; a local realtor; a pharmacy technician; and an unemployed actress and her boyfriend. Daniel is supported by monthly disability checks and needed supplements provided by his grandmother. Granny's death initiates a series of events that will change Daniel's life forever.This really is a touching story, and most readers will pity poor Daniel, who tries so hard to make his life work. There is a subplot in the beginning regarding a murder in his apartment building; the murder investigation, and Daniel's reaction to it, really doesn't seem that relevant to the story. I assume Martin includes it to make the reader aware of how oblivious Daniel is to... society's organizational rules? I'm not sure here. It really injects a bit of expected \\"Steve Martinesque\\" humor into the writing. But don't expect this story to be a comedy. It isn't.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"The Pleasure of My Company is a funny novella by famed comedian Steve Martin. Who can forget the arrow in the head and the King Tut song. Now in his 60's, Martin is pursuing other outlets with novels and plays. This is the first of his novels that I have read and I plan to take on the others. I highly recommend the audio version, where Martin reads with great precision, and without the un-neccesary drama and voices for the supporting characters.Our protanganist Daniel Pecan Cambridge has many phobias and compulsions. He lives alone in a forlorn Santa Monica apartment, trapped by his fear of curbs, unbalanced lighting, and anything not ironed. He is simultaneously pursuing several women, including his social worker, his pharmacist, an aspiring actress/neighbor, and a realtor. None of this is going anywhere, loneliness and despair are becoming more prominent.Then Cambridge has several life-enhancing experiences. He writes two of the best essays in a contest sponsored by a frozen pie company, he inadvertently becomes part of the life of a one year old boy, and he has several casual encounters with the realtor and the pharmacist. A trip home to Texas starts things changing and ultimately Cambridge sheds and transfers his obsessions.This is a good read, funny yet meaningful. I recommend it for a day at the beach."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I stumbled upon this book while browsing Barnes & Nobles.

I think that this novel is brilliant and I am deeply sadden that I do not have it anymore to come back to now that I have finished. I am now just waiting patiently for the next novel by Steve Martin, which I hope comes along soon because I think he is a genious and has now become one of favorite authors.Anyone out there who thinks that their life has an abundance of chaos should seriously take the time to read this book and take a relief from the chaos.

His insight into the female psyche must have been what most struck me about his first fiction at-pen, because the only thing that truly resonated with me in The Pleasure of My Company was the ability of a man to compulsively lie. Men do not seem to need an OCD diagnosis for this. Ahem.The book is a good read, of course; yes, humorous; yes, morose; yes, both at the very same time. They say when you read you are engaging in conversation with the author (except you are only listening) and Steve Martin is absolutely engaging whether penned as a chronic depressive young lady, or an OCD stricken man.Martin's stories are never lame, and the end of each book leaves me wanting more - not necessarily more of the character and his or her story, but definitely more of Martin and his incredible ability to poignantly express to us a genuine human- faulted, foiled, fallen; the observation of the world through their eyes, brutally honest in its misconceptions.If you enjoyed Shopgirl, you MUST have this book.

To me, The Pleasure of My Company is Martin near his finest, while Shopgirl is Martin near his worst (see my review there). I think in this book Martin lets us know his characters through their actions (or, in Daniel's case, his inaction), rather than long, blatant descriptions of motivations (Shopgirl -- yuk). I found the book paced well for its subject, and the connection of other characters to Daniel necessary as well as unique.The only criticism I have for it is that Martin now seems to rush the ending of his books, but, given the routine bizarre happenings in Daniel's life, here it was at least made believable, and I think cleverly so.Overall, Martin has delivered on a book that I found to be poignant, with touches of his wonderful sense of humor.

Little did I realize the growth potential of his talent, exemplified best by his emergence as a writer. The Pleasure of My Company is a first rate example of this. The Amazon.com review descibes it best, \\"..this elegant little fiction that verges on the profound and poetic.\\"Daniel is \\"Mr. Everyman\\" in so many ways, full of human foibles, brimming over with self-doubts, hangups, wonderment over his role on the planet Earth. As weird as Daniel seems in an overall context, there are so many parts of him with which one can identify. At times we all share the pessimism--that total ring of pessimism, like the resident who depresses property prices wherever he goes. We all find the American Dream--like homeownership, a cuddly feeling of security--violated at various times, in and out, throughout our lives. We all go through periods in life when we are looking under the door mat and seat cushions to find where we might have inadvertently dropped our car keys. Heap all of these intermittant idiosyncrasies together, and we are all Daniel, Jr. It's not only the light touch, but the human touch that make for so much joy in reading this book."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This book consists reminds me of a small bowl of lemon sorbet -- it is an imminently cool, surprisingly sweet bit of pleasure in a small but powerful package.Using the loneliness and isolation that was the hallmark of _Shopgirl_ as his starting point, Steve Martin once again explores the awkward pain of reaching out to the world outside our own private prison cells. But this book is even funnier, more poignant, more touching, and (if possible) smarter than Martin's prior work. If you don't see something of yourself in the main character, you're not being honest with yourself.Now that this book is in paperback, perhaps it will reach a broader audience. This is a work which truly deserves it."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"My husband and I both read this book and we have very dissimilar tastes. We both loved it. Both my husband and I read it in 1 1/2 days. It would be great to read on a plane ride."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I have read and watched most of Steve Martin's stuff and my favorite two books to date are: &quot;Shopgirl&quot; - the best - how he can write with a woman's perspective is awesome, and &quot;The Pleasure of My Company&quot; - the way he uses words to describe! I want to find out what Daniel Cambirdge is up to now - or probably the better way to say it: what he is thinking now! When I read these two books, I felt like I got a little piece of Steve Martin and it gives me the chills."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I like Steve Martin. I like his movies, particularly ones such as LA Story and Bowfinger which give you a view on how he views the world.&quot;Pleasure&quot; is like this but on a much different scope. We sometimes view celebrities as having it all together but reading this book gives you a view of the insecurities and depth of Steve Martin's mind.But in the end I must be entertained. I found the first part of the book slow and slightly confusing. But after the set-up, the character development is excellent as you search for the subjects that you most identify with. And, of course, Martin's dry-witted humor is sprinkled throughout and quite entertaining. By the end of the book you are emotionally attached to the characters and enjoy the contrived, happy ending. While I was not bowled over by the book, I did enjoy it. It is a very short read."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Daniel slowly lets you into his quirky world until you start to realize that his is the purest heart in the book. Perfectly written and unpredictable."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"He can really write. This is a page-turner and gets you into the mind of a guy with OCD that he manages with a sense of humor and hope. A triumph"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This is a great read. We would expect no less from Steve Martin. I laughed till I cried and then I read it again."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This is a light hearted look at the quirks we all have and the way to overcome them. A vacation from the stress of everyday life."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Martin's main character Daniel is a wonderful lovable neurotic nutjob. This book is a little short but just keeps getting better as you read it. I particularly liked the ending."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This book is an easy read about funny/sad things that happen to a young man who has isolated himself from the rest of the world. I love this book because it shows how obsessive-compulsive behavior works. If you've got some OCD going on, it's a much easier book to read than the heavy self-help books, because Martin is so funny. It's helpful to be able to laugh while you're reminded of how you've distracted yourself from fundamental psychological problems by the rituals you've created. Many of us don't do the \\"typical\\" OCD stuff like wash incessantly or fear germs, and so people have no idea that other rituals are locking up our brains. If you don't have OCD, you might come away with a better understanding of how it works."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I've read Shopgirl and Object of Affection, but I think Pleasure is my favorite. It's an insightful and witty man-versus-self story of an unbalanced, yet self-aware Daniel. Perhaps most striking is the unique voice that the story is told through. It's difficult to describe, but really I think it's some of the best literary fiction I've ever read.I won't spoil the ending, but Martin concludes with a satisfying ending and slightly unexpected. My only complaint is that Martin doesn't write enough books."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"It's not particularly heroic (except perhaps on a small scale), but I adore this story about innocence. Get the audio edition if you can---Martin's reading of his own story is extremely moving, as you can tell he is deeply invested in the characters he has created. But just reading the regular book yourself is great, too. Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"It is difficult to write an adequate review for this work. One might say this story demonstrates the renaisance nature of the author. A comedian early on who even then hinted of his many talents. An accomplished muscian...actor...and truly an acclaimed author.A story of existence and compassion that transcends into love in it's truest form."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This is a fun book about a not so fun disorder. Steve Martin's eloquent style of writing puts you right there in the a story that is both informative and humorous. Thumbs up! Everyone should read The Pleasure of My Company."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This book was great, couldn't pu uit down. Eccentric characters, interesting things going on with character development, and oh yeah... it's funny. Steve Martin is a fantastic writer and I enjoy all he has done. \\"Pure Drivel\\", \\"Cruel Shoes\\". \\"Shop Girl\\" and \\"The Pleasure of My Company\\" are all top notch. The novellas have something different of course than his purely comedic books, there is heart and humor, and human elements that combine for entertaining art and great story telling."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I have read Shop girl and I like Steve Martin as a writer. The book is a short fast read. I love his character development and who doesn't like a happy ending. Hope I didn't ruin it.

Its short, made me laugh out loud several times, and he uses unbelievably creative language."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I loved his previous book ShopGirl, and loved this one even more. The quirky characters come alive. It is just such a marvelous book. Who knew Steve Martin has the heart of a compassionate loving soul!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Daniel Cambridge is not wild, but he may be a little crazy. After all, when he leaves his Santa Monica apartment he must avoid curbs, crossing only where two scooped-out driveways face each other. That is only one of the obsessions and compulsions holding Daniel captive, and the twice-weekly visits of therapist-in-training Clarissa don't seem to be making much of a difference.In other hands, Daniel's character could be pathetic. However, Steve Martin makes him more eccentric than truly crazy, and the coping mechanisms Daniel has developed to live within the constraints of his neuroses are actually sort of endearing. It was a joy to watch Daniel take his tentative steps toward engaging with the world, and I found myself rooting for him all along the way.Even in the earliest days of his stand-up career (I've been a fan since 1970) Steve Martin's intelligence was obvious. His use of language makes his writing both funny and smart. In some ways, this novel reminded me of &quot;Roxanne,&quot; and the qualities that made that film so enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin has an incredible way with words. Even with his works that I don't particularly enjoy, his use of language shines through, along with his keen sense of observation.I almost didn't finish reading this book because I found the first 20-30 pages fragmented, and perhaps a little condescending toward its protagonist. I persevered, though, and was rewarded with a satisfying story.Heck, just reading about Daniel's trips to Rite Aid is worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I read this on audio and found it thoroughly charming. The main character is so odd and quirky and his little obsessions and thoughts about the women around him had me smiling all the way home (and that's a rarity as my drive is a nightmare!).Daniel, the narrator, has these odd little neurosis. He can't walk off a curb like most people (at least without a whole lot of anxiety), he has his house set up so that the bulb wattage equals a certain number at all times (this causes a major glitch when he attempts to have a little liaison with a lady who wants the lights dimmed) and he suffers a few other oddities that make his life quite difficult but also quite funny to those reading his tale. When he makes an attempt at running and soon after suffers the consequences it's hard not to laugh at his folly.This book was so very sweet and a pure pleasure to read. I'll have to look up more of Steve Martin's fiction"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I was really rooting for this guy who struggled with maneuvering his way through life, relationships, and everything else. Steve Martin has a great sense of humor, and he captured a lot of the hilarity that goes along with mental issues. If you can't laugh, you'll cry. This book is not terribly memorable in the long run, but it was very enjoyable. A nice, light read for a rainy day."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This book was so thoroughly enjoyable and uplifting that it made me hug myself. Martin's tale of Daniel Pecan Cambridge is one that we can all relate too. Although, we might not all have obsessive compulsive disorder, we do all have daily struggles that prevent us from reaching happiness. Cambridge's ability to overcome his struggles and achieve at least some form of happiness was so uplifting. Martin's wit is also evident throughout the novel, and entertains us with Cambridge's disorders. The funny thing is that Cambridge would probably laugh at his disorders along with us. He knows they are absurd, but is helpless to stop them. Excellent book and wonderfully funny and entertaining to read."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"In 2001, Wired Magazine published an article entitled, &quot;The Geek Syndrome&quot; about a surge in the number of Silicon Valley kids diagnosed with autism in the late 1990s. Steve Martin's &quot;The Pleasure of My Company&quot; is a wonderful little book where the main character suffers from a another kind of brain disease along the same disorder spectrum called Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The book is much more than that though. It is also about the meaning of friendship and family; how a true friend is a friend regardless of the accompanying troubles associated with the relationship and how family can exhibit examples of both extraordinary kindness and heart-stopping hatefulness. Although the topic is serious, Martin injects enough humor and happiness into the story to make it a light-hearted read and along the way, you learn a lot about what an OCD sufferer must go through.OCD is easy to define but it manifests in an infinite number of ways. An obsession is a thought, idea, impulse, or image thatseems intrusive or senseless to the patient. A compulsion is a repetitive behavior designed to reduce or stop the obsessionor the anxiety caused by the obsession. People with OCD are aware of the bizarre nature of their Obsessions and Compulsions. Trying to stop them though causes extreme anxiety and prevents them from doing so.Martin tells the story through the viewpoint of Dan Cambridge, an intelligent man who is unemployable because of his OCD. Danlives alone in a one room apartment in Santa Monica, California. Dan's OCD has caused an \\"escalating self-imposed narrowcorridor of behavioral possibilities\\" in his life. The chief inhibitor in Dan's life is his problem negotiating curbs.Because of this he can barely get himself to the local Rite-Aid to buy necessities and he spends many hours alone dealingwith his obsessions and compulsions. Much of the first part of the book comes from the intersection of Dan's strange life andthe lives of his fellow neighbors. Martin never moves into the heads of the neighbors. When Dan does something that isobviously strange, Martin lets it sit there like an elephant in the living room. The reader is left to imagine the thoughtsof the other characters as they react to Dan's behavior.My son has struggled with OCD for years and in my opinion Martin nails the symptoms and the struggles that people with OCDencounter. He must have some experience with the disorder because he accurately describes how OCD can debilitate a person to the point of not being able to function. He shows that the OCD sufferer, although hampered by this illness, is not crazy and often has a unique sense of humor about the strangeness of it all. One of the more fascinating compulsions for Dan is hispenchant for constructing elaborate magic squares; those matrices of rows and columns filled with numbers that sum to the same number at the end of each row and column.Dan's one lifeline is his Grandmother from Texas who seems to understand Dan's plight at the raw emotional level. Her deathand Dan's subsequent trip to his Grandmother's house, closes a chapter in Dan's life and opens up new possibilities for thefuture.I highly recommend this book to anyone who knows a person afflicted with OCD. This is not a depressing book. It is funny. It is also sad but it is encouraging and has a happy ending. It will give you insight into how that person suffers daily. It has been difficult explaining my son's odd behaviors to friends and family. From now on, I will just hand them a copy of Mr. Martin's book."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"&quot;The Pleasure Of My Company&quot; is &quot;Shopgirl (Mr. Martin's previous foray into literature) with pathos. Rather than an older man intrigued by a younger store clerk, we meet a neurotic; indeed, one who is almost certifiable.Daniel Pecan Cambridge ( we can only assume his middle name to be a reference to his nutty mental state) is a man whose age varies, depending upon his feelings on a particular day. He's a transplanted Texan who now rarely leaves his Santa Monica apartment. After all, there are 8 inch curbs everywhere and the chance that he might be forced to endure seeing a garage attendant in a blue hat.Now, there are one or two enticements that will draw Daniel out of the comfort of his apartment - one is the attractive clerk, Zandy, at the Rite Aid. Two might be a sale on ear plugs or the purchase of over a dozen lip balms (a practical purchase, he notes).Due to these ventures into the outside world our hero finds himself embroiled in a murder, and, of all things, an unsuccessful wooer.Mr. Martin again depicts loneliness and love with poignancy and humor. In addition, we'd expect him to read his story superbly, and he does. &quot;The Pleasure Of My Company&quot; is a diverting and enjoyable listening experience.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I tried to read this, but it didn't grab me. But since Steve MArtin is one of my favorite actors/comedians, I thought that maybe listening to the audio book, read by the author would do the trick. I listened to 3 our of 4 CDs, which is more than I'd read. Try as I might, I just found Daniel's neuroses and compulsive behaviors more disturbing than funny. Forgive me, Steve MArtin. May I be a fan of your theatre, and not your books?"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I'd actually rate this three-and-a-quarter stars, which I know is getting a little excessive in the specificity department, but three doesn't do the craft justice while 3.5 indicates a level of enjoyment and involvement that wasn't quite there. The OCD-riddled protagonist, Daniel Pecan Cambridge, comes off fairly creepy at first, but Martin artfully turns the reader around in an almost imperceptible transition. Daniel's awareness of the ridiculousness of his limitations -- as well as those of others -- and his eloquent, non-judgmental articulation of such soon makes him relatively winsome. A reviewer quoted on the jacket calls Martin's writing \\"wryly omniscient and ruthlessly truthful\\" -- that's exactly what I thought (without having hit upon that perfect phrase) when reading \\"Shopgirl\\" (actually what that reviewer was referring to), and that incredibly perceptive yet unselfconscious perspective comes out moreso about halfway in -- likely intentionally for a more meaningful character arc. I would clarify that \\"ruthless\\" is more in the unflinching directness than in the intent."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I love Steve Martin, but this book I have no affinity for.

It was almost as though the boy aged 20 years and here is his life now. However, the tone of the book is very different and much more enjoyable.Two things keep me from raising this to 4 stars. (1) Knowing the author was Steve Martin and it being written in first-person, I heard the comedian's voice in my head. This would have been fine, except many things came off as jokes that weren't actually written as such. Maladies which the protagonist struggled with had a stand-up's delivery. Also, the age and image was always wrong for the voice. (2) The character's neurosis could have been mine if things had been slightly different in my life. I don't like to think of myself as crazy, and books like this one show me to be small steps away from medication and counseling.3 and 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Great book, very enlightening and funny.

I've been a fan of Steve Martin's since the '70s so I had to pick it up. It's written from the perspective of a highly intelligent man who has developed autistic behaviors to cope with trauma in his life. Slowly as he allows himself to interact with other people, he gets the courage to break free of his self-imposed restrictions. The protagonist is often inadvertently hilarious when discussing his neuroses. Very sweet and human, I recommend it when you need something easy to read to make you feel hopeful about fellow humans."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This is a great book would recommend it to anyone, that it might be kinds boring but ends up being very interesting"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Ladies, who among us doesn't know a man who thinks the pleasure of his company is all we need to complete our reason for living? Steve Martin has written a book that so succintly describes a man who thinks he knows exactly how to attract a woman one feels exasperated by Daniel, and sorry for him at the same time. When he dresses to go jogging with Brian the Jock in loafers, khaki slacks and a white dress shirt, I was totally lost. This stud is a quintessential nerd, and obsessive/compulsive to boot. But I was completely taken by him and his unconfident confidence. Somehow all the people in his life, including the ones in his head, help Daniel make the final push out of his trap of OCD and into real life. Once there, he finds love, real this time, without too much trouble or planning. What a wonderful writer Steve Martin is!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This novel is clearly a masterpiece. I consider this as much a letter to Mr. Martin as a review. There was a review I read that mentioned Mr. Cambrige's mental illness is not funny therefore the book was not that good and not well written. Well I certainly agree mental illness is not funny but I have gone through mental illness for over twenty years and I have tried everything short of ridiculus pyshiatric drugs. This book is a God send. It did'nt make me laugh at my ailment but it did certainly loosen me up about it. To give one example of my troubles: I am a writer but I am severally intimidated by other writers so I only allow myself to read John Steinbeck because even though he intimidates the hell out of me he is suppose to - because he is a master- and I can accept that. Well I picked up Mr. Martin's book and not knowing he even wrote books and thought I would give it a shot. I felt I was safe, I mean how 'good' could he be? I mean for Christ's sake he's a knucklehead! After the first few pages I knew I was in trouble. How could I compete as a writer, he is amazing, no astonishing is a better word. So I had this dilema, how am I going to continue writing when there is someone so much better than me? So heres what I did, I considered him a master story teller like Steinbeck and therefore he is my teacher, I can learn form him and not lose a boat load of confidence. Steve Martin is that good of a writer period. And this book of his is a masterpiece. Now I only read Steve Martin And John Steinbeck. But what do I know, I'm crazy!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Daniel Pecan is weird and quirky and narcissistic to some degree. But you love him immediately.Steve says he took more risks writing this book. I saw him at the NYC book fair when he spoke. And I could definately see that he went out a limb. May be we are getting closer to a glimpse at Martin himself.The women are still written beautifully. He knows us so well, it is almost like he must have the power to enter our minds at times. (See Shopgirl)Martin is really very humble in person. One of the nicest celebs I have encountered. You could tell when he switched into a character he had played and he seemed more comfortable there than as himself.Sad, cause who would not want to be you Steve? King Tutt was brilliant. Plains, Trains, and Automobiles!I am just glad you are still sharing! Thank you for the glimpses."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"A friend had this book sent to me from Amazon. I wasn't sure I wanted to read it because he said it was funny and since I prefer to read literary works I was dubious about the writing. What a pleasant surprise it was to find it was a very well written portrayal of a transformation. The evolution of the protagonist from a frightened person who lives a limited life, ensnared by his neurosis, to someone whose life gradually blossoms to one of possibilities is finely crafted in this story.One does this book a disservice by referring to it as simply a comedy.Kudos to Steve Martin"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This is the story of Daniel Pecan Cambridge, his withdrawal from humanity and his return to the great masses. The book is not long, only 163 pages, but I found it both amusing and insightful.Daniel has some psychological problems (pecan...nut....get it?) He can no longer hold down a job or communicate easily with others. He lives an isolated life in Santa Monica, filling his days with obsessive-compulsive rituals. Likeable, gentle, with moments of great insight and others of total cluelessness, he has the fashion sense of Rain Man and the mathematical ability of John Nash. Daniel still finds other people interesting, and his desire to have a relationship with a woman leads him along a path that eventually helps him return to a richer life.This isn't an academically rigorous portrayal of specific mental health issues, but the character of Daniel works very well as a kind of neurotic Everyman. He is close enough that we can understand his world. He's interesting. We like him and cheer him on, for he is not tormented to the extent that we are alienated or repelled. The mathematical patterns and seemingly random rules that he uses to make his life bearable might be superficially amusing, but they serve much the same purpose as conventional social patterns. There is plenty of entertaining social commentary in this story, and more than a token jab at the egocentric who takes too much delight in his or her own company.Things occasionally seem a little glib and there are a few heavy handed moments. The ending, in particular, is glossed over. On the redeeming side, the story is imaginative and quirky, and it sustains enough pace to keep you interested. I also admired the author's skill in gradually moving Daniel into a more functional state as the book progresses. There are one or two moments of striking visual imagery, notably where the child Daniel imagines his father to be mathematically fractured.This writer is a keen observer of human behavior and has a finely developed sense of the absurdities of life. This humour and perceptiveness, combined with a thoughtfulness heavily influenced by undergraduate philosophy, makes for an interesting and unpretentious read that should have a broad appeal. Not as poignant as \\"Shopgirl\\", nor as sharply witty as the short stories written for the New Yorker, this quiet novella shows more technical maturity and consistency of style. As a writer of books, Steve Martin has a legitimate voice that is worth listening to."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"It's not about to be making its way into the canon of legendary literary prose anytime soon, but what a brisk sunny slice of life from our idiosyncratic protagonist, a nebbish 30-odd year old Daniel, winner of the Most Average American contest.The entire narrative unfolds in third person, with the author as the raconteur, his powers of observation taking precedence over his way with a wisecrack. The book's poignancy as well as it eroticism are brought to life through a larger-than-life comic filter of a man who believes his \\"charisma has yet to fully bloom\\" but who still has issues with Euclidean constructs and social solitude. The undercurrent of romance is fabulous.Things resolve neatly and a bit too quickly in the end (a very lean novella), but for as long as it does last it's a well-paced comic diversion with some very witty insights into life and love. A delight I'd recommend in a blink."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I found the book rather timid and boring, with trite situations and surface psychology that didn't really delve into anything profound. The main character is basically Forest Gump, but with an uneventful life and no discerning characteristics to make him interesting. I thought the title and cover art were interesting, and those were the reasons I checked it out. It was a mistake. I still think Steve Martin is a great comedian, but this book has made me wish that he would stick to his strengths."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Sometimes I look askance at books written by actors. I think: they are not writers. However, Steve Martin exceeds categories. I read Shopgirl, his previous novel, and as much as I enjoyed it, this book is far beyond it.He uses beautiful restraint, and tight writing to make the tale one of infinite familiarity. It starts out funny, but also sad, and yet grows into triumph in the small things that matter in life. I was amazed again and again by Martin's choice of words, the way each description of an emotion, a sound, a moment was so apt.The author has a compassion and understanding for his character, and makes him familiar and understandable, despite very unusal quirks. It is a very new look at obsessive compulsive behaviors and the way we create order in our overflowing lives.I very highly reccomend this book and I think you will discover, as I did, that it is more meaningful and thoughtful than it at first presents itself to be."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"It was with mild anticipation and strong curiosity that I bought The Pleasure of My Company. I've found Steve Martin's comedy, theatre, and film work to be enjoyable, which made me eager to explore his writing endeavors. In the end though, I found the book to be a lot like Martin's recent films: pleasant, but not memorable.The strength of the book lies in the characterization of Daniel Pecan Cambridge. Thanks to some strong narration, Martin makes Cambridge so alive that even the rationalizations for his behavior seem somewhat logical. This strength is augmented by Martin's easygoing writing style, which allows Cambridge's story to move effortlessly from one situation to another. However, what undercuts these strengths is Martin's inability to delve into Cambridge's and the secondary characters' emotions beyond a perfunctory level. Because of this lack of depth, even the more outlandish scenes (like Cambridge's essay and his attempts to seduce Elizabeth) come across as either mildly humorous or mildly frustrating. This weakness, combined with a much too rushed ending, leaves the reader feeling somewhat dissatisfied with what could be a fascinating story.The Pleasure of My Company will probably make a good movie. In fact, I thought I was reading a screenplay treatment instead of a novel. But, situations and emotions which can be fleshed out by actors need to be detailed when they are put into a book. It is in this area that The Pleasure of My Company falls short. It was a mildly enjoyable read; but, in the future, I think I'll stick to Martin's other endeavors."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This novel is so endearing. I wondered where it was heading in the first few chapters, but in the end, Martin wraps it up full circle in a way that only American novels do best. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Love this man as a comedian, an actor, anything \\"live\\", not so much as an author. Is this the same guy?"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This novel is told from the perspective of Daniel Pecan Cambridge, a man whose brilliance is stifled by his OCD. He lives in an apartment in Santa Monica, living off of unemployment checks (his OCD makes it impossible for him to hold a job) and a stipend from his grandmother in Texas. Every step outside his apartment is significant one for Daniel, from the walks to the neighborhood Rite Aid (he goes out of his way to avoid curbs, which he has a phobia against) to the road trip to Helmut, Texas (What about curbs?? Read the book to find out).What's working: Martin has some moments of terrific prose (\\"I had forgotten to wear sunglasses.... One half of my face was shut like a salted snail\\"). And let's face it, Daniel is a little strange. But Martin makes him likeable.However, I think this story is lacking in believable and likeable supporting characters. While it's true that most of the supporting characters in this book are not portrayed as villains or anything, I just didn't like them very well. I had a difficult time believing the relationships that develop between Daniel and most everyone else. For instance, despite the catalyst that pushes Clarissa and Daniel together (beyond their previous professional relationship), I didn't find their friendship believable or appealing.The book I read right before I read The Pleasure of My Company was twice as long, but it took me half the time to read. I just didn't find myself connecting with this book. But that isn't to say I won't give Martin's works another try; I loved Pure Drivel."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"It was an easy read and it made me laugh. Those are undervalued qualities and they make the book worthwhile. However, the ending is ridiculous and spoils the whole process. The reviewer who labeled it as \\"Hollywood\\" was right on target!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This book, a novel, a fake memoir, is a book in which not much happens. Not much that I could work myself into caring about,I should say. Because the motion picture industry has thoroughly worn out the mechanism of anterograde amnesia, Steve Martin had to reach for OCD to make his character interesting. The writing is beautiful, and if you want to read something to help you pass the time, go ahead and read this, but don't imagine it's going to be fulfilling. This is, bookwise, the equivalent of watching static on television; you'll get done and think \\"Well, that was a book, now, where was I?\\""},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin has always been among my favorite comic actors and performers, so I greatly looked forward to this book. Unfortunately I found it practically unreadable. Perhaps my taste in humor has changed, but there always seemed to be an edge to the silliness in Martin's performances. The edge is missing here. I don't abandon many books without finishing them, but this is one that I did."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin is without a doubt one of America's top, multi-talented entertainers over the past four decades. His best films (\\"Roxanne,\\" \\"L.A. Story\\") are warm, funny, uplifting portraits of regular (okay, slightly irregular) folks. I enjoyed \\"Shopgirl\\", finding it to be a touching true-to-life story of people connecting amidst the paradoxical loneliness of life in a crowded modern day American city (Shopgirl has the potential to make a very good movie). \\"The Pleasure of My Company\\" explores similar themes, yet since the main character is so obviously mentally disturbed, I could not develop a deep attachment or identification with him, which prevented the story from affecting me as deeply as Martin's best work.Although almost everyone has episodes of shyness, which handicap them from directly obtaining the object of their desires, the protagonist of TPOMC handicaps himself to such extremes that it is hard for the reader to know how to react. Martin spends a significant portion of the book describing these self-afflictions, in painful detail in many cases. Some of them are terribly sad, some are just plain stupid, and some are quite funny (my favorite was when the main character decides, for several days, to avoid saying any words with the letter \\"E\\" in them - the slightly convoluted sentences that he devises to converse with others who don't know about this self-imposed limitation show off Martin's subtle humor at its best). So, while humor is definitely one of Martin's intents, at other times I felt as if I was being asked to laugh at the truly mentally ill. Or, more likely, Martin did want to invoke more complicated feelings of pathos in the reader. But whatever his intent, it did prevent me from identifying with the main character, which in turn made it hard to apply the lessons from the book.There are a few other more minor flaws in TPOMC. There is a diversion in the plot whereby the main character enters an essay contest and gets invited to speak at fictional \\"Freedom College\\", modeled after evangelical colleges here in the U.S. Yet the essays submitted are so awful (as the main character states, every sentence in his essay contradicts the prior one) and the people at the college so wooden that Martin fails to concede even an iota of intelligence to the target of his satire. But no one is that stupid, so it is too easy to dismiss the points Martin was trying to make.TPOMC does have a redeeming message to convey: even a painfully shy, afflicted individual can, if they open their hearts widely to others and open their lives a tiny bit to social interaction, find a true, healing love. And there are some warm and humorous passages. However, for those who have not yet read any Steve Martin, I would recommend \\"Shopgirl\\" over TPOMC, and I would urge some caution before spending time and money on TPOMC."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"The book was ordered almost 2 weeks ago to be sent from Atlanta, to Atlanta. But it hasn't arrived yet. The order says it has 4 more days to arrive. I will comment again when it arrives."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"If you want to read a SM book, I'd recommend Shopgirl far and above The Pleasure of My Company.First, I love Steve Martin and pre-ordered this book. But, I'm surprised by all the reviews that call it hysterically funny. It's sad. The protagonist is sad; he suffers a mental illness that's making him miserable - it isn't funny. I don't mean that we can't laugh at misfortune (Steve Martin is GREAT at having us do so), but he misses the mark here. At times, less rather than more, there are genuinely funny lines (I did laugh a little).Mostly, though, we--I include myself--enjoy it because it's Steve Martin and we're fans. Otherwise, this really isn't a very good book. It isn't very funny and it doesn't have much to say (compare to \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in Nighttime\\" which, about an autistic character, is funny, interesting, entertaining, and heartbreaking).\\"The Pleasure of My Company\\" reads as though it's trying too hard, and it reads as though it's shallow, which I fully believe SM is not. Plus, the nature of OCD - obsessive, repetitive thoughts - the way they are presented here, in all their minutiae, makes for boring reading. I even skimmed through some of this little novella. Essentially, we get the blow-by-blow of Pecan's thoughts, which are quite pitiful, written as though we should be laughing.Spoiler:I liked the redemptive, \\"Hollywood,\\" ending and unrealistic character growth and recovery. I had a sense of completion, at least, though in this man's world it's pure fantasy."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"As with other reviewers, I was seduced by Steve Martin as author as well as the joy I found reading Shopgirl. Alas, there is no joy in Daniel Pecan Cambridge's world for him or for me. I didn't find the prose that humorous at all, and the main character was rather pathetic. And not in a sad, I feel sorry for him, way. Mostly I found him annoying. I felt like slapping him and saying, you dolt, it's just a curb, step over it and get on with your life. Moments were amusing, but with the central character being quite unlikeable, I found the reading a chore and I just didnt care what happened to him."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This literary version of &quot;The Jerk&quot; never gets going for me. It starts off as a monologue and since I know Steve Martin wrote it the image I got in my head is of Steve on stage telling me this story. Once a few characters are introduced they have no depth or real life. As the books goes on the story never progresses. The main character has no conflicts to change is character. He has a few obsessive compulsive issues to deal with but they mysterously dissolve by the end of the book. I found the ending to be particularly bad. The main character's problems are solved and he finds true love in a terrible final 10 pages. This was a story about a wierd guy who has some mildly humurous episodes and then gets better. Who cares?"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Steve Martin's brilliance never ceases to amaze me. His dry, biting, and intricate style is always dead-on. What makes Martin such a great writer is that he is such a keen observer of human nature and most importantly, of human flaws. His latest book takes this idea to a new level.Daniel Pecan Cambridge is certainly flawed. Through humor, we see what it's like to be virtually crippled by OCD and paranoia. Although the ending is a wee bit simplistic, I believe it is probably necessary for the novella form to really work. Martin captures so wonderfully the loneliness of Southern California life, and getting inside the mind of Daniel is a treat. I'm glad that Martin uses this first-person style of narration.Steve Martin is creative, interesting, and downright hilarious as a comedian. As a writer, he proves with this second novella that he is all of these things and more."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"A short book demands a short review, so here goes: Steve Martin manages to be funny and thoughtful in this book without ever making you feel like you're in the middle of an SNL skit, and that's a difficult feat when your subject matter is a man whose idiosyncrasies beg to be mocked. Instead, Martin takes us inside the mind of Daniel Pecan Cambridge, who can't cross streets if it involves stepping off of a curb, requires that all the lights in his home add up to 1125 watts (imagine how this impacts bedtime), obsesses over the realtor across the street, and makes frequent--and complicated, due to his inability to curb-hop--trips to Rite-Aid. This novel makes you think about how easy it is to get stuck in a rut and how dangerous that rut can become. It's written quite beautifully--I suppose, after Shopgirl, Martin's writing skills should be less surprising, but the fact is that he's got more literary talent than half the bestseller list. At only 160 pages, this book is just right for a three day read, during which you'll find yourself thinking about Cambridge frequently, and after which you'll be left with the hazy afterglow of a very pleasant experience with an ending that wraps things up perfectly."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I was charmed. Normally, I stick with suspense and, more often than not, you'll find me reading a good detective thriller or amateur sleuth murder mystery. Imagine my surprise when Steve Martin's novella, The Pleasure of My Company, captured me.With each and every page I felt mesmerized, as layer upon layer was revealed of this brilliant and complex character, 28 year old Daniel Pecan Cambridge. He is naive, awkward, funny, compassionate, slightly damaged, and wiser than he knows. Daniel captured my heart, so maybe I simply fell in love.Even though I've been a little bit in love with, and in awe of, Steve Martin for decades, I'd never read anything he's written. When I saw this ebook available for loan through my Amazon Prime membership, I figured I'd give it a go, costing me nothing but my time. Honestly, I didn't expect what I got. I mean, just how talented can one man be? How fortunate for me to find such treasure without expecting it. It's moving, sometimes deeply so, without taking that oh-so-obvious sentimental turn too many writers use when they want to deliberately yank my chain.True, as those who didn't care for the book complained, there's not a lot of action here and definitely no adrenaline pumping plot line. Doesn't mean, though, that there's nothing going on in this intimate exploration inside a truly fascinating mind. Consider it a character study, one handled with a deft touch and gentle hand, with an uncommon understanding of being flawed, of being human."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I admit that I was skeptical at first. On my own, I wouldn't have chosen to read \\"The Pleasure of My Company\\", but my book club picked it and I plunged in. The main character is indeed very odd, but you can't help rooting for him. He has a good heart and in the end, the book is heart-warming and hopeful. I give it 5 stars because it made me feel so good."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Martin's career fascinates me because I see him enter a new field at a certain level and then improve on subsequent outings. He's always been good enough from the get-go to earn the indulgence of fans and financers, which of course buys him time. People will take a chance on Steve Martin. Pure Drivel, his collection of short, humorous essays, bettered his first effort, Cruel Shoes (much of which reworked his standup routines). Roxanne, his sharp adaptation of Cyrano, seemed to come from nowhere, if we consider his previous screenplays -- The Jerk, The Man with Two Brains, and Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid. L. A. Story (one of my favorite films) revealed a screenwriting talent of the highest caliber. Likewise, after Shopgirl, a rather self-conscious, too-careful effort, Martin comes up with The Pleasure of My Company.Martin has always used words sparely and elegantly. Here, however, he manages to give the impression of having loosened up a bit, of taking artistic risks with his characters. The characters of Shopgirl were a little too easy and too familiar to readers of New Yorker fiction. One always sensed Martin's controlling hand in their actions, and the best parts of the book seemed to be the by-the-way observations of Southern California culture. In Pleasure, one actually cares what happens to the hero -- a self-absorbed neurotic so inside his own head that he has, essentially, withdrawn to the rooms of his small apartment. Among the many ironies, he enters (twice!) an essay contest on why he is the Most Typical American. As in L. A. Story, Martin's somewhat surreal view of life (in this case, explored through a character suffering from world-class obsessive-compulsive disorder) turns out to be, not really nightmarish, but a sense of wonder toward the ordinary world."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"First of all, this book is laugh out loud funny. But it is also wonderfully touching, something that I didn't entirely expect. I found myself crying at the finale, I was so moved by the characters and how it wraps up. Steve Martin weaves a simple, captivating tale here that is just the right length. It neither overstays its welcome, nor does it leave the reader upset for more. I loved it, and expect that others will feel the same."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This book was mentioned in the tape \\"Funny Numbers\\" published by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI). Steve Martin and Robin Williams converse with Bob Osserman, the Special Projects Director of MSRI. Martin speaks about Daniel Pecan Cambridge, the main character in this book and his passion for creating elaborate magic squares. My viewing of that tape is what led me to this book.Cambridge is a man whose neuroses are borderline psychotic, not because any one of them is that bad, but due to the large number of them. For example, the total wattage of all the light bulbs in his apartment must have a specific sum, he views normal roadside curbs as difficult obstacles and he lies easily in order to say what he thinks people want to hear.Martin's prose is not what you expect if you have seen his movies, there is a simplistic tenderness in Cambridge's dealings with others, in particular with Teddy, the infant son of Clarissa, the student who was studying him at the beginning of the book. When Clarissa's ex-husband turns violent and she needs a place to stay, Cambridge takes them in. He serves as the babysitter when Clarissa is in her classes. All through this, he makes no attempt to engage her sexually, even though they share an apartment. It is a fundamental tenderness between a man, woman and a child rarely seen in literature. Martin is to be commended for his handling of the situation and for not having it become sexually charged for the sake of the sexual charge.There is a happy ending that is fairly formulaic in the sense that Cambridge finally encounters the right woman for him. As the elderly woman who lived in our neighborhood when I was a youth was fond of saying, \\"There is a Jack for every Jill.\\""},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Martin show his mastery of the english language in this novel. Truely enjoyable with engaging characters and wonderful plot."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"A lot of people seem to think that everything Steve Martin does is meant to be funny, but this isn't a laugh-out-loud funny book. It's got subtle humor and I did find myself chuckling a few times.This is maybe one of my favorite Steve Martin books. The main character has many conditions that have rendered him almost completely socially crippled. The book takes us through his daily life. It takes us through a period in his life and we watch him slowly break out of his shell. We watch him break his own rules and expand his world. He fumbles through awkward encounters with people and situations and confesses his feelings about them to the reader.I read this book in a few days. I couldn't put it down. I wanted to stay with it and watch the progress happen. I was rooting for the main character!"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Very accurate portrayal of character. Recommended for any one who is dealing with anxiety, OCD and the like, or knows/loves someone who is dealing with such issues. Very true to life experiences."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"One of my friends had told me how good this book was and I decided to try something different. I was not disappointed as this book was very amusing and kept me interested throughout the entire read. Not too long of a book but good development of the main character."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"It isn't often that you get to share a life so complex as Daniel's. Steve Martin must have so much inside him that finds itself expressed in his two novellas, his screenplays and his comedy. So much poignant history and a talent for observation that leaves me almost unable to express my feelings about this book. Daniel is a fine man, a person with a sense of right and wrong, a developed appreciation for his world, but so many debilitating compulsions. In this world perhaps less sensitive people do better, and Daniel is sensitive. I loved this book. It is probably one of the best I have read, and I had no idea Steve Martin had it in him. Daniel is self aware, and of exceedingly high intelligence, two elements of the story which cause both sad and wrenchingly funny moments. It's a short book - read it."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"This is in first person from the point of view of a highly original character. His OCD-like behavior limits his contact with the outside world, so he spends much time thinking unusual and funny thoughts and planning ways to meet a woman despite the fact that he can't cross the street, except at driveways across from each other. The story is his journey toward making real connections with other people, and it is funny, touching and original. Much more fun than \\"Shopgirl.\\""},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"It's a fun, interesting read while passing time on the bus or in the doctor's office. I suppose I would call it 'comfort reading' to help pass the time, and easy to pick up whatever page you were on. I expected more from Steve, but then maybe my expectations are too high after \\"Shopgirl,\\" which I found insightful and profound as to what happened to the young lady. The protagonist in this little novel left me torn between sympathy and laughter - it must be hell worryng about curbs and being out in public. The ending seemed like it was created to meet a deadline - too fast and unbelieveable. Worth reading for me in two medical visits - would I recommend it to others? Probably not - not one of my favorites by any means - average attempt. I left it on the hospital bench for the next interested reader."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I don't know if Steve Martin has expert knowledge in obsessive compulsive disorder but if he does this may be an enlightening read. More so than watching the funny view of it from shows like \\"Monk.\\" For the lead character, the OCD is rooted in deeper issues. The character essentially learns to manage his behavior; I don't know if that's valid but it's a hopeful thought that someone's answers could lie outside of pharmaceuticals.Overall I enjoyed this book although the beginning was pretty slow - I dozed off so perhaps that's why I didn't pick up on the OCD until later in the book.If it weren't for the slow beginning I would have gone with a 5 star rating. The book is short, which earns a star in my book off the bat. I enjoy the characters and Steve Martin's subtle humor and succinct descriptions and language.The audiobook version is read by the author, which I really enjoyed. You just feel like you're getting the full experience. Like sitting with the chef in the kitchen while he cooks. I encourage all to seek out this experience if you listen to audiobooks. The audio version is also embellished by music and some interesting singer doing some New Age kind of scat that somehow grows on you."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I think those who go into this book (which I actually did by 'audio' during my hellacious commute) thinking 'it's written by Steve Martin: it'll be funny' are making a mistake. For the first quarter of the story, I thought the same thing - and mistakenly thought 'Steve Martin is making fun of someone with these mental challenges'. Wrong!This is a charming little story about someone whose mental challenges are never defined, but he certainly suffers from OCD. He's also a mathematical genius. His trains of thought are sometimes humorous, but I never laughed out loud.Daniel's story reminded me of A Confederacy of Dunces and The Catcher in the Rye in that all three stories are about young men who are profoundly alienated from society. Daniel, at least, is trying to take steps to overcome his compulsions and join society...I listened to Martin's Born Standing Up just before PLEASURE and heard a bit of auto-biography in it as well. The incident Daniel relates from his childhood of his father beating him (and the resulting alienation of father and son) is almost word for word from BORN. Martin is also a Texan who moves to California. Where he got the rest of the story is anyone's guess."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"How Martin weaves OCD, a pie company essay contest, a student shrink, a toddler, a Rite-Aid pharmacist, and Magic Squares into such a touching and brilliant novella is amazing. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"Quirky is the word for this novella. The title character is definitely not your average person. Through clever writing, the reader becomes emotionally involved and roots for him. This ends up being s sweet story, who expected that?"},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"A nice little read. I enjoyed this book, from comedian Steve Martin, very much. An interesting cast of characters, and my only complaint is that it ended too abruptly and too soon. I would have enjoyed more."},{"Title":"The Pleasure of My Company","review":"I actually really enjoyed this book. I'm a bid SM fan and so I love that I could envision him in the main role. So much so that this happened: I read the book several years ago and just the other say was talking about it as if it was a movie, surprised to find out that a movie had never been made of the book!It was an easy read and a fun, thorough jaunt into the mind of someone with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. It was sad, of course, to share his frustration at not being able to be the person he wanted to be. But I loved the surprisingly compassionate moments that different characters showed. It's a good one. Best book ever? Probably not, but I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Effective Safety and Health Training","review":"This is a very practical and very inspirational guide to developing and presenting health and safety training programs. The authors have conducted training for a wide variety of audiences and experience both good and bad sessions from both sides of the aisle. They provide both empathy and technical advice for people in similar situations.Their emphasis is on participatory training: the basic thesis of the book is that Lectures are Boring and they provide a number of suggestions for breaking down the barrier between a trainer and their audience. They also provide exercises to help &quot;Train the Trainers&quot; and generate new approaches to delivering similar material to a wide variety of audiences.In addition to general theoretical and abstract advice, the book addresses specific topics important to people developing training programs today, such as how to work with Generation X audiences, how to work with jaded audiences and the role of computers and the Internet in the training picture.It is clear from the tone of the book that the authors love their work and believe in its value to themselves and the audiences they serve. Their focus on practical advice and breaking down traditional barriers facing health and safety trainers makes this a worthwhile investment for anyone facing the task of conducting health and safety training sessions."},{"Title":"Effective Safety and Health Training","review":"This book is so helpful, especially for people who are uncomfortable with public speaking, looking for ways to liven up their training classes, and/or frustrated from the lack of participation or enthusiam from the audience. I have been struggling so hard with our training programs and this book has really given me some great ideas. It tells you how to format the training, get people to actually learn something, and even enjoy the training too (gasp!). I highly recommend this book. I have found it extremely motivational."},{"Title":"Smoothies for Life! Yummy, Fun, and Nutritious!","review":"I owned 'Juicing for Life' long before buying this book. I liked that one, so I bought the smoothie book when it came out. As a believer in the power of juice consumption, I found this book to be an excellent reader also. This is more than another 'fun' smoothie book for those looking for entertainment. It's broken down by chapters into &quot;Energizers&quot;, &quot;Power Makers&quot;, &quot;Calorie Burners&quot;, &quot;Immunizers&quot;, etc., in its 11 chapters of recipes. Specific ingredients for specific goals. The explanations of ingredients needs are excellent, as they were in her juicing book.One caveat: don't expect all the recipes in this book to be low-cal, as they aren't. Tahini and peanut butter are two common ingredients. That may or may not be important to the reader.Another caveat: depending on where the reader lives, some of the ingredients may be difficult or impossible to buy in smaller areas. E.G. flaxseed and other uncommon oils, algae, and a number of vitamin powders.For those who want health information as well as smoothie recipes this makes an excellent book for reading, and deciding applicability to one's own health goals."},{"Title":"Smoothies for Life! Yummy, Fun, and Nutritious!","review":"I'm a big smoothie fan, and make them often, so I did not think that a book could teach me much, but this little volume has brought new creativity to smoothie-making. It also contains loads of information about the nutritional and health benefits of fruits and other smoothie ingredients. And it hardly limits the options--everything from strawberries to granola to algae makes its fun and healthy way into these smoothies. The authors divide the book into sections for special interests, such as athletics, immunity, etc., which is also helpful if you have a specific objective in mind for your next smoothie."},{"Title":"Smoothies for Life! Yummy, Fun, and Nutritious!","review":"The smoothies are delicious, nutritious, and easy to make. I love the way the book is organized by desired benefits (there are smoothies for stress reduction, weight loss, energy, athlete's needs, healthy skin, and more.) The authors, Daniella and Maureen ROCK!"},{"Title":"Smoothies for Life! Yummy, Fun, and Nutritious!","review":"My complaint about this book is the comparative value of fat/carbs/protein in just about all of the recipes in this book. I'm a big fan of breakfast smoothies, but I make sure that it always has around 25-35 grams of protein in it. Some of these recipes call for adding a scoop of protein powder into the mix, which will get you to that 25-35 grams, however just about every smoothie calls for so much fruit, that your carb count is upwards of 80-120 grams of carbs...in one meal!! Holy crap. I know you should get 5 servings of fruit a day, but not all in one serving. The sugar rush that I would get if my breakfast had upwards of 100 grams of carbs would be absurd.I wish there were more recipes that gave a more balanced and delicious approach - like say something simple like a cup of milk, 40 grams of carbs from whatever fruit, be it a half a banana and 20 grams of blueberries, 20 grams of peaches and 20 grams of...oh I don't know, figs...then protein powder, and to get some fat in there, either peanut butter, or almonds or flax. This book contains nothing like that.How is there even a chapter for athletes (protein-based), yet all of the recipes are carb overload?"},{"Title":"Smoothies for Life! Yummy, Fun, and Nutritious!","review":"I was so impressed with the recipes in this book! They taste wonderful, they're easy to make, and it's the perfect way to make a quick tasty snack that is healthy and good. I also appreciated the fact that you could adjust the recipes to fit your needs and tastes. Five Stars!"},{"Title":"Smoothies for Life! Yummy, Fun, and Nutritious!","review":"\`Smoothies for Life' by nutritionists, Daniella Chace and Maureen B. Keane is one of those books you dread when you pick up a book on food which claims to present an important nutritional point of view. As the book was written and published in 1999, there is a good chance that some of the nutritional information may be a bit out of date. I am not an expert on nutrition, but I sensed that the book did not give as much emphasis to blueberries as an ingredient as you will see in current books. And, I was just a little suspicious of the totally negative slant given to whole milk, due to its saturated butter fat. From my view of nutrition from the outside looking in, I sense that butterfat may have made something of a recovery in reputation over the last few years, with the demonization of transfats in butter substitutes.The thing which dismayed me the most about the book was the heavy reliance on health store speciality ingredients such as vitamin C power, brewer's yeast, flaxseed oil, protein powder, and liquid herbal supplement. A lesser dismay was the discovery of a few misspelled words.My suspicion of the purported mojo obtained from brewer's yeast and protein powder is entirely personal and I point that out only because I suspect there may be others who are turned off by any recipe which requires a trip to some speciality store.The other side of the coin is the fact that this book has great value if you are especially fond of smoothies. I was pleased, for example, to see the warning about giving honey as an ingredient in smoothies to children under the age of two. This is probably almost as important as good sanitation practices with chicken and eggs, yet I have never seen this warning outside of a book all about honey. On the other hand, I suggest you take the authors' recommendations about the value of herbs with a grain of salt. I suspect the pharmaceutical efficacy of many herbs may have been a bit inflated 10 years ago. Most modern research detects not much more than placebo effects.If, like me, all you really wanted was a few good recipes for smoothies, try the appropriate volume from \`Better Homes and Gardens'. If, however, you already make regular trips to you local GNC, then this may be the book for you!"},{"Title":"Smoothies for Life! Yummy, Fun, and Nutritious!","review":"This book is perfect!

There are a lot of different categories in this book from energizing smoothies, weight loss, how to build the immune system, memory enhancing smoothies, etc. So far I have no regrets on buying this book. What I like about it most is that it has an entire section of what different ingredients do for you so you can modify the smoothies to enhance whatever you want really. Maybe you want a smoothy that will kick your butt into gear before you go to work or maybe you want a smoothy that distresses you when you get home from work, there is also an entire section in this book on smoothies that distresses you. Really no matter what you want the smoothy to do for you or your body it gives you the information on how to make them."},{"Title":"Smoothies for Life!

Our conundrums in using and understanding electronic media are laid out in suprising parallels to those faced by Plato, Isocrates and other Classical Greeks when they made the mind-boggling shift from a culture of memory and oratory to texts written on paper in the Fifth Century, BCE. Recognizing movie, TV and computer screens as anything but neutral technologies, Welch formulates the Next Rhetoric, Electric Rhetoric, as what is coming (or already here) after Post-Modernism. She makes visionary recommendations for managing these media in modern life."},{"Title":"Electric Rhetoric: Classical Rhetoric, Oralism, and a New Literacy (Digital Communication)","review":"This book was the most difficult book I have ever read. The author clearly was writing this book for someone who has extensive background knowledge on classic rhetoric and Isocrates. She uses words that don't appear in any normal dictionary and confuse even the most advanced polyglot. Don't kid yourself, this is a tough book to read, my advice is to find a different way to get your information."},{"Title":"Literary Terms: A Dictionary","review":"Has a great definition for every thinkable literary term. A must have for any English student"},{"Title":"Here lies the heart (Homosexuality)","review":"Unfortunately Mercedes De Acosta is now best known for having had affairs with both Geta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich. Don't look here for hot gossip or lesbian secrets, however, because &quot;Here Lies the Heart&quot; is not that kind of autobiography. Rather, De Acosta charts out the fascinating life and people she was fortunate enough to meet, with energy and wit to spare.Starting early in her life, Mercedes De Acosta had a love of the arts -- just about anything, so long as the person who made it was a passionate artist. As a little girl, she met presidents and royalty. She was part of an eccentric Spanish family living in the US, who dared to skim by controversy (backless dresses, divorce).Mercedes herself was an unusual person, who pursued Eastern religion, fought for animal and women's rights, wore pants before it was acceptable, and threatened to divorce her new husband when he referred to her by a married name. She worked (rather disappointingly) in Hollywood and travelled all over the world. And throughout her life De Acosta met and/or befriended poets, playwrights, singers, actors -- including Isadora Duncan, George Bernard Shaw, Noel Coward, Greta Garbo, Sarah Bernhardt, Marlene Dietrich, and many others.Mercedes De Acosta wrote one of the rarest kinds of autobiographies: She talked a lot more about other people than she did about herself. In fact, we get to know her a lot better by how she saw other people than how she described herself -- impulsive, romantic, and tending to self-examination. Her memories become a bit fantastical in places, like where she claims to remember hugging a bear when she was a baby. But it feels like kicking a puppy to complain about accuracy problems.Though De Acosta had affairs with some of the people in &quot;Here Lies the Heart,&quot; you wouldn't really know it just by reading. She seems to focus just on friendship, and the impressive or enlightened qualities that the people she knew had -- at times, she even seems to have crushes on them all. Part of a poet's passionate nature? Maybe. Her writing certainly has a touch of poetry in it, very detailed and full of strong images like black ships, coats thrown over beds and scarves blowing in the wind.Mercedes De Acosta's &quot;Here Lies The Heart&quot; is an endearing memoir of a unique life. Full to the brim of all kinds of art, her story is one that sticks to your mind and heart."},{"Title":"Here lies the heart (Homosexuality)","review":"Fascinating autobiography. Mercedes traveled the world during the early part of the century. Interacted with the great artists and celebrities of her time. She even made it chic for women to wear pants when no one was doing it. She was also a talented writer, believed in animal rights before it was popular, studied Eastern religion. Extraordinary woman. If you love history, this book will teach you a lot!"},{"Title":"Here lies the heart (Homosexuality)","review":"Book is very good encounters of Mercedes with different people in different parts of world.

The writing style is so engaging and easy to read that it feels almost like conversation. Just when you have a question, the answer appears. Marla's dry wit is refreshing and intelligent. There is no pity party here!Marla has really struggled in life and sport. She continues to learn and perservere as a person and athlete and that is what makes a champion in life and on the track. I can't wait to see her medal in Athens at the next summer olympics.

In this case, one may &quot;understand&quot; that Ms. Runyan had a painful and frustrating past, but since we are not that ones that experienced it, we do not truly understand. Being blind takes away from you just as much as it gives. You take on a completely unique perspective on life; you take nothing for granted, and take great pleasure in the small things that make life worth living. Ms. Runyan, you will win a gold medal in the Olympics."},{"Title":"No Finish Line","review":"Ever felt like you were against an impossible challenge?

I bought this book due to its low price ($15 for a pdf format). I am not disappointed with this book at all. If you are comfortable with calculus and somewhat familar with index notation, the derivation in this book is very logical. I was able to use this book to generate a structural mesh using the algebraic method and differential method. The variational method seems to require funtional background and that is beyond me. Another good aspect about this book is that it gives the final equations that one needs to solve and a procedure that one needs to use to generate the grid. A good example is the Winslow method. I was able to use the equations in the book easily to generate the grid. Anyway, I would recommend this book to people who can read the first five pages of it without too much trouble. If you struggle with the first a few pages, this is probably not a good book for you."},{"Title":"Basic Structured Grid Generation: With an introduction to unstructured grid generation","review":"The first chapter on tensor analysis is quite appealing and it is still refreshing for me who has experience with tensor analysis. The last chapter on unstructured grid generation is very helpful for me. I think it is a useful book for beginner in this field and can be a valuable reference book for experienced.In computational fluid mechanics and solid mechanics, finite volume and finite element methods can deal with unstructured meshes relatively easily. So some of the grid generation techniques for finite difference method described in this book maybe less important than, say, 20 years ago."},{"Title":"Social Capital: A Theory of Social Structure and Action (Structural Analysis in the Social Sciences)","review":"I used this book for theorhetical framework in my thesis (fall 2012) at the University of Texas, in Austin.I was writing about social capital and social network as seen in a content analysis performed on one distinct sub-culture (Electronic Dance Music Message Board Online) where I tracked posts and feedback.This book was the foundation for my literature review!!!A++"},{"Title":"Social Capital: A Theory of Social Structure and Action (Structural Analysis in the Social Sciences)","review":"Lin has devoted in area of the sociology.

Wind of Justice delivers on all those points and keeps the reader's attention till the end. If you're a hardcore L5R fan, you'll get answers - and more questions, just the way it should be. Thought Naseru wasn't the easiest Wind to like, maybe this book will change your mind."},{"Title":"Wind of Justice (Legend of the Five Rings: Four Winds Saga, Book 3)","review":"Although this is part of a series, all the books can stand alone. You need not be intimately familiar with Rokugan, a fantasy world based on Samurai and Asian themes which is the setting of the popular Legend of the Five Rings games, to enjoy this book.Naseru is one of four siblings vying for the throne of Rokugan. We find him in the ruins of the Imperial City, just after it has been attacked by monsterous hoards from the Shadowlands, and Naseru needs to find another base of operations if he plans to remain in the running as an Imperial Heir. Aside from this setback, he's got the deck stacked against him as far as his chances of becoming Emperor. He is the youngest child of the last Emperor (although already scarred, missing an eye, and looking much older than he is), his skills are as a politician which is about as reviled an occupation as it can be in the modern US, he was fostered by a tyrant who was the enemy of the Empire, and he has the reputation of a villain who is after power and position without any scruples whatsoever. Of course, in the Imperial Courts, where Naseru is at home, nothing is quite as it seems. And even far from the Courts, in the City of Lies, where Naseru goes to build a base, plots, intrigue, courtesans, assassins and mysteries abound.As if Naseru didn't have enough to cope with, he hears of the hidden Way of Night, an ancient site that is yielding artifacts that could affect the fate of the Empire, and unbeknownst to him, although not unexpected, someone has sworn to avenge themself by taking his life.Naseru's investigation into the Way of Night brings him into contact with disreputable samurai, monsters, sorcerers, battles and a host of interesting characters and adventures. It also brings him into contact with his own dark past and forces him to decisions about what he truly desires for himself and for the fate of Rokugan.I am admittedly biased. I like tales with a Japanese setting, and I am familiar with Rokugan and the previous novels set there. But I still require a good story, strong writing and interesting characters to enjoy a book, and this book undoubtedly filled that requirement and more. In fact, I think I'll go and read it again!"},{"Title":"Swamp Life Sticker Activity Book (Dover Little Activity Books)","review":"If you need a $1 filler, don't get this.

He flips vigorously back and forth between the months, skipping through a whole season in just a moment. Those big blue eyes scanning the calendar, touching each dinosaur he sees as his nose occasionally kisses the surface. His bright eyes reflect the most beautiful colors of blues, hues of greens. The image in his eyes is almost flawless, mirroring a world of complete amazement. A world that's hard to believe was once ours.

For me: Oral book report day = do your best to get out of it day. Consequently, I grew up to be one of those adults who's afraid of public speaking. Public speaking is often cited by adults as their number one fear. This book is amusing, but it also gives subtle hints about how to speak in public.

However, after reading the book I would say the book should be required reading for begining Loss Prevention Agents. I like the Scenario and Analysis set up of the book. But there are far too many &quot;single item&quot; detentions in the book. For me to risk my badge, possibly my job, and a lawsuit on a bad detention if I am wrong on a single item, I have to be VERY certain that a shoplift has occurred and that the individual has the merchandise.

I picked up this book back when I worked LP. Looking back on my 6 year career I would say I wish I had come across it earlier (I did everything from catching shoplifters and dishonest employees myself to training and certifying the LP staff in my market and managing LP over multiple locations). I found that some companies just don't do a good job training their LP staff, and the people making the arrests don't get how serious stopping someone for suspected shoplifting is (especially when it becomes routine). The fact is that every stop potentially opens the LP staff and/or the company up to financial liability and the possibility of someone getting seriously hurt. The scenarios and outcomes in the book are things that should be kept in mind on every stop. When I was new to LP, I didn't get the ramifications of my actions and learned all of the lessons contained in this book the hard way (either by my own mistakes or those of colleagues). I wish I had read something like this early on. Don't expect to find anything really advanced here, this is all basic stuff one will pick up doing the job for a little while.

I was actually able to go see Casting Crowns \\"Lifesong\\" tour this year with my youth group. During the concert, they gave every bit of praise and glory to God and none to themselves. Casting Crowns is truly blessed by God, and they are not ashamed to proclaim His Word. That night when they sang \\"Praise You in This Storm\\" I and hundreds of other people felt God right there in Freedom Hall. It is so comforting to know that through all of lifes troubles that \\"we can lift our eyes unto the hills\\" and theres God just waitng to pick us up and give us strength. Not everyone realizes that God is in control of everything and allows good things and bad things to happen (Matt. 5:45). When tragedies come, God could be giving us a chance to grow stronger.The songbook is great, and I'm learning Praise You in this Storm right now. I really want it to bless other people and give them strength. Whether you have a band or you just play solo, this book will be perfect."},{"Title":"Casting Crowns - Lifesong (Piano/Vocal/Guitar)","review":"The book, as well as the CD are truly amazing! I've had 2 opportunities to see Casting Crowns in Concert, and they truly are amazing. I read the one review about how it angered him that Christians believe that God is the one who gives and takes away. And then kept going about how God doesn't take away. All I can say is read the Bible. It says it right there, God took away Sodom and Gomorrah, God took away Elijah (or Elisha, get them confused). God wiped out the Earth in the flood. To say that God doesn't take away is purely ignorant of what the Bible tells us! God takes things away for a reason, whether it be something or someone is so evil and wicked, as with Sodom and Gomorah and the flood, or someone like Elijah (or Elisha) who is a God-fearing person. If your not one for Christian music great- but I promise you casting crowns music is unlike anything you've ever heard before!"},{"Title":"Casting Crowns - Lifesong (Piano/Vocal/Guitar)","review":"(This review refers to the Casting Crowns \\"Lifesong\\" CD that goes along with this book)...I sat listening to the second song on this CD in utter amazement that people still believe that God is the one who gives and then takes away. I believe in praising God during the storms of life, but I don't believe in holding God responsible for everything that happens to me.I would simply like to state my opinion about the part of the song that says: \\"the God who gives, and takes away\\"It sometimes brings tears to my eyes to hear people making this statement during times of tragedy and loss.Normally I don't listen to the radio, but a few months ago my wife had the radio on and I heard a remix of this song (Praise you in the Storm) and they were adding things from the Hurricane Katrina tragedy into the song. It nearly angered me to hear Christians doing this.As I sit listening to the words about praising the \\"God\\" who \\"gives and takes away\\".. my heart cries out to my heavenly Father and I wonder why so many people don't truly understand His loving nature and perfect character.To believe that God had anything to do with Hurricane Katrina and its destruction, is to deny the finished work of Jesus Christ. Or to even say that God \\"allowed\\" this hurricane for some purpose or reason, is still saying that God was ultimately responsible for it. To say that God sat back and \\"allowed\\" a hurricane to destroy thousands of people as part of His \\"ultimate plan\\", would make Him a murderer and a violator of the covenant of peace that He established with His own Son.God is NOT the one who sinned in the Garden and caused perversion in this earth. It was mankind who fell and brought evil, sin and suffering here. It was not our heavenly Father who caused it.Does God really give and then take away?Why do people continue to quote Job, an Old Testament servant, who didn't truly understand who and what was the source of his trials and pain? Didn't God later correct Job for his false accusations? So why is Job our role model?Does God really give and then take away? Is that really the God that Jesus Christ presented to the world when He walked this earth? Not at all.In fact, Jesus stated that He came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them (Luke 9:56). Jesus also stated that the thief, Satan, is the one who comes to take away, kill, and destroy (John 10:10).The book of James proclaims that God is the giver of every good and perfect gift and that God never changes (James 1:17). Is a hurricane a \\"good and perfect gift\\" ??So why is this false statement, \\"The Lord gives and the Lord takes away,\\" made at almost every funeral and gravesite? Why is this false statement about God made during nearly every time of tragedy and loss?Why do Christians continue to present a schizophrenic God to a lost and dying world? The world is in desperate need of someone that they can love and trust, not someone that they believe might strike them with cancer at any given moment or kill their newborn baby in a car accident. People need hope, encouragement and confidence.. not strange doctrines that send confusing signals about our loving God, who sent His own Son to die for every one of us.God is NOT the one who gives and then takes away. He is simply not like that. It doesn't matter what Job or anyone else accuses God of, it matters what the Bible says about our Father. It matters how we are supposed to relate to our Father under this New Covenant. Would you sit back and allow your own children suffer at the hands of your enemy to supposedly help them grow? Would you sit back and let your child's body be destroyed by cancer and disease, so that you can somehow receive some type of twisted glory from it? Would you sit back and allow your own child's house be blown away by a hurricane for some \\"mysterious purpose\\" ? That's completely ridiculous.God always loves us and He's not even angry at us. Mankind is responsible for the current condition of this earth. God didn't cause it, we did. Let's start accepting some responsibility and stop claiming that God is the one who is taking things from us. Our heavenly Father is NOT like that. When you lose something or when something is stolen from you, don't blame the Giver, blame the thief!For more information or for a free audio CD about this extremely important topic, please email me.We also have a CD about Hurricane Katrina from a Biblical perspective.

I was in college. My recollection of the book was not favorable; it was lacking in action. Now, in my 70s, my reread of the book led to a far different reaction. I realize now that as a young man I could not relate to the reflections of older men nearing retirement. Or the experience of people with doubts about the usefulness of their careers or the wisdom of past choices. I heartily recommend this book for the more \\"Mature\\" reader."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"My first Le Carre book almost turned me off Le Carre: The Russia House, a turgid, lumbering tome written by a man who was far too busy being a Great Writer to be bothered with something so trivial as writing a good spy story. Fortunately, I found The Spy Who Came In From the Cold at a yard sale and decided to try again.This is Le Carre before he decided he was a Great Writer and just wanted to tell a story about what spying was really like; the numbing, insidious corruption that seeps into the souls of men who are professional liars, who must live lies every second of their lives, who dare not trust either their superiors or their subordinates. Alec Leamas may be the most unpleasant, misanthropic protagonist in fiction, and yet Le Carre manages to make us sympathize with him anyway, because his misanthropy is so thoroughly justified by the life he has led. That he is still capable of any love at all after what he has gone through, even the limited love he shows in the book, appears as a triumph of the human spirit.The plot is intricate, unpredictable, and yet believable. One point, though, remains unresolved at the end. The true explanation for Mundt's actions at the beginning must lie elsewhere from what he have been led to believe. Those who have read Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (or who, like me, saw the BBC version) may have a good lead to the truth.There is an unfortunate point; Le Carre hints here at the irrational anti-Americanism he has since more fully expressed in print, a sentiment disguised as a critique (sometimes warranted) of American policy, but which clearly has far deeper roots in offended British nationalism. Happily, there is much more to Le Carre than this; sadly, there may not be much more to the critical reputation he enjoys."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I didn't actually read the book, but I listened to an audio version. This is one of the best spy novels ever. It takes time to build, but the ending is shattering. As a reader, you find yourself playing out complicated fact scenarios from each character's point of view. From one point of view, the facts reveal one truth; from another the same facts reveal a completely different story. Which one is true? More importantly, which one will the characters believe? If what you like about spy novels is the tortured logic spies use (&quot;If you know that I know that you know that I know....&quot;), this is what you are looking for."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"If the power of a book can be judged, in part, by its ability to sink hearts, than this book for me should get six stars. I thought about it off and on all day after finishing it.le Carre's characters, for me, are timeless in spite of the dated contexts of his stories. In this treatment, we follow the self-proclaimed believer-of-nothing, washed out spy Alec Leamas on his last, greatest, most perilous mission in ostensible service of freedom and the Western way against the Red Plague of eastern communism. The reality for Alec, though, is much more personal and shallow. This story is fleshed out with complex sympathetic and contemptible characters (some of them are both).For some people, this story is an exercize in the fruits of nihilism. For others, it is about a man who works through his own stubbornness and finds a type of faith. This book avoids the question \\"Does the end justify the means?\\" and simply observes that sometimes whether or not we like it that we justify what we do by whether or not \\"our side\\" benefits. The terribly frightening thing is that for most people, \\"our side\\" is an accident of birth. One of the great theses in this book is that often we are, truly, the same as our enemies. The great socio-institutional weapons we build to destroy each other kill both the thistles and the gentle flowers, and sometimes we become slaves of our own creations. What is the value of societies vs. the value of persons? And who gets to decide? Man has invented deadly games that he, to the exclusion of morality and even reason, pursues with only the goal of winning, despite cost.This is also simply one of the saddest stories ever told, anytime."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This is the best spy novel - and one the best books - I have ever read. Le Carre gives a very real look at the world of espionage during the Cold War. A real novel of suspense, deceit, and intrigue. He holds you on the edge of your seat as Leamas tries, for one last time, to &quot;come in from the cold&quot;. If you're looking for a fast-paced book, don't look here. You won't find it. And if you can't handle hard-to-follow plots, you won't like this one much either. Reading this novel makes me want to read even more of Le Carre. A must for a &quot;real&quot; spy enthusiast."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"John LeCarre is one of the few authors ever that has been capable of writing a book that is both a suspenseful, thrilling page-turner, and at the same time satisfying literature with interesting and believable characters.This book is fascinating, fun, and satisfying. Like all of LeCarre's books, you will NEVER see the plot twist coming.Do yourself a favor, read this book."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is the first Le Carr&eacute; novel I've read - coincidentally, just as another adaptation of his Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy hits the theaters.Like some other reviewers here, I must say that for a book touted as \\"one of the greatest\\" etc., I found the The Spy Who Came in from the Cold to be no clean kill. It has a lot of problems at the basic prose level, and although it was Le Carr&eacute;'s third novel, it reads less like the work of a polished fiction writer than of a government agent who had a fair grasp of narrative. It reminded me strongly of Peter Wright's (non-fictional) Spycatcher, which of course covered the same 1950s-60s Cold War timeframe.I assume an editor spent quite some time manipulating The Spy Who... into publishable shape. There is little action, of course - the plot is largely spun out in clandestine meetings, tribunals, interrogations, and of course flashbacks - which is not strictly a problem, except that Le Carr&eacute;'s dialogue, on which all this plot depends, is rather clumsy. Characters simply announce how they feel in bold, primary-color emotions. Someone suddenly figures something out, and then it's explained to us in breathless monologues which read like field reports, not human speech.The love interest, Liz, is a pathetically simple character, moreso (if this is the comparison we are damned to return to) than any Bond girl. The grand English xenophobia is also on display, less overwhelmingly so than in Spycatcher, but still palpable: men with secrets fearful of those they perceive to have filthier secrets - queers, Jews, Arabs. Even though this novel is almost half a century old, its contention is that there is no moral high ground in espionage, so why revel in small-minded prejudice?The legacy of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold must surely originate from its final pages. The writing here is still workmanlike and yet at its conclusion I felt Le Carr&eacute; had more to say, in a finer way, than perhaps he was capable of at the time. It's the novel's only emotional note, and well-struck. You'll continue thinking about this book afterwards because of the conclusion (which is just about the best praise I can give, I think) and yet the strength of that conclusion also makes the 250 pages preceding it, their dry exposition and underdeveloped characters, that much feebler."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This book is enjoyable enough, but I don't think it is Le Carre's best. I won't gush about the things I liked, but here are two things I didn't like: the narrative perspecitive and the unconvincing ending. As for the perspective, I wish the story had been told entirely from the perspecive of one character, like in his later books (such as Absolute Friends). Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is also very very good (as long as you don't mind dealing with a really complex plot). If you want a more modern espionage/mystery novel, try The Prisoner of Guantanamo by Fesperman, which has the same high quality and realism as le Carre's books. Barry Eisler is good if you are looking for an author who leans slightly more towards action and thrills, but not so much that it is unbelievable. (although they may be slightly less probable, Eisler's books are still quite plausible).Also, I wish that Le Carre would not try to be so damned clever with his endings. It is a trap that many otherwise good writers fall into: they try to give the ending such a big twist that it stretches the limits of what one is willing to believe. The worst offense is that the author uses the cheap trick of concealing from the reader facts that the protagonist knows, but leading you to think that you know everything that is going on in his head."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"John Le Carre (David Cornwell) took the espionage novel away from the ridiculous and campy world of James Bond and the Man from U.N.C.L.E. and made it into serious literature with this, his third published novel.Readers may be struck by how bleak Le Carre's world is in this book. The story, Alec Leamas, a veteran agent goes on his last mission into the Zone (East Germany) in an effort to combat the East German intelligence (The Abteilung) from discovering a deeply planted British agent. Le Carre's staple character, George Smiley makes an appearance here, but it's Leamas who dominates the book. He's angry and cynical, but a dedicated agent. The other characters, Liz, Fiedler and Mundt are also wonderfully drawn and believeable. Le Carre keeps the plot moving without sacrificing his characters (sometimes difficult to do in the thriller genre). The result is a deeply felt, wonderfully written thriller. The final twist (if you're smart, you'll figure it out) is very satisfying and reveals the hypocrisy of the Communists and Western Powers and the callous regard for human life and dedication to one's cause. A core of high intelligence runs through this novel, yet you never have to reread passages to find out what happened. It's beautifully written and highly controlled. Le Carre is in total control of the reader and we're seduced by his dazzling prose. The most amazing thing is forty years later with the end of the Cold War, this ageless work still holds up. It has gone from a commentary piece to historical literature and retains it's power. What more can be said for a classic than that?I noticed that Cliff's Notes has a companion to this work. That, I think shows what a classic Mr. Cornwell has penned. It's that good. This is a novel to read, digest and ponder."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Le Carre is an unusual writer in the spy/thriller genre in that he creates real people with real problems who also happen to be spies. The story of Leamas, a spy for Britain during the cold war, is well discussed in the many reviews here. So instead I will briefly focus on why this is such a great read.The book works at several levels. First, one could characterize this as a page-turner because of the subject matter of the cold war and intrigue. But the story is also very complex and demands the reader pay attention to fully benefit. LeCarre does not spell out everything for the reader and I found myself having to go back several times to understand what had transpired. I actually rented the movie - a gloomy B&W; portrayal with Richard Burton as Leamas - in order to sort out a few things from the book. Secondly, one is never sure, even when finished, who the good guys are and vice versa. This causes the reader to think and contemplate issues of right and wrong, and moral values.At the end I was very sorry that the book ended but also looking forward to reading more of this authors work. This was a great book!"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"What is to be said about John Le Carr&eacute;'s THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD? It's shockingly entertaining, it's genuinely unpredictable, and it doesn't offer up a cheap get-out-of-jail-free ending. The characters are cursory without being shallow, the plot moves with amazing speed, and the action keeps bouncing along. In short, this is pretty much the perfect spy novel. As engrossing as it is realistic, and as absorbing as it is intriguing.SPY is a book based almost entirely around its plot, and while I usually give a storyline summary in my reviews, I don't think I'll be doing that this time. You see, the novel relies so much upon its double-crosses and back-stabbings that even the parts in the beginning (which are usually fair game for reviewers to spoil) can be puzzling and fun to follow. Every part of the story is interesting. Where other novels would still be setting up the premise, SPY has already started playing the game.Apart from the deviously clever plot, there is one additional thing I want to single out for praise -- the relationship that takes place between two of the main characters. On paper, it's a fairly standard idea: an older male spy paired with a younger, idealistic, innocent woman. But in execution it's a very nicely unstated bit of romance. It felt real, in part because Le Carr&eacute; didn't beat us over the head with the details, merely sketched in the broader strokes and let the reader's imagination do the rest.SPY isn't a story where the characters trade artificially witty banter in between their death-defying action sequences. The protagonist spends most of the book tired, battered and confused. It can be a mystery at times guessing whether he really knows what's going on, whether he is the chess-player or the pawn. When one of the book's villains tries to engage him in a verbal battle over whose society and philosophy is the superior, he can only grumble and offer insults in reply. It's this sort of likable realism that makes the book the success that it is. At the time he wrote this, Le Carr&eacute; had already joined and left Her Majesty's Secret Service, so I can't help but wonder if the plot, which seems intricate and elaborate in a fictional context, was actually a straightforward retelling of a standard spy-game."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"John Le Carre's disillusioned, cynical and spellbinding spy novels are so unique because they are based on a wide knowledge of international espionage. Le Carre, (pen name for David John Moore Cornwell), acquired this knowledge firsthand during his years as an operations agent for the British M15. Kim Philby, the infamous defector, actually gave Le Carre's name to the Russians. The author's professional experience and his tremendous talent as a master storyteller and superb writer make &quot;The Spy Who Came In From The Cold&quot; one of the most brilliant novels I have read about spying and the Cold War. Graham Greene certainly agreed with me, or I with him, when he remarked that it is the best spy story he had ever read. The novel won Le Carr&eacute; the Somerset Maugham Award.The novel's anti-hero, Alec Leamas, is the antithesis of the glamorous action-hero spy, James Bond. A successful espionage agent for the British during WWII, Leamus continued on with counter-intelligence operations after the war, finding it difficult to adjust to life in peacetime. He eventually became the head of Britain's Berlin Bureau at the height of the Cold War. Leamus, slowly going to seed, drinking too much, world weary, had been losing his German double agents, one by one, to East German Abteilung assassins. Finally, with the loss of his best spy, Karl Riemeck, Leamus has no agents left. His anguish at Riemeck's death is palpable. He has begun to tire of the whole spy game, as his boss at Cambridge Circus, (British Intelligence), seems to understand.Leamus is called back to London, but instead of being eased out of operations, called &quot;coming in from the Cold,&quot; or retiring completely, he is asked to accept one last, dangerous assignment. &quot;Control,&quot; the man Leamus reports to, asks him if he is up to &quot;taking-out&quot; Hans Dieter Mundt, a top East German operations agent and the man responsible for the deaths of Leamus' agents. The ploy is elaborate, and if successful, it will conclude with Mundt's own men killing him. With much planning Leamus convincingly changes his lifestyle and sets himself up as bait as a potential defector to the Eastern Block countries. As Leamus works efficiently toward his goal, two unexpected problems come-up - problems that he is unaware of until much later, when it is almost too late to resolve them. First, he falls in love with a young woman, a member of the Communist Party, who was supposed to be part of his cover, nothing more. And second, Control and the Circus have embedded plots within plots to further their end, which they don't see fit to reveal to Leamus - now operating in the dark. Le Carre portrays spying as a dirty game of acting, betrayal, lying, excruciating tension, and assumed identities. The espionage methods of East and West are the same. The only difference is their economic ideologies. There is a seemingly endless game of chess between the superpowers, and spies are as expendable as pawns.This is a short novel, 219 pages, and very tightly written. However there is much packed into this bleak tale of the espionage business. The story has more twists and turns than a rollercoaster. And the ride is well worth it!JANA"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This book defined a genre. From the elegance of the language, to the betrayal and harsh brutality of the plot's finale, this novel set the standard against which all other espionage fiction of the Cold War would be judged. Whatever the truth of the matter, Le Carre's fiction created a world which is so real that subsequent spy novels departed from its parameters at their peril.The story at the heart of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold implicates all sides in the struggle in a hypocritical conspiriacy of betrayal and disloyalty. The message seems to be that no good deed goes unpunished and that things certainly are not what they seem.A truely great book, with characters one cares for and a deftly plotted story that both surprises and distresses the reader. The message of the book is not a pleasant one, but then the reality of Cold War espionage was not pleasant either."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I recently reread this book and was struck by how perfectly Le Carre's writing style matches the bleak atmosphere of the novel. The hero of the tale, Alex Leamas, embodies the loneliness and personal confusion the author felt at the time. Writing this masterpiece of espionage in just 5 weeks became a source of solace for Le Carre. \\"By telling an ingenious tale,\\" he says, \\"I was making some kind of bitter order of my own chaos.\\" The result was a book that ended a life of writing obscurity and began a long period in which the publication of a new book by the author became an event in the publishing world.As the quotidian reality of the Cold War years vanishes generationally into the past, documents like this provide grim reminders of the atmosphere that prevailed at that time. Le Carre was inspired to write The Spy Who Came in from the Cold while working in the British Embassy in the shadow of the newly constructed Berlin Wall. It was, says the author, \\"perfect theater as well as a perfect symbol for the monstrosity of ideology gone mad.\\" The Wall, according to Le Carre, made the espionage industry more clandestine, perilous, questionable and over-crowded than ever before. It is more a character than a bit of scenery in the novel, making its appearance in the first and last chapters.In addition to providing expert Cold War atmosphere, the book has strong characters and an ingenious, twisting plot. British agent Leamas is left out in the cold to entrap East German Head of Security Hans Dieter Mundt. The chess match between these two is compelling to watch. Inclusion of Deputy Security Chief Fiedler as well as Leamas' love interest, Liz, increases both the stakes and the complexity of the game. Le Carre's tale demonstrates how emotional and intellectual powers are the true attributes of an agent rather than the physical histrionics that are exhibited by cinematic practitioners of espionage.The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is a taut morality tale which utilizes a palette of grays to paint its characters. It freezes a moment in time which should be remembered as a cautionary tale. Graham Greene, himself a master in the field, called it \\"the best spy story I have ever read.\\" Many more espionage novels have been written since Greene said this, but I'm not sure any have surpassed Le Carre's iconic effort."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Arguably the best spy novel ever written. It was out of print for years. I envy the readers who can now buy this newly printed copy. I had to make due with a decades old moldy copy that fell apart as I read it. Not that I'm complaining--I loved the book! Le Carre knows his spy stuff. This is not some techno-filled, action-packed, lets-throw-in-a-plot-twist-for-the-h@ll-of-it book. This is a tightly-packed page turner that will lead you by the hand in the beginning and then drop a piano on you at the end. Le Carre's heroes are not Bond, they are overworked, overweight, underpaid, highly intelligent characters who love their country. This book was one of Le Carre's first books, and I feel his very best. The &quot;winners&quot; and &quot;losers&quot; are blurred in the spy game, and this book clearly illustrates that point. If you want to get a feel for what real Cold War spy work was all about, read this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD is the quintessential cold war espionage novel. For four decades, this early LeCarre tale has served as the benchmark for 'spy thriller' writing. Reading it fresh in 2004, it's easy to see why.Though THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD was only LeCarre's third novel, his strengths as a storyteller are fully evident here. The opening chapter alone serves as a narrative tour-de-force, swiftly and adroitly introducing the reader to the central characters, their impossible situation, and the hopeless, duplicitous world they inhabit. It is beautfully mirrored by the final chapter, in which the consequences of protagonist Alec Leamas' weakness becomes excruciatingly, tragically clear.In terms of both style and structure, this early work seems to take its cues from Grahame Greene's '50s novels -- particularly THE QUIET AMERICAN. As in Greene, LeCarre's descriptions here are spare and succinct, with characters and situations quickly sketched in razor-sharp detail. Like Greene, this writer shows that sacrifice of innocents at the hands of arrogant ideologues has become mundane. He reveals the tragic complicity of all-too-human agents like Alec Leamas. Yet LeCarre does not share Greene's belief in personal redemption: His characters take it for granted that they live in an amoral labyrinth in which treachery and triple-cross are simply routine.Economy and intelligence are hallmarks of this work. Dialogue is terse, sharp; plot complications are introduced with a minimum of fuss. LeCarre sketches his players deftly, in medias res, as they run the gauntlet. Consequently, this 224-page novel can be read in two sittings, yet its characters and situations seem fully realized -- and its tragic conclusion hits with tremendous impact.THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD is an early work, by a writer still looking to more experienced hands for models. It would be almost a decade before LeCarre truly came into his own, with TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY. Still, it's clear that this novel is more than just a superlatively crafted 'spy thriller', more than just a classic of the genre. Forty years after its first publication, LeCarre's tragic tale has lost none of its power: THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD remains an extraordinary masterwork, by a supremely gifted and intelligent writer."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"A word of warning: \\"The Spy who Came in From the Cold\\" is not just an espionage thriller, it's a horror story.British MI-5 agent Alec Leamas, the eponymous hero of John Le Carre's brutal little espionage masterpiece \\"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\\", discovers that being a secret agent at the height of the Cold War is a little like being a man outside in the cold, looking in on the friendly warmth of home and hearth but unable to come in---so close, yet so far. His life depends on keeping up a charade, on cloaking his intentions and lying about his work. He can trust no one but himself, and he keeps an eagle eye on himself.To make matters worse, a botched defection at the Berlin Wall sends Leamas's career into free fall, prompting his recall to London, a subsequent reassignment to a desk job in Personnel, and, simultaneously, the hatching of one of British intelligence chief Control's more byzantine little schemes: use Leamas's fall from grace as a means of ferreting out and destroying Hans Dieter Mundt, a high-ranking East German master spy and Leamas's shadowy nemesis.To say more would be unfair to the reader. Le Carre, himself a former British intelligence officer, is perfectly suited to composing the elaborate, excruciating fencing match between London and Moscow that lies at the heart of so many of his best tales. The typical Le Carre protagonist and his handlers are not James Bondian pulp heroes with Union Jacks painted on the pommel of their 9MM Walther PPKs; instead, they tend to be bland, non-descript ciphers, poker-faced and cynical creatures who hide their machinations under bland exteriors.\\"The Spy\\" is Le Carre at his deftest, and the Cold War at its coldest. Leamas is re-introduced into the world as a potential defector, but his ruse is haunted by the unexpected relationship with a British librarian he leaves behind in London. And really, the relationship, and the emotions it awakens in this grizzled Cold Warrior, is what makes \\"Spy\\" so compulsively entertaining and riveting: Alec Leamas wants to love and to reveal himself, just as his East German interrogator Fiedler wants desperately to believe in the purity of the Revolution and in the ideals of Communism.But this is a Le Carre novel, and ideals and emotions are the luxuries of the dead or the doomed.\\"The Spy\\" has the advantage of excellent pacing and deft characterization, and as with many of Le Carre's best novels, it manages to condense a considerable amount of treachery in a minimum of exposition. Le Carre is not only a good storyteller and a master at plotting out the grim duel between his spies, he is also a consummately gifted writer who uses words like a surgeon uses a scalpel. Best of all, \\"The Spy\\" is a nastily clever work, in which the plot turns in on itself suddenly and viciously, casting some light on a dark arena in which no one can be trusted.\\"The Spy who Came in From the Cold\\" is a classic in espionage and a timeless literary masterpiece, but it is also a ruthless and jolting work whose cynicism is horrific. It is a bracingly good read and completely unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This is it - the best spy novel ever written, so good that not even Le Carre has ever been able to match it. If your image of espionage is formed by the cheesy gadgetry and high adventure of James Bond, then get ready for one very rude awakening. The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is a heartbreaking story, full of lonely people sadly making their way through a cold world - the Cold War was never more chilly than it is here. It's a sad and depressing book, but a smashingly good one, too. Read it."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Considered the best spy novel ever written, this is a quick, bleak book. It is widely praised for its realistic portrayal of Cold War spycraft, and rightfully so. There's hardly any 007-style action, no gizmos, no babes, just an elaborate, nasty plot. More or less makes all other Cold War spy novels redundant in its efficient depicted of an old British spy making his last big gambit before being retired. Tight prose and lots of tension."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Graham Greene, who was possibly the best novelist of the twentieth century and who was no slouch at the spy novel himself, call The Spy Who Came In from the Cold, \\"The best spy story I have ever read.\\" When I found out that Greene had said that, I had to finally pick this book up and see if its reputation was deserved.In my opinion, it was. Easily. It's the best spy novel I've read, too. I was riveted from the beginning. Le Carre won't ever let the reader become oriented. Nothing's as it appears. Ever.The characters are compelling. The plot's twisted (a good thing). And the novel just keeps hanging around because the implications Le Carre touches on (politically and philosophically) are far-reaching (well into today's milieu) and probing.It's a must-read for a lot of reasons."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"In 1963, David Cornwell published his third novel. Because he was then an agent for British Intelligence, he used, as his government required, a pseudonym: \\"John Le Carr&eacute;\\".Graham Greene, who pretty much invented the modern spy novel, called The Spy Who Came in from the Cold \\"the best spy story I ever read.\\"It was.And the thing is, it's even better now.In a decade when James Bond was all the rage, \\"Spy\\" revolutionized the spy novel. The Bond books --- and, even more, the Bond movies --- were thrill rides. The suave hero never mussed his tux. He had no need to; his car had more armament than one of Patton's brigades. The explosions that went off just a few feet from him always were just background flash. And, of course, he possessed the ultimate weapon --- his deadly quips, capable of killing any villain within earshot.Le Carr&eacute; had no interest in superheroes. For him, spycraft was the antithesis of a glamour profession. It was thinking and planning, waiting and watching, and lying --- always lying. It operated by a single moral law: results. You may be assured that good people were betrayed along the way.\\"Spy\\" was an instant classic precisely because Le Carr&eacute; showed readers exactly what Intelligence is about --- sometimes a roll of film, more often a list of names, never an atom bomb in a briefcase. Even better, it revealed how the trick is done. And, most of all, it asked a question: Us and Them --- how different are we, really?In London, men schemed long and hard to think up ways to misdirect the Communists. In East Berlin, men much like them plotted to deceive and damage the Brits. Between them was the Wall --- and a brightly lit, barb wired checkpoint.The Wall is where this novel starts. Alec Leamas, a 50-year-old British agent, waits at the West Berlin checkpoint for a German --- a British agent --- who's in danger of being found out. Tonight, he's crossing over. You get the scene quickly: coffee, cigarettes, idle chatter. And then you see the man on a bicycle. He stops at the East Berlin gate, shows his papers, pedals on. But then he hears something. He pedals faster. Shots are fired. He sags, falls. Leamas, the ultimate realist, \\"hoped to God he was dead.\\"The career of Alec Leamas certainly is; he failed to get his man across. And this leads to an opportunity for his employers. They would love to discredit --- or, better --- destroy --- Mundt, head of German Intelligence in East Berlin. The way they'll do this? Retire Leamas. Watch him sink into booze and despair. Let him be recruited by the East Germans. And then, in his debriefings, let him present these Communists with evidence that Mundt has been taking money from the Brits --- that Mundt is a British agent.This is mental chess. It calls for 24/7 acting skills. And the bar is set high. Leamas, flawlessly failing. Leamas, jailed. Leamas, released and bitter. Lemeas, expertly recruited by the Germans. Leamas, credibly sneering at his new employers.But that's only technique. Idealism? Patriotism? Le Carr&eacute; is the first modern spy novelist because he has a hard time telling the difference between the good guys --- that's us --- and the Commies.Let me interrupt to tell you something important about the author. His mother left home when he was 5 years old; he didn't see her again until he was 21. His father was \\"a confidence trickster and a jailbird.\\" Le Carr&eacute; has said: ''I was a spy before they ever recruited me. If you are brought up to believe that your home is an extremely dangerous place....\\"In his writing, he says, 'I always try to identify with one character in a book and appoint him my secret sharer.'' Here, that character is Alec Leamas. But here, there is also a father: Control, the head of MI5. I'm not going to spoil the book for you, but I do ask you to read with one thought in the back of your head: For this writer, what does a father do?Levels upon levels, worlds within worlds --- the experience of reading this novel is anything but relaxing. But if you're read any of the master's novels, you know that they deliver a kind of pleasure all their own."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I remember the opening scene of the movie of this book from my high school days but I didn't remember any of the story.

Alec Leamas is a lonely and haunted spook who is well past his prime and knows it. After years of being in \\"The Cold\\" his moral compass is seriously confused, his loyalties are questionable and his daily scotch intake is enormous. For the entirety of his career he has been outsmarted and outgunned by his spook counterpart in East Germany and now in the twilight years of his life and career he is given the opportunity for the ultimate Coup de Grace.Alec Leamas is a true gem in a literary world over run by Bondesque assassin spies. The stark, arid and cold world that Le Carre paints in this book is fantastic and proves to be the perfect arena for a washed up old man to consider a life spent in the grey areas of morality. Leamas's character development is absolutely superb throughout and by itself would provide a worthy read, but the plot is fantastic. Throughout the book the plot twists and turns in unimaginable ways that, in my imagination, must be hauntingly reminiscent of what the real spy game looks like.The prose and literary style of this books are without peer in the genre, the main character is intriguing, the plot is amazingly twisted and convoluted, and the pace never slows down.This is my current favorite in the genre - Highly Recommended"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"The book got here right on time and was in great condition.

Now that I have... well, I still consider it to be the consummate spy novel. What I was surprised to note about The Spy Who Came In From the Cold was the relative lack of action compared to many of the modern attempts in this genre. This is a story of words: of conversations... of the cause and effect relationships wrought by both what is and what is not said. It's a really interesting read.Alec Leamas is a British intelligence operator who runs operations in West Berlin. Unfortunately, he's lost every valuable agent he had to a ruthlessly clever East German operative named Mundt. At the outset, Leamas is recalled to London where he is offered a new assignment: to kill Mundt. When he accepts, British Intelligence demotes Leamas. He pretends to become a disgruntled drunk who eventually loses his job, gets gypped out of his full pension on a technicality, and ultimately gets sent to prison for assaulting a grocer who won't extend him credit. This is all a ploy is to make Mundt and the communist side believe that Leamas may ripe to defect and provide them with valuable inside intelligence on British operations.They, of course, take the bait... and so begins the game of verbal cat and mouse. Much of the narrative is consumed by interviews and conversations held between Leamas and his inquisitors. Every word, every move, every subtlety of conversation both verbal and nonverbal must be carefully crafted (by both sides!). Everything Leamas says and does must \\"sell\\" the right story. The information he gives must be just enough to let them jump to their own conclusions based on their own fears and prejudices. It's an incredibly complex story.I don't do spoilers here, of course, so suffice it to say that Leamas himself eventually finds that his assignment isn't quite what he thought... that he too is a pawn in a game far more complex than he ever realized. Reading this book is like peeling back layers of an onion... there is more and more continually coming to light.The Bottom Line: An interesting and intelligent spy story... full of twists and unexpected complexity.This review originally appeared on my blog.

I decided to give it a try because I remember as a boy (in the 1960s) that this was THE spy novel to end all spy novels. My thoughts? I was both overwhelmed and underwhelmed.Firstly, the story is about a burned-out British spy coming home after a rough (and somewhat failed) assignment from Berlin (..right after the days of when the wall was built). At least a third of the book is devoted to his subsequent breakdown; the reader now understands that the life of a spy is somewhat less glamourous than that of Mr. 007. Whilst weak and vulnerable, he is approached by East German intelligence officials to see if money can persuade him to divulge information. And then ... the story takes off, with many bumps and twists.I was very impressed with the overall 'cold', depressing feel of this novel. The first half of the novel is very believable, especially our burned out 'hero/spy'. But then Le Carre gets too clever for his own good and spins a story with too many plot twists; it is blown completely out of the realm of realty, and it makes for a confusing read. Other reviewers have called this novel one of Le Carre's easiest to understand. On that note I will not give him a second chance.Bottom line: a moody, brooding cold war novel with an authentic feel. Just don't let Le Carre's over-enthusiastic imagination deter you from enjoying the book."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Great novel, lousy edition.

But the le Carre books have always caught my eye with their mystique and the acclaim that its garnished from reviewers. I was pretty dissapointed. le Carre is certainly a gifted writer and the style of his writing leads to a shrouded, gritty urban atmosphere that lends well to a spy novel. However, the plot was pretty mundane and by halfway through the book it was becoming a real labour to finish and I was well past the point of caring about the outcome. For anyone who is a keen reader of espionage fiction this is probably the book for them. For myself, a novice in the world of spy fiction, I found it mundane and ultimately forgettable."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"There is no question that Le Carre casts a unique plot with this book, and he keeps his spies very much on the human side. He lets us into his characters' thoughts without giving anything away and they are not cartoonish. Although it is complelling, it becomes more of a puzzle and a history lesson about the cold war in the 60s than a genuine work of lasting literary value. Le Carre can write an amazing sentence now and then, but a story so locked into the circumstances of the day it was written in creaks with a bit of rust after 44 years. There are certain scenes and certain turns of phrase that put me off just a dash with their aged presentation, but I am old enough to remember the Berlin Wall and the machinations of both sides of the conflict, and it is a bit nostalgic to remember what things were like in the spy game before computers, satellites and cell phones. Le Carre doesn't put his heroes through the ringer the way his contemporary Alistair MacLean did, but he can write suspensefully, and ultimately this novel satisfies the need for a good yarn, as well as challenging the reader to figure out what's going on before the book's hero does. The anticommunist preachiness that creeps in is also a bit much in light of the time that has passed and what has happened in the meantime, but that goes by fairly quickly. It borders on melodrama without taking that final leap, but some of the dialog suffers all the same. It's a great taste of a bygone era of history, and of writing, and should be read as that. If you're looking for the cutting edge of spy fiction, this book lies at the other end of the scale. Anyone who writes a spy story owes Le Carre a debt for being one of the progenitors, but he didn't quite cross into literature territory the way Maughm did with theAshendon stories."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I tried it, I thought - it was first, it should be best. But I must admit, although it's quite good piece of espionage literature, I've read better LeCarre's. So if you want to try some LeCarre I would recommend to read Russia House instead."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I'd never really read a &quot;spy&quot; novel before this book, but I'd imagined them to be tense, white-knuckle affairs. Strangely, I didn't find that at all in this book, although it is largely hailed as the greatest spy novel ever written. It is much more of a human drama with a lot of sad commentary on the psychological and physical torture some people go through for the sake of their countries. The plot happened rather gradually, with Le Carre never giving you enough information to be sure if you were understanding what was happening in the right light. The plot itself was very convoluted and complex, but most of the twists and turns just shuttled you back and forth between wondering if A was happening or B was happening. By the end of the book you knew that either plot A or B was going to turn out to be the truth, and the book could have conceivably ended a chapter or two early without the final change even necessary. Le Carre's writing style is engaging but economical and the book is a surprisingly quick read. I wouldn't include this on a must-read list, but if you're looking for an easy read, you might try it."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"The book arrived in excellent condition and before the time promised.

Wow, what a compelling read! I didn't know what I was in store for. At first, I thought it started slow, but it increased from there and built till the climactic ending! If you haven't read this book, you should! It is a fantastic spy story. I saw the movie shortly after reading this with Robert Mitchum, who played a wonderful lead in the story. This should be a must for everyone above the age of 15, even if it is just for education purposes but is is exciting as well!"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This is just a great, solid, easy to read and dramatic spy thriller.

Very well written."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I've just started reading again about 4 months ago. I've stayed with fiction and have seen some ups and downs in the books I've read. I confess, I look around here to see what books avid readers recommend, and I compare that with my taste to pick one.So, when I saw John LeCarre's name in another review, I checked out the book titles and found this one. Let me tell you, I'm quite happy I decided to read it!As one reviewer before me put it, this is NOT your typical protagonist. Entertainment (books and novels, for the most part) follows a simple guideline, it seems. Cool protagonist, disliked antagonist, predictable ending. Not this one.Alec Leamas is an aged \\"case worker\\" for the Circus (basically London's spy agency) who's just come up short on his last assignment, and expects to be discarded after his last failure. What he finds is one more voyage into the fray.LeCarre's character development is pretty good, and the sense of feeling he gives the protagonist is genious. As said similarly in the book, the reader is between the carrot and the stick. LeCarre gives moments of shock, panic, and rarely a sense of comfort.To my best guess, this is what it feels like to be a spy. Something rarely found in spy novels these days. A good purchase for someone to add pages of intellect to their library.For another good one, check out Robert Ludlum's \\"Gemini Contenders.\\""},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This is the finest, and from what I can gather, most accurate and detailed fictional account of a spy during the Cold War that is available. For those that dont mind the lack of Clancy-like ( aka unreal) additions of &quot;high profile assasinations&quot; etc, this novel can give you so much pleasure from its masterfull twists and turns, as well as its desire to stay true to reality, and in doing so help the reader understand the period in which it is supposed to take place. The best story I have ever read.

You'll not find a better plot, nor will you find characters more loathesome and lovable. I wish I could give it six stars. 'Nuff said."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"It's a very interesting book an you can't stop reading it. The central figure is Leamas, a secret agent. After he lost all his agents in East Germany he got a new job to do- he became a defector. The reader too can't trust all the persons and till the end you don't know on which side the agents are. When you read a spy story for the first time, it's a bit complicated. I can really recommend this book"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This is the best of the best when it comes to John Le Carre. I am a long time fan of Le Carre and this book is the cream of the crop from his selection.

It's a story about a British spy runner, Alec Leamas, who takes care of all the defectors from the other side of the Berlin Wall but when his agents start getting found out and killed one by one(by the head of the Abteilung, Fiedler) his boss sends him to the other side of the Wall to play a disgraced spy who wants to defect but who's real motive is to cause havoc in the Abteilung! From that moment begins the greatest quest for the truth in spy fiction history! Le Carre is a true master of suspense, take my word for it, you won't even get till the ending! Deserves 5 stars!"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This is a well-crafted story with universal themes:-The necessity and the costs of moral compromise.-The ambiguities that cloud the atmosphere on both sides of our political lines-in-the-sand (even the Berlin Wall).-The manipulation and/or supression of human sentiment by liberal societies and authoritarian regimes alike.-The modern complexities that ultimately overwhelm personal choice.Because of the transcendent themes and the expertise of the narration, this book will be read for many years to come.Time, however, has eroded some of the plot devices which were employed once so perfectly by this redoubtable book.1. The use of the tribunal as a device of discovery now seems quaint and naive, if not actually medieval. Today we see \\"trials\\" as spin contests or campaigns of persuasion based on known sets of evidence. Our trials are dramatic only for the jury; the rest of us already know everything about the case. Unfortunately, LeCarre relies heavily on the tribunal to unfold his plot. Consequently, this thriller resonates today primarily as a courtroom drama plus aftermath.2. The Author's Message of moral skepticism is no longer thrillingly provocative as it must have been for the mass market in 1963. The characters have lost some of their facination as representatives of \\"the way we live\\" and their fates don't hold us in as much suspense as they once must have. The heavy-duty Author's Message passage runs two or three pages and is integrated into one of the most dramatic scenes of the plot.All novels are affected by time and this one, already, seems old. Yet we still admire the novel's ambitions and execution--and yes, discerning readers will enjoy its patina.LeCarre's next book, A Looking Glass War, is more artfully made, I think, so I value it more highly, even if the story is not so gripping. I look forward to reading some of LeCarre's more recent books."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Those who like their spy aristocratic, romantic, brimming with boyish charm, and with ever a clever remark or sexual pun up his Armani sleeve should run--fast--from this book. For le Carre is a realist spy novelist with little interest in how many willing damsels his hero can bag, and less interest in crafting a spy that would be capable of such seduction anyway. But he has written the best novel ever about spies who would not be spies, everyday people except with guns and fancy cars, who are burned out with all of the killing but are tragically too good at it to escape the game. Possibly, it is just the best novel about spies ever, period. Alec Leamas is James Bond without charm, good looks, unflappable bravado, and humor: in short, he is an ordinary man.But The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is no ordinary spy novel."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I just love it easy reading keep you on the edge .

This is useful since the world of spycraft is perplexing enough without our being left entirely to our own devices. The author's afterword also places the writing proces in the context of the author's subsequent rise as a literary giant, relating it to his own future develpment as a writer as well as to his readership's better appreciation of, not just the ideom, but the creative process itself.Stuart DayPARIS"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Le Carre, as many have noted, is still the globe's pre-eminent espionage writer, and Limas is for my money his greatest creation.

The jargon may be completely fictional but it is gripping the same way good fantasy fiction pulls you into the world of Hogwarts, hobbits, etc.I also was moved by the philosophical questions the spy faces: loyalty to what, what is the point of doing good work and toppling regimes. Also the rootlessness and disturbed nature, the search for structure and belonging of the spies was insightful."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I found myself rereading pages just amazed at his spare and direct prose.The story is frustrating and sad. It shows how the use of double agents compromises everyone. It reveals the spy trade deployed to protect us as devious and amoral capable of destroying honest, passionate and well meaning citizens in its effort to protect its agents.The cold war is long over and the Berlin wall is gone. For those of us who came of age in those years, especially those with relatives behind the Iron Curtain the book feels like an icy hand around your heart.A brilliant and chilling book."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Many years ago, I saw the film version of this book, starring Richard Burton. It was fascinating. At the time, I didn't pay attention to the author but ran into his name often in recent years due to my new love of mysteries and espionage fiction. This is not an action driven book, although things do happen. There's little emphasis on &#34;blood and guts&#34; that we encounter contstanly today. What there is is strong characterizations, thoughtful description and exposition, and strong procedurals. This is a Cold War book, Connelly's first, I believe, however, even with the razing of &#34;the Wall&#34; and the breakup of the Soviet Union, I found this book a vivid 'rememberance of things past' as well as a mirror to events today."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Well written and a plot that certainly ranks at the top of this type of book.

Many of his other novels are indeed excellent spy stories (especially Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy), but in my opinion The Spy Who Came In From The Cold actually rises to the level literature. The Cold War is recent history, but this book tells us more about that period than anything else written so far. It is probably also the definitive work on spies and espionage, and will stand the test of time. A great book."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I am a student in year 11 who has read&quot; the spy who came in from the cold&quot;.

For me the films while they gave me pleasure to watch. i found that after reading &quot; the spy who came in from the cold&quot; it showed me a reality that 007 does not touch upon. For example the political issues that are in the book would not be suited to a 007 film. We could not have any smart one liners from james on the comminist regime, now could we. also in 007 films james bond who personers the &quot;spy&quot; gets with so many girls it becomes a joke { in the one film he may end up with 3 -4}.

Our protagonist is not a super-spy working for a secretive agency. There are no fast-cars, no beautiful femme fatales, no explosions, no exotic locations, and definitely no gadgets.But The Spy Who Came in From the Cold is the most realistic and believable spy-thriller ever written.It is a novel so gritty and realistic that one can almost conjure up images of Alec Leamas and Control sitting in a dimly lit room filled with clouds of smoke, filled with paranoia. Talking in hushed voices about Russia and Germany, double-crossings and moles deep in the heart of the Circus.Instead of over-the-top action, SPY has gripping suspense. Instead of chases, SPY has intrigue, drama, double-crossings, countless plot twists, double-agents, national secrets, conspiracies, a complex plot, memorable grey characters, character development, brilliant atmosphere, and brutal, realistic action.John le Carr&eacute;'s brilliant, elegant prose, real-life experience, and excellent atmosphere put him at the top of his genreI recommend it to anyone looking for a spy-story, thriller, or simply an excellent novel!I give The Spy Who Came in From the Cold my STRONGEST RECOMMENDATION!"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"The Spy Who Came in From the ColdI got to know Le Carre only recently through his later novels, which were not quite exciting. The Spy Who Came in from the Cold totally changed things, more interesting than most crime fiction titles. The book helps to revive memories of the past associated with the cold war which held back global development. The unusual introduction by Le Carre himself is great."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Full disclosure: I'm a fan of John LeCarre's books. They are very well written and laden with characters that seem to be chiseled from reality. With that said, the reading experience is a little like watching Bittish teledramas on PBS - usually it takes me a little while to absorb the accent and get confortable with the flow of the piece, but once I'm there, I'm generally hooked on a good story.This is one that, for me, defines the genre and elevates the 'spy novel' to a treatise on the practice of intelligence gathering in practice during the cold war years. Coming in from the cold is a great read of a good, but now somewhat familiar story that connects the reader with not just the character, but with how the character thinks, then turns it all on its head.If you're looking for a good introduction to LeCarre's excellent collection of work, it is a good one. And if you're just looking for a well crafted story that reminds me of some of Conrads work, it will fill a long afternoon and evening with the kind of 'can't put it down' reading that's all to rare lately."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I read this years ago, and it was fun to read it again on my kindle.

It keeps you confussed engough that you want to keep on reading. What I didn't like was that it seemed to forced. The charaters, the side love plot, a lot of the feelings and emotions expressed through the book, just didn't seem like they had to be there. It seemed like LeCarre just thought &quot;it's a spy book, so I HAVE TO have this in it...&quot;.

However, from the middle of the book it just deteriorates into cliches, \\"good British spies against bad communists\\". I wish the author spent time studying East German justice system, to at least get the terminology right.

The characters were either too cynical or had motivations I was unable to sympathize with, like the girl, who was a member of the communist party but in truth just wanted to get a husband. The book was very clear on that, she was as ordinary as it gets. Communists just recited typical communist propaganda, with a touch of nazism once in a while, and were hardly fascinating as the opponents. The ending was unsurprising, because it was obvious that one of two alternatives was true, and it wasn't even possible to admire the cold cleverness of the story.

Leamas is in charge of a West Berlin spy division but all of his agents are being killed by East Germans under the direction of Mundt. He returns to England where a plot is hatched to make it appear as if he is disgraced so that he can seem to defect and implicate Mundt as a British agent. A complication arises when he becomes involved with Liz Gold, a British Communist Party member, but the plot seems to be working.I was so caught up in this story! I kept trying to figure out what would happen next and what the ultimate outcome would be (I was not even close) as the layers of intrigue and betrayal unraveled. The ending was completely unexpected to me and while not what I wanted, entirely fitting with the story. I'm used to the more glamorous pictures of spying such as in James Bond but this is altogether different. It's dirty, often crude, and certainly unglamorous. As presented, there are no clear-cut \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" guys in the Cold War battle as both the British and the East Germans use the same methods and motivations without the guidance of morals.Leamas is painted as largely fed up with the spy game as bloody and cruel; he claims no specific ideology, whether to Communism or capitalism or something else. It's just what he has to do and what has to be done. Liz is a sweet girl, loyal to Leamas, but baffled by spying and the dark side that the public doesn't usually hear about. Mundt is a great villain; he became a Communist because they were the ones in power but as a former Nazi, his main belief seems to be antisemitism. He is cold and ruthless.Overall: An intriguing look at Cold War tensions and spying."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I have chosen to read this book as it is listed by a world distinguished magazine among the best spy novels ever writtenThe plot is a challenge to the reader intelligence since one cannot predict the outcome until the last word on the last page, and that is the essence of a spy novel. Who is outsmarting who ?"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I read Secret Pilgrim a few years ago, and after spending most of my afghan deployment reading Clancy, I decided to shelve him for a bit and return to Le Carre. When I received it in the mail, I was surprised how short it was (the edition I read was only 112 pages), and yet The Spy Who Came In From The Cold hooked me from the very beginning and didn't let go until the very end. The characters are real and believable - ironically I felt the most empathy for Liz Gold and Fiedler...the two main communists. The supposed \\"good guys\\" are son of a bitch bastards (Leamus, Mundt), who I found myself rooting AGAINST until the very end. Even then, they aren't good people. Nature of the game, I guess...Set in Berlin in the early 1960s when the Wall was first constructed, LeCarre paints a beautiful portrait of the turmultous city at the height of the Cold War. The suspense didn't cease from the opening word to the final one. The ending was an ending, not a drawn out epilogue of events. Short, and to the point.In summary: Read this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"The Spy Who Came in From the ColdThis is a jewel in the crown of espionage novels. I fell in love with this book upon its first reading, and have read it many times. No glory here. No other book captures the cold, hard feel of Post War Berlin and the intrigue and duplicity that accommodates the craft. This novel is beautiful in its dreariness, evocative of the desolation and the consciousness of the doomed. After reading this book, you can never pass by the Brandenburg Gate and not think of this novel."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"While I'm still at the beginning of John le Carre's bibliography, I'm still amazed at how he can write a complete novel yet still keep the page count down. It's so different than today's 400 page doorstops that could stand a fair amount of trimming. The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is a tightly woven espionage story from the Cold War days, and le Carre keeps the twists and turns coming at a non-stop pace.The story revolves around a burned out British spymaster, Leamas, who wants to call it quits. But before he does, he's asked to do one more job involving the capture of East Germany's most notorious espionage agent, Mundt. The scene is set to make Leamas look like a washed up spy who is on the outs with his government, and therefore ripe for recruiting. And of course, the other side takes the bait. He's debriefed for much of the basic info, but they want to take him over the border back into East Germany and beyond to find out even more. Things take a bit of a sideway turn when the British government puts an all-points bulletin out for him, and it looks as if Leamas may really need to follow through on what looks like a full defection. But the deeper he gets, the more confused he is as to who is working for who, and whether he ever will be allowed to come in from the cold...The aspect of The Spy Who Came In From The Cold that I enjoyed most was le Carre's way of keeping the reader guessing as to what was actually going on behind the scenes. As with real-life espionage, nothing is ever black and white, and shades of grey are the best you can get. Leamas thinks he has everything under control, but he soon finds that what he signed up for and what is actually happening could well be two different things. le Carre does this all in 212 pages, which is remarkable. I'm looking forward to continuing on with all his other books, as I expect them to follow in the same vein of tight writing and good storytelling."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"To label this book just as a spy book it is a tremendous injustice and oversimplification. \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is manly about our fatalism.I've never read anything to even remotely resemble the style. It takes a few pages to get used, but once you get it, you are immersed. The story has some flaws, but it is extremely intriguing. The characters will stay with me forever. There is no much background about them. We know them through their reactions, ethics and spare thoughts and that's more than enough.Even without the cold war, \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" still makes sense."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I heard this book touted at a writer's conference as the best spy novel ever written--so naturally, being the bookworm I am, I bought it. Three chapters in, I was fascinated, but rediculously confused. But I continued reading, because while I had no idea what was going on, I could tell that it was obviously sleight of hand by the author and not lack of skill.This isn't the most accessible novel or even easy to understand, but it is definitely good, and at times, flat out brilliant as the layers of the plot get thicker and thicker and the intensity ratchets higher and higher. It is also worth mentioning that I would not usually expect a book like this to have the heart that it does--I found simple love story between Leamas and Liz quite beautiful, and the the strong, forceful ideas of the next to last chapter chillingly satisfying."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This is the book that really launched Le Carre's career as a writer. It displays all the qualities that make his work attractive. The subtle presentation of the complicated and surprising plot makes a very unlikely series of events seem natural. The character development is superb with real psychological insight and rigorous attention to detail. The quality of writing is excellent and miles above the usual standard of thrillers. Animating this book and all his best books are concerns with substantial moral issues. Do the ends justify the means? If so, then what amount of betrayal and deception is acceptable? If both sides in conflict like the Cold War employ the same immoral methods, is there a real difference between them? Finally, what are the moral and personal costs of using these methods, even in an apparently good cause? Le Carre posed these questions in the context of stories about the small world of espionage, but they apply equally well to many facets of national policy during the Cold War."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This is probably the best spy novel ever written. The prose is nearly as hard and lean as Hemingway's; the plot is intricate and gripping; the fantasy is austere and very satisfying. This is John LeCarre's third novel, and although his first two feature his continually recurring master spy George Smiley, they were really detective novels (fine in their way). After reading 'The Spy Who Came in from the Cold' you may be frustrated trying to find another John LeCarre as entertaining. I suggest you go straight to 'The Russia House'.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"After 40 years this still remains Le Carre's finest work. This is a lean, taut and gripping book. It, like so much of Le Carre, paints an essentially bleak portrait of the human condition but leaves room for individuals to act nobly and courageously.The book was published in 1962 when the cold war was at its coldest. Alec Leamas, a worldweary but experienced agent on his way down is asked to take on a final mission. In the course of this he discovers the love which has so obviously been missing so far in his life.Of course the characterisations are antiseptic, anaemic even. That helps give the book it's gorgeously bleak feel, and of course Le Carre wants to make the point that the morally relativistic world of espionage is inherently desensitising and dehumanising. The book poses the question \\"Are there any good guys left or have all sunk to the lowest common denominator?\\"To say more about the plot would be to spoil too much. Let's just say as well as the deeper questions it posits, it has a fast-paced, thrilling storyline which may even appeal to lovers of lower grade spy fiction. Buy it! You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"John le Carre keeps his readers spellbound. Though the action is not as fast moving as in modern spy stories, the details of this book are imaginable, in great depth, and therefore it becomes easy to feel what the main character might have been feeling.This is good literature."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"John Le Carre has definitely written a different type of spy book. This is not a book filled with excitement, romance, andheroic adventure. This book, instead, focuses on a divided Berlin during the Cold War. The protagonist, is a burned out, disallusioned British agent by the name of Alec Leamas. The British plan is for Leamas to \\"defect\\" into East Berlin andto provide the enemy with a combination of both accurate and subtlely flawed information that will discredit a key playerin the East German spy network.Leamas is a natural for this deception, not only because ofhis knowledge of espionage, but because his true inherit cynicism towards his career, has made him almost indistinguishable from the character he is pretending to be.Just remember, this book is not escapist, light reading. The main characters are dark, flawed, and generally depressing.The lines between good and evil are not clearly defined. The spy game is portayed as finding a means to and end, regardless......"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Alec Leamas is not an easy man to have affection for, in the beginning, yet as the story builds I could not help but become his advocator. I was reminded of the stoic character of Kurt Russell in the movie Soldiers and that became a good personality model for the character of Leamas. He is a spy. Of course, and a British spy to boot. The year is 1960 and Berlin wall is high and thick. To be called in from the \\"cold\\" is for a field operator (a spy) to be called back to the safety of the Home office. In this case our paladin spends a good more time out than in from the cold. True to de Carr&eacute; the story is complex with seemingly dark corners and dead ends at every turn. Written in 1963 when the Cold War was certainly at it's height there is a disturbing contrast between the value of the individual weighed against the good of the whole with a harsh look at both sides of the Wall. Communism is presented as the enemy, certainly. However about half way through the book it becomes clear that the good old boys back at the Circus in London just may be up to a bit of double crossing, at Leamas' expense. And then there is the young Jewess, a Communist, back in London that he must protect, no matter the cost, to himself or his mission. A most enjoyable read, right up to the very last paragraph.February 2003"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"The Spy who came in from the cold provides an exciting introduction to the finest level of spy novel. Le Carre introduces the burnt out agent, the pragmatic Control, and the all too human George Smiley. The plot provokes, mystifies, and then draws you into the mind of Leamas, who now wants out of his espionage career. The novel contains taut suspense, and a cast of riveting characters.I read the book, I watched the movie, and then I continued reading Le Carre's other novels. The Spy who came in from the Cold, like many other of his novels, probes deep into the mortality of what spy craft is, and the sacrifice of innocence by two opposing forces that are perhaps amoral, and seek only for one small triumph at a time."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"To treat his classic novel purely as a spy novel is to miss the point. It is classic book in the true sense of the word. A book that will endure for a very long time indeed.The work may be rooted in the Cold War and reflective of Le Carre's own experiences but it does not due justice to read the work at such a superficial level. As Leamas states, 'I do not deal in black and whites'. This theme gives the book greater depth than any spurious comparison to James Bond.I thoroughly recommend this book. Read it as a thriller if you must - better to appreciate it as the idea that at some time all of us need at some time to 'come in from the cold'. Even if it is to ask for redemption on our deathbeds. If you find it a little confusing bear with it and I recommend that your next read should be CS Lewis's The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Alec Leamas in one of the most fascinating characters I've ever encountered in my reading. His brutal, uncompromising, frankness in his personal interactions with people makes him an enigma in a profession that requires him to lie for a living. Does he excuse the lies he tells for the government by reminding himself of their practical value? After all, he is a man who respects utilitarian motives. He could forgive a nessesary lie more than her could a cowardly lie, such as the ones that the repugnant Ashe tells. Or, does he excuse the lies by pretending for himself that he's indifferent to the information being lied about? Again and again, throughout the story, he displays contempt for ideology and politics. This is the tale of a man trying to cope with a task that his conscience rebels against. By the end, when he finds that he's been betrayed and lied to himself, these devices begin to fall apart. In one the final passages, he finally opens up and all the excuses that he's been telling himself over the years coming flooding out of him, providing an excellent commentary on the countless rationalizations made during the cold war. Liz, who is present to hear this confession, shakes her head to each of Leamas's excuses. There is no washing his hands of his guilt over the foul mess he's found himself involved in."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This is the classic cold war spy novel.

Worth reading just for the end"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This was a great book. It stripped off the window dressing and supposed glamour of the world of espionage, showing us the unpleasant, seedy and labyrinthine side of a spy's existence. Le Carre gives us a look under a rock by introducing us to Alec Leamas, a boozing, brawling, disgruntled former British intelligence officer and veteran of Cold War Berlin intrigues, who &quot;defects&quot; as part of a painstakingly laid plan to discredit a mole/double agent within East German Intelligence who has been feeding the Brits secrets but also systematically blowing their carefully built-up spy networks in the East. The East Germans believe Leamas and execute the mole. Only then does Leamas learn the truth: the &quot;mole&quot; was innocent, the East Germans were getting suspicious of the actual spy, and Leamas was sent in to save his skin by handing his superiors a sacrificial lamb. The highly-placed agent spying for the British -- who has indeed blown British spy cells but is really a TRIPLE agent that London wants saved for a rainy day, arranges for Leamas and his girlfriend, a bona fide member of the Communist Party of Great Britain delivered into the hands of the East Germans through the secret machinations of MI6 to keep Leamas in line -- to escape back to the West. But unknown to Leamas, yet another secret agreement has occurred. The girl is killed as she and Leamas attempt to get over the Berlin Wall, and Leamas makes a decidedly final act of protest in response to the sordid demands and inherent treachery of his profession. A powerful book."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This might be one of the best spy novels of all time, at its admirers say. I wouldn't know. I haven't ready many spy novels, and this 1963 work was my first exposure to le Carr&eacute;'s writing. I wouldn't mind reading more, though after reading the autho's own 1989 introduction to this novel, I feel somehow warned against it. The Spy Who Came In from the Cold tells the story of Alec Leamas, a British intelligence agent who, after seeing his best East German source shot dead at the Berlin border-crossing checkpoint, becomes part of a plan to frame, discredit, or perhaps even kill Mundt, a high-ranking official in the East German intelligence agency who is held responsible in the West for the death of capture of multiple Western agents, and the general disruption of intelligence gathering. Or at least, that is apparently what is going on, but because this is a novel about the world of espionage, deceit, and secrets, you can never be sure. The book is an effective page-turner, but it is more than that. Le Carr&eacute; has much more depth than, say, a Grisham or similar writer of page-turning, plot-driven novels, and he is a better writer.Though this novel takes place during the Cold War, there is little about ideology, and most of what there is comes off as cynical. Indeed, there is little to distinguish the players on either side of the ideological divide. This is in large part because, as Leamas himself points out, the battle is fought at close quarters, at the scale of the individual, and individuals on either said may be honorable or despicable, cowardly or brave, bought or sold. Part of le Carr&eacute;'s skill is that he effectively portrays the weariness and cynicism of the practice of espionage without suggesting that it should all be tossed out the window. It does make one wonder: even with all the advances in electronic intelligence gathering, can anything really replace good old-fashioned human beings?"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I rate this as a good book, not a great book only because it could have ended better for me.

After reading Ian Fleming's Bond novels (and perhaps I was spoiled by Fleming) I was extremely hopeful for this book, ostensibly the &quot;finest&quot; spy novel ever written.One of the more exciting aspects of the book is when the main character is spirited into East Germany, and meets increasingly interesting and intellectual interrogators. The exciting middle makes up, in part, for the slightly silly beginning and melodramatic conclusion.The main romance was a bit difficult to believe, and the plot was somewhat formulaic, but I suppose it isn't too bad. Anyway, even if I'm the only person in the world who doesn't love it, and my review is entirely offbase, I figure that your slightly diminished expectations will be exceeded even farther by the book, and you will be more delighted because of my lukewarm review. If you do buy this book, I hope you enjoy it more than I did."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Brilliant story of espionage during the Cold War.The second last chapter is the book's only flaw as le Carre uses a conversation between Mundt and Liz to hit the reader over the head with the message that the spies of the East and the West are alike in that they both believe the means justifies the ends. This was unnecessary and a little insulting to the reader's intelligence because le Carre has already made this point with the story itself. However, I'll chalk this up to an author in his youth.All in all, I cannot recommend a better spy story."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"The audiobook, which I purchased, uses the old school craft of radio drama combined with a master spy story. All characters have unique voices with realistic personalities. There are sound effects such as bottles and glasses, doors, cars, the beach and sirens.I don't recommend the audiobook because it the acting wasn't performed nearly as well as the movie, and the print version is also better.The story doesn't glorify anything although it probably is a draw for Cold War history buffs. Those \\"in the game\\" are in it for the game, not ideals. At their professional level, this would make sense. There's really not much glamour depicted about the personal lives of spies.I can see why this story became a popular traditional spy story.

It's a very good novel, with a refreshing economy to it. At just over 200 pages it tells the story of a British spy who agrees to one final mission behind the Iron Curtain before he retires and \`comes in from the cold'. As one might expect of the genre, not everything is as it seems. This is not a novel filled with explosions, high speed chases and witty exchanges. This is espionage of the cerebral variety, where all the players are making moves and anticipating counter-moves at every turn. The spy game is completely convincing and the characters are fully realized, flawed human beings. Le Carre gives us a hero who is pragmatic, tired, and bitter. A far cry from the superficial slickness of James Bond and Hollywood blockbusters.The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is a smart novel with an uncompromisingly brutal ending that will resonate with the reader. This is undeniably a benchmark in the spy fiction genre. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This spy novel has it all: fleshed-out characters, excellent dialogue, wonderful pacing and a plot that's replete with uncertainty. The writer held me on the edge of my seat right to his thrilling finish, after which the characters and intrigues continued to linger in my mind.Through the eyes of Le Carre, a genuine spook, I became struck by the high drama of the Cold War period, including the stakes, the rivalries, and most interesting of all, the ambiguities. I say that despite remembering the late Cold War era because the author portrays the battle of the Soviet Bloc versus the West with a vividness and sensitivity one could never glean from TV broadcasts, newspapers and magazines. Le Carre's a brutal and fearless artist; weaned on a diet of Hollywood cliches where \\"the German\\" is usually cast as stupid, I was refreshed--even shocked--to visit a world where Mundt could be the smartest man in the room and where America's arch enemy just might win.Fantastic read. I thought Le Carre could have tightened up the sequence at the Bayswater Library for Psychic Research, but otherwise there's no fluff here and loads of suspense.My TitlesShadow FieldsSnooker GlenDasha"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This is my first review so you know its gonna be good or bad. I am happy to say that it is one of the best novels I have read all year. John Le Carre created a spy novel that had me captivated by the inner dialogue of the main character alone. A must read."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold has been heralded as one of the greatest spy novels ever. John LeCarre, a British Intelligence agent who served during the Cold War until his identity was given to the Russians by double agent Kim Philby, wrote this timeless classic in 1963. It covers the story of Alec Leamas, as an agent, friend, spy, lover, and killer. Leamas takes on a mission to defeat his nemesis Mundt in East Germany, knowing full well it may be his last. Le Carre wrote his novel as a conduit from which he could communicate his viewpoints on matters dealing with morals, politics, ideology, and world affairs. Le Carre was able to do this without all the blood and gadgets so commonly found in your typical spy novel, and in the process, convey much deeper principles.The novel was a quick and intense read; one that packed quite a punch. The intensity comes not from the blazing guns of a secret agent, but the dialogue, treachery, deception, mind games, and aggression expressed by the many rounded and dynamic characters. Those looking for a bloodbath or risqu&eacute; spy novel will not find it here. LeCarre tells his story with limited exposure to violence and sex, which made the story more raw and realistic. The true catch of the story is the game of cat and mouse; the never-ending cycle of espionage that winds up enveloping the lives of both participants and innocents. The life and nature of spy work is portrayed quite convincingly and one has to wonder how much of it came from LeCarre's own wartime experiences. My father served in the intelligence community, and it's my knowledge of his experiences there that made me impressed with the way LeCarre's novel exposed the moral dilemmas and paradoxes associated with the perilous work of espionage. As a political science major, I found the book was a metaphor for many schools of thought dealing with world politics and human nature.Some would complain that LeCarre's novel is all about people's feelings, is too cold, or does not have enough action packed fight scenes. They are exactly right, and those who say it takes away from the novel are missing the point. This book was written to show the world that spy work is unglamorous, unrewarding, uncertain, immoral, and cold. It serves as a reality check to those who are fascinated by spy work because they see movies like James Bond. It exposes the real world, where there is no definitive good and bad. It makes us question our own actions. Luckily for us, not all literature or film is created for pure entertainment value. Sometimes there is a brain behind the final product.The Spy Who Came In From the Cold conveys the tragedies of war, along with the intensity of forbidden love, revenge, and betrayal. Once you pick up LeCarre's novel you will not be able to put it down. Finally doing so leaves you begging for more."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"John Le Carre's spy novels have thrilled readers for decades, and \\"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold\\" is the novel that kick-started his writing career. A surprisingly short novel, \\"Spy\\" packs in more high-quality twists and turns than most books twice its length.Alec Leamus, Le Carre's protagonist, is a bitter British agent stationed in Cold War Berlin. The Wall has gone up, which both divides the city and makes it a perfect hot-bed for agents of the communist and capitalist powers. At the outset, the communists have the upper hand - they have killed all of Leamus's agents. Leamus returns to England in disgrace and, worse, useless.Or so one would think. But Control, Leamus's boss, sends Leamus back out for one last mission - to bring down Mundt, the communist agent who destroyed Leamus's network.What makes Le Carre's novels so special is how they unfold gradually. This is not James Bond, where M conveniently briefs Bond at the beginning and clearly sets forth who the villain is and what his ambitions are. Much of the action that occurs in \\"Spy\\" occurs for reasons that are only explained later. As a result, Le Carre compels the reader to dig deeper into book, searching for clues and hints, only to have Le Carre reveal purposes and motives at the perfectly appropriate time.Be warned - \\"Spy\\" is a bitter, cynical book. Leamus has been around the block more than a few times, and he knows he is expendable. But even he is shocked and unnerved at the espionage game's ability to chew up and spit out individuals in pursuit of its own ends. Readers seeking happy endings and tidy resolutions will be disappointed, but readers seeking a brilliant, unsettling, shocking spy tale will be thrilled."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is the story of a British Secret Service agent who leaves that organisation and basically defects to East Germany.What he does not realise for a while is that he is actually being manipulated by his former masters as they play a complicated game of espionage with other assets in place in his new home."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Leamas is waiting for an agent. His cover has been blown. Alec Leamas and the agent, Karl, have already had a row over a woman. The white searchlight goes on as Karl is crossing on his bike. Leamas wants operational assignments. He knows now he has been written off. Leamas's counterpart is Mundt. Leamas has been losing agents, Control reminds him. Under him there has been a heavy rate of expenditure, a lot of dead agents. Control believes the Circus should try to get rid of Mundt. Leamas is to ferret out George Smiley. He knows the case well. Within a few months Leamas becomes a resentful drunken wreck. Killing Mundt is to be Leamas's last act; afterwards he can come in from the cold.In terms of quality this is not ordinary popular fiction, this is extraordinary. The author writes in a subdued and steely fashion, powerfully. Subsequently Leamas becomes a defector. Peters is to question him at a location in Holland. Leamas learns he is wanted in London for an offense under the Official Secrets Act. Liz Gold is a friend of Alec. She is visited by Special Branch. There is a connection between Alec Leamas and George Smiley, a card. Peters, a Russian, delivers Leamas to East Germany.Layers of deception, not surprisingly, constitute the story. Journalists and lawyers are inquisitive. Questions become ends in themselves. Leamas is asked about his philosophy. Having completed his first stage as a defector he is to be put on ice.Much of the appeal of mystery stories is psychological description. LeCarre, former member of the secret service and son of a confidence man, is in a premier position to create a full range of psychological types and permutations generated by acts."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This is the first John Le Carre book that I've read, and given The Spy Who's renowned status, I came to it with high expectations. This was especially so, as I had previously enjoyed a number of articles by, and interviews with, David Cornwell/John Le Carre. His insight and turn of phrase was something that I already held in great respect, and I expected this book to be no different. However, whilst his central thesis - \\"a plague on both your houses\\" is compelling and beautifully drawn, I found that overall, it was somewhat bloodless. I wasn't expecting a \\"shaken, not stirred\\" take on Cold War espionage, but, for a book that is essentially character driven, the depictions often seemed more than a little antiseptic. This surprised me, and was completely at odds with the author's ability to convey the essence of his characters, using just a few strokes of the pen. It was just that there seemed to be no follow through. Indeed I often felt that the story was unfolding on a black and white telly, whilst I viewed it through the wrong end of a telescope. So, whilst I would recommend it, I did find it a little dry, and had to push myself a bit to complete it. However, I will go through it again, and will be interested to see how it reads a second time."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Le Carre is probably the best spy storyteller out there; and no doubt \\"The Spy Who Came from the Cold\\" is his finest hour.This is not your typical James Bond fireworks and action packed waste of time. Here we deal with flesh and blood spies with their troubles and tribulations and ultimately with the morals of it all.Le Carre takes us inside the mind of a spy and the ongoing inner battle of what he is supposed to do and what is right to do. It is superbly done; maybe because le Carre was a spy himself.This is a bittersweet book; but a must if you love the spy genre. Just be prepared for a change of pace,"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Le Carre's classic work of spy-thriller literature was first published more than 40 years ago. It harkens back to the day when the Communists were the Bad Guys, the West were the Good Guys, and all's fair in propaganda and war. Although the world has changed a little bit since then, Le Carre's story is still griping and nail-biting, full of spies, double-agents, triple-agents and the like. This book is able to keep hits hold on the reader because his austere plot, centered around the infiltration of Britain's spying-ring inside East Germany and the British spymasters attempt to fight back, is a framework on which Le Carre has developed the psychology of spying. No one is ever quite who they seem, and as the motivations and actions of individuals blur into an ever-shifting moire field, the behavior of the various organizations are even harder to sift out. But that is all part of the fun. As the reader tries to figure out what will happen next, and gets stymied by each subsequent twist, you get more sucked into travails. And the twists keep on happening right to the very end. It is because of this brilliant writing that allows Spy to remain fresh and sharp after all these years."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"John Le Carre's masterful novel, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, has all the elements one could ever want from a great spy story. Le Carre brilliantly combines suspense, mystery, location, romance, and a story line that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last page.Keeping with the tradition of all well-written spy novels, the action of Le Carre's book grabs the reader from the first scene, and doesn't let go. Set in the midst of the Cold War in Germany, the author, a former spy himself, has no shortage of material to work with. He uses it all in creating a brilliant story of a spy who finds himself a part of a complicated plan in a spy war in which all the things he thinks he knows turn out to be lies. As this unwitting pawn in a dangerous game understands just how deeply the untruths he has been told run, the reader constantly finds himself wrongly guessing as to the extent of the circumstances the character is really in.The reader stumbles in this manner until the very end, when the whole thing finally makes sense and an unthinkable conclusion is drawn. Here the brilliance of Le Carre's work realy shines, for the reader discovers he, just as the main character, has been led along a path of powerful deceit for the entire story. For those looking for a great spy novel, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold truly has it all."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I can say from personal experience that John Le Carre's description of early '60s Cold War Berlin is deadly accurate-- from the feel of the cold rain on cobblestone streets to the tension of waiting at a border checkpoint.Many reviewers have used words like &quot;dreary&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;cold&quot;, and &quot;bleak&quot; to describe this novel and they are right. The Soviet Zone of Berlin was all of that and more-- a depressing, grey and colorless prison whose inmates lived in constant fear.In those days, East Berliners were afraid to be seen talking to-- or even looking at--an American soldier. For example, they would look only at my reflection in a glass store window-- afraid of being picked up and questioned by the DDR Staats Polezei. Le Carre captures that depressing climate of fear and imparts it to his reader.The 1965 movie of the same name starring Richard Burton also captures this mood. It is not coincidental that it was filmed in Black &amp; White. This medium reinforces the crushing dreariness of East Berlin in 1962. I consider this espionage &quot;film noire&quot; one of the best ever made.On a different plane, I can also recommend the original movie &quot;Day of the Jackal&quot; (not that dreadful remake!) and the book is even better.I think many readers and even editorial reviewers missed an important point-- Alec Leamas was supposed to start drinking and fighting so that he would be arrested-- that was the set-up to make his disaffection with his &quot;former&quot; agency believable to the Staasi. His descent into bitterness and alcoholism was contrived but, like so much of the story, one does not know how much was a sham and how much underlying truth may have been revealed."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"The two cardinal rules of criticism are: 1) A critic must distinguish what he likes or dislikes personally for subjective reasons and what is objectively good or bad, and 2) a critic must judge works on their own terms.\\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is a spy novel, a story about espionage. It is not concerned with evil-genius super-crooks and science-fiction gadgetry; it is not a cops-and-robbers concoction. You may prefer super-crooks, etc., but as far as your review is concerned, that is neither here nor there.\\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is hard-boiled fiction. You may prefer Agatha Christie to Dashiell Hammett, Fitzgerald to Hemingway; you may prefer \\"colorful\\" characters and settings, but that's you.\\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is not and does not purport to be \\"realistic\\". It is genre-fiction (not \\"literature\\") just realistic enough to draw you into its web. (In his introduction to \\"The Looking-Glass War\\", the author himself makes this point clearly and, one might say, vehemently.) \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is plot-driven, not character-driven. Essentially, in fact, it's a small puzzle for you to work out. (The solution is given.) Only readers who enjoy working out puzzles, readers who like to think, need apply.With the possible exception of \\"The Russia House\\" (which I also heartily recommend), \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is John Le Carre's best spy novel (he has also published detective stories and non-genre fiction), and the best he is likely ever to write. (Ian Fleming's James Bond short stories, by the way, are much better than his James Bond novels, and I recommend these -- the short stories -- too.)"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"If one is to read only one spy story and certainly only one Cold War novel, that story is The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. LeCarre established himself with this one novel as not only a popular writer but also one of the best novelists of the second half of the 20th century.In LeCarre's spy world, secret weapons and glamorous action are not present. The Spy Who Came in From the Cold is full of twists, turns and betrayal. It presents seamy people living seamy lives without ideals, just playing a deadly game to win at all costs. Spying is like a giant chess game in which the players can very quickly become the pieces and become discarded when they have lost their value.The novel features Alec Leamus, a middle aged spy who wants to come in from the cold. That is to say he wants to stop spying. He is persuaded to accept one more mission to discredit the East German who has been catching all his agents.. He must pretend to sink into alcoholism and eventually defect. What follows are the twists, turns and betrayal that are stock LeCarre.The presence of George Smiley is felt throughout much of the novel. The protagonist of Call for the Dead and A Murder of Quality is present in very few scenes although his spectre follows the action. However, he is a Kafkaesque figure. What is Smiley doing? Why is it important? All is ultimately revealed or is it? In subsequent Smiley novels, the reader gets to see Smiley the player. In The Spy Who Came in From the Cold we get to see Smiley from the viewpoint of one of the pieces.The Spy Who Came in From the Cold works on one level as a straight spy story, perhaps the best ever written and there is more depth. The \\"cold\\" referred to is not only a metaphor for the discomfort one feels when one is isolated from home and security it is also a metaphor for the Cold War. Leamus is involved in a nasty, dirty business from which he cannot easily withdraw. Essentially he represents the west, not wanting to engage in the business, not sure why it is involved and who benefits but unable to withdraw.Ultimately, The Spy Who Came in From the Cold answers all the questions but in doing so creates far more unanswered questions. It is a thought-provoking masterpiece and one of the great novels of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"John le Carre gives us a serious and gritty cold war era spy novel with \\"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\\". The main character is an agent in Berlin who is recalled to London after his last contact is killed at the Berlin Wall. What follows is a spy plot that follows the main character through the depths of humanity and intrigue. This novel is so well written that you feel the emotions, paranoia, depression and anxiety of cold war Europe in the 1960s. This is no James Bond novel: no sexy heroine, no fancy casinos and hotels, no witty phrases, no implied sex on a sunny beach. This novel is a hard core look at the spy business that pulls no punches and spares none of the innocent. This truely is the best spy novel ever written."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I picked up this book after seeing a copy of The Constant Gardener, simply because it is supposed to be Le Carre's greatest work. Having read my fair share of Clancy, I started reading expecting gunfights, chases, and high level assassinations. What I discovered was a book that relies on much more subtle tactics for its suspence. But that is what makes it such a masterpiece. Le Carre expertly demonstrates how betrayal and deception can entangle a person's emotions and destroy who they are. He depicts the world in a harsh light, where there is no moral certainty, only a vast array of pieces on a fog covered chess board."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This book starts as your standard cold war spy novel that is vaguely interesting before moving into high gear. When you finally realise what is actually going on in the plot, I assure you that you'll be astounded at the sheer intelligence that LeCarre has communicated in this novel. All is not what it seems and the plot kicks into gear, it is addictive reading. In fact, a second reading is often necessary just to go over and comprehend it completely. All around it is a great story, so great, in fact, that when the novel was first released it was believed that LeCarre was a former government agent! A great book that makes for a fascinating read. I totally recommend it."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"It's impossible to deny the tremendous impact this, Le Carre's breakthrough novel, had on English-reading audiences when it first appeared in 1963. Readers seized upon it because it was one of the first novels to avoid presenting espionage as glamorous: Le Carre's world is of dreary flats, shabby post-War cityscapes, and extreme loneliness (only occasionally offset by furtive middle-aged sexual couplings). The only thing that seems much alive, and presents the whole novel with its engine, are the constant mindgames practiced by the Circus (Le Carre's memorable name for MI6, the British Secret Intelligence for which he used to work) and their counterparts in the East German Stasi. The tired and jaded Alex Leamas, an agent for the former, has to undergo a long con for the Circus to pretend to be a defector to the Communist bloc; the double- and triple-crossing pioneered here have become such a part of the grammar of contemporary espionage novels ever since that it's easy to forget that Le Carre largely pioneered them here. Still, this novel's bleak view of human (and international) relations may take some getting used to today in the post-1989 world. The novel's action is pared down to mostly dialogue, trying for an extreme realism that was (and continues to be) hugely effective but is not terribly imaginatively rewarding. To complain of this spareness would be in some ways to miss Le Carre's very point; even so, it's the kind of book that works best for certain tastes."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"John LeCarre's 1963 novel, \\"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold\\", has had a long life as perhaps the definitive novel of the Cold War. It features a twisting storyline, an unblinking look at the moral ambiguity of the espionage business, and a haunting ending.\\"The Spy\\" is British agent Alec Leamas, recalled to London from Berlin after the loss of a valued agent. There, the ruthless head of the British Secret Service offers him a chance to square accounts with the East Germans, by pretending to defect.To build Leamas the proper bonafides, he is cashiered from the service with an inadequate pension. An alcoholic burn-out case, he is fired from a series of menial jobs, and even falls in love with the young secretary of a London communist cell, before ending up in prison. When he is released, he is approached by the East Germans and persuaded to defect.In East Berlin, Leamas comes face to face with the senior East German intelligence officer he was meant to find. He also discovers that a much deeper game is being played, in which betrayal can have many faces...\\"Spy\\" features several characters who would have recurring roles in later LeCarre novels, most notably George Smiley, Leamas' handler, himself a troubled soldier of the Cold War.\\"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold\\" is very highly recommended to fans of spy fiction, who are likely to find it one of the best in the genre."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"John le Carr&eacute;'s early fiction takes me back to the days when there were clearer distinctions between the good guys and the bad guys. Yet much of the tension of this, his most famous novel published in 1963 before I was born, questions those very distinctions with a tale of a man cruelly used in the service of a fiendishly clever plan.Alex Leamas is a British secret service operative who has just lost his last man behind the Berlin Wall, the Soviet-imposed breeze-block-and-barbed-wire barrier between East and West Berlin. Now he wants revenge against Mundt, the East German counterintelligence chief responsible for their deaths. Which is just what his bosses offer him, under the cover of putting Leamas out in the cold himself and into the hands of the East Germans, where Leamas can then go to work on undoing Mundt.\\"You can't be less ruthless than the opposition simply because your government's policy is benevolent, can you now?\\" the shadowy figure called Control tells Leamas. Leamas senses something off in this, but goes along just because it's rather personal between him and Mundt.Le Carr&eacute; crafts a tightly wound, ever-constricting narrative framework that communicates within it a larger message, that maybe counter the views of both East and West the rights of the individual do sometimes matter more than the perceived safety of the masses. It's a rare book where the author's philosophy actually thickens the plot considerably, as we are made to care about Leamas the pawn more than almost anyone else in the story, including Leamas himself.Bleak but never dull, \\"Spy Who Came In From The Cold\\" is a quick read. Regular le Carr&eacute; readers more familar with his later novels will be surprised by his lack of narrative digression, though many of his later calling cards, such as May-December romances and the sense of rot within Western power structures, are here in full display. Critics sometimes have at le Carr&eacute;'s habit of setting long sequences that consist of people talking to each other in place of action, and that happens here, too, but when le Carr&eacute; is on like he is here, those chat-fests have a way of feeling more deadly than gun battles do in other thrillers.The best involve Leamas and an East German spy named Fiedler. Fiedler is a true believer in the Soviet system and thus sees nothing wrong in killing individuals in service of the State. Does that make him wrong? Leamas believes in nothing, it seems. Does that make him better, or worse? Conversation between them is biting, funny, and ultimately more than a bit heartbreaking.Do I think this is the quintessential spy novel? Well, overall I probably enjoy reading Fleming or Forsyth more than le Carr&eacute;, but when he's this good, there's no one to touch him. It's a novel that makes points that stick with you, while at the same time delivering suspense and excitement in sometimes overpowering doses. Like I say, the two kind of work together, which is why people still consider this a classic even if it is a bit of a relic, too."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"One of the best peices of fiction in the 20th Century.It is a jewel.If you don't understand it, then it may be that you may have missed the history of the \\"cold war\\"."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"What can one say about a novel by a master storyteller that is not laudatory? If you really thought about it it should be required reading by anyone interested in playing the \\"spy\\" game. Le Carre has presented us with a devilishly clever plot line which holds your interest page after page. Le Carre has you in his grip and won't let you go as he makes you wonder where he is leading you and what comes next in this thriller. There is no need to spell out all the details since it is written in a manner which challenges your imagination totally as you get deeper and deeper into this mystery.There is very little of this saga that in uninteresting. The characters, the plot, the interplay, makes one come away with the feeling that all the characters are totally involved in an action which makes this story one of the finest spy stories ever written. This is a page turner which holds you and never lets you down. Viva Le Carre!!E.J. Walden, author of \\"Operation Snow Owl\\""},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This classic became a worldwide bestseller and was turned into a successful movie starring Richard Burton as the British spy Alec Leamas (AL). It also enabled John Le Carr&eacute; (JLC) to say farewell to the British Foreign Office and devote himself full time to writing. First published in 1963, this book has not really aged. JLC's books are about what Americans call HUMINT (human intelligence), with spies living under deep cover, determined to go unnoticed. In contrast to Ian Fleming's creation James Bond, JLC's heroes attach little importance to technology. For them no high living, casinos, amazing gadgets or crazy enemies planning to rule the world or steal the gold from Fort Knox. With one exception (\\"A Murder of Quality\\"), in JLC's novels in the 1960s and 1970s, the Cold War is the backdrop and the Soviets and their satellites, the enemy.AL has been the Circus' West Berlin man for ten years, when his networks in East Germany are destroyed one by one by Mundt, who has quickly risen in East Berlin's intelligence apparatus after killing two of his own agents in London and managing his escape from the UK. AL returns to London empty handed, whereupon he is shelved in the Circus' banking section. This is the beginning of his life spiralling downward, or is he being brought back into play? Where people work with people, mistakes are made. AL meets assistant librarian Liz, who has been a Communist party member since 1954, and decides not to involve her in the legend being created around his person by Control and his staff, amongst whom George Smiley. The Circus is unaware of their affair...Superlative writing, great characters, mounting tension, unexpected turns in the plot and a dramatic and cynical finale. It is a recipe for compulsive reading. JLC's oeuvre is eminently re-readable.

LeCarre is still the best at the spy thriller game."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I just picked this up blindly out of the library...very good book, short read, i finished it in just over six hours of dedicated reading time...I'm actually surprised I'd never heard of the author before, I'll definitely be looking up more books written by him..."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"John Le Carre can put into a 223 page book what some authors today need 600 pages to tell. He is not just a master with the dialogue, but with the mood, setting and gives you a complete rundown of the politics in that small number of pages. There is no need for me to give you a rundown of the storyline; many have done that before me. What I'm here to say is that even after 45 years, this book is still relevant and although some might say it is dated, it gives us an accurate appraisal of the 1960's in Europe - something our current history books can't do.Loving a good spy novel, I began to read Le Carre, starting with \\"Our Game\\" because I bought it at a library book sale. It was just okay at best - very rambling and with no real focus, it seemed. What was I missing? So I read \\"Single and Single\\" because I bought it at a church book sale. It was really bad. This just seemed like drivel from an author that had no idea where the story was going. But I knew that Le Carre was the primo spy writer, but nothing I was reading was showing me any of it. So I didn't panic, but instead read all of the reviews on Le Carre's other books. Then I started at the beginning of his success with \\"The Spy Who...\\" Wow!! Now this is a master spy writer at his best. The characters were intense and their sweat came through to the reader and I was sweating with them. The Cold War seems so long ago, but this book brought it back to me like I was again living it. The historic information of this type of book is long forgotten and our younger, Nintendo/ PlayStation playing, non-readers should pick up this book and see what they may have missed the first time around, but might not during what may be coming next in the world as Russia is making its comeback.I will now go back and read the two earlier works and then progress through the best of the rest. If anyone has started reading Le Carre during the last several books, like me, it would be well worth their time to start here and then begin the series when the master storyteller was in his heyday."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Well if you never read a spy novel like myself then this would be a perfect entry point. First the positives the book was great because it was not so long the book was 224 pages so if you have a couple of hours to kill or on an airplane then this would be a perfect book to read and it was great because it dealt with the cold war era which is pretty interesting stuff.The negative would be is that it is an old book but a good book certain british lingo such as macintosh meaning raincoat is something we americans would not understand but overall it was a great book and the lingo was not too bad that it confused anyone that read it.

The reviews have been from every corner, including my fellow Amazon reviewers, professional reviewers, and other famous authors such as Daphne du Maurier. I decided to begin at the beginning (after reading Absolute Friends) so I read Call from the Dead, and a Murder of Quality. Those books were intriguing and made for decent reads, however, le Carre seems to hit his stride and peak with The Spy Who Came In from the Cold. The book starts out with a steady pace, nothing spectacular, then wham... it builds a head of steam and becomes un-putt-downable (not sure if that's a word, but it applies nonetheless). Alec Leamas makes for a very compelling and complex character. George Smiley takes backstage to Leamas and the spies from the other side. I love the simple nuances of this book, in particular in the description of the need to know the preference between pins or paperclips. I got the impression that this book could stand as a textbook for those entering the field of espionage. A true 5 star read. Highly recommended, in fact, required reading for those interested in the espionage/thriller genre."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"If you think working as a spy means flirting with the receptionist before popping in to see the head of the secret service and then dropping down to the basement to pick up the gadgets you will need for your mission, this book will help give you a reality check.The British need a mole in East Germany so they pretend to fire one of their top agents by faking a problem with alcohol. The former spy gets a job in a bookstore. He works beside a young woman who just happens to be a low-level member of the Socialist party. He befriends her, and while she falls in love with him, he uses her to get inside the apparatus in East Germany. While you read the rest of the story, you get that dirt-in-your teeth feeling, like you might have after a very rough outdoor contact sport. You also find out that a spy agency cannot afford to be compassionate.If you really want to know the sacrifices made by the brave men and women who work for our intelligence agencies, this book will give you a pretty good taste.

La Carre has succeeded in writing an intelligent, thoughtful and creative thriller that is also a real page turner.The introduction by William Boyd is interesting but it will spoil your enjoyment if you read it first.It is amazing that this book was written in 1963 and can still be read with pleasure in 2001 and without seeming anachronistic.It is extremely atmospheric and there are plenty of interesting characters. The central character of Alex Leamas is very well observed, partly an embittered cynic and partly a hopeless romantic.A slight criticism that I have heard is that the plot by the British secret service is too clever and slick and that in reality everything was a lot more amateurish. I am not certain that I really agree with this criticism. I thought that the whole book was very well judged and it certainly seemed pretty true to life."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"No spoilers.Clearly the critical reviews of The Spy... are in the minority on this website and in the literary world altogether, but I have to say that this one didn't completely do it for me. The Spy... is lauded as the definitive spy novel and one that set the standard for the genre, so going into it I had extremely high expectations and could not wait to tear into it. However, after finishing it I have to say that it was not at all what I expected and for that, I'm a little disappointed.Now, I know that one reason this novel is supposed to be so great is that it portrayed the world of espionage in \\"real terms\\" as opposed to the \\"martini, girls, and fast cars\\" lifestyle of James Bond. Given that, I wasn't expecting wild car chases and a protagonist with a seemingly unlimited capacity gun magazine; however, I was expecting some sort of action... anything. This entire novel is people talking, save for the first and the last chapters (known as \\"The Wall chapters\\"). Besides those two chapters, the novel is a lot of talk about past occurrences, so much so that you start hoping something will happen in the now.I'm not saying this is a terrible book by any stretch, as it has clearly withstood the test of time. However, I will say that I respectfully disagree with those willing to give The Spy... the title of best-in-genre. I'd--without hesitation--reserve that distinction for The Day of the Jackal by Forsyth."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold is, without a doubt, the greatest spy-thriller ever written.But it's a spy-thriller such as you have never read before. Our protagonist is not a super-spy working for a secretive agency. There are no fast-cars, no beautiful femme fatales, no explosions, no exotic locations, and definitely no gadgets.But The Spy Who Came in From the Cold is the most realistic and believable spy-thriller ever written.It is a novel so gritty and realistic that one can almost conjure up images of Alec Leamas and Control sitting in a dimly lit room filled with clouds of smoke, filled with paranoia. Talking in hushed voices about Russia and Germany, double-crossings and moles deep in the heart of the Circus.Instead of over-the-top action, SPY has gripping suspense. Instead of chases, SPY has intrigue, drama, double-crossings, countless plot twists, double-agents, national secrets, conspiracies, a complex plot, memorable grey characters, character development, brilliant atmosphere, and brutal, realistic action.John le Carr&eacute;'s brilliant, elegant prose, real-life experience, and excellent atmosphere put him at the top of his genreI recommend it to anyone looking for a spy-story, thriller, or simply an excellent novel!I give The Spy Who Came in From the Cold my STRONGEST RECOMMENDATION!"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Recommended by a Washington Post article, this book does not disappoint.

It is a dark look at the horrible machinations of the KGB and MI6 at the height of the cold war, and the price that a number of foot soldiers in that war paid. This book sets the form that LeCarre will work to perfection until the collapse of the Soviet Union - damaged British agents versus evil communists with a fair amount of innocents on both sides getting taken down in the whole mess. It's a great read, you should check it out."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"JOHN LeCARRE is not just a spy-story narrator, he is a GREAT writer! His prose is tight, imaginative and beautiful. His imagery is majestic. And his grasp of human nature is truly impressive.This book was his first; no matter, most of his writing skills shine to full strength. At the hight of the Cold War, Alec Leamas is a British agent on a seemingly uncontrolled downwards spiral. After loosing one of his sources (shot and killed while crossing the Berlin wall), he is recalled back to London and then he experiences betrayal by every side imaginable. He resorts to drinking, and depressive thoughts, and revisiting the mistakes of his life. But of course the Game is played constantly and one should not trust anyone. Ever. In a world where double-crossings are common and triple-crossings not uncommon, can anyone trust long enough to find love?This book conveyed such an original atmosphere that many suspected JOHN LeCARRE being a former MI6 insider. Those suspicions were latter confirmed (his secret agent status was blown by none other than Kim Philby, the notorious double agent for the KGB). This is definitely THE BEST spy story ever written!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I'm not a seasoned connoisseur of spy fiction, but had the feeling nonetheless upon finishing this book that I was not likely to find many (if any) of its type that I liked as well. The suspense was there, the 'never-certain-what's-what' quality was there, the serpentine plot, etc. But for me perhaps most impressive was the overall atmosphere that permeated the story. I would say a 'dreary realism' -- but in a good sense! The reader is authentically submerged into the gray, secret world of espionage. Nothing glamorized or oversimplified. If anything, it is a tad too morally ambiguous to my mind. Others would disagree. The title of the book fits the contents to perfection.The story builds effectively, and its climax-conclusion comes off as fitting. I enjoyed it, and found it seamlessly written, reflecting considerable knowledge on the part of the author of the shadowy existence about which he writes.For me (I'm a hard grader) it didn't rise quite high enough to attain a 5-star rating, but it's a near-miss. \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is a slick and skillful novel that readers who like this sort of thing are apt to enjoy very much."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This is an excellent, tightly told, spy thriller but let's get one thing out of the way - if you're expecting high tech gadgets, cover to cover action, and chisel-chinned heroes who know kung fu don't bother with this. The main character, Alec Leamas, is a 50 year old guy who drinks too much and wears raincoats, the majority of this slim novel is simply characters talking and the climax takes place in an East German tribunal, not in some underwater fortress. The Spy Who Came In from the Cold is a thinking persons thriller - intricately plotted and written, and will leave you guessing and second guessing everything that is going on. I don't want to say anything about the plot other than Alec Leamas is assigned to act as a double agent in order to take out a high-ranking East German spy. To say anything else would be criminal. The book has it's flaws, notably the narration which is effective and readable but is often a bit too cold and clinical. However, it is well worth reading if you're looking to read a classic spy thriller and if you've never read le Carre. It might not be the best book ever written, but good on the editors of Time Magazine for including this in their All-Time Top 100 Novels. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This book centers on the swan song of retiring, or soon to retire, Alec Leamas. After losing numerous agents to the German counterintelligence, he is asked \`I wondered whether you were tired? Burnt Out?. . . one can't be out in the cold all the time; one has to come in from the cold.\\"And, so we watch the spy come in from the cold, become alcoholic, fail at his post-spying jobs and become an inept member of Britain's civil society. He even punches out a man, and for breaking his jaw he is ordered to spend three months in prison. When released, the \\"other side\\" takes him in - offering him deserving money that his own would never offer.Crossing the line in espionage or covert operations is not like leaving your job for better pay. The people who are behind the scenes masterfully set the ball in motion in this chess game of counter-espionage during the times of the cold war. This was written in the early 1960's - when the Berlin Wall (which is referenced at the beginning and end of the book) represents \\". .. A perfect symbol of the monstrosity of ideology gone mad.\\"This book interestingly applies to today's news. Now our own government stands back after being implored to stop building a similar wall in Baghdad in April of 2007 - are we now like our enemies of that war? Are we becoming ideologically mad?The ability to move the chess pieces ahead of the reader is what makes this mystery so marvelous. Le Carre created a style in this book which has been copied so successfully in the future. Cinema's \\"No Way Out\\" and each \\"Manchurian Candidate\\" prove the public has a great interest in such surprise twists. Television's \\"Man From U.N.C.L.E.\\" and \\"The Avengers\\" each borrowed from Le Carre's formula.Now, that we have read or watched this style on numerous occasions, the novelty of this book is not as pronounced. But, it is the founding father of such literature. And, to that we thank Le Carre. I recommend reading this book which should always be enjoyed and remembered"},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"John Lecarr&eacute; describes a world that seems altogther different from our own, but yet it feels very real.

But I deduct one star, since this brutal and immoral ending, the consequence of actions by many Intelligence operatives, simply reads like one final twist of the plot. For me, the story would have acquired heft had Leamas articulated his moral risks and choice earlier in the novel and then battled the consequences.

It was written by John Le Carre and first published in 1969. The book is a very good but a complicated spy story. It focuses on the espionage back in the 1960s when Berlin was divided into West and East Berlin. The main character of the book is Leamas, a clever English spy. After finishing his job of spying in East Berlin for London, he started to drink and deteriorate. Leamas had done a good job while he was working for London, but when he retired he appeared to have no savings and no income. Being extremely poor, he resented the Organization for which he had been employed. However, one day he met other spies who worked for East Berlin and who took him to a man named Fiendler who was interested in obtaining information that Leamas had. They offered Leamas money and he accepted. The story is an astonishing one. It is mostly about the rough times a man goes through while spying and how he is left out at the end by the Organization he worked for. Trying hard to avoid poverty, he falls into a very dangerous business. The book is good because it has a lot of mystery and suspense. At the same time it is very hard to understand because it has a lot of information that makes your head spin. I don't like the characters that much. I don't agree with the desicions they make, because of their selfishness and greediness. I think that &quot;The Spy Who Came In From The Cold&quot; is a good story. It is full of suspense and adventure. It is the story of a man who had to make a hard decision after being let down by the ones he trusted. It is a story about betrayal, hatred and jealousy. At the same time it can be very confusing because of too much mystery."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Some people may regard this book as a modern classic. It is certainly the book which brought John le Carre to the fore.Before I continue, I'd like to give you a warning. Please skip the Introduction by William Blake, as it will completely wreck the pleasure that you should get from the story as it reveals all, including the ending. You can go back to read the Introduction.I well remember the first time that I read this book. I was about fifteen and I was an officer cadet at a Naval school where we could assemble in the mess hall every Saturday evening to watch a big screen feature film. I saw The Spy who came in from the Cold with Richard Burton was on the \\"Coming Soon\\" list. I borrowed the book from the school library and read it before I watched the film. I enjoyed both immensely, despite the relatively small differences in the story lines.Revisiting the book a few decades on has been equally enjoyable experience. As you would expect, my life since those days has given me a different viewpoint, particularly as I served on the IGB (Inner German Border) during my Army days, and spent a lot of time with members of families who had spent years of forced separation from their close relatives. It was so sad.This book is about the duplicitous games that spies play and how these affect the lives of others. There are lots of descriptions of the plot amongst the hundreds of online reviews, so I am not going to repeat that for you. What I would like to say is that this is a fast-paced story of Cold War espionage which draws you in. Every word and action of every character has to be carefully considered by that person, as any slip could place them in serious danger. That makes the story exciting.This is one of those books which you simply must place on your have-to-read-before-I-die bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"There was a time when we spied on the Soviets, they spied on us and the writers who wrote spy fiction liked it that way. In the height of the Cold War, the Berlin Wall stood as more the a physical barrier. It split a city and two contrasting life styles, each living in well reasoned fear that the opposition was trying to wipe it off the face of the earth. These were simpler times, an easy to be a spy novelist like John le Carre, a master of writing about the craft of spying. Gist for the mill jumped off headlines in major metropolitan dailies and out of Joseph McCarthy inebriated mind.In the hands of a good story teller, a master spy could reasonably navigate his way through Moscow without drawing more attention than a single match stick in a generic and unmarked book.But, these days, trying to have an American go incognito in Damascus would be like try to slip vodka into James Bonds's martini. You are just going to set off some alarm bells. From the spy novel perspective, the new world order doesn't lend itself to the kind of deception we appreciate. la Carre, like many of the old masters, has struggled in this new world. In his newer work, he makes good movie but lame novels.But, it's still a good time to read his early stuff, when spies were spies and the Soviets weren't trying to be like us. His leading man are lumpy and flawed, never to be played by Sean Connery or Clive Owen. Instead, think of Ricky Gervais, if he took a serious turn, or Phillip Seymour Hoffman, though like a good spy he can do anything so it's not really fair to cite him, but you get the picture.In the Spy Who Came in from the Cold, la Carre's breakout novel, the leading figure is old, fatigued and miserable. Alec Leamas spent a life lying to his closest associates, mistrusting the motives of others and wearing a secret face, leaving him alone and in cold comfort as his usefulness as an agent comes to an end. Packed with this emotional wreckage, Leamas accepts one more assignment before he can come in from the cold to finish a career that has ended sourly.It's impossible to do the plot justice without spoiling the novel's conclusion, but there is a reason Time Magazine rated it one of the top novels of all time and Publisher's Weekly called it the greatest spy novel ever. As with many great novels, sometimes a great plot and strong story telling can obscure a deeper message. So it is with The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. la Carre has a lot say about the morality of spying, why we do it, who it benefits and who it hurts. His characters, presented as archetypes, are fully fleshed with quirks and humanity. There are no cardboard cutouts here. No short cuts in character development. Yet, in each character we see more than a person, we see a class of people, or should see it anyway and the whole package paints an ugly picture.The Cold War is gone. We won that one without firing a shot, through as a result we have the greatest and most expensive military in the world. The military, like la Carre's early spy novels, may be bit dated, built for a world left behind and unmissed, but that does not mean that we can't admire the majesty and the power."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Can a book be interesting but kind of dull at the same time? Yes, although I don't think this particular combination happens often in writing. I read \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" when it was first published, and what I remember liking about it was what I felt was its verisimilitude -- the appearance of being real or true. Before he wrote this book, the author had been a member of the British Secret Service, so he wrote as a former spy about spies and spying. The boredom, the uncertainty, the duplicity, the depression, the immorality -- these things all come out in the book. When you read this book, you can feel what the spies feel. In all these senses, the book is interesting.What makes the book dull is that, although it's not even 300 pages long, it reads like a 600-page book. Slow. Tedious. Long paragraphs. Little white space. Little action. A lot DOES happen in this novel: it just doesn't FEEL as if it's happening. It may be unfair of me to criticize the dullness of the story, because the author may very well have intended to show that this is what the life of a spy is like (this, not the James Bond action). Still, a writer must take readers into consideration and try to get the tedium across without being tedious.But, if you're interested in spy novels, read this one. It is to spy novels what Joseph Wambaugh's \\"The New Centurions\\" is to cop novels -- written by a practitioner of the trade, telling things like they are."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This isn't exactly a Jason Bourne type story, but it is everything I wanted from a spy novel. \\"The Spy who Came In From the Cold\\" leaves you thinking about the story, the ideologies and the characters long after the novel is finished; all things that define a great book from a good one. I don't want to give anything away, but everything that happens in this book, right on from page one, is 100% important to the progression of the story. This book is cerebral, yet easy to comprehend, especially once everything comes together at the end - how blind I was to what was going on! The way I felt after reading this... I doubt I could ever begin describe, but it is both wonderful and chilling at the same time."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"An absolutely terrific novel. Amazingly well written. That the author could write such a complex and entertaining story in just over 200 pages is a tribute to his great talent. There are virtually no wasted words and the story unfolds quickly and dramatically. The pace is lightning fast, the plot is very clever, and the ending is dramatic. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"I devoured this book in three days. There's almost no action--not what you'd expect for a spy story--and heaps of complex dialogue, and I couldn't put it down....I sought outThe Spy Who Came in From the Coldbecause it was recommended inBook Lust to Go: Recommended Reading for Travelers, Vagabonds, and Dreamersas a good book to read for Germany (current interest), as parts are set in Berlin during the Cold War. Then I saw that the master storyteller Graham Greene had blurbed it as \\"the best spy story I have ever read\\" so then I knew I had to read it. And it really is excellent. Just don't expect it to be any sort of James Bond thriller; this is the polar opposite.Alec Leamas is a life-long secret agent for England working in West Berlin against the Soviets (mostly in East Berlin). He's quite experienced though not very brilliant, seen a lot of agents on both sides rise and fall with rather bad luck for his men recently, and then is called to London for a little chat with his superior about his future. That's not much of an intro, but I won't spoil the story by revealing further any of the subsequent plot (and plot twists). Beginning and ending with the Berlin Wall, the book transcends the spy novel genre and the Cold War setting to become an exploration of the power and futility of individuals within and against ideologies and organizations (as contradictory as that sounds). Sure, it's cynical and gray and depressing, but that doesn't mean you won't be glad you read it.I'm headed to the library to get the movie version now..."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"This classic tale of espionage during the Cold War certainly lived up to its billing. Le Carre paints a vivid picture of Cold War Europe and the various operatives doing their best to usher forward the \\"end of history\\" and those opposed to the march of communism. The book examines the moral trade-offs and ambiguities of the spy business as well as the complexities of signaling and communication in a world where everyone has an incentive to lie and no one can be trusted. All in all, a thrilling story."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"The spy games portrayed in this book are not like James Bond. There are no card games or cocktail parties, and no novel weapons and fancy gadgets. Instead, there are intelligent people playing mind games with each other, each only knowing a part of the whole story.The common theme throughout this book is that in the world of espionage, the ends justify the means. That ideals are an unnecessary burden that must be discarded in order to succeed. This message has just as much relevance today as it did when it was written; it's an interesting exercise to imagine this taking place with modern day terrorists rather than East Germans.Overall, if you are looking for pulse-pounding action, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a fast, gripping read that makes you think, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"Being a child of the late 1980's, I entered the world way after the setting (and writing) of this book. For whatever reason, though, the 60's spy scene fascinates me and I really enjoyed reading this book as my first foray into the period and genre. Le Carre seemed to reach right into my mind and create an atmosphere, and on more than one occassion his outline of a setting allowed me to imagine a vivid and detailed scene. While I wish I had started the series at the chronological beginning, each of the characters were quickly brought to life and became distinct players in the story. I found myself confused once or twice as the story meandered through the twists and turns of a spy ring, but I know that's exactly what Le Carre wrote for. Excellent book, and one that can be read in a single sitting."},{"Title":"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold","review":"\\"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,\\" (1963) was the third book by British author John LeCarre,the pen name of Englishman David Cornwell, a prolific, much-honored, best-selling author of spy novels. During the 1950s and early 1960s, he had worked for the British Secret Services: MI5 , which deals with domestic British matters; and MI6, which deals with international espionage. He then began writing under the pseudonym \\"John LeCarr&eacute;,\\" (French for \\"John the Square\\") as employees of those agencies were not permitted to publish books about their employment. \\"Spy,\\" was an international best-seller that enabled him to quit his day job; it remains his best known work to date, and he has said that \\"The Spy,\\" is his favorite among his works. He's also well-known forTinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy; andSmiley's People.Throughout his early career, the author was mentored by Graham Greene, another Englishman of long life and long writing career, who was also able to call upon his personal experience of the espionage trade in writing his many successful spy novels. But Greene was also great friends with the notorious Kim Philby, a double agent, and defend him throughout their lives. Greene, in fact, is often quoted as having once said that if ever he had to choose between his country and his friend, he hoped he would have the courage to choose his friend. Philby was a high-ranking member of British intelligence who was a spy for, and later defected to, the Soviet Union. And, before his 1963 exposure and defection, Philby had exposed LeCarre, who was then, as Cornwell, stationed in Bonn, behind the Berlin Wall/Iron Curtain. LeCarre was able to get out in time, but it was a close call; and his career in the field was over. He was lucky that \\"The Spy,\\" took off just then.The book gives us an encyclopedic look at the wintry U.K. at the time, and the freezing, divided Germany. The divided city of Berlin, which the author has called a spy's paradise, and its infamous, menacing wall, separating west from east, that's virtually the star of the book. \\"Spy\\" concerns Alec Leamas , returned to London and MI6, the Secret Service, after failing in his last German mission. Control offers him a desk job, but Leamas prefers to go back into the field. So Leamas must first seem to sink into alcoholism, violence and debauchery and get himself in trouble with the law. And, after his short jail sentence, he takes a job from the Labour Board, given him by a civil servant he seems to recognize from the spy biz, in an odd little backwater library. There he meets and hooks up with Nan Perry, assistant librarian, a nave Communist camp follower. He's done all this in an effort to attract the attention of the opposite side, and that he does. He's soon back in Germany; his actual, secret mission, to protect an --unknown to him --British counterspy. And, somehow, Nan is also there. LeCarre's most famous character creation, George Smiley, who had appeared in the writer's two earliest books as a detective of sorts, finally appears in \\"Spy\\" as a high-ranking officer of MI6.The book that runs a swift and vivid 250 pages, is an accurate snapshot of a particularly significant place at a particularly portentious time, and, though it's surely a downer, is likely to stand quite a while yet. It's already outlived that hated, menacing Berlin Wall.Throughout LeCarre's long career, his grounding in the actual day to day business of spying has been one of his greatest strengths, but he is also an excellent, terse and witty writer, skilled in plotting, writing narrative, description, and dialog. He has the knack, which you can see in \\"The Spy,\\" of being able to both open and close his narratives with riveting set pieces. In this book, the writer opens with his protagonist Leamas anxiously awaiting the crossing by an agent of his of the Berlin Wall; he closes with Leamas himself trying to cross the (now, mercifully, long-gone) wall. Mind you, the writer has often worked in the German-speaking world, and has set many of his books there: he is evidently comfortable with the language.The spy novels of John LeCarr&eacute; are an unglamorous response to the James Bond thriller genre established by Ian Fleming in the mid nineteen-fifties. LeCarre's cold war work shows men who are not heroic,who know the amorality of their work. They have few grand action thriller moments, few sexy gadgets, and practice only the violence necessary to move the plot -- the dramatic conflicts are character driven. LeCarre's characters lack the moral certainty of Fleming's British Secret Service adventurers; his spy stories are morally complex. They show the reader the weaknesses of the Western democracies and the secret services protecting them, and often imply the moral equivalence of east and west. \\"New Yorker\\" writer Malcolm Gladwell has written that he rereads \\"The Spy\\" every three years, and discovers new riches within. \\"The Spy,\\" written while LeCarre was actually in residence in then-contemporary Germany, went far in establishing him as the greatest literary spymeister of the age. It may be time for you, too, to reread this book."},{"Title":"Laura Ashley Style","review":"This book looks old fashioned, to-day. Even if pictures and Laura Ashley own house are great, the pedagogical approach looks a bit &quot;outdated&quot;."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Typical of 1930's Hemingway, To Have and Have Not is a frustrating novel, equal parts exhilaration and disappointment. The main story involves the tragic life of Harry Morgan who shuttles back and forth between Key West, Florida and Havana, Cuba, taking odd-jobs so that he can support his family. No job is too dirty or too dangerous for Harry, and he quickly gets caught up in smuggling, kidnapping, and anything else that will make him decent money. Harry's sections of the novel are violent and grim, full of double-crosses and bloody shoot-outs. It may be a little bit shallow for Hemingway's talent, but all the action and adventure make for a fascinating read. Rounding out the story of Harry's exploits is the beautifully drawn character of Marie Morgan, his devoted wife. Nowhere else in Hemingway's fiction will you find a female character so lovingly rendered.Unfortunately, this rousing tale gets derailed about halfway through the novel by an abstract social commentary artlessly forced into the text. Describing the lives of a number of well-off residents and visitors of Key West, Hemingway spends several interminable chapters contrasting the ennui and shenanigans of the wealthy yacht-owners and writers with the down-to-earth goodness of characters like Harry Morgan. Hemingway pokes fun at the sexual intrigues and pointless drama of the wealthy, while glorifying the ernestness and devotion of the Morgans and their peers. It is a simple and banal observation, completely overblown and out of place, and it almost ruins the entire novel.But the book concludes with Marie's painful inner monologue, written in Faulknerian stream-of-consciousness, and a tender description of the boats and the water around the Keys, causing the reader to forget all that drivel that has passed before and reflect on the beauty and danger of the world that Hemingway has created.To Have and Have Not would have been stunning as a novella about Harry Morgan with maybe a few minor asides about the idiocy of the wealthy (which Hemingway shows perfectly in an early incident where Harry tries to teach a clueless vacationer how to fish). Or it might even have worked as a long novel (around the size of For Whom the Bell Tolls), exploring the climates of Key West and Havana in vast detail. But as it stands, the novel Hemingway wrote is too disjointed and confused to qualify as a classic (though still worth reading for fans of the author)."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Although I think it is one of his worst books (along with \\"Across the River and into the Trees\\"), it is still a good book. But I think you have to be comfortable with Hemingway's style before you can appreciate it properly. I would recommend \\"The Sun also Rises\\" or \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" if you haven't read his stuff before. \\"To Have and Have Not\\" seems a bit unpolished at times but I would recommend it to any Hemingway fan."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"This is a book that you can dislike or even hate at one period of your life, love in another. It is a book that may be called either inherently flawed or grandly experimental. Hemingway himself came to dislike it, and one wonders if he ever considered it very worthy. But decades after it was published, it keeps oddly getting back on its feet like its spooky anti-hero Harry Morgan, finding a public, and claiming a life and hard-fought little space of its own.These are really 3 long stories, rather violently jammed together, without even unity of narrative voice. Its manner of telling is thus as jarring as its distrurbing story which puts an amoral killer at the center, not without admirable brute animal characteristics. Gulf coast rum-runner Harry is essentially a vehicle for Hemingway to lay the violent side of life in the great depression era bare to the bone. Its dreamy boozed out delirium at times works like a drug, quite convincingly recreating its 1930s dockside setting and people in all their awful glory. If erratic in it its conception as a book, the devil is in the details. Hemingway was still relatively young and strong and packed a lot of wallup. The book actually reminds one a lot of Soviet realism, but without the preposterous commie propaganda about the glory of the people tagged on. Here, no excuses are either given or asked for.In short sum, it's a slice of life, and its artistic hat trick is an apparent and almost intentional artlessness. For Hemingway afficionados it is indispensible; others may bypass it, though in doing so they will unfortunately miss a bitter piece of Americana not really adequately available elsewhere. Next to Harry Morgan's world, the depravity witnessed by Huck Finn going down the big river looks like a choir boy's tale."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Widely accepted as Hemingway's worst novel (stated by Hemingway himself), this novel still makes other authors' best works pale in comparison. Harry Morgan is one of the most intriguing characters Hemingway has come up with.I disagree quite a bit with a previous reviewer who characterizes Harry as a cold, abrasive, and uncaring person even for his family. I think what Hemingway is successfully conveying with Harry's character is the hardships of the times. Harry is an ex-cop, a position that generally holds some moral and ethical standing, turned fisherman turned rum/illegal alien/bandit runner. Harry is driven by his paternal and machismo inclination to provide for his family. He murders for his beloved Marie and his three daughters - not because he is particularly murderous or is greedy with an acute thirst for money. The final chapter about Marie encapsulates the beauty of the Morgans' life. They had everything, regardless of material wealth because Harry always provided for his family. Juxtapose this life with the lives described in 2 or 3 chapters before the end of the extremely wealthy people who own the yachts and we can see exactly what the title of this book means. Some people have, and some people have not. The rich people whose lives are closely examined in this novel are miserable. And though Harry loses an arm and eventually more than that he still is the one who Has in the theme \\"To Have and Have Not.\\"This novel, though somewhat disjointed and difficult to organize in your mind, is a beautiful criticism of what many people think is the key to happiness: abundance of wealth. Thinking back, the disjointedness is what makes this novel so beautiful and sensical. The chapter examining all the different characters in their yachts is one of the most intelligent and wonderful criticisms of the upper class I have ever read, anywhere. You will not be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"I read this because I liked the Bogart movie. The movie used the very beginning of the book then goes on to follow a completely different story line. The book is darker and more violent than the &quot;feel-good&quot; themed movie. The novel centers around Harry Morgan, a charter boat captain who does some bad things to make ends meet in 1930's Cuba and Key West. It appears that the book may have started out as a short story that was fleshed out into a novel-length work. The copyright page indicates publication in a magazine in 1934, three years before the book's publication date. This may explain the confusing change in narrators that other reviewers have mentioned. It also seems to me that the have versus have-not theme has been tacked on to contrast the lives of rich holiday-makers in Key West to the lives of struggling Key West natives. The parts dealing with the wealthy aren't particulary interesting or believable. I suspect they were added to give a simple action story more social consciousness. This fault is more than made up for by the scenes with Harry Morgan. He is a tough man of action who wont stop at killing if necessary. It makes for an exciting read; I read it through in one night. I must diasagree with those critics that feel this novel is one of Hemingway's worst."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Depending on whether you count The Torrents of Spring or The Old Man and the Sea, Ernest Hemingway published five, six, or seven novels. I suppose one of them had to be the worst. To Have and Have Not was Hemingway's choice. Given the excellence of all his novels, that corresponds approximately to noting that Beethoven's second Rasumovsky quartet is the worst of the three in the set.This is a truly great novel, spare and economical, packing the most thought, action, and meaning into the fewest words and revealing the inner lives of Harry Morgan and other residents of Key West, from the dregs of society to its affluent froth. I've read it twice, and the second reading has impressed me even more than the first."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"I was inspired to read my first Hemingway novel by my upcoming trip to Key West, FL. Since the Hemingway House is on the &quot;must-see&quot; list for Key West tourists, I thought I should familiarize myself with the work of this renowned author. &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; particularly caught my eye when I saw that it is the story of Harry Morgan, a man who is forced by economic circumstances and family obligations into smuggling contraband between Key West and Cuba. I wasn't disappointed!This is an amazing story about a many who does what is necessary for the well-being of his family. SURVIVAL is a main theme throughout this novel - Harry Morgan does what is necessary for his family's survival; Marie Morgan also learns to survive when she loses her lover and provider. There is also a vivid contrast made between the &quot;Haves&quot; and &quot;Have Nots&quot; when Hemingway discusses how the wealthy yachtsmen are unable to overcome their petty financial troubles while the struggling and often impoverished Conchs of Key West seem to endure against all odds.Reading this story has whet my appetite for more Hemingway and I am looking forward to spending time with some of his six-toed cats in Key West :-)!"},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"This is the first book I have read where I think my age impacts my ability to appreciate it's depth. I read it when I was 23 and immediately could not relate to the main character at all, on any level. Being a huge fan of Hemingway's writing otherwise, this will be a book I look forward to coming back to in twenty years or so. I'm glad for that, because somedays I worry that I'll read all his books too fast and be left with nothing of his to read for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Well, if you are expecting a parallel to the Bogart movie, you are looking in the wrong place. This book is an examination of the human character, and how the human spirit can become warped in extreme circumstances. At once a commentary and a warning, I found the harshness of the story a contrast to blind optimism. Worth the read."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Considered by most literary critics to be one of his weaker novels, including 'To Have and Have Not' director Howard Hawkes who once bet Hemingway that he could make a good film from what he considered one of Hemingways worst books which he did starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. While the film adaptation of Hemingways' novel was a critical and box office success, it was anything but true to the actual novel and many liberties were taken in creating the final product; a rah-rah patriotic WWII flick starring the greatest actor in Hollywood. So, make sure that you differentiate between Hemingway and Hollywood when it comes to 'To Have and Have Not' at least in this case(His other novels were better adapted to film, most notably 'For Whom The Bell Tolls' and 'A Farewell To Arms.). The novel my not be Hemingways greatest work, but it is still a very entertaining story nevertheless. Written during his years in Key West, this like all of Hemingway's work draws on his own real life experiences which was transformed into the story of Harry Morgan a man who after falling on hard times is forced to be a rumrunner between Cuba and the Keys. In the movie Harry Morgan hunts Nazi U-boats, while not in the book Hemingway himself actually did do this aboard his boat Pilar while living in Cuba during WWII. A great and entertaining short novel that is classic Hemingway all the way."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"I've always been a fan of Hemingway's The Sun also Rises and a Farewell to Arms. I wanted to read another of his books, and since I loved the Bogart and Bacall movie I purchased this despite the typical literary review that calls To Have and Have Not his worst novel. This book is great!! It's gritty, realistic, and the characters are consistent in their characterizations and actions throughout. The bar dialogue, Harry's actions as he delves into crime, they're all dead on. The plot-line really comes together with the juxtaposition of the rich and the poor (I dare you to not be disgusted by the &quot;vital&quot; concerns of the wealthy in the last few chapters). Hemingway's depiction of Harry's suffering wife is perhaps the *ONLY* completely believable female representation I have *EVER* read. This book is macho, poignantly sad, exciting, and full of heart wrenching loneliness throughout."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"To Have And Have Not is too fragmentary to be Hemingway's best novel. It's divided into three episodes, which I think were written at completely different times, so Hemingway's objectives might have changed halfway through. The first episode was meant to stand on its own merits as a short story, but Hemingway liked it so much he came back to it later and added two more. That said, it's certainly a fine novel - gripping, moving and very well-written at every step of the way. It revolves around Harry Morgan, an honest man turned into a smuggler by necessity. In the context of the whole novel, the first episode serves mainly to establish his person and show what sort of man he is - his reluctance to get into illegal activities, his strength, his survival instinct and the cruelty that it sometimes results in, and his human qualities. This reads like a self-contained short story with no real point other than an action-filled scenario. The second and shortest episode is the weakest part of the novel - it's a cross-section of a day in Morgan's life after he already takes up smuggling. It certainly shows the risks he has to take, but doesn't serve to do much other than explain a certain point in the third episode.The third episode, where the real meat of the story is, is the best. It shows the further developments and the conclusion of Morgan's criminal career. It is also where the book's title comes in - here we see the contrast between those who have and those who have not. This comparison makes it easier to understand by contrast just how inevitably Morgan was driven to the life he now leads. Though Hemingway could have treated this issue by simply depicting the rich people as bad and Harry as good, he instead develops the story with tremendous emotional complexity - in a chapter dedicated to the former, Hemingway gets inside the heads of many well-off Americans and shows you their thoughts and fears. You might end up sympathizing with them more than with Harry, even though their glaring weaknesses are relentlessly brought to light. They are shown to be just as much victims of circumstances as Harry Morgan - while this does not exonerate them of their foibles, just like it doesn't exonerate him of his crimes, it makes all of them easier to understand. Nor does Hemingway paint the Marxist rebels that Morgan agrees to transport to Cuba in black and white - some are ruthless mercenaries, but some genuinely seek to make the world better, and others are just there by chance. The tragedy of the book is that all these people, who with a few exceptions really weren't bad sorts, were driven by much more powerful forces against one another, and all ended badly. Here we have Harry Morgan, a strong and intelligent man who really didn't want anything other than to have enough to subsist for him and his family, and he ends up hopelessly alone up against both the law and the lawless. His last monologue, where he ruefully summarizes his life, is one of Hemingway's finest moments.Here I must add, as an afternote, that this book conclusively proves that those people who like to claim that Hemingway's treatment of women is somehow \\"sexist\\" or \\"disrespectful,\\" or that his female characters are \\"stereotypical\\" or \\"weak,\\" have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. Harry Morgan's wife doesn't have a large role in the book, but there is one crucial scene that revolves solely around her. In it, she shows titanical inner strength; she is possibly the strongest character in the novel, stronger than Harry. Yes, her role in life is \\"stereotypical,\\" but that is due to the _realism_ of the story - in those days, in those parts of the world, that was the way things were, and that's that. It is undeniable that Hemingway treats her with great respect, admiration and fairness. Thank you very much."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Rough. Hard. Dirty. Physical. Tough. And also lyrical, simple, emotional, indelible. All characteristics of Hemingway's writing, all present in this book. A simple story of Harry Morgan, sometime fisherman forced into smuggling and illegal immigration just to feed his family, a man who spirals down the slippery road of 'the end justifying the means' till there is nothing left but survive at any cost.The story is told as three separate time-segments in Harry's life, which forces a certain disjointedness to the tale. But it also allows Hemingway to illuminate Harry's story with different segments of the Cuban and Key West societies at different times with changing social conditions. There are many character vignettes, people captured sometimes in only a few paragraphs, people who are desperate, silly, egotistical, idealistic, cynical, worn-out, greedy, dissolute, resigned, driven, and just coping. Albert, a man doing relief work for less than subsistence wages, is one of the clearest and most poignant images, hiring on as mate to Henry even though he knows the voyage is supremely dangerous. Within this short portrait of this man, we see not only the extremes that desperation will drive a man to, but also Hemingway's commentary on social/political organizations and economic structures that give rise to such desperation. This was quite typical of Hemingway, as he never beat his reader's over the head with his political philosophy, but showed the underpinnings of his reasoning through the circumstances of his characters.Throughout this work, there is the sense that there is more here than what the words on the page delineate, a theme of people from all walks of life and all economic circumstances who are caught in the implacability of fate. All of these people have their own dreams, their own methods of dealing with the vagaries of life, and each is limned by the ultimate depression of life limited to only a short span.Morgan's wife, though relegated to only a small part on these pages, shines through as one of the most engaging and durable people here, supportive of her husband's dreams, willing to forgo anything more than minimal material wealth, able to put aside her husband's foibles, and having the inner strength to continue when all her world collapses around her. The contrast between her and many of the other characters here is striking, a fine illustration of what really comprises the 'haves' and the 'have nots'.This book is not as powerful as For Whom the Bell Tolls, mainly due to its fragmented story structure and lack of any clear objective for its main characters, but is still a fine book with many nuances hiding within its simple story. This is not a book for those who like happy, uplifting stories, but it does much to illuminate both the best and the worst of humanity's fight with the curse of living and the insurmountable wall of dying.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Masterworks like For Whom The Bell Tolls and The Sun Also Rises overshadow To Have And Have Not, but you should not overlook it. The novel is mainly about Harry Morgan, a depression-era fishing boat captain who has run out of luck. The book also has several of the trademark Hemingway stories within the story. Rather than a novel, I like to think of this as a bunch of short stories held together by one greater theme. When your reading, you feel as though Hemingway has let you in on a secret, and he is showing you his private world of Key West and Havana in the 1930's. I also believe that this book is the link between his early success from The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To Arms to his later triumphs of For Whom The Bell Tolls and The Old Man And The Sea. Because of its high action and the constant sense of adventure, I would recommend this quick read to the first time Hemingway reader. This book is the perfect primer for For Whom The Bell Tolls. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because of Hemingways other great works. Had another author written this, it would be a better known book for sure. Excellant book and a must read!"},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Hemingway once said &quot;A man can be destroyed, but not defeated... a man can be defeated, but not destroyed&quot;To Have and Have not is primarily a story about the destruction of a man... one of the 'have nots' (the conchs) of Key West. The central character, Harry Morgan, constantly struggles throughout the book defying the law, even killing those who stand in his way just trying to make a living. Hemingway peels back the skin of this entire society and shows the reader what lies beneath. This is the classic Hemingway tale of the central character encountering malevolent circumstances and fighting them one by one to the bitter end. I love this book! I wish the movie version had actually been about this book, instead of what it turned out to be. A &quot;Howard Hawks&quot; film with an &quot;Ernest Hemingway&quot; title.Maybe the critics don't consider this to be his finest novel... but I've read most of his work now and I think its the best one in the bunch."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"I understand this book was written as a contractual necessity, and it feels cobbled together by Hemingway. The first two portions seem straightforward, and qualify as good short stories about Harry Morgan, a down-at-heels boat-owner in the Florida Keys. The third seems destined to follow along a similar path, and then Hemingway throws in everything but the kitchen sink (like the cliche? It belongs in this section of the book) as Harry becomes a minor character in a hackneyed social-realist critique of just about EVERYHTING: communism, capitalism, alcoholism, any ism you can think of. New characters are introduced and forgotten every few pages. Hemingway cleaned out his junk drawer and stuck it here.So: completists please read. Otherwise, stick with Hemingway's short stories. Or better yet, read some Hammett."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"This is an excellent Hemingway! Action packed from the opening, it is a real adventure story, filled with fight, fury and fishing.Harry Morgan is led into a desperate situation by a customer who doesn't pay up after a long fishing expidition in Harrys boat. This results in Harrys involvement in the smuggling trade between Cuba and the Florida Keys. He transforms into a uncaring, brusque and to-the-point man who only wants to reap the monetary benefits to support his wife and daughters.As the story unfolds, we witness Harrys involvment in various smuggles that lead to him losing an arm and to his eventual demise. Along the way we are introduced to a series of characters; some involved with Harry and some not, delving briefly into their personal stories, angsts and relashionships.The way the book was written was reflective of the times, where lower class races were called derogatory names and performed menial, servantry tasks. Hemingways usual use of descriptively simple language paints glorious pictures of the events that transpire. A great chapter is the one involving the vets getting drunk and fighting in the local bar. It depicts a manic scene of uncertainty for any fellow in the bar willing to pick a fight. Hemingways brilliance comes through further as he takes an aside from the main story (the main character returning home) to focus on the lives and situations of the people aboard the fancy yachts moored to the local pier. It shows the great divide between those the story has told about and those unknown floating in their impressive vessels.&quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; is a story about surviving love and loss; about being a man and about fishing. I thought it was great and had moments of satire and grisly noir to go along with the adventurous plight of Harry Morgan. This book would be excellent for those new to Hemingway and a treat for those more familiar with his style and brilliance. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"After publishing back-to-back two of the most celebrated American novels ever, Ernest Hemingway waited eight years before his next. For that alone, \\"To Have And Have Not\\" could not help but be a disappointment, a judgment that lingers today. Is it merited?Ex-cop turned charter-fishing-boat captain Harry Morgan is having a run of bad luck. Thanks to the ineptitude of his latest customer, Morgan loses his expensive fishing tackle off the coast of Cuba. The customer then skips without paying for his two-week charter. Down to forty cents, Morgan must scramble to provide for his wife and three daughters in Key West, even if it means breaking the law a little. Or a lot. Morgan's bad luck is just beginning.Published in 1937, \\"To Have And Have Not\\" starts out reading like an Elmore Leonard novel before its time, in the conversational voice of the opening narrative and the long sections of crisp dialogue which follow. Other than the narrative's casual racism, there's nothing wrong with the first part of the book. Hemingway gets to a lot of action quickly, including a gun battle four pages in and a couple of savage marlin fights which show off his economical writing style to good effect.If there's a problem with the first half of the book, actually two Hemingway short stories he stuck together and added a novella to form this novel, it's with the character of Morgan, an unsympathetic guy who carries a lot of issues but no backstory to help us understand him. He's simply dislikable and dangerous, becoming more so as the story progresses.\\"You don't care what happens to a man,\\" Morgan is told at one point by a gun-shot companion. \\"You ain't hardly human.\\"This might have worked if Hemingway kept the story on its pulp-fiction track. Instead, he goes for creative dissonance, widening the lens of his story to encompass multiple story arcs and contrasting Morgan's tale with unrelated ones featuring other Key West characters, jaded rich folk and poor World War I vets struggling to extract some pleasure and value from their variously blasted lives.Hemingway seems to be making a contemporary point about the income gap, hence the title, but never ties it into Morgan's individual story beyond that he needs money and is struggling to earn it. Morgan is an offstage non-presence in the novel's two longest chapters, featuring a long parade of here-and-gone characters. Hemingway's lingering descriptions of each, along with some uncharacteristically long run-on sentences, suggest a misguided attempt at channeling William Faulkner rather than working in his own singular style.Yet there are good things to say about \\"To Have And Have Not\\", like Hemingway's finding inspiration from the ocean, describing the smell of sea grape and the sight of passing ships hauling cargo across the horizon: \\"Brother, don't let anybody tell you there isn't plenty of water between Havana and Key West.\\" It's a locale Hemingway returned to in two later novels, \\"The Old Man And The Sea\\" and \\"Islands In The Stream\\", and you get a feeling for why he liked it so.Also good reading is some of the barroom dialogue, though Hemingway like many alcoholics doesn't know when to quit and keeps it coming for too long, until you feel like you are going to have the speaker's hangover the next morning.Hemingway was too great a writer to write a worthless book. \\"To Have And Have Not\\" is not a must-have by any means, but it has its moments."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"This book belongs up there with Hemingway's better known books, The Sun Also Rises, For Whom the Bell Tolls and The Old Man and the Sea. Papa unapologetically presents characters who do bad things. Some people have cited the racial slurs and the crimes the characters commit as problematic, but Hemingway displays these things without condoning them. He isn't writing what is good and bad. He is writing what happens. These things happen. People hate. people kill. People become desperate. Hemingway is at heart a reporter and he has crafted a tremendous story and a great book."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"SummaryHarry Morgan is a policeman-turned-fisherman down on his luck like so many others in the Depression-struck Florida Keys. To make ends meet, Harry begins engaging in increasingly dangerous illegal activities in the waters between the Keys and Cuba.The book opens on Harry and several Cuban revolutionaries who want to pay Harry an exorbitant fee to transport them to the United States. Harry refuses, preferring to use his boat for legal activities, and as the revolutionaries leave, they are gunned down in the street.However, after being tricked by a customer who charters the boat for three weeks and then vanishes without settling his account, Harry agrees to smuggle Chinese immigrants from Cuba to the mainland. Next, Harry begins running alcohol between the two countries, and a confrontation with Cuban customs lost Harry his arm and his boat. Undeterred, he signs to the next scheme he runs across: stealing a boat and ferrying Cubans involved in a bank robbery back to their homeland.As he descends ever-deeper into desperation, Harry meets old friends and new faces. He has little patience for those who have not remained as resilient to the times as himself, and he has no patience for outsiders. Tensions mount between this hardscrabble jack-of-all-trades and several tourists who frequent his local bars.One pair of tourists take special prominence in the book: Arthur, an unexceptional writer, and his beautiful, unhappy wife. When Arthur comes home one day after sleeping with yet another woman, his wife decides to leave him for another man, an alcoholic who has been seen sloshing around the bars as well.Meanwhile, you are given a peek into the intimate details of Harry's relationship with his wife, Marie. The quiet desperation with which they cling to each other is meant as a justification for Harry's illegal maritime activity. Unfortunately, Harry does not return home after his trip with the Cuban bank-robbers, and Marie becomes yet another Depression-era woman left wringing her apron in desperation and rage.AnalysisI'll be the first to admit that I have a bit of a Hemingway obsession. One of my literary goals is to read all of his books, and I'm not too far from the finish line. However, To Have and Have Not is my least favorite Hemingway book so far. Though Hemingway attempts to dissect grand social issues, such as troubled economic times and the relationship that exists between husband and wife, the entangled sub-plots and the erratic activities of the characters serve to distract from whatever statement Hemingway is trying to make.The unexpected changes in viewpoints are disorienting, and the stories of other characters either stop abruptly or trail off seemingly without resolution. Harry remains the driving force of the novel, if there is one, even when the narrative meanders through the viewpoints of those who interact with him. Though his motivations inspire pity, his actions encourage judgment. Ultimately, I felt indifference toward him.One aspect of the novel that I did enjoy, however, was the marine setting. I liked the descriptions of Harry's boat and the protective feelings that he felt for her. However, if you want good writing by Hemingway about the nautical life, read The Old Man and the Sea. In fact, skip this book and read Old Man anyway."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT was written during the Great Depression when there was also much revolutionary activity in Cuba.The book is not very similar to the Bogart movie with the same title. The protagonist, however, is named Harry Morgan and as in the film Harry is a fishing boat captain. His wife is named Marie which is the same name as that of the Lauren Bacall character in the movie. The plot of the book is very different and the mood throughout is dark and sombre - except for a few humorous interludes while Harry is drinking in a bar with wealthy tourists.Hemingway begins the story using the first person before switching to the third person after five chapters. The effect of this technique causes some confusion but it does add an extra dimension to both Harry and the plot.As a protagonist Harry is courageous but not very likeable. He at times appears to be just a desparate man who does not mind killing in order to make a decent living for his family.TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT never rises to the level of Hemingway's more successful novels but it is still worth reading as an example of the author's writing during his early years in Cuba."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"If you want your Caribbean thriller, look no further than right here. Hemingway's descriptions of life in the Florida Keys and along the Gulf Stream will raise the sweat on your brow. If written today, this novel would be broadsided with charges of political incorrectness; precisely one of the reasons that it is so refreshing to read. The dialogue is vital and lively, the master's economy of style shines here as in most of his other works. And, it is the story of a man and woman's life in a difficult time in these United States, the Depression. The rich are rich and the poor, well, they're real poor. The characters are richly drawn, and pull the reader into the chain of events of the story. The first chapter sets the pace of the novel and the reader is gripped by the throat and pulled along into Cuba long before Fidel and Key West at a time when a gay parade on Duval Street would have resulted in bloodshed. Pour a cold beer, sit back in your Morris chair, and get set to cross the Straits of Florida."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"To Have and Have Not is a character study of a failure - Harry Morgan. He is a poor man in Key West and Cuba who cannot figure out how to make a living, so he turns to murder, thievery and smuggling. While most see Morgan as an essentially good man forced into evil, from the first segment he makes stupid decisions, and never shows much goodness. Bigoted and mean, he is the least sympathetic character in the collected works. But that's not why the book is bad - It is disjointed - with several points of view, all caring about different things. The book only moves when Morgan is having adventures. The rest is empty. From a big Hemingway fan, I voice disappointment."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"I read this book the first time on my first trip to Rome, Italy in 1977.

I'd be happy to deal with this seller again."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"This is nowhere as good as Islands in the Stream. The story is in the first 123 pages. Racist labelings apart, the prose is quite gripping up to that point. Then the protagonist Cap'n Harry Morgan gets forgotten and some drunk and not very interesting characters squabble in the bar and in the bedroom, who really have very little to do with the plot, except to justify the title (these are the Have's). Harry Morgan is basically a good, hard-livin' guy who likes to drink and fish (like Hemingway), but it's as though the author ran out of steam with him. A deeper plot, with less time gaps and jumping about between characters might have made this a much better novel, but you'll find trademark H. understatement and great descriptions of the sea, especially of a marlin jumping out of the water."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Book was not is as good of shape as advertized.

I picked this book not only because of the author but also because of its connection to the movie of the same title. Well, a warning to those who might do the same: there is very little outside of the title and the first section that compares between the book and movie!In this novel, Hemingway seems a bit lost, a bit muddled. It seemed to me that what he had was more of a short story that he somehow needed to flesh out into a novel. And it doesn't quite work. Oh, there are scenes in the book that are very well written, yes. The opening scene alone is great! And other action scenes throughout the novel are also very well put together. Hemingway also does quite well with characters in this one. Harry Morgan - our protagonist - is easily envisioned (and so easily encapsulated as Bogie!). The diaglog is well done and very typical Hemingway. However, there is so much extra in this novel, that I wasn't quite sure exactly what was going on or even where the story was taking place. And the entire of chapter 24 - all 20 pages - is completely unnecessary!I found the later half of this book easier to read than the first half (though, I wish I had had the sense to skip chapter 24!). There were more action scenes and it just seemed to flow. While this certainly isn't as well written as some of Hemingway's other novels, it is certainly better than others. Well, at least to a fan of Papa!I would not recommend this book if one has never read Hemingway before. He has much finer works. But if one is a fan who feels they need to read everything Hemingway has written, you probably won't find this a total waste of time."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"The book is an action-packed thriller that has bootlegging, aiding illegal immigrants, and assisting foreign revolutionaries in a bank robbery. Harry Morgan, a middle age owner and a captain of a boat, living in peace time Florida, is faster moving than either Robert Jordan of \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" or Frederick Henry of \\"A Farewell to Arms\\", both young military commanders in a war zone. Being less of a positive hero, Harry can be more colorful. The supporting cast is no less vibrant, and even the patchwork of new characters introduced at the end of the novel feels of a piece, if a bit schematic.The novel is a quick read. The combination of simple language sporting an occasional twist, rapidly unfolding plot and memorable characters makes it an easily enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"To Have and Have Not is the story of Harry Morgan, a fisherman forced to turn to smuggling when his business goes bad. It is, as all of Hemingway's work, beautifully written in stark prose, but the story itself rambles a bit and follows some tangents as it winds toward its conclusion.The story reads somewhat as a story of a man's struggle to survive amid dire circumstances, but also as a contrast between the problems of the rich and the problems of the poor. Hemingway devotes several pages to brief glimpses of the lives of several wealthy tourists and their \\"problems,\\" most likely as a means of pointing out their empty, materialistic existences, and comparing that to the poor on the island who scrape to provide themselves with the basic needs of life.Morgan is a typical Hemingway character; a fairly average individual forced into difficult and ultimately dooming circumstances. The story itself seems somewhat distracted and unfocused, but the writing is classic Hemingway; stark and ultimately tragic as events unfold to determine the course of people's lives."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"An excellent book with some of the most complex and interesting character deveopments I have ever read. If you like Hemingway you will love this book. Even if you normally don't care for Hemingway, you will more than likely appreciate this work. I think that it is one of his best. A wonderful must read for all."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"The first thing I thought upon finishing this novel was, wow, I'm glad that's over. What a gritty and dismal story! Poor Harry Morgan and his bad choices. He gets gypped by a rich wannabe fisherman, and is suddenly in need of some cash. What does he do? He gets himself an illegal job, takes advantage of the situation, shocks the heck out of me, and it's all down hill from there. The N word was used quite a bit here, too, which was another shocking point. I suppose that has something to do with the era this book was written in, but shocked me nonetheless. I'm thinking maybe Mr. Hemingway was a crude and unsavory man. Could just be his writing, I don't know. I don't remember watching the movie based on this book, but I believe that it is quite different. So, if you like gritty, hardcore, manly books, you may like this one. It is interesting enough until the last few chapters, which is why I gave it a 3 instead of a 2. The description mentions something about a love affair. Not sure where that was supposed to have taken place. I just remember lots of violence and trash talking."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"I love Hemingway. I just like the way he writes. Some people say that he is sexist. I never seen it. All in all though, this was a good book."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"What a sad story. I enjoyed the book very much but felt so horribly for the main character Harry Morgan. In Harry Morgan we have a seemingly noble man. Who starts the book as a hard working Fishing Charter Captain. Through a series of unfortunate events Harry loses his work as a fishing boat captain. And goes headlong into the life of a smuggler.Harry seemingly detests this life in the beginning of the narrative, but is somewhat forced into doing it.It is amazing to see Harry, a man bound by duty to a life he doesn't want to lead, go down the dark dark path of destruction. The most amazing factor is how Harry appears to lose all his sense of ethics in a heartbeat.Hemingway discusses one of his favorite themes, duty of man. Harry has the duty of providing for his wife and daughters and will do whatever it takes to provide for them.Hemingways narrative reads like a series of flashbacks. Each time we see Harry he is in a new place in his decent to the abyss. He gets lower and lower each time. It all reads with a strong sense of predestination. It almost seems Harry is destined to walk this path... even though he wouldn't have chosen it initially. He didn't want to go in this direction. But he finds himself there and will do what he needs to do.Harry seems so full of integrity at the beginning then begins to do all he can to make this lifestyle work no matter the end result. He seems driven to provide no matter what he has to do. It is almost a Machiavellian story. You have to feel for Harry and his wife. But Harry makes his choices and lives with them.Read this book. It seems to be one of the darker Hemingway novels but it deifinitely satisfies! A great stroy and a sad story."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Its a story of a fisherman sort of like Old Man and the Sea but this novel has a different twist to it, the main character broke and has to find a way to make a deal with another boatsman to survive"},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"This book reminded me of a horrid ride that you couldn't get off. At first it was fun, then gradually, you just want to puke. It's the story of a weak protagonist who spends the book carrying out a pathetic vendetta against authority in general. I was extremely disappointed with this novel since I usually love Hemingway's work. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you want to read about the same recurring incident over and over."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"This is an interesting but seriously flawed novel written by Hemingway well after he had achieved critical success for his earlier novels, A Farewell to Arms and The Sun Also Rises. It is a fascinating novel in another way though, in that it shows the beginning of a dramatic change in the author's style, which would ultimately manifest itself completely in the magnificent For Whom the Bell Tolls, which came several years later.The first part of this novel is about Harry Morgan, a Florida Keys resident, scraping by as first a charter boat owner, then a smuggler, and then eventually much worse. For some odd reason, Hemingway chose to write this with differing viewpoints. Part of his story is written in the first person by Harry, part of it is written in the first person by an acquaintance, and part of it is written in the third person. Why he did this, I do not know. It doesn't make any sense thematically or for any other reason.About half way through the book switches gears, and suddenly Harry's story is interspersed with the stories of several wealthy people who come to the Keys to vacation in their expensive yachts. These stories are interesting and written with Hemingway's typically terrific ear for dialogue. Their problems are alcoholism, infidelity, and aging, and it dawns on us that this is the theme: the have-nots of Harry's world have more basic problems, such as getting enough food into the bellies of their children.But even this doesn't work so well. Despite the fact that Harry lives in what can be a rather cruel world, he himself seems a little more vicious than is absolutely required, and it is difficult to sympathize with him. Here is one of his final howls, spoken in delirium: \\"One man alone ain't got . . . no matter how a man alone ain't got no bloody &amp;%#@&amp;%&amp; chance.\\" Yes, the poor depression-era man crushed by overwhelming and indifferent forces he can't understand. This is a theme which had been done both before and during Have Not, has been done since, will continue to be done, and is, frankly, a little tiresome.To me the most fascinating aspect of the novel is that we see a change beginning to emerge in Hemingway's style. Along with the brilliant descriptive language and dialogue, we begin to see in Have Not an increase in interior monologues, which are fascinating, dramatic, and add greatly to both his characters' and the novel's depth. It is a trend which would continue."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"At the core of this book is a great story about Harry Morgan. Despite his racism and misogyny, he is, much like Hemingway himself, ultimately a sympathetic character. We want him to succeed given the force of his will and the odds against him. Also, despite his tough talk, and sometimes equally tough deeds, Morgan wants to do well for his family and wants to help out the dispossessed.Unfortunately, Hemingway felt the need to write a novel rather than a short story, and the story suffers in the process. He experiments with shifting points of view and interior monologues -- almost like he wants to show the world he can beat Joyce and Faulkner at their own game. Worse still, he shifts the story away from Morgan to a collection of \\"haves\\" who are not sufficiently developed, believable, or sympathetic. Again, one gets the sense that Hemingway is experimenting with another writer's style (in this case Fitzgerald), but does not quite bring it off.The one passage I remember from reading the book over 30 years ago is the epiphany experienced by Morgan's wife when he sees Harry ride away -- capturing both the strength and the hopelessness of Harry's character. This passage is one of the best Hemingway ever wrote. It and the basic story of Morgan make the book worthwhile.It is ironic that this book received so much criticism. It is much better than the \\"Old Man and the Sea\\", for which Hemingway won awards. The theme of individual's struggle against forces much larger than himself is much better told in this book than in Hemingway's later work."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"I re-read this book after some 40 years and found it more \\"topical\\" today than when I read it the first time. So many themes literally tumble out of today's headlines. There is the American-Cuban relationship, engendered by proximity, and of course economics, before America erected its economic version of the \\"Berlin Wall\\" against Cuba. There is the subject denoted by the title, the \\"haves\\" and \\"the have nots,\\" with the emphasis on the later. There is an incisive vignette on one of the \\"haves,\\" who had managed to steal from many of his fellow \\"haves,\\" a la Madoff, driving some to suicide. There is a sexual predator of a wife who \\"collects\\" writers. There are veterans who have fought in America's foreign wars, misused and mistreated by their own government. There is illegal immigration, and why it was more contained in the \`30's, due to the stiffer penalties. The central character is Harry Morgan, a hard-luck, but ethical fisherman, trying to scrap a living during the Depression, who is ripped off by an inept, but economically \\"successful\\" \\"have\\", which commenced Morgan's decent into crime and guns. Yet a topic which could fall out of today's websites as a \\"post-mortem,\\" literal and figurative, on another mass killing by an economically marginal figure - some, but not all, driven to despair by one of the \\"Sun King\\" \\"haves.\\" And then there is the wildly speculative, but an item for consideration concerning the organizational membership of the two Presidential candidates in the 2004 election: \\"the type of man who is tapped for Bones is rarely also tapped for bed; but with a lovely girl like Frances intention counts as much as performance.\\"Other reviewers have evaluated the novel as not up to Hemingway's other works, even making the point that supposedly he said, and meant so, himself. They also criticized the shifts in narration, the supposed \\"Faulknerian rambles,\\" the shallow portraits of the \\"haves,\\" and a supposed \\"cut and paste\\" nature of combining some short stories and vignettes. All of the above \\"worked\\" well for me. The novel is primarily about Harry Morgan, inarticulate as many are of his economic class, but admirably portrayed by Hemingway through his actions. The portrait of his wife, Marie, a woman who \\"stood by her man,\\" is succinct and successful; almost certainly the most insightful portrait of a woman in any in Hemingway's works. Often the rich are vapid and shallow, and so Hemingway's description is accurate. The woman in the bar scene, accompanied by her husband, deserves Morgan's contempt and reaction. And the novel is another view of a \\"Margaritaville,\\" or at least one version of same, Key West, Florida, where Hemingway is still fondly remembered.The novel has withstood the test of time, and can be read, or read again with greater appreciation today. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"This paperback is a very handsome edition of the work. It took me several goes to read this novel all the way through and I was frustrated and puzzled by it until I learned that the first two sections were originally published as short stories, and then I realized that the difficult third section, the largest of the three, might be another sequence of short stories, so that the book would then work as a sequence of short stories collectively making up a novel. I haven't tried reading it that way yet, but the problem with the book as it is presented is that the narrative keeps switching around in the third section and so does the character thread, and it feels difficult to hang on. However the writing and its evocation of the setting is superb and this is a book I shall keep. It flopped with the critics but it has a lot of great Hemingway in it."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"I've got to agree with Papa on this one, this is definitely not Hemingway's best work. This novel is actually two short stories and one novella, with the main character Harry Morgan (a smuggler and fisherman going between Cuba and the Florida Keys) linking the three together. The short stories were written well before the rest of the text, then tied together to make a single novel. The first two \`sections' (short stories) are fine adventure-type tales about the shady characters of pre-WWII Cuba. The novella starts off as an adventure tale as well in the same vein, but evolves into an introspective story about the value of life, the things the people hold valuable, and what it means to lose them. The latter half of the novella has very little to do with the first half or the other two short sections. I got the impression that EH changed his mind about what he wanted to do with this novel halfway through writing it, but instead of editing the first half for consistency, he just gave up. This makes the overall tale disjointed and puzzling. There are definitely some glimmers of Hemingway at his best in this novel (e.g. the chapter in which Morgan faces the bank robbers on his boat, or the last chapter about what people hold valuable and loss), but EH would have been better served to write to separate, complete tales about each of the threads. I would agree with one of the other reviewer's comments that if this is EH's worst, it is still better than most author's best, but I think that some of the glowing reviews are grossly overstated. This is a flawed work by a great writer in my view, not on the same planet as \`For Whom the Bell Tolls' and other EH greats. This is also one of the few cases in which the movie is better than the book."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"I am someone who came late to appreciating the literary genius of Hemingway, perhaps because like many in my generation I viewed his literary aura as overly slanted towards man's macho nature.The story revolves around the doings of a rather shady ex-cop engaged in smuggling in and around Cuba and the southern Keys. Beneath his corrupt veneer, however, rests a loving family man seeking to support an adoring wife and three young daughters. Unfortunately for our protagonist, a band of Cuban Coast Guard officials catch up with him during one of his intrigues, resulting in him being shot and eventually having one of his arms amputated. In the face of bankruptcy, will he find economic salvation in that one last great heist?This review is but a speck of what could be said in interpreting this fine piece of art.

I had rated this book 3 stars because that the story was boring and confusing, although I still like the book.

It takes place in Key West, Cuba and the Gulf of Mexico.Harry is tough and thinks he can beat the system, but we find out that he (like so many others) is just another loser. Hemingway contrasts Harry with some other losers, including Cubans, Chinese, Blacks, and a large assortment of Americans from several class and ethnic backgrounds.There are a few bright moments in the book between Harry and his wife Marie, as well as between Harry and his shipmates.Many of Hemingway's favorite themes are here -- what does it mean to be a tough man, an artist, a lover. Unlike some of his other works, his answers to these questions are mostly bleak and depressing.The 1944 movie starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall is nothing like the book. If you've seen the movie be prepared for a big shock."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"To be honest there is nothing I can add to all the good things that people have said about this classic book by Hemingway who wrote it many years ago.If you like Hemingway and have not read this one yet you will not be disappointed.This book is not like the movie but i was not expecting that. I really liked the movie too with Humphrey Bogart and Walter Brennan. This book does not have the happy ending of the movie and it's main character did not fight Nazi's like the movie one did.Like with many of Hemingway's books he throws in many little tidbits of information that gives you insight into the people of that time period.All in all I highly recommend this book to all. I was happy to see that there were only a few errors in the Kindle version."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Nothing like the movie. More a series of vignettes in Harry Morgan's life. I was surprised I liked it because one of my pet peeves is if you are going to make a movie from the book, stay true to the book. Much more violent, less heroic than the movie. I have to admit that based on Hemingway's descriptions of certain characters that the actors were well chosen for the movie. I still liked the movie better."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"I had read the first section of a three part story years ago in an anthology of Hemingway novels and short stories.

Nothing sugar-coated in this tale and the writing is classic Hemingway."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"A well executed tale of struggle and ambition.

Don't look for happy endings but you'll certainly enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"This book, which you can't help but feel is closely modeled on a period of Hemingway's own life, is most revealing in the portrayal of the lifestyles of the rich and unemcumbered of the mid-20th century. Based in France and Spain it follows a group of friends travelling to bull fights and idyllic fishing spots and explores the friendships and jealousies between the group.In my opinion, not as good as 'For Whom The Bell Tolls', but also a far different story and different type of novel.An easy, enjoyable read, but not Hemingway's greatest work."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Hemmingway writes in a way that makes for a page turner.

It's particularly interesting to read Hemingway's view of the Cuban revolution in the making, as well as getting a view of the violence in the background of those times when Cuba was a \\"playground\\" for some pretty unsavory types. Though it probably is one of Hemingway's worst, it still has its moments--thin characters and all. This is one of the few books where I'd say the movie was better. Bogart did it justice. Still...it's a damn good book by most anyone's standards."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"But this book is missing something. It has plenty of drama, interesting sidebars, but I think a lot of it was rambling and Hemmingway didn't know where he was going with it. Nevertheless, the tale of Harry Morgan's struggle to keep his family fed in corrupt Key West is interesting. The dialog is powerful, particular in the bar scenes. And Hemmingway's style of direct prose writing is entertaining. You will feel the pain of the characters in this difficult story."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"This is a book often linked with a later one from the 1950s: Across The River and Into The Trees; mainly because many readers do not like either of these books.To Have and Have Not has always been an interesting read for me; having come upon it in the mid-1960's while still in college. It was not part of my assigned reading but my professor was so much against EH's Islands In The Stream that I sought out what some critics feel to be one of his lesser works. But as I say, not only have I always enjoyed reading this book, but feel EH knew both the area and the people very well.Though I am truly an EH fan I cannot say this is one of his best, because for me the writing is in many spots very uneven. Though the characters are true and real, for Hem took most from real life, they and the sadness of the depression years keep this one moving along. Part One is very good, very even, but when one starts Part Two it seems one has been dropped 'in medias res' and it takes some re-reading to get a clear line on the writer's direction. And the length of each 'part' can also be very uneven, too. The book deals with not only depressing times but tragic ones as well. Doesn't mirror Hemingway's personal life at this time for he was at a crest, especially with the books he turned out while living those Key West years.The book is completely different from the movie, which EH did not care for at all, and Eddie comes off worse in the book than in the movie. EH has Harry even considering killing Eddie at one point.In Harry Morgan EH has created a person both fictional and real: much of the character was based on Josie Russell the man who owned Sloppy Joe's, and one of few lasting Hemingway friends, their friendship lasted from 1932 till June of 1941 when Josie died during the time he and EH were on their annual fishing trip. EH took his death very hard. So with this novel you have much fiction intertwined with non-fiction.I would not suggest this book for readers just beginning his/her Hemingway reading, but once familiarity with EH has been established it will offer a reader good background for those early/mid 1930 years EH spent in Key West. For those of us with a couple shelves full of books by and about Hemingway, this is an essential read.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"This book tells about the story of a fisherman named Harry Morgan who has to do smuggling business to feed his family. The book does a good job of depicting many kinds of characters. All portrayling the negative aspects of a human being. Greed, violence, jealousy, and compeitition. From the naive \\"chink\\" Mr.Sing to the tragic Albert. The book brings out a lot in terms of people's lives during the Great Depression.However, the book was also hard to get into. The actions seem to go on intermittently, sometimes the book becomes fast paced while suddenly it jumps into a sluggish form. Some depictions from the book simply do not make any sense. The action jumps from Harry and suddenly turns to a writer named Richard Gordon and talks about how his wife left him to have sex with another guy. The book does a poor job of tying a beautiful, and somewhat touching story together. And instead it gets people to scratch their heads and wonder what is going on.However, all said and done, this book still remains valuable through its realistic depiction of a tough life from the perspective of Harry Morgan. Though not one of Hemingway's best works,(probably his worst) this book should still be read with serious thoughts."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"It's a common belief under critics that great writers have only about six really good novels in them. Because of his extensive journeys, Hemingway is the exception. Although he had one or two bad ones, this one is not of them.'To Have And Have Not' revolves around Harry Morgan, a broke fishing boat captian willing to sacrifice his life and family for a few greenbacks. His mission: to safely smuggle a couple of immigrants from Cuba to Florida without getting caught. I admit, this is not my favorite Hemingway novel, but, it's still very good. Naturally, when Hemingway is at sea, it must be good. It just makes you close your eyes and clench your teeth every time you hear the cry of a gunshot on the boat. Off course, there's more than just that. Harry Morgan is deeply thoughtful for a fishing captain, and the way the author moves back and forth in describing his scenes makes for brilliant reading. That's how good Hemingway can be. Especially with a bottle in the one hand. Enough said. Everybody knows Hemingway wrote genius. Why he still don't get taught enough at colleges and universities is mind-blowing. Academics say there are nothing to teach about Hemingway. I disagree."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"I found To Have and Have Not to be the roughest of the Hemingway's works that I have read to date. The narrative is choppy, and the reader never really gets into the protoganist's head the way we do in even his earliest works (&quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;). The progress of the plot is uneven, and unlike his many works set in Europe, we do not develop a vivid image of either Havana or the Florida keys.If you are looking for an introduction to Hemingway, I strongly recommend reading one of his great works such as A Farewell to Arms or For Whom the Bell Tolls. If you are working your way through all of Hemingway's works, then of course this belongs on your list."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Hemingway is known for his simple, easy-to-read writing style, but everything he writes goes much deeper than the oceans he writes about. This book, as is common with his other books, tells about the struggles of trying to make it through life, and how one has to play with the hand he's given. Everyone has to put up with hardships in life, some more than others, but everyone has to learn how to deal with them because there's not much they can do to change their lives. &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; is a very realistic account of life. It will leave you contemplating about life in general, and make you realize many new things that you may not have thought about before. Though it wasn't given very good reviews by critics, and is not considered one of Hemingway's major novels, it is a book for the person out there who loves to find the significance in seemingly insignificant things put in there by an ingenius author."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Hemingway's genius as the greatest American writer of the century is evident from the first chapter. His action narrative skills are first rate, but get beneath that level and find his wonderful insight into the shallowness of the rich in contrast to the depth of the protaganist, a poor fisherman, and adventurer. And, if you think Hemingway is all machismo, read chapter 21 for its gut wrenching sensitivity from the female perspective. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"A word is warning is appropriate before going into the book. Most of the book speaks from the perspective of a person who uses highly prejorative terms about people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. This use of the terms is consistent with the story, and advances the story, but will not be welcomed by some readers. I found this aspect of the book offensive and graded it down one star as a result. If the use of such terms is very offensive to you, I suggest you skip this book. It will cause you pain to confront this prejudice in undiluted form.This lesser-known novel by Hemingway looks at what the cost of false pride in status is. The book has some of the most eloquent statements of remorse that you will ever read, in the context of a love story about two happily married people.Be sure to understand that the novel is quite different from the movie. If you liked the movie, you may not like the novel. The book is much more complex and darker emotionally.Harry Morgan has his own fishing boat, and makes a living taking wealthy people fishing off Florida's Keys until the Depression knocks the skids out from under normal economic times.The book opens with Morgan in Havana turning down three Cubans who want him to smuggle them into the United States illegally for a very substantial sum. The negotiations are quickly followed by a hail of gunfire, and one of the Cubans is killed. Morgan is warned to keep his mouth shut by the survivors.Like most small businesspeople, he wants to provide for his family, be respected for his profession, and enjoy what he does. All of this is put at risk when he fails to collect from a wealthy customer who skips out on him. Morgan had avoided dunning Mr. Johnson, his customer, for the money, worried about upsetting the customer. That false pride in pretending that Morgan isn't concerned for the money is expensive. The result is temporary economic ruin. He's left in Havana without even enough money to refuel the boat to go back to the Florida Keys.Now, he has to scramble to do anything, and quickly takes on a job of illegally transporting Chinese. Survival comes before ethics now. In the process, Morgan tries to keep his morality intact as best he can, and does an immoral act to avoid doing a worse one.Soon, Morgan is taking other risks and routinely operating as a criminal. His ethical standards keep slipping in order to maintain financial appearances. This trade-off proves to be his undoing.In each case of economic hardship, Morgan has avoided taking other actions that would have solved his problem, at least temporarily. He owns his boat, so he could have sold it or borrowed against it. He owns his home, and could have sold it and rented. He could have rented other peoples' boats when he could get a charter. The government has subsistence work available for the unemployed, but he prefers to maintain his life style and appearances as though he has no problems. He also has tried to keep from getting caught in breaking the law, but that hasn't worked either.Morgan ends up taking on more than he can handle. He feels remorse as a result. He's tried to be too self-reliant, as a way to reduce his risk. That was the wrong route. Getting help was the right way to get the risk down.His wife, Marie, captures the challenge of the modern world this way, &quot;You just go dead inside and everything is easy. You just get dead like most people are most of the time.&quot; This suggests compromising your pride and principles to keep up appearances, which is what most people do.Hemingway makes good use of the &quot;haves,&quot; those who charter and own the yachts, to show that they have compromised with self respect. They have money, but they do not have honor and decency. Often, they lose other benefits that matter to them, such as the chance for close human connection.His &quot;have nots&quot; are crushed by the intent and the carelessness of the &quot;haves.&quot; The &quot;have nots&quot; are also undermined by their willingness to let the ends justify the means, and abuse of alcohol. Those weaknesses compromise them, and they are destroyed as a result.So the lesson is that you should uphold what is important to you (not appearances) and make the necessary compromises to guard the important (such as your family, your health, and your survival). The worse the conditions are, the more important this lesson is.After you finish contemplating what you would have done, I suggest you also think about where today we find similar compromises occuring because of prosperity. Where do we sacrifice what is important to have more prosperity or to appear to do so? I think Hemingway's tale still applies. How should you change, as a result?Get the right life for those you love and yourself!"},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"If, like me, your first experience with Hemingway's classic sea tale To Have or To Have Not was the steamy (for the times) Bogie/Bacall movie version where the main character, Captain Morgan, is the put upon object of the local French Resistance in World War II then this the original will surprise you. Actually the only similarity between the two works is the captain's name. That said, this tale is really about a gritty, hard-bitten, down at the heels sea-going man who will try everything to keep his family and himself above water (no pun intended). Starting out with a little illegal, just a little, activity he winds up.... well you can read the rest. Is this a major Hemingway production? I think not but it is also not the \`throwaway' that Hemingway in his lifetime considered it. Face it if you want to get an approximation of the life on the sea, the real sea, and the language of the waterfront Hemingway is one of your sources."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Following a trip to Havana in which I took in the villa and hotel rooms where Hemingway spent much of his time, I wanted to try this lesser known novel of his which begins with a typically terse but magnificent Hemingway description of tough guys in early morning Havana, operating before the ice wagons come to service the bars.This novel is a mixed bag. The dialogue is excellent, and the scenes where Harry and his wife's marital tension is explored are first rate and represent some of Hemingway's finest writing.The rest of the time it is largely a tale of hard men becoming undone. Which is a theme dealt with better in some of Hemingway's other writings anyway."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Thanks you very much for your work. It was fast, good and on time. We did nor expect such a quick shipment."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"\\"To Have and Have Not\\" by Ernest Hemingway is a typically sharp and stylistic character drama set in depression era Key West and Havana, Cuba. Hemingway's books usually have a signature of authenticity that is the true mark of an original writer. I have read four or five of Hemingway's best novels and the most distinguishing aspect is the dry, sparsely written prose that cuts right to the heart of character. There is no fanciful allusion or elaborate language that defined some of the writers that came in the generation before Hemingway, such as Edith Wharton or Henry James. As they often dealt with the upper strata of society, there exists a slight literary pretension in some of the pre-modernist prose that matches the late Victorian era aristocrats and their social values.As America entered the modern era, society began to change with Teddy Roosevelt's \\"trust busting\\", labor unionizing, civil rights issues and the question of immigration all calling established societal values into question. After reading a bit about Roosevelt, Hemingway's early life seems very much inspired by the president who took the Oval office shortly after his birth in 1899. The virility of Roosevelt is matched by Hemingway's experiences throughout the first half of the 20th century, especially his love of the outdoors and the thrill of big game hunting. In the case of \\"To Have and Have Not,\\" it was Hemingway's love of the Gulf stream waters around the Florida Keys and Cuba that inspired this 1937 publication, specifically the years he spent as a seaman, exploring every inch of the waters, but also the people and the unstable and sometimes dangerous world that linked Cuba to the United States.With the Prohibition era, liquor and the ingredients necessary for its creation were smuggled into Florida; the mob connections that developed in the area grew and grew until prominent underworld leaders such as Meyer Lansky had invested large sums of their money into Havana, making it into the playground and vacation destination of America's elite. This era was a little after the period in which Hemingway wrote \\"To Have and Have not\\", yet the foundations for the corrupt mob backed state of Cuba and the transit pathways between American coasts and \\"offshore\\" financial interests were very much alive in the 30's, thanks in large part to the smuggling business.Hemingway was a well-known figure in these circles; he had gained fame with his writing in the mid to late 20's with \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" and \\"Farewell to Arms\\". He had access to the Cuban and American communities on which this story is based. In that light this book, like all good fiction, is drawn from real life events and people, only the names and details are rearranged to create a more fluid and original story line.The principal character is Harry Morgan, an ex-Miami Police Officer (though this is only mentioned once in the whole book) runs into some bad financial luck in the small business of chartering his fishing boat to wealthy American's on holiday. He becomes deeper and deeper involved into the nefarious smuggling networks between Havana and Key West; so much so that by the end of the book he is unrecognizable from the man painted in the first few pages. While he is the main vehicle on which the story is built, Hemingway includes other character sketches, such as a pair of quarreling spouses who are in in the Keys to write, a bar full of drunken and violent WWI vets (of the famous \\"Lost Generation\\") and various \\"shady\\" individuals, looking to subvert the law and make a quick buck. The reader is never sure of who they are or what they represent, because Morgan is a free lancer; he is not under a criminal organization with \\"bosses\\" above him.This book is definately an example of how Hemingway became so successful and also how a large part of this success was his access to people and places that were considered important at the time. Hemingway is no genius with his prose; yet his style is considered one of the definitive forces of modernist writing. The real strength of his work was the way he mirrored his life with his prose. He was considered such a denizen of his era that he moved in many circles throughout his life. He hobnobbed with mobsters and politicians, generals and revolutionaries, yet always maintained his autonomy and an independent sense of \\"manhood.\\"On Monday, the 28th of May, HBO is showing an original movie titled \\"Hemingway and Gellhorn\\" about Ernest's 3rd marriage and the courtship that took place during the Spanish Civil War. This should be great; after reading this book and also his brother's memoir/bio of Ernest, I kept thinking how suitable his stories are for the big screen. It is no wonder that most of his major books were made into movies during the early years of Hollywood. Though some of these won Academy awards, I still find that pre 1960 films are usually so rigid in their standards that real character exploration is put aside in favor of a mass produced \\"faade\\" that is meant to impart old fashioned values to the viewer, rather than really telling the truth. I watched \\"The Sun also Rises\\" with Tyrone Power, but found it somewhat ridiculous that he was cast as the Ernest character, who was in his early 20's at the time, while Power is pushing 50 (though Rock Hudson's characterization in \\"Farewell to Arms\\" was much better). Hemingway's stories defined what it meant to be manly in the 20th century. As that century fades into the past, his stories really depict how the world changed as the result of two world wars (both of which he witnessed) and the unrest of the Cold War. \\"To Have and Have Not\\" was far ahead of its time in pointing to Cuba with a cautionary tone, as it would become the place where World War III nearly started, with the Missile Crisis in 1962."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Length:: 2:46 Mins\\"To Have and Have Not\\" was released in a troublesome time in Ernest Hemingway's life, when he was looking to make some money because he was low on it.Now I didn't know this upon my first reading, but apparently having reconsidered the work himself to be garbage in that he more or less just wrote it for the money.I walked into this thinking it might be another Hemingway classic now and you can understand my surprise when I'm used to such classics as \\"For Whom The Bells Tolls\\" and \\"The Old Man & The Sea\\", I was expecting something of the same caliber. He's one of the best to ever have written in American literature, so you can understand my disappointment as halfway through, I still felt like there was nothing really going on and there wasn't a good story structure to base things around and in the overall excitement, flow was just missing.I later learned that \\"To Have and Have Not\\" is a longer form of what was originally just a short story. And perhaps that can explain why it doesn't seem like the structure of the novel is completely there.I would give this one three stars and it's just barely three stars. I think it makes up to three stars because there's still Hemingway here - that writing style that you know and love from either when you were taught in high school or for your own passionate reading of the author is here. It's intact but the storyline and the ability of the story to grip you as a reader it's just not as strong and not as overall important of a novel in Hemingway's work as all of his other stuff.I'd stay away from it unless you're a huge fan of his other stuff. If not, look for some of his other significant stuff first, especially something short like \\"The Old Man & The Sea,\\" which is one of my favorites.BookReviewersClub (.com) Reviewer - Dean Goranites"},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"I went through a long period of not much liking Hemingway. I read For Whom the Bell Tolls and A Farewell to Arms back in school, and while I could appreciate a lot of Hemingway's craftsmanship in them, I couldn't enjoy them. I couldn't get over their dryness, even if there was intelligence behind it. Then, however, I decided on a whim to readThe Sun Also Risesand give him another chance. It worked. I loved it (still do) and read my way through some of Hemingway's other works, especiallyThe Old Man and The Seaand a lot of the short stories, and found a lot to like, a lot of moments in which the intelligence equaled the humanity in the stories, and where the direct style matched the toughness of the characters and stories. I would count myself a Hemingway fan now.Finally, I got around to reading To Have and Have Not a couple of weeks ago, and unfortunately, I had rather a mixed reaction to the novel. It's, first of all, a rather disjunctive piece, broken up into three parts that, and while they mainly follow the same chief character and similar subject matter, are rather different, to my ear, in tone and style. I've read that To Have and Have Not is comprised of originally separate pieces, and it certainly reads that way.The first part, in which Harry Morgan is trying to make good but is driven by circumstance to do something terrible is the strongest part of the book. Alone, I think it's about as strong as anything else Hemingway ever wrote; it's extremely well-paced and contains subtle and well-drawn characterizations. Harry is noble, but tragic, and it's easy to feel for him.The rest of the book carries on the themes of that opening story. Harry is married to Marrie (a sympathetic character) and wants to do well by his family, but poverty keeps driving Harry in deeper, making him increasingly desperate and angry and forcing him to lose his caution. He goes on determinedly but makes tremendous mistakes and ends up losing more than his arm.The final two thirds of To Have and Have Not strike me as somewhat too one-noted. Things are bad and get worse and worse. No doubt this marks Hemingway at his grimmest. It seemed to me that things are so overwhelmingly bad in this novel that it's difficult to muster more than a little pity for anyone in it. The disjunction of the three parts was a little disconcerting to me, as well, especially since I thought the book began so strong. Some of the (wealthy and vain) side characters who make cameos in the book, though their actions served well as a foil to highlight the social criticisms of the novel, mostly feel intrusive, and their stories seemed incomplete.So, I wouldn't label To Have and Have Not as a total failure. It has its good and bad moments. I doubt, though, that it is one of Hemingway's works that I will ever revisit again."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Many people classify this novel as a \\"minor\\" Ernest Hemingway novel, but after reading it,I have come to appreciate this book more and more. We spent a day in Key West as part of a cruise and my wife purchased this work at the Hemingway House. After she finished, I read it more to see how the author treated the people of Key West in the book since we had been there nd learned of the Conch Republic secession from the United States in the 1970s.This book features Harry Morgan, one of the \\"conches\\" in Key West, who ekes out a living operating a fishing boat out of Key West and Cuba in 1937. Times are hard for harry and when he gets stiffed by his charter, he is faced with the economic necessity of performing some illegal activities with his boat (activities to he is not a stranger).On the surface, the \\"have nots\\" are the poor \\"conches\\" of Key West who are battling to lift themselves out of the depression and are willing to commit illegal activity to feed their families.That is the surface plot. Yet underneath, there is a series of disparate characters who demonstrate that, despite their high level of social and economic status, have aspects of their lives in which they \\"have not\\". These vignettes are vividly displayed, as the master must have intended."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"\`To Have and Have Not' follows Harry Morgan, one of Hemingway's harshest heroes, as he tries to earn a living from his boat between Key West and Cuba. He gets involved in a variety of exploits, from people trafficking and liquor smuggling, to aiding escapees from a bank robbery. He acts and lives in as hard a way as he has to, to survive the dangers these events put him in. This is one of Hemingway's better novels, with great descriptions of Cuba and Key West and has a story that moves at a steady and inescapable pace, except for the last 50 pages where the story drifts a touch and rambles in that way Hemingway books tend to do. You get great examples of his writing style, with terse, short sentences that evoke the era and events and shows how effective he could be when he was at his peak. The main character may not be the most likeable, but this book still manages to keep you turning the pages until you reach the inevitable conclusion. Well worth a try if you've enjoyed some of his other books.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Like so many readers, I'm familiar with the entertaining film of the same title that took quite a lot of liberties with the characters and plot that Hemingway developed. (And by the way, William Faulkner wrote the screenplay for the movie!) I assumed the book would be similar to the movie -- and it's not.The Harry Morgan in the film is a hero, a sort of amoral hero in some sense, but definitely someone who is working on behalf of the greater good. The Harry Morgan of the book is a true anti-hero, one of the seminal anti-heroes in literature. But I loved the book nonetheless. It's a powerful book, full of death and failure and frustration, as well as the classic Hemingway machismo.The book is a series of stories about life in the Florida Keys and Cuba during a period when the Great Depression had torpedoed opportunities for many Americans, and life was becoming unliveable in corrupt, violence Cuba. The main character, Harry Morgan, is able to move between those worlds, and carve out an existence. Quite literally, he moves between the two countries as a boat captain. He offers fishing charters in the Gulf, and, when the Depression kills the charter trade, he is willing to run guns, liquor, and illegal immigrants from Cuban to the States. Anything for money.All of of his life begins in bars, where he seems to spend most of his time. He cuts deals, catches up on the news, and drinks endlessly. He just goes from one event to another, with little thought of the future or a grander plan. Sadly, his bravery -- of which there's a great deal -- has no greater purpose. He's amoral, but also fearless.Through a series of vignettes, we see the key moments in Morgan's life. In the first vignette, Morgan escapes a political hit that results in deaths of three men seeking to escape Cuba. Then he gets stiffed on nearly $1,000 for a fishing charter, and so he accepts an offer to smuggle a dozen Chinese men into Florida. But he double-crosses the dealmaker. In the next vignette, we see Morgan at the tail end of a liquor run that has gone horribly, violently bad; ultimately, he loses his arm. Then, in the last extended vignette, we see Morgan taking yet another chance because he's in dire need of money, when he agrees to take political operatives back to Cuba, against his better judgment. This goes horribly wrong, too.Through these stories, we get a deep character sketch of a man we want to like and admire, but who I find ultimately to be distateful. Morgan breaks the law over and over again. He's mean to friends and people who are loyal to him. He antagonizes strangers, just to show that he can't be pushed around. You want to think he's the Humphrey Bogart character in the movie -- a fearless man who breaks the law in order to serve a higher good -- but in the novel, Morgan isn't serving a higher good, except perhaps in the sense of being the little guy against \\"the man.\\" That's what makes Harry Morgan an anti-hero, and that is one of the great achievements of this book. It should be said that Morgan loves his wife, a former prostitute with whom he's had three daughters. Morgan just wants his little piece of life, but he only knows how to get it in the world he inhabits of bars, boats, broads.The book also does a wonderful job of sketching the side characters -- the rummies who seek small jobs from Morgan, the political schemers who are fomenting revolution in Cuba, the rich folk and intellectuals who come down from New York for a frolic in the Florida Keys. It also shows the understated way that the bartenders and workers of a place like the Keys set up the atmosphere for the casual visitor, and the contempt with which the workers hold most of the visitors. It's not a pretty sight.The book is over 50 years old, but it has the power to shock. The comments about sex between Morgan and his wife are blunt and more than a little \\"dirty.\\" Morgan also calls Blacks and Chinese people by less-enlightened terms, and he shows contempt for the folks living in Cuba. As I said, he's not likeable, dignified, or noble -- despite his obvious skills as a boat captain and his great bravery.Conclusion. It's definitely worth reading if you want to inhabit a tough world of down-and-out people. Hemingway builds a romantic world while not making it pretty, safe, or even fun. It's gritty, dirty, dangerous -- and you wish you had the cojones to live there, too."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"To Have and Have Not is not one of Hemingway's masterpieces but it is a solid novel.The story is basically a sea adventure story involving an owner of a small boat named Harry Morgan who specializes in giving tours to wealthy people but delivers contraband on the side to make ends meet.

Few things in life are as wonderful as a Hemmingway novel. The way he writes, the language, is poetic and full of life and he can make the most boring of subjects keep your attention and beg for more. To Have And Have Not is not one of his more famous works, but it is very satisfying indeed."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"This short novel was written when Hemingway was living in Key West and paying regular visits to Cuba, before moving, lock, stock, and barrel, to Havana in 1939. The author was a keen deep-sea fisherman himself, who craved a laid-back tropical lifestyle between bouts of high adventure. To Have And Have Not draws heavily on his intimate knowledge of early nineteen-thirties life in the Florida Keys, the north coast of Cuba, the Gulf Stream in between, the fishing boats that worked those waters, and the men who owned and manned them.This was the time of the Great Depression. Harry Morgan has been bilked of his dues for a fishing charter out of Havana. Broke, he turns to smuggling - with its inevitable risks - in order to support his family while the author treats the reader to a simply told, suspenseful, and sometimes poignant morality tale. A tale with a rich share of characters ranging from down-and-out &quot;rummies&quot;, Cuban revolutionaries, bar-owners, customs men, and an inevitably crooked lawyer, to the wealthy owners of luxury steam-yachts.Interestingly if a little quirkily structured, the book is divided into three parts. The first is told in the first person, most of the remainder in the third. To Have And Have Not should be viewed as a product - as well as a story - of its time, particulary in respect of terminology that would be seen today as highly racist and derogatory. Not &quot;Papa's&quot; best work, but most assuredly a yarn that held this reader's attention throughout."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Harry Morgan, the antihero of Hemingway's \\"To Have and Have Not,\\" is a former cop from Miami who now works on the other side of the law. He owns a small yacht and charters fishing trips for vacationers, alternating between Havana and Key West, where he lives with his wife Marie and their three daughters. When times get tough, as they often do during the Great Depression, he supplements his income by running liquor and aliens between Cuba and Florida. For the remainder of his short life, he endures danger, violence, and great bodily sacrifice in his rather simpleminded pursuit of the next big score.Early in the novel we see exactly what kind of operator Morgan is when he cheats and murders a Chinese businessman who has hired him to transport some immigrants. His motive is nothing more complicated than that he needs the money and doesn't value human life very highly, especially not a stranger's. He has little use for people who can't directly help him make money; it's not surprising that he has few friends, these being Eddy the drunk and Albert the sad sack who's digging ditches on a relief project. He is cold (but not abusive) even to his family and apparently doesn't care much whether they live or die even though he feels a vague obligation to provide for them.Hemingway contrasts the impoverished Morgans with the more affluent tourists in Key West, most of whom do not interact personally with Morgan. The most notable subplot is the troubled marriage of the writer Richard Gordon, who is working on a novel about a labor strike, and his vixenish wife Helen; but their purpose in the novel is unclear except possibly to portray random marital discord. All these characters, from the surly, discontented Morgan to the wealthy residents with their facades of prosperity and happiness, have one thing have in common--they are people to whom an enormous amount of liquor is an anesthetic with which to numb their miseries.That Morgan is an unlikeable man is not the problem with \\"To Have and Have Not\\"; he's little more than what he seems--just a guy on a boat getting into trouble and drinking away his aimless, empty life. Hemingway lived in Key West in the 1930s, and it can be assumed that he was inspired by the shady characters he might have seen on the docks, so I can appreciate where he was going with this novel; but it has only half a heart. His minimalist, descriptively sparse prose and punchy dialogue work best when his characters have desires and passions deeper and more complex than money, as they do in his better novels (\\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" \\"A Farewell to Arms,\\" \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\") and short stories. Like Hemingway's better heroes, Morgan is an adventurer, but his tragedy is that he lives only for the payoff."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"After having lived in the Keys for eight years, I picked up \\"TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT\\" again and realized Harry Morgan lives! And, he's got lots of relatives. Ernest Hemmingway is often touted as Key West's most famous son, but he wasn't born there and he didn't stay there all that long. I think he stayed long enough to realize that if he stayed any longer he would have become Harry Morgan, fate included. There's a mixture of opinion regarding this novel collection. Even the author himself came to disdain it. However, if anything, TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT is too good, too real for comfort.There is an oft-quoted phrase, \\"Keys Disease,\\" that is used in the Keys to describe a variety of sensual addictions from the love of the eternally warm weather to sport fishing and reef diving to alcoholism and drug abuse. But, what Hemmingway has captured in this dark, desperate work of fiction is the real Keys Disease, an alien, otherworldly, situational ethos that is born of the intimate embrace of Thanatos. To truly live in paradise, one has to be dead and dead men like Harry Morgan are unconcerned about morality or life or fate, least of all their own. The warm, shallow Florida Bay, that lies so placidly behind these tiny coral islands, conceals the evidence of a thousand Harry Morgans; unholy traffic in human life, robberies gone awry, drug deals that ended in death, murders and suicides. You know the Keys Disease has got you when you can accept it all, smile and say, \\"Just another beautiful day in the fabulous Florida Keys.\\" I think Papa got it."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Just the name Hemingway conjures up images of writing that will leave a reader astounded by its brilliance. Sadly, my first Hemingway novel, left me a little flat. \\"To have and have not\\" is a somewhat disjointed account of a scallywag named Harry Morgan. Harry owns a charter ship based in Cuba and, is also not averse to running Cubans between Key West and Cuba.That's pretty much the premise for the book. There's a lot of conversational prose that flows over many pages of which the outcome doesn't seem to be ... anything? Morgan doesn't mince his words and, due to this, we never get to know him well enough to root for him. There's little, if any, internal dialogue where can get inside his head and figure him out. In some ways, this book is two or three short stories bound together.Towards the end of the book, I got a sense of Hemingway's brilliance as he takes us inside a number of boats docked in a small port of Cuba. Here he glows as he paints a picture of the people's lives and how they ended up at the point they are now. He uses words so well and, due to this chapter in particular, I'll delve deeper into Hemingway's work. Without this chapter I might have decided against further time spent reading Hemingway's work.\\"To have and Have Not\\", in summary, is a disjointed, tepid and tired tale about a man we know as little about by the end as we did at the beginning. Strikes me that Hemingway was under contract and churned this one out in between his better novels."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Harry Morgan made good money chartering his boat out for sport fishing,but times are hard; the depression is in full swing, only the ugliest survive and Harry makes money anyway he can-shipping Chinamen from Cuba to Florida to running liquer.

Hemingway inserts chapters and characters that all strongly underline the titled theme; 'To Have and Have Not'The depression has caused political and social uncertainty; dishonesty seems to be the only thing that pays. Honest Albert Tracy is starving with his family as he works for lousy money on relief and what he can earn from Harry, but respects the law.The rich are rich because they're ruthless but are always one step away from having someone do to them what they have done to others, and the taxman is calling. In Cuba they want revolution but the replacements are every bit as brutal as the incumbants. This follows up-or underlines- Hemingway's theme in 'To Whom the Bell Tolls' where the internationalists are every bit as murderous and brutal as the fascists; what's in a name? Where is civilization?Hemingway strips humanity down to its most animal instincts of survival and poses the same questions as Steinbeck in 'Grapes of Wrath' all in 180 pages. A really brilliant book, a really brilliant writer."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Harry owns a boat and he hires himself out to sportsmen who want to catch big fish. He is cheated by a client and short of money. He agrees to run contraband. He goes home to his wife. She fears something will go wrong. They make love. She worries that Harry wants more than she can offer. He reassures her: she's a fine woman.The next day Harry goes on his trip. A young unsuccessful writer sits in a cafe and sees a fat old woman in a badly fitting dress running towards the docks; he imagines her to be late for work at a processing factory or some such thing and begins a short story based on her pathetic life. She is in fact Harry's wife. She just got a call from the police. The writer will never know of the passion she felt the night before. Or Harry's story.Easily one of Hemingway's most depressing books, this dark and complex story shows bad things happening to good people. Take it as a warning. Life requires courage, or as Hemingway described it, grace under pressure.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"I ordered this book for my grandson for Christmas. It came on time and in perfect condition. Would definetely order again from this seller"},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I am not a big Hemingway fan.I remember a college professor saying that Fitzgerald would agonize over every word of his novels. He would be terribly angered that Hemingway would grab a bottle of whiskey, walk up to his writer's garrett and whip out a novel.My impression after reading this Heminngway work is that he did just that - grabbed a bottle of whiskey and whipped out a novel. The parts of the books are headed as seasons in Harry Morgan's life and much of the book that is devoted to him is okay. He is Florida Keys boat owner trying to get by with money-making trips - both legal and illegal - between Florida and Cuba. However, especially near the end, there are other characters brought in who have absolutely no relation to the book. The impression the reader gets is that these characters and their descriptioons were sitting on Hemingway's desk and he threw them in as filler. Most annoying were a series of character descriptions of people on yachts in a yacht club when the Coast Guard was towing in a boat - completely useless to the book. A freshman in college may cite them as some examples of class disparity, but I think that is giving too much credit.Unless you are completely enamored by Hemingway, I'd skip this one. Frankly, if it weren't by Hemingway I doubt it would have ever been reprinted - if printed at all."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Harry Morgan is a poorly developed charcter. It is difficult to really sympethize with him. He has financial problems but doesn't just turn to smuggling, but murder. Reading a book without being able to sympethize with any character can be tedious. Hemingway may have been trying to show what happens to a man when society pushes him into poverty. The problem is that Morgan has no virtue at any point. Probably Hemingway's worst character."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"The theme of this book seems to be \\"life sucks and then you die.\\" Seriously, it is hard to believe that Ernest Hemingway who is considered one of the great writers of the 20th century wrote it.The novel begins with chapters about a charter boat captain who is down on his luck. He becomes involved in more and more criminal behavior to make money for his family after one of his customers skips out on the bill.The novel then takes a detour through a number of vignettes about brittle, rich sops who hang out at a bar and on yachts and are mostly miserable. Some fight scenes with war veterans also happen in the bar.Then the novel lurches back to the sea captain's ignoble fate at the end, kind of like getting seasick on a small boat.Woven throughout are lots of racial slurs spoken mostly by the sea captain, Harry Morgan.This book was written during the Great Depression and interestingly mentions suicide several times so perhaps Hemingway was depressed when he wrote it. He did end his own life many years later.All in all it was not worth the time I spent reading it after picking it up at the Hemingway House on Key West. Don't read this if you are in a bad mood as it will make you feel even worse.I am giving this three stars with respect to the fact that Mr. Hemingway wrote it. Otherwise I would give it one star."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Although &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; is Ernest Hemingway's minor novel and supposedly one of his worst, I feel that it is one of his best. I found this book much more exciting than any of his other novels, and it is filled with excitement and adventure. It is an easy story to relate with."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"Hemmingway called this his \\"worst novel,\\" and while authors aren't always their own best critics, sometimes they are. Yes this book is Hemmingway. Yes, it has flashes of brilliance. It also has many of his favorite themes: the Gulf of Mexico, tough-talking self-contained men. Bars. Boats. But there's not much to it.There are two problems. One is the loose-knit plot. Just to give one example: There is a maxim in drama that if you're going to show a gun (or a knife, or whatever) in the first act, you'd better use it in the third. This book opens with Harry Morgan witnessing a gunfight involving a bunch of Cubans who blame him for betraying them and threaten to get him eventually. Morgan eventually has plenty of trouble with Cubans...but they're not the same Cubans, and the threat goes nowhere. I kept waiting for them to come back, but apparently they were just window dressing. Which goes for much of the story. As a period piece on the way people behaved in Depression-era Key West bars (where most of it is set) it has some interest, but as a coherent story, it's seriously lacking.That would be a minor problem if Morgan were more interesting. The story shows how he, a former cop, is drawn into a string of illegal activities because he sees no other way to keep his beloved boat and support his family. As it progresses, he gets angrier and more bitter, and the story could have worked as the tale of a man beaten down by the Depression and seduced by the lure of making better money than he could on New Deal public-works projects. But from the start, Morgan is utterly immoral. Within 20 or 30 pages, he's contemplating murder, including the murder of a friend who gets in the way. There's no tragic story here of a good man who loses his way, because Morgan is a stone killer at the start of the book-and gets progressively worse.Bottom line: if you liked Bogie in the movie, you aren't going to like the protagonist of this book. So, unless you're really interested in watching how Hemmingway developed over the course of his career, give this book a pass. That said, if you do want to read the book, this is a handsomely done edition."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"To Have and Have Not is the kind of book that you can barely believe was penned by Ernest Hemingway. This literary giant wrote many a beautiful thing in his day and no matter what terrible things he may have written between his several masterpieces the triumph of his genius cannot be erased. But this book comes as close as any will.To Have and Have Not was Hemingway's most ambitious literary endeavor by a long-shot. And he fails spectacularly. It's a story about a smuggler and his family in Key West, which attempts to dissect the socio-economic injustices of Depression-era United States. This is no easy subject for certain, and his legacy would have been the better for not having attempting the feat. And yet, there is something admirable in Hemingway's attempt even if it does make for a miserable read.The story is disjointed in terms of both time and structure. It's more a sequence of vignettes that fail to add up to a whole with a string of dead-end tangents around every page. When Hemingway broaches the greater social issues of the \`haves and have-nots' as the title suggests, there's little point or connection to the plot. The examination is superficial, boring, and in the end sheds very light on the real issues. On top of that, it might just be the most extensive collection of awful metaphors ever published. Hardly a paragraph goes by without a clunker of a metaphor jumping off the page to stab the reader in his or her brain.The most interesting parts of the story are the colorful scenes at various Key West watering holes, which Hemingway paints to perfection. These are no doubt well-researched, first-hand accounts of the Key West bar scene and its many colorful characters, but they serve no real purpose in the story other than to offer a break from the tired language of the rest of the book.Worst of all, it's impossible to like any of the characters. It's almost as if Hemingway went out of his way to make his characters unappealing. And his attempts to add dimension to these figures simply gives the reader more reasons not to like them.When Hemingway is at his best, he is king. When he's at his worst, his writing makes L. Ron Hubbard look like Shakespeare. And after reading To Have and Have Not, even a TV Guide will look like breathtaking literature. In short, To Have and Have Not read this book, I'd much rather have not.If you do give it a read, try and forget about it quickly. Dwell instead on A Farewell to Arms or The Sun Also Rises . This is the Hemingway that we know and love."},{"Title":"To Have And Have Not","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. He must have been drunk when he wrote it.

In most books I've read the name Francis Marion comes up somewhere. Often, little is said about him, so I have been curious to read more. Although I can not give you an experts analysis of the facts and figures included in the book I can review its composition and attention to detail.This book was excellent to say the least. The book follows Francis Marion from his days at Fort Moultrie through his death. Along the way you get a feel for the man. From his feud with Sumter through his love of family and his country you see a man much different from many others. Bass takes you along with Marion on his many exploits, large and small and fills you in on the major events happening in other colonies as you ride along with Marion and his men.I've read a few books on some of the \\"minor\\" players in the war: John Stark, Daniel Morgan, Nathanael Greene, Henry Knox and Lighthorse Harry Lee to name a few. Some were very good, a couple not so good. This one was head and shoulders above the rest in terms of attention to detail and overall mood of the book. It was not an attempt to make Marion a man he was not by sensationalizing him, nor did Bass confine himself to the major events.I give few books a 5 star rating. This is deserving but I do have one complaint. That is, the lack of maps and pictures. To better understand the strategies Bass dicsusses and Marion executes,it would have been helpful to have maps of the areas, which were somewhat limited, in which Marion operated. Pictures of the major players in the book would have been nice as well.This book was hard to put down once I got started. Very well written."},{"Title":"Swamp Fox: The life and campaigns of General Francis Marion","review":"This book might not be up the scholarly standards of some, but it still is worth reading for most. It is entertaining, and provides some information into the biggest aspects of Marion's life. It does not go into more obscure episodes of the Swamp Fox's life, but mentions them and moves on. For most general readers, this is all that is needed to gain a picture of the horrible conditions associated with the American Revolution in the South. Marion was someone who is worthy of our attention, as he was responsible for pushing South Carolina to accept American independence, as well as the cost of fighting for it. Bass offers a masterstroke of a book that captures this episode of American history, but without mentioning the subject's motivations for doing what he did. At any rate, get this book and enjoy a tale of the American Revolution."},{"Title":"Swamp Fox: The life and campaigns of General Francis Marion","review":"Swamp Fox minutely details many of Gen, Francis Marion's campaigns and battles. It also provides us with many biographical details of Marion before and after the American Revolutionary War.We see in Marion not only a cunning strategist and tactician (the bane of the harsh British Lt. Col. Tarleton), but also a man of high principles who refused to compromise them when he stood nearly alone on them. For example, we see him opposing cruelty when it was shown either by the enemy or to them.To read the book is to be convinced that Francis Marion is one of the most underrated of the American generals during the revolutionary war and one of the finest examples of the patriots."},{"Title":"Swamp Fox: The life and campaigns of General Francis Marion","review":"This is a great book to sink your teeth into. It deals with major battles as well as the multiple skirmishes fought by the southern militia. I felt as if I was there in the swamps, and hovering over the battlefield fighting along with these men.

This book also made me want to know more about Nathaniel Greene. (next book!)

One will quickly notice that Marion is using \\"part time\\" soldiers - militia. He's not fighting major battles. He's not an integral part of any major campaign.The military history reader will easily notice that what Marion and his men are doing is the same thing T.E. Lawrence and his Arab raiders were doing to the Ottoman Turks in WWI. Swamp Fox caused the British to divert troops to protect their lines of supply - sometimes elite units such as Banastre Tarleton's legion.The reader will also note that Marion is defending patriot civilians from Loyalist attacks - often simply by his presence in the countryside. In other words, he's protecting the friendly, civilian population.The author does a very good job of showing the disdain Horatio Gates had for such men and the much wiser attitude of Nataniel Greene who could see the benefits of men such as Marion and exhorted him to even greater effort.The author does a very good job of putting together numerous sources to give the reader a very comprehensive account of all the small actions undertaken by Col. Marion and his militia troops.This is an excellent work for both the military historian in respect to irregular warfare and how it can assist conventional campaigns as well as readers of Revolutionary War accounts. I recommend this with five stars."},{"Title":"Swamp Fox: The life and campaigns of General Francis Marion","review":"One of the real heroes of the Revolution - underscores the difficulties that Gen.

Then they learn that he believed that the end justifies the means and that it is better to be feared than loved, etc. etc. The truth of the matter is that Machiavelli was quite brilliant, logical and very reasonable in his thinking. That between the Discourses and The Prince, he created a wonderful course in The Lessons of Leadership and Running a Country or a Business. He actually knocked out The Prince in short order, where The Discourses took him a great deal of time to write. My recommendation is to do your due diligence on the life of Machiavelli, his relationship with the DeMedici's, background on some of those he writes about like Cesare Borgia, and by all means come to understand who Livy is and what he wrote and accomplished. It will not take you long to do this. It will just provide you some worthwhile insight to Machiavelli and will allow you to better understand and interpret what he was promoting and why he wrote the things he did. And in this case, if you are a student of leadership or even political science, the end will indeed justify the means!"},{"Title":"The discourses (Pelican classics)","review":"The astute comments on the First Ten Books of Titus Livius show the author of \`The Prince' in a slightly different daylight, as a rather more balanced political analyst than the staunch defender of Leviathan rule.His comments cover such important issues as war and peace, corruption and justice, the role of religion, the essential forms and players in the political theatre at home and abroad.They reflect Machiavelli's pessimistic vision on mankind.The nature of mankindFor Machiavelli, men are more prone to evil than to good. Men never do good unless necessity drives them to it. Hunger and poverty make men industrious and laws make them good. All men are ill content, for desire always exceeds the power of attainment. They are also deceitful, organize conspiracies and speak with a double tongue.Forms of governmentMachiavelli discerns three good typed of government, which, however, can easily become corrupt. Principality (Monarchy) can turn into Tyranny; Aristocracy can become Oligarchy; Democracy can break up in Anarchy.His ideal is a blend of the three good types, like the one introduced by Lycurgus in Sparta, which lasted for 800 years.The players at homeThe core conflict in a State is the clash between those who want to keep (the haves, the upper class) and those who want to acquire (the have-nots, the plebs).Fearing that they might loose everything, the haves in Rome granted the plebs a say in political affairs by creating the tribunate. In order to fight corruption and \`malignant humours' they built a judicial network with many (not few) judges.Rome's army was based on a mix of Roman and foreign soldiers under the helm of Roman generals.ReligionFor Machiavelli, religion is a necessary means for the maintenance of a civilized State. A great fear of God helps to produce good men and to control the armies.Neglect of divine worship is a sure indication of the decline of a nation.Empire buildingFor Machiavelli, the causes of war are the desire to subjugate or the fear to be subjugated.Rome waged wars out of ambition (territory, wealth, power), but also to crush those who wanted to acquire territories (the Gauls).Rome's international policy was based on alliances, in which it reserved the headship and the capital for itself. After a victory in war, it never adopted a middle course. The vanquished were treated generously (even offered Roman citizenship) or completely wiped out. The spoils of war entered into the coffers of the republic.Ultimate verdict: a reactionaryMachiavelli stands staunchly on the side of the haves. He applauds profusely all the measures taken by them in order to soothe the have-nots: gods, judges, Tribunes (what he doesn't say is that the Tribunes had to be unanimous in their decisions). The latter gave the populace a say in political affairs, but not a \`have'. The have-nots had to live in poverty and to stay hungry to make them industrious. The imperial wars served the \`common good' of the republic, which was controlled by haves.Machiavelli's book is an in depth unraveling of political systems, of national and international tactics deployed by the haves in order to control their home base and to expand their wealth and power abroad.It is still a highly relevant comment and should not be missed.N.B. Machiavelli's exhaustive comments on conspiracies have been summarized in this book."},{"Title":"The discourses (Pelican classics)","review":"Considering the social and cultural landscape of the contemporary West, one cannot help but wonder whether we can pull out of our downward slide, and what are the odds of doing so.An interesting analysis of this issue is provided by Machiavelli, in his \\"Discourses\\" (1517). In this deeply insightful book, a commentary on the work of the Roman historian Titus Livius (Livy), Machiavelli examines the ebb and flow of the Roman republic, applying its lessons to the affairs of his own era, and to the life of nations in general. (Note that this is the republican period of Rome, c. 510 - 44 BC, before the advent of the great emperors.)Let's start with the bad news. Machiavelli is not particularly optimistic about a country's ability to adapt to new circumstances:\\"There are two reasons why we are unable to change when we need to: In the first place, we cannot help being what nature has made us; in the second, if one style of behavior has worked well for us in the past, we cannot be persuaded we would be better off acting differently. The consequence is that one's fortune changes, for the times change, and one's behavior does not. Another consequence is that cities are destroyed, for the institutions of a republic are never modified to suit changing circumstances...Change comes too late because it is too difficult to accomplish.\\"If that weren't enough of an obstacle, we are also subject to the whims of fortune; i.e., to circumstances that are beyond our control:\\"If you will think sensibly about how people's lives are shaped, you will see that often events and accidents occur against which the heavens were determined we should have no protection. Seeing this sort of thing happened to the Romans, who were so skillful, pious, and well-organized, it is not surprising that it happens much more often to cities or regions who lack these advantages.\\"Machiavelli goes on to relate Livy's account of Rome's near-demise following an invasion from southern France, which wasn't repelled until the barbarians were threatening the Capitol itself. The Romans, at that time still relatively vulnerable, could not pull together until their very heart was threatened:\\"Fortune, in order to make Rome all the greater and build her up to the power she eventually attained, judged it necessary to give her a nasty shock...but did not want, at this point, to destroy her completely...In order to bring [change] about, the whole society must feel endangered; it is not enough for just one individual to change his mind.\\"It doesn't require much imagination to apply this wisdom to the contemporary West. Consider the mass immigration from the Third World, leading, in some European countries, to a now-foreseeable usurpation of the native population and culture. It is likely that only a shock of great magnitude would be capable of stalling this locomotive. One can only hope that, as was the case with the Roman republic, \\"fortune\\" does not intend to destroy us completely.There are, still, many things that can be done to stave off ruin, says Machiavelli. It is not inevitable. But the task is great, and can only be accomplished by the clarion call of first principles. This is the subject of the chapter entitled \\"On how, if you want a movement or state to survive for long, you must repeatedly bring it back to its founding principles.\\" Here, we read that\\"there is nothing more essential in any form of communal life, whether of a movement, a kingdom, or a republic, than to restore it the reputation it had when it was first founded, and to strive to ensure there are either good institutions or good men who can bring this about, so that one is not dependent on having some external intervention before reform can occur...it is so dangerous there are no circumstances in which one should hope for it.\\"Machiavelli also emphasizes that to be successful, our behavior must be adapted to the era in which we live. Bold, impetuous action may be perfect at one moment yet disastrous at another. When the Roman army was broken and demoralized, General Fabius avoided defeat against Hannibal by being cautious. Later, when a bold strike was needed, the daring Scipio was appointed to the task. The switch, a fortuitous adaptation, could be accomplished because\\"a republic can adapt itself more easily to changing circumstances because it can call on citizens of differing characters. Someone who is used to proceeding in a particular way will never change.\\"We certainly possess \\"citizens of differing characters.\\" But will the right ones be called upon at the right time?"},{"Title":"The discourses (Pelican classics)","review":"There are two mean reasons to read Machiavelli:Firstly, Machiavelli gives in his books a deep insight in political and psychological principals. Some comment on how these principals are - at times - conflicting. This I find Machiavelli's main strength: he shows that choices need to be made, that there isn't an unconditional best choice, but that the best choice is dependent upon circumstances (he tries to give insight in the circumstances) and that the worst is not to make a consistent choice.For instance: when one conquers a city, one can subject it's inhabitants by being making them love you, or fear you. Which one chooses is also dependent on whether you attack a new city, or a city previously under your control, if one wants to make an example out of them (and what kind), etc. Most important however is that one must choice between making your subjects love you or hate you (you can't torture a person and then try to win his love).Secondly, it is worth reading Machiavelli because of his literary abilities. He writes with charm, ease and lack of difficult words, he gives interesting and innovative illustrations, he has written two books that are real pageturners but that also give a new and deeper insight in society (so new that their books are still read today, and not just by literary scholars).The general applicability of the principal used above, can be seen at relations (most couples stay together because of love, but some because they fear retribution by their partner), at parent/child level (parents either making their children obey because of fear of punishment, or by giving them a sense of responsibility and trust), at companies (a manager can motivate employees by either making them fear for losing their jobs, or by making them share company ideals and values) and at governmental level (Saddam ruled Iraq by fear, while a real democracy must be run by love - or at least lack of fear - for their leader).At all the previous examples one can see that both situations can work, but the greatest mistake is not to make a consistent choice. It would be as great a mistake for Osama Bin Laden to try and win American love for the Islam by sending planes in the Twin Towers, as for Bush to try and win Iraqi love for democracy and justice by making a policy out of torturing unconvicted Iraqi's (and violating other civil rights). (Hopefully there will be an inquiry that will convince Iraqi's that the torture in the Abu Graib prison wasn't government policy, so that the faith in America, democracy and justice will be restored)."},{"Title":"The discourses (Pelican classics)","review":"I ordered the book as a gift, but it was never received and I was told it was rejected, although the recipient says he did NOT reject the item...in fact the recipient specifically requested the item.

Though other works existed, Machiavelli chose Livy's histories because Livy was an eye witness to the fall of the Roman Republic.Machiavelli's purpose for writing The Discourses can be summed up in one line: &quot;The multitude is wiser and more constant than a prince.&quot; More to-the-point, however is the later phraise: &quot;A corrupt and disorderly multitude can be spoken to by some worthy person and can easily be brought around to the right way, but a bad prince cannot be spoken to by anyone, and the only remedy for his case is COLD STEEL.&quot;With every stroke of his pen, Machiavelli sets out to prove the superiority of a republican form of government. He values freedom of the citizenry above all else, and provides princes everywhere with grizzly tales of what happens when it is restricted. His influence on the Founding Fathers, and particularly on the works of Paine and Jefferson, is evident. Our current leaders would find themselves more secure if they stuck to Machiavelli's principles."},{"Title":"The discourses (Pelican classics)","review":"Machiavelli's second most famous work, this book deals with the author's commentary on the way the Roman Republic was run and why it was so successful in expanding its borders. He stresses the reason it was so stable and successful was the solid core of reasonable laws, a standing army of professional soldiers and plunder/tribute from surrounding countries.He illustrates the ways in which the good ideas of the ancient Romans could be applied in contemporary politics (it was written during the XVI century).Unlike the Prince, which propandasizes his personal political opinions and describes the ideal ruler, the Discourses deal mainly with mundane economic and social issues, with little personal opinion.It is filled with anecdotes about the lives of interesting or exceptional Romans and is not that difficult a read at all. In reading it for my first-year history class, I found it was a very good summary of the complicated life of the Roman Republic (it deals very little with the time of the Empire)."},{"Title":"The discourses (Pelican classics)","review":"Although much can be learned from modern writers about the history of Italy, the sentiments and evaluations of politicians and historians of this period (sixteenth century) are unique to their day. It is wonderful to read Machiavelli's evaluation of Livy's historical accounts and see why certain actions which would be shunned by modern writers made perfect sense then. Such accounts help the reader not to be trapped in his own day's thought processes, but have an expanded scope of history. Very enlightening!"},{"Title":"The discourses (Pelican classics)","review":"THIS IS ABOUT the edition with Ninian Hill Thomson as the translator. i returned it, which is exceedingly rare for me, because the table of contents lacked the descriptive notations and there was no commentary or introductory analysis with the edition. the book itself is also in a cumbersome format, but that could have been excused. i sent it back and bought the modern library edition (prince and discourses combined) instead."},{"Title":"The discourses (Pelican classics)","review":"I'd recommend this book to anyone who might've enjoyed books like Sun Tzu's &quot;Art of War&quot; or Robert Greene's &quot;The 48 Laws of Power&quot; or even someone who is even religious (Muslim, Christian, etc.) who might not be too afraid of understanding the perspective of a politician. I mix in religion because, perhaps to someone who subscribes to a more &quot;pious&quot; take on life, Machiavelli may hold a severely secular stigma. But this book may offer an alternative, if even more secular, view on the decisions made by religious/state leaders like Moses and Muhammad. As for those who also are into government conspiracy theories I'd also recommend this book- mix it with what you already think and you may come up with some more original theories of your own! ;)Machiavelli comes across as a learned observer of mankind and expresses a rare understanding of the continual state of flux of mankind. Through his studies of history and in comparing past events to &quot;present&quot; (circa 1500s) ones Machiavelli makes strongly supported arguments throughout the discourses. Where Robert Greene falls short in &quot;48 Laws&quot; I believe is Machiavelli's stronger point- applying the [quite helpful] description of the characteristics of the parties involved which helps the reader summate the outcomes [of many of the events that are described throughout his discourses] right along with the reading. &quot;48 Laws&quot; does this well at times but falls short of this fluidity with many of his examples which can leave a certain level of disparity between the example(s) given and the &quot;Law&quot; to which it applies.In summary I'd note that this is one of the few books that I wish didn't finish. I don't agree with him on every point, but I admire the proofs to his arguments on every page."},{"Title":"The discourses (Pelican classics)","review":"The 16th century Florentine statesman Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli is mostly known for his work \\"The Prince\\", arguably the most ill-reputed book ever written, perhaps apart from Hitler's \\"Mein Kampf\\". However, \\"The Prince\\" seems to have been a purely empirical study of Italian politics, or perhaps even a rhetorical exercise. In other words, Machiavelli didn't really mean it! At least that's one possible interpretation (yes, the most charitable one).So what were Machiavelli's real positions? Many scholars believe that these are laid out in \\"The Discourses\\", a work almost unknown to the general public. Its full title is \\"Discourses on the First Ten Books of Titus Livy\\". Using the ancient Roman Republic as his model, Machiavelli attempts to analyze the role of fortune and virtue in history, the art of war, and the best system of government. There are certain similarities between \\"The Discourses\\" and \\"The Prince\\". Both works contain their fair share of pragmatic Realpolitik. On the whole, however, \\"The Discourses\\" show Machiavelli in a much better light than \\"The Prince\\". Machiavelli actually turns out to be an advocate of a democratic republic! Indeed, since Machiavelli supported the republican side during the political conflicts in Florence, it's safe to assume that *this* is the real Machiavelli.\\"The Discourses\\" is not a particularly systematic work. It contains no fully worked-out political theory, and suffers from bad editing. (Machiavelli even admits this in his foreword.) The most interesting part is Book One, which deals with constitutional issues. Book Two, about the expansion of the Romans, is moderately interesting, while Book Three is the most disjointed. Since Machiavelli discourses on ancient Roman history, a working knowledge of the subject might be handy when reading his work. Despite the somewhat confusing character of \\"The Discourses\\", the main lines of argument are still discernible.Machiavelli clearly believes that a free republic is the best form of government. The republic should have a division of power between the elite groups and the common people, something akin to the ancient Roman system where power was divided between patricians and plebeians. The republic should not use foreign, mercenary troops to defend itself. It must use its own soldiers. This is a point to which Machiavelli returns again and again, apparently since he believed that the Italian city-states of his own day lost their freedom due to reliance on mercenaries and even foreign officials. Wide income or class differentials are negative. Citizens should be frugal or even poor. A true citizen should be ready to serve in any position, high as well as lowly. A dictator might be temporarily appointed during a state of emergency, but only for a limited period, and only under constitutional forms. (A similar system existed in the Roman Republic.)There is a great deal of ambivalence in \\"The Discourses\\" towards the common people. On the one hand, they are seen as a safeguard against tyranny. On the other hand, Machiavelli feared the fickleness and passions of the mob, and exclaims that a crowd without a head is useless. Despite his notion that wide income differences are negative, he nevertheless opposes the Agricultural Law, which would have re-distributed property in the Roman Republic from the upper class to the plebeians. There is also a contradiction between wanting the citizens to be frugal, and keeping patricians in power. Perhaps Machiavelli subconsciously identified the Roman patricians with the \\"bourgeois\\" middle class of his own time? In another part of \\"The Discourses\\", he explicitly writes that aristocratic nobles idly living off large estates should be literally exterminated! From his middling position, Machiavelli was equally suspicious of both landed gentry and the lower classes. Still, he seems to veer towards the latter.Naturally, Machiavelli cannot refrain from giving some very pragmatic and \\"Machiavellian\\" advice in his work. His view of religion is typical in this regard (and the childish attempts of the translator to explain away the anti-Christian remarks as pro-Christian are perhaps even more typical). To Machiavelli, religion is a political tool, nothing more. If the people is religious, it's easier to keep in line. Rulers should uphold the religious traditions of their society, whatever these might be, and whatever they might think of them in private. However, one should never sacrifice the good of the state for a religious principle, and Machiavelli gives an almost humorous example of how the Romans attempted to circumvent a bad augury while still pretending to believe in it! He further states that paganism was better than Christianity, since paganism made people more virile, warlike and freedom-loving. Christianity has made people more prone to tolerate bad governments in the hope of heavenly salvation, rather than to fight for freedom in the here and now. (One almost waits for Nietzsche's statement that Christianity is a slave morality!) The out-spoken Machiavelli even questions whether Friar Savonarola (whom he supported) really was a prophet conferring with angels, although he quickly qualifies this by saying that the Friar was a very holy man, etc. (Savonarola was the leader of a republican revolution in Florence in 1494.) Please note that Machiavelli didn't mind Savonarola *claiming* that he spoke to angels, as long as this was politically useful. He makes a similar point about the ancient Roman king Numa, who claimed to have frequent meetings with a supernatural nymph about grave matters of state.There is a great deal of ambivalence in Machiavelli's discussions about the Roman military expansion. He claims that Roman expansion was due to the Romans forming alliances with other peoples (albeit under Roman leadership), allowing non-Romans to settle in Rome, and letting conquered cities keep their own laws and traditions. In other words, he attempts to paint the Roman imperial expansion in as benign and \\"republican\\" light as possible, presumably to avoid the obvious problem that it eventually replaced the republic with an autocratic empire. However, he also admires the peoples who resisted the Roman expansion, seeing them as free republics. As a good Florentine, Machiavelli naturally feels a certain anachronistic aversion to the Roman conquest of \\"Tuscany\\" (actually Etruria). The discourses capture the dilemma in the following sentence: \\"Had the Romans not prolonged offices and military commands, they would not have attained such great power in so short a time, and, had they been slower in making conquests, they would also have been slower to arrive at servitude\\". Precisely. Here Machiavelli finally says what we somehow want him to say: imperial expansions leads to...well, empires, not republics!Finally, I noticed that Machiavelli has some problems with Sparta and Venice. They don't conform to his more democratic republican model, and yet, Machiavelli is forced to admit that both these polities were very stable and lasted for an extremely long time. Somehow, you get the feeling that he treats them as anomalies in a world where everything else is in constant flux. The discourses also contain an interesting discussion about how Spartan and Venetian imperial expansion eventually led to their downfall.\\"The Discourses\\" are an interesting early attempt to formulate a modern, moderately democratic republicanism. Readers who previously saw Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli as some kind of monster, might get a more positive picture of the man. He may not have been perfect, but at least he comes across as an honest statesman wrestling with difficult issues.This is the real Machiavelli."},{"Title":"The discourses (Pelican classics)","review":"Machiavelli's Discourses... a book that is a compendium of historical events analyzed in such a way as to obtain a lesson that is both precise as well as eternal.

I know what the subject matter is, but that doesn't mean that texts on the subject have to make you fall asleep.Just because I'm anal retentive about the smaller things, the proofreader of this text needs to be shot in the head- there's probably one typo per page. The book is labeled as an introductory text, but I found it to be rather in-depth (admittedly, I picked this up as a primer for a plasticity course I am taking in the fall). There isn't much of an introduction- the author just kind of picks up assuming you know what most of the basics are. The author goes over some important stuff in a mere sentence, and then goes on and on and on and on and on about some trite points...I think that this book is twice as thick as it needs to be. Don't get me wrong, I love the fact that there are many examples, but the differences between some are rather minute. I also love the fact that the examples are mostly related to practical, realistic manufacturing problems. It's my observation that most practicing engineers use finite elements when it comes to plasticity, and this book doesn't really cover it that much or that well...though I don't know that it should, given the goal of the text.I don't know if there are any better or any worse texts, but this one is probably worth overlooking, unless you want to see the derivations some of the formulas in the various (manufacturing) engineering handbooks."},{"Title":"Basic Engineering Plasticity: An Introduction with Engineering and Manufacturing Applications","review":"This book is not very carefully examined before publication.

Bottom line is that all this writers books are very entertaining to a high degree. I look forward to his next piece of work with anticipation and just wanted to warn all the spoiled readers out there that reviews should be written with a broader use of thought instead of focusing on first reactions which is known as tunnel vision.

I have read a lot of books where that wasn't the case. I've picked up some 6 months later before finishing. If you are looking for a book focusing only upon Drizzt, then you will surely be disapointed. But Drizzt on his own gets dull really. Its how he reacts to the world around him that matters. Exile was good, but didn't really turn into something great until Drizzt found his way to Blingenstone. And when you see and here people complaining that the book didn't resolve enough, remember, if the story isn't compelling, why do they care if it continues?

I also cannot figure out the point of the trilogy, the situation at the end of the book is basically the same as the situation at the beginnng, nothing has been resolved.

These are just a few of the words that come to mind in describing this \\"concluding\\" book to the trilogy. A friend and I were discussing how it might end just after the second book in the trilogy came out and basically nailed it. The only part we missed was O'bould dying. I don't mind giving spoilers here because there is nothing to spoil. Why orcs anyway. The great invincible Drizzt loses to an orc of all things. He suddenly turns into a helpless novice simply to allow O'bould to live so Salvatore doesn't have to think up a new story whenever he gets back to Drizzt. How it is possible to write 300 words of nothing is beyond me. I own every book Salvatore has written on Drizzt and it is no longer his strong point. He needs to get back to his roots and write about evil Drow. If he never comes back to Drizzt, I could care less. I may be able to forgive him if he finally writes the series that Jarlaxle and Entreri so deserve. They are infinitely more interesting than Drizzt, Drizzta, Drizztb Drizztc etc. Hopefully he will ditch the Drizzt diaries also. How many times can you rewrite the same thing? Apparently quite a few....."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I own all books written by R. A. Salvatore concerning Drizzt.

I'm a big fan and anybody who wants to read/likes to read books of this nature I would definitely recommend in doing so."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Great concept to start the trilogy an orc king rallying all the orc tribes together to claim land for themselves so that they can be looked at as a real race and society of the realm. The novels progress and not much develops, in fact the second novel really doesn't even need to be read, just read the last couple chapters. This third novel is more of the same to the point it is like nothing I have ever read by Salvatore, minus the Wulfgar novel. He writes at such a slow pace you feel like he is preparing a 10 book series of 6,000 pages and by the end it is what you fear there was no end.Fans of these books, like I am, will be disappointed because there is not much to love. The typical one on one fight scenes Salvatore is known for putting you in the action have been traded for clumsy mass combat with little description. The once love you had for one of the group will not continue because most of the story revolves around others and the heroes are the supporting cast, with only glimpses of the old Icewind Dale group for mere moments.Twenty years of writing has not done well with this band of heroes because Salvatore is stuck in a time capsule and never lets the story evolve.The Hunter's Blade Trilogy is one I would not recommend, however a must read for fans because the new Transitions trilogy is a continuation of these events. Lets all hope by \\"Transitions\\" Salvatore has a new idea and ventures far from this one.Not recommended."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that several of RA Salvatore's works have been some of the best books I've ever read. So it's hard to see him produce such an uninspired work that could have been written for a freshman creative writing course. The beautiful imagery and rich character development that are such a trademark of his novels and makes them so entertaining is completely absent in the Two Swords. Even his beautifully narrated fight scenes have regressed into mind numbing hack-and-slash. It seems like it was written simply to fulfill a contractual obligation. Frankly I'd rather send him $25 and not have him write something like this."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"While I think its about time Drizzt was with a female, not Cattie-Brie!

Hey, she will be an old woman in another 30 years and Drizzt will just finally be an adult elf at about 100. Do us a favor R.A. and set Drizzt up somebody half-elven at least. Then they at least have a chance at some sort of relationship. You could play on the fact that half-elves have trouble being accepted in both human and elven worlds. I just say again, NOT Cattie-Brie!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"As the conclusion to the Hunter's Blades Trilogy, the Two Swords falls a bit short of being a five star book. While still a very good Salvatore novel it just seemed to be lacking some things.First, Drizzt is barely in this book. While the final act is all Drizzt, for the most part he is non-existant throughout. An odd thing to do since the trilogy is called The Hunter's Blades and the last novel \\"The Lone Drow\\" was all Drizzt. So we went from him being the focus, to kind of dropping out of site.The second problem was that the cast was way to big. There are too many dwarf characters to follow. Did we really need to hear the story of Nikwillig coming down the mountain, following the Felbarr army and then meeting the elves of Moonwood? Or Fendes who seemed to die three times in the book just to come out fine in another chapter? Dwarf characters that we know were disregarded in the same way as Drizzt. Why is the battlerager Thippledorf Pwent in no major scene? In fact he is only mentioned twice I think. And consider Torgar and the Mirabar dwarfs who were such a prominent role in \\"Thousand orcs\\" have no more than a cameo in the middle of the book.The last problem is the biggest. There really is no conclusion to this storyline. The book could have left things open for more books, but there has to be some sort of conclusion, otherwise this really can't be called a trilogy. It is written more like a continuous series.Finally, this is still a very good read. Great battles, good characters, amazing action. I still think that \\"The Lone Drow\\" was the best in the trilogy because of its focus on Drizzt and its very dark tone. But this is certainly better than \\"Thousand Orcs\\" if you were disappointed in that like I was. May Drizzt never stop fighting!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I have to agree with most every one....this was terribly lame.R.A.

But this was the best book out of the Hunter's Blade Trilogy and shows more maturity than most of his Forgotten Realms books. Which are enjoyable for the most part and create some interesting characters, but tends to make them too powerful and lacking any vulnerabilities. That is why I lost interest in the almost invulnerable Drizzit. The ideas may be interesting, but there is rarely any question on weather or not he will survive.This one was a little different. This time the bad guy wasn't an ambitious individual, a group from the Underdark, or some artifact, it was someone touched by a god and a possible avatar. True there were people in the shadows, but they have less control over events than they think.In the first Two books it showed how an ambitious Orc decided to make a deal with the Frost Giants, a few renegade Drow, and a pack of Trolls. This pleased me for a few reasons. The Orcs and Goblins were named as a nemesis, but they never seemed like more than dirty brutes that die by the thousands against Elves and Dwarves. A good nemesis has to be an actual threat. This is an Orc that got feuding tribes to join under his banner and negotiates successfully with other races. More like the Tolkien Orcs and Goblins that weren't refined or compared to other races, but clever,strong, and apt at fighting.In this final book everyone is worried. The Orc armies are still growing and taking ground despite losses. Some say it is the tens of thousands and they are staying together and keeping fights minimal. Obould has formed a near cult around himself, even the cynical Drow think he might be touched by Grumpsh. The near immortal Drizzit starts showing concern for the sheer power and influence that the Orc chieftan displays, as well as constraint in battle. The dwarves are worried because he has his armies set on the Doorstep of Mithral Hall. Though they are not as effective as the disciplined Dwarves, they outnumber them more than 20 to one.This book isn't as good as the books he writes out of the Forgotten Realms universe, but it is one of his better works. The ending is a bit of a dissppointment, but it opens it up for another trilogy. But it finally gave the Orcs a much needed day in the sun and show themselves as more than lackies for evil geniuses or nuisances for Drizzit and the good reaces to practice their swordwork on."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Remember - there is no great hero without a great villain! Gone are the days of Matron Baenre, Llolth, Zak, the Underdark, dragons, the shard, Entreri, etc... We need more than an Orc with great armor! That was awful! I mean - give me Ellifain's superElf brother or something!Salvatore is a great writer but has failed to come with a good idea to breathe new life into his stories about Drizzt and his company. Much like Jordan - the books seem to go nowhere. Whether it is writing a book a hundred years into the future, including Cadderly or maybe some other forgotten realms characters, or another trip to the underdark - he has to do something which will break the monotony of what we are becoming used to: one of the main characters thinks another is dead, he/she gets pissed and kills everyone, a reunion with the main characters...."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I don't write reviews that often, but this book compared to other RAS books was horrible at best. It took me over a year just to read it because I got bored so easily with it, and if it weren't for my overseas flights I probably would have never finished it. The fight scenes were a dull read, which typically are the most enthralling piece. I've read The Dark Elf Trilogy, Crystal Shard series, etc., so I have some ground to get a comparison off of his previous writings. It just seemed to me there was no excitement in this book that kept me from putting it down, instead I just wanted to read it, finish it, then drop it off at the used bookstore."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Perhaps this was not the best Drizzt saga but it was far from disappointing.

Even though overall I enjoyed reading this book, I found that it lacked something.

Out of all the Drizzt books, I think I least liked this book."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"As a collective, I enjoyed the entire Hunters Blades Trilogy quite a bit, mostly due to the fact that this body of works has a slightly darker feel to it than Salvatores' past Realms novels. The battle scenes were described in excellent detail (as always), the introspectives with established characters was good (if a bit stale), and the introduction of new characters gave Salvatores corner of the Realms a bit more dimension. However, in The Two Swords, everything just seemed to end far too abruptly. As usual, the story was (obviously) left open for future novels, but it's just not like Bob to leave so many loose ends lying around. It felt to me that, ultimately, NOTHING was really resolved.A good book that ended in a good way if this series wasn't a trilogy, but being the last of the three novels, I was a bit disappointed.One more thing: for the love of all the gods that ever were, PLEASE kill Wulgar . . .again . . .for good this time."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Ok, maybe it wasn't \\"gentle.\\" But I, and I'm sure most everyone else who's read this incredibly violent, dark, and surprising trilogy up until now will come into this book expecting the huge, epic, final battle - all the \\"goodly\\" armies of the region taking on Obould's thousands of orcs.Well, to you I say - just read the book. The first third of the book is absolutely incredible - the whole thing is rolling along just as you've pictured it. The other armies are coming in, \\"legendary\\" characters are showing up. It looks like Drizzt will finally, finally return to Mithral Hall and find his beloved friends are still alive.Then...things take a turn. The Two Swords start to fumble, start to slow. Things aren't progressing the way you thought they would. There's some surprising things that happen, some twists you might not appreciate at first.I say \\"at first\\" because the book truly does have a resolution, and a fitting ending. R.A. Salvatore was able to create, in Obould, a villain that actually had a real purpose, a strong belief system, a good reason to do everything that he does. I, for one, was rooting for Obould throughout the entire trilogy, and I was hoping that his dreams of an Orc Kingdom - dreams when the Orcs can share the sunlight with Elves and Humans - would come true. The fact that you can agree with, and even CHEER for, what was initially supposed to be the \\"bad guy\\" is a real testament to the storyteller's gift that R.A. Salvatore posseesses.The characters undergo pretty drastic changes...they're still the same characters you know and love, but they're not completely unchanged after all they've gone through. They're becoming more and more like \\"real people\\" - they all have huge emotional burdens, but throughout this book they begin to get over them, to become true to themselves - or, at least, they can finally define what being \\"true\\" to themselves really mean.All told, reading this books is quite the enriching experience. This trilogy was easily among the best of all the Drizzt books, and this final book does it justice. There's a fine resolution at the ending, leaving you satisfied, while still looking forward to the further adventures of these legendary heroes."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Let's face it, R.A. Salvatore has somewhat lost his touch. As of late, his books just are not up to par as to how great he used to be. I think back on some of his earlier work such as The Dark Elf Trilogy and the Demon Wars and then I read this one and I shake my head in disappointment. Salvatore's Drizzt books used to be so great and unpredictable but now it's all changed.This book was quite stale. You had Bruenor on his death bed but yet the entire thing was pointless because you KNEW that he was going to come back to life. The fight scenes were OK but even those were not as good as Salvatore back in the past. Whatever happened to good old one-on-one fight scenes that RAS excelled in?In order for Salvatore to spice up his Drizzt series, he needs to refresh it by letting some of his main characters die. It is far past due for a major death to take place.Overall, \\"The Hunters Blades\\" trilogy was a poor series and nowhere near Salvatore's earlier work."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I also own and have read and reread all of the dark elf books and love this character. This book was a real let down as far as an ending, and the character was really dull at the end. You expected so much more from Drizzt and from Rob that i wish he had put more time into this. Hopefully he can put the zap back into his character before the next book. SPOILER&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; also upset that the book flap review hinting that Drizzt would have to choice between life and death when the scene never got that much energy. this was a big let down!!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I was very much let down by the conclusion of this book. Nothing becomes resolved except long, drawn out reunion of the companions. I think that Salvatore has to either return Drizzt to his roots of the greatest warrior in the realms or just let him fade away. How long can readers follow his exploits when he is constantly brought down by orcs and goblins after hearing how he defeated demons and dragons? I cannot begin to explain my sorrow at having bought this book in hardcover when it is hardly worth the paperback price. I own every book Rob has ever written but this is the first I have ever felt betrayed afterwards. Please let him learn the error of his ways soon before I move on and find more interesting tales to follow."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"*I will try to avoid giving any spoilers, as this book is worth the read simply for the sake of knowing the end of the Drizzt saga first hand. However, since I'll inevitably give a ton away anyway, dont read this until you've read the novel and formed your own opinions on the events which transpire within.To be fair to The Two swords, the first half of the book \\"lived\\" right (4.5 to five stars) up to my expectations, with all the customary wit, intreuge, and flashing swords we have come to expect from Salvatore. I felt that this portion of the book carried on the series nicely, and set us all up for either a glorious defeat of the orc hordes and an alliance of the goodly folk of the Marches, or atleast a darring assasination of Oblould or Greti, setting back Grummsh's plans of conquest. I'm sorry to say we dont get either, or even an unlooked for way out (I was half expecting Kaer'lic's fears to turn out ture and Drizzt to be guided to vicotry by Lolth herself.). What we do get is an indesicive conclusion to what was otherwise a very strong series, and a disapointingly rushed one at that. While there where still some noteworthy moments in the later portion of the novel (with Drizzt's deafeat and Kazid'Hea's possesion of Delly Curtie), I found much of it to be simply page filling meteral and not very well thought out. Before I go on, let me explain my rationel for seeing Drizzt's defeat as a good thing. Quite simply, we've all seen him win enough time's to half convince us and the rest of Fearun that he is invincible. That is not so, nor should it be. In the FR, we have far to many perfect heros, undefeatable and righeous (cough cough, ELMINSTER!). By proving Drizzt not to be one of these, Salvatore demonstrates a noble goal, even if it wasn't brought to fruition as well as I'd have liked (If Dirzzt has to be beat, I'm sure you could have thought up a better way to bring it about then encasing the villian in perfect armor, and then making Drizzt drop his sword, I mean, the elfs been training with weapons for decades, he is not going to make a clumsy mistake like that, even if Obould has the strength of a god.) Back to my original rantings, I found the ending protion of the book to have the same rushed feeling about it as the end of the fith Harry Potter. If Salvatore had just taken 100 more pages to fill out Drizzt's reuniting with his old companions, maybe found a better way to reinterduce Obould after his apparent death, and given Inovinndil a better departure (all those elfie smiles for Dirzzt's happiness where a little much, even for one of the elder races.) So, for the end portion of the book, I award 2.5 to 3 stars. Averaged out, the total marks should be around 4 stars, but I thing that a books faults can override its strengths, so I'll give the Two Swords a 3.5, and since Amazon doesn't allow for half stars (ALTHOUGH THEY SHOULD!!!!!), I must resign myself to awarding a three."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Mr. Salvatore seems to have run out of orignial ideas and new plots. This book is same ole...same ole...And since none of his main characters ever dies, there isn't much suspense in the battles. Plus just how many different ways can you continue to chop up an orc or a troll and make it interesting? When he first introduced us to Drizzit, each book was a brand new adventure with new and exciting characters and action. Now it seems that if you have read one you have read them all. I wish the author would get inspired and give us something new and exciting. And occasiontaly kill one of the characters. After all, evil does triumph now and then. Finally, why call this a triolgy? It certainly did not have an ending!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Once again Drizzt runs through impossible obstacles in invincibility mode. I've read many of Salvatores works and it's just more of the same. He keeps creating new stories for his bread and butter character which have grown so stale that were at one time creative nd suspenseful. Drizzt always comes out on top. Wulfgar is always torn between the same emotions that he only knows how to deal with in his barbarian rage. If this is your first venture into Salvatore's world you may enjoy it. But long time readers are likely to be bored with the same old same old. Read War of the spider queen book one instead. It's actually versatile, creative, and multidimensional; what a good fantasy book should be. Note: I am referring to the entire trilogy no just book 3."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"The Drizzt series has been a favorite of mine since i read the lone drow. I read all the others up to this point in about a year, and they were good reads. Now though, Salvatore just needs to get on with it and actually make something happen. This book, and the two before it, are incredibly slow and boring, as none of the villains have any depth and are basically there to annoy Drizzt and the gang. I also dislike the invincibility that all the main characters seem to possess. Just kill Bruenor or Catti-brie or someone please, it might accidentally spice things up a bit."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I hate to say it, because I have been a fan of Salvatore's work from the very beginning, but it just may be that he's losing interest in this long-running series -- or at least, that's how it seems.The battle sequences in this volume are top-knotch -- vintage Salvatore. I'm not sure there's a writer out there who choreographs better fights, be they between a pair of individuals or armies on a grand scale. Unfortunately, the battles in this book do not resolve themselves. Despite building toward what seems a perfect climax, we are left with an open-ended storyline -- not what you expect from the third volume in a trilogy.Instead, I was left feeling as if I were watching a soap opera -- an interminable saga with no end in sight. And while I am NOT looking forward to the day when I can no longer read about Drizzt and the gang, I would like each of their occasional adventures to bring with them a sense of closure, so that next time, it feels like I'm starting off on a fresh journey, rather than just dragging along the same old storylines from 10 books ago.The love triangle, for instance, between three of the major characters, is definitely bordering on melodrama. Can someone make up their mind about how they feel, already? Hearts may be fickle, but this is getting ridiculous. Whomever CB is going to end up with, I wish she'd just hurry up and do so.Even better, of course, would be for Salvatore to throw in some kind of surprise. I'm not anxious to see any of these principle characters -- for which this series is so beloved -- die. But I feel something major has to take place to shake things up and make them interesting again. In my opinion, it's getting tiresome, watching these superhuman characters receive a near-fatal wound, only to bounce up and carry on their way again. I'd rather see them simply kick the snot out of someone without first receiving a grievous wound, or else succumb, once and for all.In retrospect, I'm not sure that the premise of this series was strong enough to carry three books. Without giving away any of the plot, suffice it to say that the bulk of the story -- particularly Book 2 -- centers around one character's dilemma, a dilemma which is created out of a false assumption. Interesting enough, I suppose, but a question that could have been answered quite easily should the character have decided to verify the truth. Instead, he goes around assuming the worst, making those assumptions real. I'd liken it to the idea of: Well, I'm going to die anyway, so I might as well jump off a bridge now.In any case, I'm certainly not suggesting that fans of the series stop here. On the contrary, the author makes certain you will want to return -- whenever he himself decides to do so -- to this ongoing saga. Just don't expect a tidy resolution to any of the major plot threads, or you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I bought this book as a gift for my brother and he liked it. Based on that I give it a rating of 4."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I own some of the books series on Drizzt and plan on completing all the sets. Waiting untill someone makes the movies."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"'The Two Swords' is the third volume of the 'Hunter's Blade Trilogy.' Interestingly enough, R.A. Salvatore decided not to resolve most of the plot lines started in the first two novels of this trilogy. The focus of the novel is how Drizzt will reunite with his friends, whom he believes dead, and how his friends are struggling to deal with the massive orc presence outside the gates of Mithral Hall.The only major plot line to reach a conclusion in this novel is that of what Drizzt will do about Cattie-Brie. There has been a bit of a love triangle between these two characters and Wulfgar since early on in the series. Finally, Drizzt makes his decision. Just when it appears resolved, events in Wulfgar's world cloud the picture. Any more details than that will spoil the story.Other than that, the novel fails to resolve the rest of the major plot lines, and instead resolves a few more minor ones. Drizzt and the surface elf Inovindil bring their quest for the captured pegasus to a conclusion. A few more characters meet their demise in this novel. However, none of them were really major characters in the trilogy.Ultimately, the novel keeps open the major plot lines for future novels, and introduces a few more. For instance, anxious to read about how the heros deal with Obould? Although there are confrontations, nothing is resolved here. Same for the presence of the Orcs outside Mithral Hall.This novel ends with essentially the introduction to the next novel or trilogy in the series. I did find that irritating. While I don't mind authors setting up future novels or trilogies in their current trilogy, it seemed a bit odd to not conclude this trilogy within the trilogy. There may not be a conclusion to this trilogy in the next few novels either because Salvatore has already introduced new plot lines that promise to shape the next novel or two.All this being said, I still enjoyed the book. There are plenty of detailed and expertly woven fight scenes. Salvatore seems to be the master of dark elves and dwarves and has created a very identifiable species stereotype for each. Salvatore's characters are classics, if not a bit invincible. If the reader had a dime it appeared one of the five major characters received a fatal blow, then nobody would have to buy his books. Still, they are familiar, unique, and occassionally imitated but never really duplciated. Fans of the Drizzt series will enjoy this book, but the one they'll really be looking forward to will be coming a bit farther down the line.Grade: 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Well, as indicated by the other reviewers, despite this being book three of the trilogy, the end is very free of resolutions. Rather, more avenues are opened up and not addressed.Drizzt and Innovindil continue their efforts to fight the orc legions, with Drizzt and Obould the orc-king finally meeting in combat. However, Salvatore changes gears slightly and makes this enemy beyond Drizzt's normal abilities. Salvatore does, however, make no secret of getting to Drizzt the tools needed for the job. While the battles show some of Salvatore's old flair, the inability of Drizzt the Invincible to defeat this blessed orc grates against me, especially given the inner rage Drizzt feels for this orc having killed (so Drizzt believes) his closest companions.The nonexistent love quadrangle between Catti-Brie, Wulfgar, Drizzt and Delly Curtie is played too far, as well as some cliched use of a newly-childless mother in her grief, to move this story along. It almost seemed like the cast might have been too large, and some of the chaff needed to be separated from the grain. Suffice to say that a number of consistent supporting characters do not survive this book intact, though the primary players of the Drizzt series come through for the most part. There is also still some notable lack of appreciation from the Nesmeans despite the efforts of those from Mithral Hall to aid them, selflessly.The end of this novel, though, leaves nothing finished. A new quest is planned, Wulfgar must travel down the river to seek a lost child, Catti-brie and Drizzt finally get to business, the orcs are still holding sway over the northland and the surface region of Mithral Hall, the humans are surprisingly willing to let the orcs stay put and dig in, there is new cooperation among Dwarven nations, and there is still strife between the frost giants and the orcs. But most of that was true at the end of the second book. While the writing of this story was fine, and perhaps the best in this trilogy, the necessity of flipping back and forth between so many disparate storylines seemed to give short shrift to them all. Yes there are clever and well-written fight scenes. Yes, there is sword and sorcery goodness. Yes there is stupidity and sacrifice. But there is no resolution. I think that loyal readers would not have minded wrapping up some of the many loose ends before starting a new series, we still would be willing to buy it. But leaving so much hanging, for a year at least, is really beneath a good author, in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I looked over some of the reviews here and I was truly shocked. I understand that everyone has his or her own tastes and opinions, but R. A. Salvatore is a truly talented writer. So many times, while reading \\"The Two Swords\\", I caught myself reacting verbally as the story unfolded. From ooos and ahs to mimicking Pikel's \\"uh oh\\" or \\"hee hee hee\\". The story did take on a different edge that I found very refreshing, but not so drastic as to alter the storyline. I think that perhaps some are overlooking the message. The ending to the book couldn't have been more perfect! The companions know who they are and where they belong. The road to adventure lies before them... always. They each learned more about themselves and each other. King Obould is a villain with a vision. In some ways, I thought he was similar to Drizzt when he first wandered out of the Underdark. I was thrilled with the way in which R. A. Salvatore handled the end of his story as well. It was a solution to an impossible battle that everyone (for now) has to live with. Would you rather that Drizzt settle every problem at the end of his blades? Even when it isn't something that's even feasible? I feel that I have grown with the characters over the years and I have come to know them as I would know a friend. So seeing the changes and growth and reading about the near death experiences keep me spellbound, NOT disappointed! Through the years we saw Wulfgar escape the bonds of hell and we walked with him during his turmoil till he found himself once more. Catti-Brie is no longer the confused teen, caught between her emotions and the same could be said for Drizzt. We learned and grew through their experiences and Drizzt's reflections and, in many ways, perhaps became better people ourselves. R. A. Salvatore has been a mentor, a guide, an entertainer, and a cherished friend all through his tales. I personally anxiously await a movie on the silver screen!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I can't believe the number of people that are actually COMPLAINING that some of the main characters haven't died off! I for one, cannot imagine enjoying these books nearly as much with Bruenor, Regis, Wulfar, Drizzt, or Cattie Brie dying. This is, after all a fantasy book, and I believe that RA Salvatore has been able to create enough suspense regarding the fate of the characters without having to resort to killing them off for the sake of killing them off simply because they have \\"been around so long.\\" That is really what it comes down to for those that have called for the deaths of these characters: It has been a long time, so they MUST die.I found this series to be absolutely compelling. In fact, I read the whole trilogy in less than a week. The only real problem that I had with this trilogy was the fact that the Obould situation was not resolved. I thought it would be much better had Obould died, but maybe the storyline could have turned to the succession of Obould and how the orc nation may have had a series of orc's vying for ultimate supremacy and the effect that it has on the area surrounding the northland. Tribes could be in fighting as well as attacking nearby lands in order to achieve ultimate supremacy over the lands and the orc tribes.I thought Wulfgar's wife brought little to the story line, and although I did not like the genesis of her character from supporting wife to one that ultimately betrays wulfgar in such a short time to be a bit stretched, I believe that she brought little to the narrative line.All in all, this was a fantastic series, with many twists and turns and some real suspense. The more I read it, the more interested I became in dwarves and dwarven culture. I actually find dwarves to be the most interesting of all the races that populate the forgotten realms.Again, I repeat, these are fantasy books, and I read them because I care about the main characters. If even one of them dies, I think it brings the whole series down with it.Kudos to RA Smith, the best ADD fantasy writer in the world."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Unlike some other reviewers, I'll say the first 2 books in this trilogy were much better than the previous series, so I was very excited about this book.Big let down. I hope you didn't expect anything big to happen or anything. I hope you didn't become interested in any of the new characters like Nanfoodle or the dwarves who basically vanish from this book. I hope you didn't see into any of the foreshadowing about the good Drow goddess that's in FR 3.5 (Elliastrae sp?).It's just pretty bad. Everything seems rushed, characters aren't fleshed out at all. The only interesting part comes TOTALLY out of nowhere and has nothing to do with the previous 2 books. (Khazad'hea's adventure).I kind of wonder if Salvatore wishes he could just let Drizzt go.The epilouge lays the groundwork for the next series though. Let's all hope Salvatore finds some inspiration between now and then."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"To summarize my review before I get into it: R.A. Salvatore's Drizzt-books have evolved into Saturday morning cartoons rather than staying as the Tolkein-esque stories they first started out to be.I have been a Salvatore-Drizzt-book reader ever since 1990 when I read The Crystal Shard. I have read every Drizzt-book since then, but with this last book I have decided to give up the series until some drastic changes are made. Instead of an exhaustive review of this book, I'll just point to 6 ways as to how this entire series is on its death-bed. Salvatore can cure these maladies by listening to the following:1.) DRIZZT AND HIS FRIENDS HAVE BECOME SATURDAY MORNING CARTOON CHARACTERS - In cartoons the main characters never die, they are invincible, they are unflawed. In The Drizzt books, no main character can ever die. They fight hundreds and hundreds of \\"bad guys,\\" only to score perfect victories each time. If it seems that one of the main character has died, or will, it's only a red herring that sets you up for that character to inevitably \\"save the day.\\"2.) DRIZZT'S ENEMIES HAVE TURNED INTO THE \\"VILLAIN OF THE WEEK VARIETIES\\" - In cartoons, the heros are usually pitted by a different villian each week. The villians are rarely fleshed-out, and they're just around for the purpose of getting killed by Drizzt and Co. If a villian is fleshed-out, Salvatore becomes attached and cannot kill him, only send him away (Artemis Entreri, Jarlaxle, etc).3.) SUPPORTING CHARACTERS ARE LIKE THE \\"YOMAN\\" CHARACTER FROM STAR TREK - Remember in Star Trek how Captain Kirk would beam down to a planet with some unnamed officer, and inevitably, the unnamed officer would die while Kirk would be unharmed? Okay, now substitute \\"Captain Kirk\\" with \\"Drizzt\\" and you have Salvatore's new books. A seasoned reader knows that when a character is introduced, he's not likely to be a permanent fixture.4.) YOU CAN'T GO 2 PAGES WITHOUT BEING REMINDED THAT DRIZZT & CO. ARE THE TOUGHEST, BADDEST CHARACTERS IN THE WORLD - It's not that you see this through their actions, but Salvatore spells it out for you before every fight. Hypothetical example: \\"The orcs were heavily armed and outnumbered the weakened drow twenty five to one. But this was Drizzt Do-Urden, and he was no ordinary drow!\\" Please ...5.) SALVATORE'S EDITORS NEED TO BACK OFF OF HIM AND LET HIM WRITE - if you've noticed in the past several books, Salvatore paces the story nicely, then has to suddenly end the story because the editors limit the number of pages he can have. When you get 4/5s the way through it, you think \\"wow, I'm almost finished, and there's so much left! Hell, (enter character's name) isn't even within a 10-day ride from the others?!\\" ANSWER: Robillard the mage shows up and magically teleports the character wherever they need to go.6.) THE FIGHT SCENES ARE A BIT TOO DETAILED - Everyone knows Drizzt is a bad mutha-sucka, but when Salvatore gets carried away and writes, \\"Drizzt then shifted his balance to the right and pivoted low with a perfect center of gravity, slicing his left scimitar right, then feinting back, swinging his left scimitar in a downward arc, pulling back, then upward pivoting to his right, bringing his swords at a downward V-angle, parrying each blow, then rolling to his left, followed by an inverted cone flip to the front, slicing diagnally with his left right-ended scimitar....\\" I just find myself skimming paragraphs.MY SUGGESTION FOR SALVATORE & DRIZZT:-------------------------------------Set the next series some 100 years into the future. Drizzt, as an elf, will continue to live for several more centuries. Cattie-Brie, Wulfgar, Regis and Bruenor will not. Go ahead and jump forward and write the novel that you wanted to with THE LONE DROW. It's time for Drizzt to move on.I think Salvatore knows that. He toys with the ideas of Drizzt and Cattie-brie's grim future, but I don't think he has the nerve to actually kill anyone off. So just jump to the future and make it happen.And get rid of those annoying dwarf brothers! They are the Jar Jar Binks of the Drizzt world. I would welcome any feedback from Salvatore fans. I still am one, but I feel like I'm watching a good thing go down the tubes.Be critical, people. Don't just throw praise at a book because teh main character is cool and has potential. I can tell by the writing style of the majority of these reviewers that they are somewhere between 10-16 years old. That's how old I was when I read The Crystal Shard. I want to feel the same way about these new books as I did when I was that age reading the early adventures. I've matured, so now must the Drizzt storyline."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"There are a few spoilers in this review but it is nothing that you would not have figured out from the other reviews of the Hardcover edition. However, I will mark any paragraph with spoilers if it has any.Most of what has been written about the book in the Hardcover edition is pretty much true. On one hand, you do have some character growth in the form of Buenor actually acting somewhat like a king than in previous books. Regis, for the few times he actually appears, is a lot more calm and settled than he was when he first appeared.However, most of it is the same old, same old. Drizzt is still engaged in a lot of navel gazing when he isn't chewing through the enemy as an unstoppable force. Catti Brie is moving back towards her usual \\"Which one do I love?\\" persona. Wulfgar....Well, he twirls a hammer a lot.[Spoilers]A few secondary characters die without much comment, chief among them is Dellie. Her death is long expected as, after playing her part in Wulfgar's redemption, it is as if R.A. Salvadore had no idea what to do with her. Wulfgar's almost complete lack of reaction to her death would be callous if it were not representative of how little she was actually developed.[End spoilers.]In the end, we are left with nothing much having changed from the end of the second book and that might be the most intriguing development of all. One of the reasons that I don't read much in the way of Forgotten Realms books is that they are always pretty much the same. A great evil arises, heroes band together, evil loses a god/kingdom/a whole mess of wizards (with the attendant loss of henchmen), and that's that. In fact, back in college, I commented that, given Evil's track record, how noone with a survival instinct would become evil in this world.With this book, evil, for once, has not been neatly defeated. Obould's kingdom is still going strong at the end of the books. If the authors of the Forgotten Realms novels really wanted to write something new and different, they would incorporate this into their novels and not just as an excuse to have orcs to bash. Instead, have the leaders have to gradually deal with the kingdom. Perhaps have Obould become a civilizing influence (as he already has to a degree). Examples abound as to how this could be written ranging from the Zentraedi Control Zone from the Robotech Universe to the very real world example of Israel being surrounded by the various Arabic nations. Introduce some shades of grey into the situation (If Obould's orcs do stop and actually settle the land to build their own life, is it really \\"good\\" to slaughter them?).While nothing new was really written in this trilogy, there is potential for a new and fresh perspective to be brought to the world of Forgotten Realms than the usual \\"same old...\\" that has plagued these books for years."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Finally united by their god-king Obould, the Orcs stand at the gates to Mithral Hall--the great Dwarf kingdom and mining center. But when his initial attack falters, Obould pulls back--he'd rather defend the world's first Orc kingdom than waste his resources attacking the well-prepared and heavily trapped Dwarf caves. With his giant, dark-elf, and troll 'allies' repeatedly proving to be undependable, Obould knows that hanging onto what he has already conquered will be challenge enough.Renegade dark-elf, Drizzt Do'Urden, falsely believing that his friends and allies have all been killed by Obould, joins with an elf to rescue a pegasus, then makes single-handed war on the orcs. He knows that if he can somehow kill Obould, the orcs will shatter--as they have shattered so many times before. What he doesn't count on, though, is that Obould really does manifest the Orc-god--and killing a god is a tough challenge, even for a dark-elf.Author R. A. Salvatore delivers a mix of heroic action and introspection. Drizzt continues to evolve, slowly learning to leave his drow preconceptions behind him and become a true-elf. Obould is almost a sympathetic hero, holding his people together and helping them build their first kingdom despite attacks by elves, humans, dwarves, and the backstabbing by the ice giants and especially the drow. Salvatore's writing is always professional and smooth--and doesn't falter in THE TWO SWORDS.Fans of the movements of dwarf armies, clever dwarf traps, and of Drizzt Do'Urden will definitely not want to miss this one. If you aren't already a Salvatore fan, however, you might want to give THE TWO SWORDS a pass. There isn't enough character development or story arc to appeal to those not already deeply involved."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I have to admit to being somewhat strange, in that I love the Dark Elf books, but find Drizzt himself to be a completely unentertaining character. It is the people around him that I find intriguing. Perhaps that is the reason this book is one that I have mixed emotions about. For most of the book, it seemed that R.A. was going to 'right the wrongs' that have plagued the series up to this point - Delly and Colson out of the picture, Wulfgar and Catti-brie together (as they should be), Drizzt and perhaps Innovindil together, etc. At the very rushed feeling end of the book, however, Drizzt and Catti-brie are together and Wulfgar is left all alone following Delly's death and Colson's disappearance. Also, the Orc storyline is completely left up in the air - dramatic changes to the Northern part of the Realms have been made. It will be interesting to see if they follow up on them. Lastly, for Drizzt to be the nigh-invincible fighting machine he has been portrayed as for so long (along the lines of Snake-Eyes in GI Joe, honestly!), to see him struggle against and ultimately fail against the orc Obould was laughable. The redeeming parts of this book? The almost-renewed relationship between Wulfgar and Catti-brie, the excellent characterizations of some occasionally badly named Dwarves, and the fact that the next set of books (which are clearly set up at the end) seem to take the entire group out on the road again - perhaps a return to the great, rollicking adventure feel that the original Icewind Dale trilogy had, but that has been lacking and overshadowed by Drizzt's 'poor pitiful me' routine of the last 6-10 books or so. If you're a fan of the series, it's worth keeping up with the exploits of the crew - otherwise, you may be better served to stick with the current well-written War of the Spider Queen series for your drow 'fix'."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Much has been said of R.A. Salvatore's Forgotten Realms novels in the last few years, and most of it is negative. Are Drizzt and his friends seemingly invulnerable? Yes. Has Salvatore failed to introduce much in the way of interesting new characters? Yes. Are his books generally getting repetitive? Yes. Are they boring?...well, no.Most of the fantasy I read is in the Forgotten Realms world. Take that as you will, but Salvatore still wipes the floor with the majority of the Realms writers. Usually Salvatore, Elaine Cunningham, Troy Denning, and Douglas Niles are reliable writers of fun fantasy novels (for those angry readers who want to see a bloodbath in which scores of good-guy characters die, look no further than the Moonshae Trilogy by Douglas \\"Grim Reaper\\" Niles). The others range from passable to excruciating. But I know what to expect from Salvatore. I don't read his books to be enlightened - I read them to be entertained, and Salvatore does it again in \\"The Two Swords.\\"The story finds Drizzt Do'Urden spending most of his time trying to free a captured pegasus from the bad guys - orcs, trolls, frost giants, but especially King Obould Many-Arrows, a clever orc who appears to have become the avatar of the orc god Gruumsh, and is pretty much invincible. If this sounds like boring stuff for Drizzt, it is - but remember Drizzt is wallowing in self- loathing because he believes all his friends are dead, so he's trying to find something to do besides return to Mithral Hall and face the music (or so he thinks). Plus, he's trying to impress Innovindil, his moon-elf sorta-girlfriend (who has lost her horse! Sounds sort of like the plot of a Barbie comic!). In spite of this, Drizzt finds plenty of time to puree orcs, not to mention (and I don't think I'm spoiling a thing here) fight King Obould.Innovindil, although not a particularly original elf character, does deliver a cool soliloquy on 'what it is to be an Elf.' Drizzt buys into this and decides that his life doesn't suck so much after all. But most likely the best part of the interaction between these two is Drizzt's response to Innovindil's speech about all the noble reasons why Obould should be killed: \\"Maybe I just want to kill him.\\"As for Drizzt's friends, they're imprisoned inside Mithral Hall by about a billion orcs (give or take a few zeros). Bruenor, recently returned from the dead (yeah, I know, keep reading), leads his dwarves in devising all kinds of A-Team like devices to turn orcs into chunky orc salsa. Wulfgar is having serious marital issues with his jealous wife Delly, and Cattie-Brie is torn between wondering what became of Drizzt and flirting with Wulfgar. All fairly typical of Salvatore's subplots in his last few novels.The story, however, moves along at a fast pace despite all these apparent obstacles- it is really only dragged down by the pathetic Galen Firth and his inability to kill the trolls that want to slaughter his kinsmen from Nesme. Salavatore spends a decent amount of time bringing secondary characters to an unpleasant demise, but he neglects to introduce Galen's face to 20 or so orcish arrows. Too bad the interesting mage Shoudra had to be turned into cat food by Obould in \\"The Lone Drow;\\" she would have been a much better character in this book than the loser Galen. Also, the frost giants in the book, though led by the supposedly brilliant chieftain Gerti, serve little purpose besides chucking boulders into unfortunate places.Honestly, I think most of this book's enjoyability comes from the dwarves. Drizzt put Salvatore on the map, but I think he writes dwarves better than just about anyone. Let me add a caveat by saying the *names* he gives those dwarves are often horrifying (quick, spot the REAL Salvatore dwarf name! *Cordio Muffinhead* *Kragg Weaselface* *Alebrain Forgefarter*), but the dwarves are easily the most likeable characters in the book, mostly for their selflessness, love of life, and the fact that they don't give a... . Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder, formerly of Salvatore's lousy Cleric Quintet, are probably the best of the dwarves because their personalities aren't quite so cookie-cutter as those of the others.Finally, Regis the halfling finds ways to be useful as always, although his role is a bit diminished here and he is more or less on injured reserve for most of the book. I still think Regis, who usually wins with brains vice brawn, is one of Salavatore's best characters. He appears useless but often displays unmatched courage and innovativeness.Perhaps the most significant thing about this book among Salvatore's novels is that there isn't a happy ending of any sort. Drizzt slugs it out with Obould, and dwarves turn lots of orcs into hash, but Salvatore does a good job impressing upon the reader that Bad Things are happening to the North of Faerun, things that will outlast a novel trilogy or two. Obould, for his part, is a calculating and formidable opponent. Although very evil, his bloodthirstiness is limited by his tact, and exactly what the limits of his power are are not explored in this book. Among Drizzt's enemies, Obould is not as interesting as Artemis Entreri, but he is more dangerous. Expect Obould to be around for awhile.Unsurprisingly, the book sets up for a sequel or new trilogy, but the good news for weary Salvatore fans is that it looks like he's going to venture into some interesting territory with Bruenor and Drizzt. I never thought Drizzt was done with Ellifain, the elf girl whose life Drizzt one saved only to have her attempt to murder him decades later, and it looks like he's going to try to put those demons to rest. Bruenor seems to be heading off to find some ancient dwarven Moradin-given wisdom that might destroy Obould. I think that road will end with Bruenor's death, so those of you who want to see one or more of Salvatore's main characters buy the farm ought to stay tuned.Should you read this book if you have enjoyed Salvatore's past novels in the series? Sure! Don't expect, well... *any* loose ends to be tied up, but this is a typical fast-paced, enjoyable book from Mr. Salvatore. If you absolutely hated every Salvatore novel since 'Streams of Silver,' you can skip this one because you'll probably just have an aneurysm. You could instead go read 1500 pages to see if Robert Jordan writes about anything but womens' clothing this time, or maybe even go read some Ed Greenwood if you really want to get mad while reading a Realms novel.Otherwise, enjoy 'Drizzit's' exploits - and don't feel guilty about it."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I've come to the conclusion that all of Salvatore's creations leave as many questions unanswered as ends tied up. LOL! At least he keeps his details fairly straight. But I suspect it'll be another year before we hear anything else from Drizzt - his most recent release seems to be about our friends Entreri and Jarlaxle."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Hmmm where to start. I just finished this book and am happy I read it. However, I have a small feeling of being given only 3/4 of a hamburger when I ordered a full burger. What I mean is this... the book was supposed to (not sure if Salvatore said it or not) tie up some loose ends and bring closure to a few storylines. In my line of thinking only one of the storylines was really moved forward in any substantial way. I won't post spoilers here, but there a few things that may have been written a little differently. But, I don't know the larger scope of storylines that Salvatore has planned so maybe this is for the best.With that being said, the books itself is a great read. Full of action and drama. There are a few twists int he book as well as a couple points where one holds out hope for a single hero... there are a couple memorable deaths in the book. Salvatore is one of the few authors who gets inside the head of the 'bad guy'. If you read the first two books int he trilogy you are sure to want to read this one as well."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I'm giving this book 3 stars because it is average. It is better than a lot of crap coming out but still not as good as Salvatores past work.Most of the negative reviews have been pretty close to the way I feel.When the series first began most readers were close to the main characters. I actually cared what happened to them, however it's hard to really get into a story when no matter what happens you know that the main characters won't be hurt.I think others have pointed out that the main characters are invincible. Right now I cared more about secondary characters more than the main ones.I think it's too late for Salvatore to do anything about it. So many readers and reviewers feel this way and have pointed it out that if he did kill off a main character I think most of us would just say he did it to appease us (the readers). It's a darned if you do darned if you don't at this point.I read in another review of his books that said he should do a book based in the future and following Drizzt. Say 100 or 200 years when many of the main characters would be dead.I personally think that is a great idea or that he should take a page from Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman and do a Next Generation series. That would be worth reading."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"This book had everything I look for in a Drizzt book- fast paced action, intrigue, suspense, and great fight scenes. It's great to see some of the characters together again and some cliffhangers with some of the characters. I was surprised to see a single negative review until I clicked on the reviewers \\"wish list\\". \\"Thirteen\\" is not on my wish list, and if that is your reading level, this book may be too sophisticated for you. Drizzt has some tough internal reflection to live through here as he battles with his Hunter self and his more surface elf-like personna. Obould has become a nemesis as significant as Entreri. You will love this book."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"If you started out reading earlier volumes of R A's work featuring Drizzt and loved them then you may well be disappointed with his work on this trilogy and any future works. I myself will never pickup another book written by R.A. as his work has become horrible and a labor to read completely through."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"SPOILERS:This trilogy has developed the characters even more, mostly Drizzt. I belive R.A left out a few obvious things for obvious reasons. Obould. Orcs still roaming. Baby gone. The new strange love triangle between Drizzt/Cattibrie/Wulfgar.Some people say these things make it a bad book. He did not want to make things happen to fast. Why try squeeze more in that book when you can fully explain the details in a new series?Why was Delly killed with so little mourning over her? Was she in the end just a Luskan Bar Wench never to have had a good life? At least she could have been kidnapped by orcs and rescued in daring raid by her beloved husband.However, it still left me wondering. I did not expect it to end the way it did. But I guess that is a good thing! Anticipation has increased because of it!(For future books)All I know is if he does not come out with a new series, I would rate this disappointing, because then the ending would be in my opinion horrible. It would leave you wondering, not really an end at all. I dont think he would do that, though."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"\\"The Two Swords\\" is a perfect blend of emotions. It had me on the edge of my seat one moment, instilling me with compassion and empathy the next, only to follow by inciting joy or causing me to laugh out loud over some of the antics carried out by one character or another. I am purposely avoiding mentioning names and scenarios because I feel, if you haven't already, it is most certainly a must read for any who enjoy fantasy fiction. R. A. Salvatore has taken me through the growth and development of his beloved characters through his words and captivating stories. His exceptional skill in writing has painted a picture in my mind that enticed me, drawing me into the story so fully, that I found his book impossible to put down. I feel Mr. Salvatore has orchestrated the perfect ending (though I do hope to read more!) to a long road as each character found their place and worth in the world. In the end, while still leaving tales for the imagination, I came to understand that adventure, in many forms, will always await the 'Companions of the Hall'. \\"The Two Swords\\", in my opinion, is a masterwork, worthy of appreciation."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"The Two Swords, like RAS other works, is a captivating tale with much of its focus directed toward the emotional struggles of the characters as well as how the army of Obould will change the realms. While the battles are still great (you have to admire Salvatore's dwarves and the ingenius devices of war they use)the strength of this novel relies on the how the characters come to terms with what happens around them. Filled with intricate plot twists and deception within the ranks, The Two Swords kept my attention through till the very end. Without giving much away, I would say that this novel finally defines Drizzt's character, and in those defining moments,the fabled drow ranger will forever be changed. It will be exciting to see how the surprises, turmoil, treachery and choices made in this book will effect the characters and the realms in the future. Do yourself a favor and enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"This is a bland tale with no suspense or unpredictability whatsoever. It has become obvious with Drizzt books that RAS is only now writing them for money and not for actual content. and for god's sake, kill somebody already!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"As an individual character, Drizzt Do'Urden is as complicated as they come. The other main characters of this multi-trilogical series have all been well developed. What has always been lacking is the big picture.On a small scale the characters are lovable, for both their faults as well as their strengths, which has been the cornerstone of the series. What has not been developed adequately is the inner workings of the global political system. The Hunter's Blade Trilogy nicely, and finally, paints the picture of the complex politcal system of the region, and sets the stage for a \\"New Age\\".Although, at the tip of the sword was Mithral Hall, we see clearly how each city or citadel in the region reacts in a politcal way to the threat. It is a parallel, perhaps, to the real-world theater. The act of leaders taking different positions on the issue, and doing what each feels is in the best interest of their people or themselves is clearly defined. One such character is Lady Allustrial of Silvery Moon, whose beauty, grace, fairness, and good-nature have been crammed down our throats so much that we readers want her phone number. However when put to the test of doing what is right for her lands, or doing what is right for the region (which would include her lands) she takes choses her lands. It is not anything against her neighbors, but she certainly did not come to their aid until she had no choice.I liken that choice to the choice of King Thayoden of Rohan in Lord Of The Rings, when he chooses to send his people to Helm's Deep instead of turning and facing the invaders head on. He was only doing what he felt was right for his people. In the end, he had no choice but to meet them head on.The Fantasy Fiction Genre is always setting stages for new frontiers. Series like Star Trek and Star Wars, or Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms have always set major era changes, which welcome new characters, and new ways of thinking, often to the delight of the current reading generation. The Hunter'S Blade Series wraps up on kind of a anti-climax, but I think sets the stage for one of these \\"New Ages\\". In the near-future Salvatore novels, I think we will see exactly where this leaves-us-hanging trilogy is meant to take us.To place Salvatore in perspective with another fantasy writer who loves to leave you hanging, J K Rowling's Harry Potter: And The Half-Blood Prince leaves you hanging with more questions than answers, setting the stage for the final novel. This is exactly why I love Bob Salvatore's work, and look forward to the next trilogy of Drizzt and his friends."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"This book was a fitting conclusion to an awesome series.This trilogy began with an incredibly dark and foreboding book, and that sense continues with the final book. Mithral Hall, Nesme, and the other dwarven citadels are fortifying to contain the orcs, while King Obould solidifies his gains. The tension will remain for some time. It is exciting to see such a powerful villain in the Realms. Obould matured from a ravaging leader to a calculating king over the series, forcing other leaders to change their strategy in dealing with him.The Two Swords perhaps had the least amount of action of the three books, but still has enough to satisfy.I think the ending will provide interesting new story ideas. And while some interesting turns leave some relationships changed forever, the door is opened for future strife between Bruenor, Regis, Catti-Brie, Wulfgar, and Drizzt.This is a trilogy I will be re-reading time after time."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"This the christmas gift my son had on his list. He knows exactly what he wanted as he has others. I know he is happy"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I have to say, I have loved almost all of the Drizzt books, and even the spin-off novels. Some are better than others, true, as is the case with all authors. This series, which focuses around Drizzt's and friends' dealings with an unusually powerful orc king (who is actually an old nemesis of the dwarves), is a very good addition to the series. Packed with action, cliff-hangers, and a couple very good villains, this series has it all, and the final book is no exception.The characterizations are nop-notch, as usual, with some frighteningly savage outcomes for some secondary characters. Concluding the series with his usual flair, R.A.S. brings dark elf Drizzt (again) from the brink of self-loathing and hopelessness back into the light...pun intended, on a few levels. Much of the North gets pulled along with the waxing and waning of the dark elf's mood.Though I can see how some would tire of Drizzt's see-saw bipolar outlook, Salvatore's flare for writing about these nuances never cease to amaze me - he manages to keep them fresh, despite their obvious reoccurences. That said, I think it's getting time to let the poor elf have a NICE time with his buds for a change!I look forward to the next series, which is hinted at throughout this series - the hunt for the lost dwarven kingdom that daddy Bruenor thinks will save the Northlands once and for all, while also lending one more adventure to the old dwarf's ledger."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"The Two Swords if the conclusion of the The Hunter Blades Trilogy depicts the war in the Silver Marshes between the forces of the orcs, giants, trolls, and bugbears led by King Obould Many-Arrows against the alliance of dwarven citadels and humans cities.The story itself excellent. Unlike The Dark Elf Trilogy and the Legacy of the Drow series, The Hunters Blades Trilogy focuses on a larger scale of events rather than just a group of characters. Obould's orcs are tearing through the Silver Marshes, and the leaders of the dwarven citadels human cities must unite to stop him. It's a classic story of good vs. evil.What I also liked about this book is that you see each character equally throughout the book. What kind of dissapointed me for a little bit, was the build up of Obould vs. Drizzt. In the end of the Lone Drow, and throughout the Two Swords, you feel the hype build up as Drizzt proclaims that he wants to fight the orc king. \\"Maybe I just want to kill him.\\" Though the fight itself was fast paced, the end result.Whenever I hear someone complaining about the ending of this book, it reminds me of when Lord of the Rings came out. I thought the ending itself was really good. It left it open for three seperate story lines, in which anything could happen.This isn't the best Salvatore novel, but for the end of a trilogy, I thought it was good. I probably won't be rereading it again for a while, but it's going to stay on my favorite's shelf next to the Dragonlance Chronicles."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"After reading all of Mr.Salvatore's books, and waiting eagerly for the next of drizzt's adventures, I was a little disappointed with the new book. The story started off fairly well with the first couple of chapters, but later nothing seemed to have happened in the book. I kind of felt bob was stretching the story to fill 300+ pages. Nevertheless, for loyal fans of salvatores work this is the kind of book which would make us wait for the next one.

And NOTHING comes to a conclusion other than a few minor storylines. Could Salvatore be out of ideas with these group of adventurers? I hope not but this trilogy has left me with much doubt."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"The Two Swords by R. A. Salvatore is the latest edition to the companions of the hall series. I have been a fan of the companions since the beginning. I devoured icewind dale, the dark elf series and so on. However I do not understand how anyone could give this book or for that matter the complete Hunters Blades trilogy more than one or two stars. In my opinion things started going south in passage to dawn with the return of wulfgar. He was dead, long dead and should have stayed dead. However I remained a loyal fan and eagerly anticipated the books that followed. That is, up until I read the thousand orcs, then on to the horrendous lone drow and now finally the dreadful two swords. I suppose I keep reading the series hoping that Salvatore will do something dramatic, like kill off a main character and keep him/her dead. I hope it's Bilbo, I mean Frodo, I mean Regis.I don't even know where to begin with this atrocity. How many times is a main character going to survive a cave in or a tower falling on them or a huge giant thrown boulder taking them down? It's just silly. How many times is wulfgar going to jump out in the midst of a thousand enemies and make it back in descent shape? Once again silly and unbelievable. Wulfgar may be tougher than stone but he is human and without any real magic to support his attacks.One of the main themes in this book, actually it seems to be the theme, is Drizzts belief that his companions are dead and how returning to mithril hall in the wake of their demise will make him feel. Throughout the novel Drizzt is hovering around the Hall but does not go in. Some may say that is just how Drizzt operates in situations like this. Hanging around on the outskirts looking for that target of opportunity---Obould in this case. But weren't all or most of the dwarves of the hall his friends, was it not his duty as a friend and ally to report to the dwarves. Perhaps seeing him alive and well would give them more hope. Also, with all the spying would he have not heard the mention of King Bruenor's return to the battlefield from at least one orc? In fact, Bruenor was the only companion of the hall whose death he had any real evidence of. He just assumed the rest were dead but that is silly as well. Why would he be so worried, even if they were dead couldn't he just go retrieve their souls like with wulfgar. Oh but that was different, wasn't it? Finally, drizzt comes two steps away from entering the hall but instead decides to follow a host of frost giants in the hopes of rescuing a pegasus for his new elf girlfriend. I think that could have waited five minutes. Oh but drizzt just wasn't ready to deal with the confirmation of his beliefs regarding his friends----whatever. So he tracks these giants all the way up to their wintry mountain abode and along the way does not find a single opportunity to free the pegasus, yet he arrives at their fortress and thinks he can waltz into the place and back out with a flying horse in tow----absolutely ridiculous.I could go on and on about this tremendously awful novel but I will not so let me conclude with a review of other reviews. I read a number of the 4 and 5 star reviews of this book hoping that I would find one with some substance. There were none. I would just like to point out a couple that said something more than, \\"Another Gem\\" or \\"Fantastic book.\\"Reviewer:Jared GarrettThe Two Swords by R.A. Salvatore is the final book in the Hunter's Blades Trilogy. It is a well written examination of the Hunter (Drizz't) and his relationship with his blades... or in other words, of how Drizz't has chosen to deal with the world around him. Readers know that Obould, the orc king, is a powerful new enemy, so we will not go there in this review. However, it is possible that Salvatore has created his best villain ever here. Obould has almost transcended base evil and is practically living on a higher plane of existence. The question is not \\"How do we kill him?\\" but is rather \\"Can and should he be killed?\\" Salvatore leads us to interesting questions and answers throughout this book. However, the action is still strong and vivid, the characters continue as believable and beloved, and the reader is sucked in quickly. The stakes are high, both on the kingdom level and the personal level, for all those involved.First of all, how is Obould anywhere near Salvatore's greatest villain ever? Obould is worthless and popped up out of nowhere. Have you read any of the other books? What about Jarlaxle and Artemis or any other villainous character? Obould is a joke. Second, \\"Can and should he be killed?\\" What? Everyone wanted to kill Obould even some of his supposed allies. This statement makes no sense. Third, please show me where there are interesting questions and answers in the book because I don't remember any. Finally, as I have already mentioned the characters are no longer believable. They can not die, nothing can kill them. Not even 50,000 orcs and a god-like orc king.Reviewer:Mary A. FeinbergThis was an awesome book even by RAS standards. I mean you get DEEP into his character (Drizzt) and emotions. And there is a lot going on here in many sub plots. Some characters die, some find themselves, there are huge battle scenes. I loved it.If you want a new RAS book with new characters read \\"the Highwayman\\". It was incredible. Or pick up the Demon Awakens series, but don't whine if a character that you love dies. RAS has no problem killing off characters, but we are reading about the life and adventures of Drizzt here. So I doubt Drizzt will die in this series.Ok, there is nothing even remotely DEEP in this book. Drizzt just wanders around whining about his lost friends and wondering if he knows what it's really like to be an elf---how lame. Alright some minor characters do die, one of which should have never been created to begin with. Huge battle scenes---so what. They were great to begin with but now they have become to long and drawn out. They are more of a crutch for Salvatore than anything else. Finally, Salvatore did kill off some main characters in the Demon Wars series, but this is not the Demon Wars series. I don't want to see Drizzt die but someone has to go.Salvatore has either lost his edge and is only out for financial gain or has lost interest in this particular series. I tend to believe the former especially when considering the second demon wars trilogy. The first trilogy was marvelous. Mortalis and Ascendance were even pretty good, however the final two installments were worthless and the conclusion was pure garbage. Mommy and Daddy saved their boy---man that was some crap."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"RA Salvatore's writing is very pedestrian in style and seems more like a play by play commentary of some D&D game than anything resembling a novel. This book is only recommended for 14 year old fanboys who judge a book's quality by the numbers of magic items carried by the heroes."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Read this if you read the first two in the series, then you'll be done.

I am happy with this purchase."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Reading some of these reviews I find it hard to believe so many people have called this book predictable. Predictable would have been if Drizzt would have killed Obould. Predictable would have been Drizzt returning to Mithral Hall with Kazidhea instead of the surviving drow running off with it. I could go on but you get my point. I think people were more disapointed because the book spent and in fact this trilogy spent more time than it probably should in developing Drizztz's character. That is the only flaw I could see, but overall an excellent story and well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I preordered this autographed book from the RASalvatore.com site and I finally finished it last week. I can only say that I am deeply disappointed with this book. There is no conclusion to this trilogy. I feel like this book is just about Obould. There is no struggle for Drizzt other than trying to rescue a pegasus. The introduction of Innovodil was in part that Drizzt had another love interest. Anyways I just wanted to say the book could have been better. SHOULD have been better."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"This book was awesome. It had great battle's, and suspense. It wasn't as good as some of R.A. Salvatore's other books but it was still better than the average fantasy book published. The ending left you with a cliff hanger not really knowing how the situation was going to end. That was really the only thing that bothered me. However, it just left the story open for future books and my faviorate characters."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"The Two Swords is a grander scope than most of RA Salvatore's companions of the Hall books. It deals with both enormous external stuggles (The Orc Horde, sacking of Nesme, Prominent Dwarves deaths) as well as the internal ones (What it means to be an Elf, Love and Prejudice). There are many issues that are not resolved to this concluding book but it just sets us up for more in the future. No one brings forth a good villian the way that Bob can, and Obould fits the bill nicely. Gerti and her Frost Giants lend further credibility to the enemy. I was up till 2 in the morning finishing this one, and wanted to keep going, just to see that there were no more pages to turn.Dennis Clark"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I was terribly disappointed in this final volume of what was until this volume one of R.A. Salvatore's best Drizzt series ever.The reasons I was disappointed are as follows. This book scarcely deals with Drizzt at all, it has him on some (in my opinion) pointless side adventure that really seemed out of character for him to be on. I am glad the love triangle of Drizzt, Wulfgar and Catte-brie was solved finally but I thought the execution of it seemed forced, as if he didn't really want to write it, but felt he had too.If he is so tired of writing Drizzt books he should kill him off instead giving us this drivel.I thought Drizzt's reasons for not going back to Mithrall Hall after he thought his friends were killed was understandable to a point, but once he saw how bad the war was going, at the least the Drizzt I know from the previous books would have gone back to face that struggle instead of the silly quest for the pegasus. All in all the book hardly has Drizzt in it at all, and when he is there, he whines, but overall I liked the series, and Salvatore certainly left everything open for the inevitable sequels, but I was disappointed, the first two books were the best to date."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"When I read my first Salvatore novel(s) a couple of years ago I was, honestly, less than impressed. I was never a big fantasy fiction fan outside of Tolkien's works and my forays into Dungeons and Dragons as a student. But a friend had insisted I read the Icewind Dale trilogy so to please him (shut him up, really), I consented and dug in. The books were O.K. Then I read the next trilogy, much to my surprise and again at the insistence of the aforementioned friend. I found these next three works to be quite an improvement over the first three and yes, you guessed it, I went on to read the next trilogy and all subsequent Drizzt books after that. I must admit, I was hooked. I suppose I was lucky in that I became a fan recently and was able to read many of the books back-to-back without having to await a publish date; up until the Hunter's Blade trilogy, that is. Now I must wait like the rest of Mr. Salvatore's readers for each and every opus. So naturally, my expectations were higher than most folk's for \\"The Two Swords\\", since I actually was forced to sit for the year between it and \\"The Lone Drow\\". And I must say, the author did not disappoint this go around. \\"The Two Swords \\" was fun-filled and action-packed. Mr. Salvatore's writing and style have improved much throughout the years. His talent for character development and obvious love of \\"casting against type\\" (drow rangers; dwarf druids) make this final chapter in the Hunter's Blade trilogy a very enjoyable read. Drizzt's \\"internalizations\\" at the beginning of each book part are tremendously well-done and offer unique insights into the mind of a unique, albeit unlikely, hero. I found this book to be a fitting and fascinating end to another great trilogy from a writer for whom I've grown very fond. And now the next long wait begins..."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Ok, same old story I'm a big fan sense Icwind Dale Trilogy yada yada yada...Loved the first two books, couldn't wait for this one. What a let down! Nothing was accomplished, no loose ends tied up. The only reason it got a three star rating was the fact it did surprise me. The surprise was I really wasn't expecting NOTHING to happen in this book. The fight scenes were ok. They felt kind of rushed through, especially the big end fight scene, only one page long. Maybe RAS was tired of the good guys always winning at the end of the books. Personally I don't care if the bad guys would have won, but nobody winning c'mon.Who says that they are tired of a story and that they plan on walking away from the books for a while, and leave two armies ready to fight right next to each other. A person trying to cash in on the next book of drizzt, when he decides we have waited long enough. Now don't get me wrong. I love RAS, I have all his books in Hard Back, but I think he let us down in this book."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I'm a huge fan of Drizzt. The problem that I am having is that I want to continue reading about this drow elf but the author is ever increasingly making him a weak character. Drizzt has never really defeated any large bosses, it always comes at the hands of his companions. Drizzt never finds real love... I suppose because he is always conflicted. Drizzt is never the real hero in any of the stories, it always turns out to be a side kick.Another thing about Salvatore's writings that is starting to wear on me is that none of the main characters ever die, when you think that they do he finds a way to bring them back. Wulfgar should have remained dead, Catti-Brie and Bruenor should both died somewhere along the way as well.It appears to me that this book was comprised of 380 pages of fluff and no real substance and that is unfortunate. Yes, I will buy the Orc King and continue reading, however, I'm going in assuming to be disappointed once again since this has been the pattern since the Dark Legacy Trilogy.Come on Mr. Salvatore don't write a book just for a buck put a little passion into it. Kill off a main character once in a while or at the very least but some mystery and unsuspecting turns in the plot for once. Stop writing as if you are trying to create a play guide for a dungeon master somewhere. I see the potential of your characters and the brilliance of your writing style but what I am not finding is a quality story. This one has left me the most disappointed so far. Here's hoping the Orc King breaks this pattern."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I've read about all of the R. A. Salvatore books written so far, and each one just gets better. Some of the characters are riveting, so memorable and just plain endearing. I am about finished with the above mentioned book, and sincerely hope that Mr. Salvatore continues with more novels about the legends of this Drow (Drizzt) and his friends. Simply put, a spell-binding character. Well done sir, please don't let them die the writers death."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"To me this story, and the other two editions in the trilogy, are more about the dwarves and their defense of their lands than it is about Drizzt Do'Urden...which is fine by me. Don't get me wrong, Drizzt is a great character, but Salvatore imbues his dwarvish characters with so much personality that Drizzt becomes a secondary player for the most part. While most of the dwarven characters share many stereotypical dwarven traits, Salavatore brings them all to life on the page - from the stalwart courage and gruffness of Dagna, Banak, Tred, and Torgar to the most unconventional dwarf Pikel and the amamzing Thibbeldorf Pwent and his Gutbusters. From my standpoint it was a very good book and I look forward to reading the next installment/trilogy. Mr Salvatore, there is no need to hide behind the popularity of Drizzt, however, so name the next one Bruenor's Axe to Grind or just Hee...Hee...Hee...My Brudder!"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"a review?The Two Swords by R.A.

Readers know that Obould, the orc king, is a powerful new enemy, so we will not go there in this review.However, it is possible that Salvatore has created his best villain ever here.

Now he's become stale, he rehashes old plots, and all of the main characters are invincible.One can only hope that RAS can revert back to his older style. And let's hope that happens sometime soon."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Let me start by saying that I have been a fan of the Dark Elf books since day 1, which only serves to magnify my disappointment with this book and this trilogy as a whole.I can appreciate Salvatore's efforts to further develop these already familiar characters, however, the overdone introspection and self analysis quickly went from the \\"development\\" stage to irritating diatribes of whining and self pity. While the story did offer a few (far too few) unique elements, it was ultimately the secondary characters that kept me interested. The main characters were simply put back into old plot lines under new book titles--- Mithril Hall being invaded, Drizzt's self-analysis and fear of having lost a best friend(s), Cattie Brie & Wulfgar romantic tension. Again, some different twists, but ultimately more of what we've already seen.Finally, and most importantly, from a pure reading enjoyment standpoint, the ending was terrible. Absolutely terrible. Salvatore did an excellent job building to what you thought would be a glorious climax and conclusion, then allows the momentum to fizzle horribly. Anti-climactic is a kind description. There was simply no sense of reward or resolution. You will turn the last page then quickly check the cover to confirm that this was indeed book three of a trilogy, because it is not evident in the ending. The only upside is we can be certain more books are to come."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I tend to agree with the many negative reviews here and have nothing earth-shattering to add, except to say 'here, here' to those that have recommended a much-needed hiatus from Drizzt for Salvatore. I've read every Drizzt novel in addition to just about everything RAS has written and overall, I love him. Hovever, this was the most disappointing travesty of a third novel in a trilogy I have ever read. (The 2 stars is for sentimental reasons only) I kept hoping and praying that SOMETHING would happen to redeem the book, but as each page turned it became less and less likely until finally, it was over- and pathetically so. RAS simply has too many 'beloved-characters' going and not enough of stuff HAPPENING to those characters.For those reviewers that read this and thought it was worthy of 4 or 5 (or even 3) stars, you obviously haven't read any of RAS' good stuff (Dark Elf Trilogy then Icewind Dale Trilogy is a good way to start)--go do that, then you will undoubtedly come back here and reduce that rating you posted for Two Swords.As others have mentioned RAS needs to switch gears to the long-awaited/ anticipated continuation of Jarlaxle and Entreri's adventures--'cause that will be something truly to look forward to. RAS' strentghs lie in his mastery of the drow and the choreographing of memorable swordplay battles--both of which would be central to any series involving J&E.;Switch gears RAS!! PLEASE!!! Then, after a few years, Drizzt can come whirling back into our lives and we'll all be happy to read that he did."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Although I understand why some people are disappointed by this latest installment from Salvatore, I'd have to say I enjoyed this novel more than any of his FR stories since Servant of the Shard. However, if you enjoy this book, it will be because Salvatore is trying something new, i.e.- Drizzt is using his intellect more and his swords less.That, I think, is why other reviewers have either loved the book or hated it- none of those really intense, beautifully written one-on-one fight scenes that made Salvatore so famous. A fair point, I think, is that the end of the book is paced too fast, especially the final chapter. Additionally, I agree, that little is resolved at the end of the story- other than some real movement in Drizzt's and Cattie-Brie's relationship. Obould is still out there, but that's OK, because he is a worthwhile villain because of his ability to plan ahead and inspire his hordes, not because of any fighting prowess he might have had.So, I do think this is a must read Salvatore novel, but existing fans should be prepared for something new, and they'll have to decide whether they like this style from Salvatore, or the old one better. I personally didn't miss the one-on-one combat so much, because, I think (spoiler), Salvatore makes it very clear that, despite the fact that their battle is interrupted, Obould can't stand up to Drizzt in single combat without his impregnable armour. So for now, less sword play and more character development; without Drizzt's foil (Entreri), I don't miss the combat-oriented writing that much."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I have been a long time fan of the Companions of the Hall, and a growing fan on all of Salvatore's work. I believe this was a great end to a great trilogy full of action and memorable moments. It's not easy keeping long time reader amused with the ongoing adventures of the same five main characters for so long. I commend Mr. Salvatore greatly. Yes, this doesn't have the same feeling that the companions of the hall had in the old days, but times change, and people grow.We can't always say that 'the other books were better' or that 'oh come on, that's so cheap, an orc in uber-armor and a massive army! I could come up with something better than that!' Well, maybe you can, but in a reasonably created fantasy world, not every bad guy is going to be Artemis Entreri or Jarlaxle, and not every adventure is going to be daring the underdark or reclaiming Mithral Hall.I believe what Salvatore is trying to do is to give us all a deeper view into the workings of the five best friends, especially Drizzt. He has done, by far, something that can be considered something marvelous by any author - creating and molding several characters so that they are imperfect, but exceptional by fantasy standards, then lets them grow into these wonderful beings of fiction that we all so love.Bottom line is that the Companions of the Hall are some of the greatest fantasy characters to ever grace the pages of the world.If you are a long time fan like myself, this book will prove greatly satisfying to you, bringing to fruit somethings that we have waited a long time to see. I promise that you will like it.\\"Hee hee hee!\\" ~Pikel"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"im very torn in regards to this book. looking at it strictly as a novel, i enjoyed it like i have enjoyed all other salvatore works, despite the fact that drizzt is very scarce in the book. BUT, looking at the book in regards to what it was supposed to do, i was disapointed. nothing is resolved in the book. i dont see the point of having made it a trilogy. if anything, the hunters blade trilogy seems like one long book leading up to something. im glad to see that the drizzt and co storyline will continue, but i got no closure from this book. little was contributed to the overall story. this is made even worse considering that salvatore is taking a possible 2 yr withdraw from the drizzt storyline to work on jarlaxle and artemis books. as a book it was an exciting read, but it dint deliver what it was supposed to. i am a huge fan of salvatore and it pains me to give this such a low score"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I love R.A.

Yes, the whole \\"did they die or not\\" thing is getting tedious, but I can honestly say there's no way I would enjoy this series more without Cattie-Brie, Regis, or Bruenor. Wulfgar might be the only one that I could have accepted dying because it was pretty well done when he did, and RAS gave us enough reason to hate him at the time to not mind it so much. But c'mon, kill Cattie-Brie?? Yeah, let's kill off Drizzt's main love interest thats been developing from book one and start over. Sorry, but at this point, that would just be dumb. If your going to kill anyone off, let it be the ultra-annoying Galen Firth. Which brings me to my next point.Why on earth did RAS make us hate Nesme SOOO bad just to have Silverymoon pretty much choose it over Mithral Hall? He's given us a reason to hate that town with a passion at every turn, yet he frustrates us with the events in this book. I don't think I'm alone in saying that the minute I get to read that Nesme and everyone in it has been burnt to a cinder by a horde of Red Dragons, I will literally stand up and cheer. And the more detailed the demise of Firth, the better. Hell I hated him worse then any of the main antagonists in this series by far, or pretty much anything he's written (ok maybe not Kessel, but close!).Overall though, I think this was a mediocre close to this trilogy. The ending made some things I was waiting for pretty dry. I was waiting for Drizzt and Cat's reunion and they run to each other, finally kiss, and....we read that they are going to be going back out separately pretty much immediately (with their other semi-love interests no less). Wulfgar finally get's a girl that will keep him out of Drizzt and Cat's way and...splat. You have to think that the end of the third book in a trilogy should have one hell of an ending, and this one just didn't cut it. This book wasn't bad enough to make me not read the next trilogy, but it was pretty disappointing overall."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"this has been the most satisfying drizzt series i've read. why? because the big guy wins finally. you know who i mean. the most interesting character in FR...Obould Many-Arrows. he wins. the orcs finally win one. and its about damn time. why shouldn't the orcs have a nation of their own? why can't the progress as a people? finally those pompous dwarfs--and i love Bruenor as much as anyone--and those uppity elves get a kick in their teeth.

Salvatore's writing in general, Drow World/culture, Forgotten Realms, RPG gaming and good character development.Review:The book is not a great book by any stretch of the imagination. It is entertaining if you enjoy stories in the Forgotten Realms but you will not get much in the way of plot resolution. Obould takes his war against the humans, dwarves and elves to the next level. He prepares to seige Mithral Hall with support from Frost Giant allies (translate: Stupid artillery). The Seige is successfully forces Clan Battlehammer back into Mithral Hall, breaking down the front door and uniting the three Dwarven kingdoms against the Orc threat. Obould makes the effort to hold the ground he has won to date (I liked the fact that he is not a mindless animal. It is nice to see a villian with some level of reason and pragmatism.)The story does a bit to help resolve some of the \\"love triangles\\" -- if you can say any of the characters have love for each other, not fantasy in lust or high school crushes. The childishness of the relationships is frankly a bit insulting. I really wish the author would go back to developing the characters as he had done when he created Drizzt. For the most part, the characters are two dimensional in a soap opera way...the writing should grow with the maturity of the average reader.I have come to really enjoy the Dwarven characters(in general). I am looking forward to the next book due to the Dwarven underdark exploration for lost friends/allies. King Bruenor will make for great reading -- he has character and is not politically correct all the time.Drizz't really needs to get over himself and move on with his life. The book tries to help with that but it is a very slow process facilitated by an interesting Elf character, Innovindil. The lessons learned by Drizz't should have been clear a very long time ago.It is kind of sad that the author needs the evil, sentient sword, Khazid'hea, to move the plot along. The sword even started to be interesting even though it is painfully obvious in its actions. The characters have become that weak.Galen Firth is one of the most annoying characters ever created. In the world of Forgotten Realms, he should have been cut down a very long time ago. His annoying factor and stupidity is not quite on bar with Jar Jar Binks of Star Wars fame (the only character that I know of to have an entire audience at a local movie premiere to chant -- 'Die Jar Jar! Die!' at his first appearance on screen). The fact Galen survives is just down right painful when interesting characters like Dragna die needlessly.I hope that R. A. Salvatore takes time before writing the next book in the series / involving Drizz't. He needs to get his creative juices flowing again. Please focus on developing interesting characters and a solid plot line...the rest will all fall into place. Please do not continue to use the same formula as used in this trilogy."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"I see everyone complaining that there was no resolutioin, King Obould sucked as a antagonist...blah, blah, blah. Everyone missed the point of the book. It was to wrap up a trilogy that is a fraction of what the series is. This story, (The whole complete Drizzt story) has span more than a decade in writing with like twnety something books in the whole series. This is just another stepping stone to the next part, that's all it is. If you read it without reading the other books before it, you will get frustrated. If you read the first two books in the series and not read this one, you will get frustrated. If you've never read one of these books before,, you are allready frustrated because you haven't found one of the most engaging and elaborate stories ever written.And everyone forgets that this story is also developing Drizzt's character in a whole new light. Yes he's still the invincible drow that left Menzoberranzan decades ago, but now he's lost some of the vulnerability that made him such a dynamic character. This late in the series, Drizzt has been accepted by most of the people on the surface. Now that that has happened, there really is no story. Most people think that the whole orc army coming to the north and taking over towns is the story, but the story really is the emotional journey of this one dark elf who suddenly seems emotionally vulnerable again.Basically, what everyone needs to focus on is the change in Drizzt's character, and not the unimportant loose ends. That's what suspending disbelief is all about. If you over analyze the story it becomes like star-trek, all technical. I give it a four because it is still a good story, but not worth me reading 20-30 times like some of his other books.Oh yeah, you have to read it if you want any resolutioin to Drizzt's love life problems."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"This group of Salvatore books was a fun read, as always, but I couldn't justify 4 or 5 stars. This 'trilogy' really didn't do much for me. The biggest problem I had with it was this book. It took care of some mildy interesting side plots which did keep me reading, but when I noticed I had only 50 pages left, I began to worry. The one thing I did not want from this trilogy was a quick and sloppy end to this war. I didn't get it, and for that I am glad. But that is the biggest flaw of this book. While some things get accomplished, it did nothing but set up an inevitable follow up. Don't get me wrong, I cannot wait for the conclusion to the orc conflict, and I will undoubtabley read the next set of books. However, this group was mediocre overall, with some good spots, and one of the most irritating endings I have ever read. Good trilogy with an incredibley disappointing ending."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Salvatore is one of my favorite authors. And this series was making up for the previous few books that were written basically so he could write these characters again and set them up to be in better situations. Now any book is written to put people in situations and watch them go through it, but usually this happens in the book you are reading. The ending wasn't the great climax it usually is, it REALLY felt like it was all setting it up for future books. I like a novel that stands on it's own and leaves room OPEN for something to happen in the future (in your imagination or in a future book) BUT I don't like being set up for a future novel that he wants to write.So I just finished The Twin Blades, the third book in the Hunter's Blades Trilogy. Very good trilogy. I can't recommend it unless you have read all the other books containing Drizzt and Wulgar, because if you haven't read them then about half of this book won't make sense to you at ALL! There are about 14 books you would have to read (you could skip one and be ok) to understand this one. And since two characters from a different series of characters comes into it, I would recommend reading those 5 as well. Now most of these books are definately worth reading, so I recommend them all ;) And the Hunter's Blade trilogy was definately worth reading, but the first two books were better than this one. Since it was a trilogy, I was okay with the way the first two ended, leaving room for everything to be explained in the 3rd. BUT this was the last book in the trilogy, some of the MAJOR things should have been addressed. Instead it was left where we see things will be just as bad in a few months as they were now.Also I have a problem with the way Delly was treated. When she was introduced, she pushed Wulfgar to be a figher cuz that's true to his heart, blah blah blah. She was very understanding (TOO understanding ;)) and all that. Somewhere between her being introduced and this book, aparently the author decided to totally change her. Instead of this being gradual because of circumstances she was put under, we are given NO explanation, he ignores how she behaved earlier and she just suddenly turns into a twit with no explanation. Also he kills off someone who was so obviously a 'plot twist that didn't go over as well as he thought it would', so get rid of the character. I don't have a problem with people dying, just don't kill someone only because you don't want them around anymore cuz people don't like them :p It should feel right or help the story somehow. AND one other major issue I have... in a previous story he messed up. He added an element he thought would make it interesting (which lots of tv shows have done as well). (I don't want to say what it was and spoil it for people) Well it didn't make it interesting, it was okay, but would definately get in the way of future adventuring stories. So he got rid of it in this book, very stupidly too. Also very in a way to set it up for a future adventure :p I don't like being so OBVIOUSLY set up! One of the things I've always loved about this author is that he is NOT obvious. Yes sometimes you can guess where the twist is going to go, but more because you are paying attention and are smart, not because it's all laid out in such a straight line. That's cheap and anyone can write a book like that. Be interesting! I still liked the book, for the most part it was great. But having the two major plot things at the end that were SO done to fix a previous mistake, kinda put a bad taste in my mouth.Oh yeah, I also don't like the love story. In an earlier series we were told Just Friends Just Friends Just Friends, so much so you couldn't think of anything else. Over the years certain fans have whined nooooo they looove each other! So fine aparently the author gave in. I don't like it, Drizzt deserves someone else, like ME! But the author decides to hook them up. In the meantime we meet someone else PERFECT for my boy! But no, he's stuck with her. BLECH! It didn't feel natural for me, although I am sure some fans are very excited about Drizzt's current love life.Anyway I'd recommend his earlier books, and if you like them keep going. But don't start with this one, you'd ruin all the earlier ones."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"---Spoilers---I was upset at the end when things were just left hanging. I know Bob is slowing down in his writing and won't be publishing a new Companions of the Hall (COTH) book anytime soon. I also knew this was the end of a trilogy and I expected things to be all neat and tidy at the end. Instead he surprised me. Blind-sided me, but in a good way. I now have to wait for the next book to find out what happens to the three groups. Drizzt and Innovindil, Catti-Brie and Wulfgar, Bruenor and Regis. All three groups are planning an adventure and are likely to fall into hard times. How will they get out and will they ever meet again are just two of the many questions now brewing in my head. Thanks Bob for catching me off-guard. I'm looking forward to the next COTH novel with an even bigger puddle of drool.The development of Drizzt and his emotional rollercoaster has made me more interested in him. Over the years I had become somewhat bored with Drizzt. He fought, he won, end of story. But now he has feelings. Stronger feelings than I've read before. He's been fleshed out, along with the other COTH characters, to the point where I'm more interested in reading about him.Wulfgar, Catti-Brie, Bruenor, and Regis also grew as characters. Regis I felt was getting older. Showing the hardships of war a little more than he'd like. He's nothing like the fat Halfling that dozed on the lakeshore fishing. Bruenor has seen death and survived. It wasn't really addressed, but I feel he may be taking a bit of a conservative stance at times, now that he sees he is mortal. Wulfgar and Catti-Brie are on the road again, together. There may be some tension between them, but I doubt it will amount to much. Catti-Brie is committed to Drizzt and Wulfgar is/was committed to his adopted daughter and Delly. I think he's in for another emotional road-trip in looking for another wife. Meanwhile Catti-Brie will be thinking of Drizzt and wondering how things will work out in the future. Is there a chance for a half drow-half human child?In conclusion, I see The Two Swords not as the end of the Hunter's Blade Trilogy but as the beginning of a new era for Bob. His writing style has changed dramatically since his first story, Echoes of the Fourth Magic. He moved up in skill with his Demon Wars series and moves up again with The Two Swords. And I think that has brought about the negative reviews. Fans expected to read the classic Drizzt fighting evil in the Underdark. Instead they read a story about the COTH as people fighting an evil that may win. Hopefully, like it did with Vector Prime, the negativity will eventually be washed away. Only time will tell with this newly defining moment in Bob's career.Neil@TK42OONE.com2004 TK42ONE.com Productions"},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"So many people are complaining about the loose ends and the invincibility of Drizzt....WHOOOPPEE!!!The loose ends are there for a reason. How can an author continue on a story if all the ambiguities have been closed up? He can't! So to all the people who want a close ended story....its not gonna happen.And contrary to some of the people who reviewed this book I like Drizzt being the unstoppable character that he is. For crying out loud he survived the wilds of the underdark, various dragons, and even greater demons.....hes supposed to be tough. When i imagine Drizzt in battle it isnt him losing....its him dominating the battlefield.Now given characters like Artemis Entreri also have been through similar if not just as rich experiences as the famed drow and should be able to stand toe to toe with Drizzt, but the idea of a barbarian orc lord in invincible armor was ridiculous. I saw that as the only fault in RAS book. For one thing....glass steel was a technique only known to the sun elves and the avariel. How did a stupid orc ever find a way to make some.Still with this major fault i felt that Bob relayed an excellent story filled with action, and ultimately a story that shown into the heart of Drizzt. As for the loose endings ....I cant wait for his next novel."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"There was so very much to like about this series. The action was well realized, fast paced, and imaginatively told. These are like adventure war novels set in the forgotton realms. The characters are, for the most part interesting- replete with interestingly rendered orcs. There is even a hint that in the numerous-perhaps unending-skirmishes between orcs and the dwarves, that maybe the orcs weren't always at fault. There is character development-though not much. So I have to admit that I read each of these books in about two days after I got them and I thought they were, on the whole, a fun read.That being said, there were times, way too many times, that I would want to throw the books across the room in disgust at the timidity and cowardice Salvatore demonstrates.There are several moments where key characters appear to be killed only to have it turn out that they survive at the beginning of the next chapter, or a few chapters later. I must stress these passages aren't ambiguous. THere is nothing like, \\"it appeared, though he couldn't be sure,\\" or \\"it looked as if blah, blah, but then they disappeared from view.\\" Salvatore describes, completely unsurvivable situations,only to rather cheaply let his babies (Cattie-brie, Wulfgar, Drizzt and REgis) off the hook. Listen, when a mountain giant hurls a boulder at you, and it hits and lands on you, you can not appear in the next chapter with nought but a limp. You can appear battered, bloody, flattened and dead. I suddenly understood the anger felt by a certain number 1 fan from a certain Stephen King book. So if Mr. Salvatore wants to write scenes that make it appear his core characters are going to get killed, fine. I would just appreciated it if he had the respect not to try to cheat them back on to the pages.Also by constantly deus ex machinaing the fan favs from the jaws of death, he subsequentially robs his narrative of any power it might possibly have.The experience has left me a bit reluctant read his next series."},{"Title":"The Two Swords (Forgotten Realms Novel: Hunter's Blades Trilogy)","review":"Compared to the Grisham, Patterson et al books I read this was a great book.

I mean you get DEEP into his character (Drizzt) and emotions. And there is a lot going on here in many sub plots. Some characters die, some find themselves, there are huge battle scenes. I loved it.If you want a new RAS book with new characters read \\"the Highwayman\\". It was incredible. Or pick up the Demon Awakens series, but don't whine if a character that you love dies.

The wisdom found here is deep - more so than you would tend to think at first glance. The author gives a very accurate account for each card - one for how it practically influences my life, on all levels. And then he takes it even further, and explains the spiritual principles behind our daily experiences. The text is easy to read, condensed, and really gives you the opportunity to explore what you are meeting in your own life.He has also added a \\"food for thought\\"- section for each card, which really is exactly that.The book makes it easy and inviting for newcomers to Tarot to start investigating this oracle, and the insight the author conveys in each card is deep enough for even the most seasoned tarot expert.This book is perfect as a gift, and a must for all seekers willing to investigate Life."},{"Title":"Tarot with Cards","review":"I bought this because I was deceived by the attractive pictures of the BACK of the cards (a lovely green &quot;snowflake&quot; on deep blue). The cards and accompanying deck are enclosed in a very attractive folding cardboard case that ties shut. The cards themselves have very simple, brightly coloured diagram-like pictures with absolutely no esoteric content. The pip cards are simply illustrated, with little or no connection to the standard Rider-Waite sort of meanings, so you'd have to have their meanings already memorized. The accompanying book, a well made 114-page hardback, is similarly slick; a page per card, with small picture, simple meaning, brief reversed meaning, and a &quot;reflection&quot;--for the High Priestess, it's &quot;Am I able to see other people's true character or just their facade?&quot; A few spreads and a little history are described.The Chariot becomes The Hero, and shows a little guy in a balloon.Those who cut their teeth on the Thoth deck will consider this the sort of deck that the folks at Aeclectic.net contemptuously dismiss as &quot;a gift shop tarot&quot;. Real beginners will do better with a Rider Waite clone until they learn the minors. Having said all this, I really like the deck.

This deck, however, is an exception to this trend and is clearly above most new decks that depart from the traditional canon of Tarot symbology.This deck is definitely not from the Rider, Thoth or Marseilles tradition, rather, unique, having a bit more in common with the Marseilles pattern (un-illustrated minors). The artwork has aesthetic integrity and is pleasing in color and line. Some liberties were taken with the symbology (\\"The Chariot\\" becomes \\"The Hero\\" in a balloon). The accompanying book is an interesting collection of thoughts upon the Tarot by the designer but, by themselves, are not enough and are incomplete in depth and thought.While I may not recommend this as a beginners deck, it makes a lovely addition to any collection and is remarkably inexpensive. I have found this deck to be easily readable as well. The only negative considerations are the card's finish, which is extremely slick and slippery (that can be carefully modified somewhat) and the lovely case that houses the book and cards is not practical for storing the cards at all."},{"Title":"Tarot with Cards","review":"I love it.

At last a robustly trinitarian and systematic account of Scripture! Webster lays out succinctly, and with refreshing clarity, a doctrine of Scripture in terms of the doctrines of God (chapter 1), the church (chapter 2), and salvation (chapter 3), and then turns, in the final chapter, to a consideration of the role of Scripture in the task of theology. Rejecting critical detachment from his subject, refusing distraction by debates in modern hermeneutics, and setting aside even such pertinent issues as Scripture's relation to tradition and proclamation, Webster has written an urgent and focused account of the nature of Scripture and its role in the economy of grace.Chapter 1, \`Revelation, sanctification and inspiration'. Webster argues that a doctrine of Holy Scripture must be based on a prior account of divine communicative activity; everything to be said about Holy Scripture must be \`subservient to the self-presentation of the triune God' (6). Webster then describes this self-presentation in terms of revelation, sanctification, and inspiration. Revelation is \`the life-giving and loving presence of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Spirit's power among the worshipping and witnessing community' (12). \`The \\"sanctification\\" of Scripture (its \\"holiness\\") and its \\"inspiration\\" (its proceeding from God) are aspects of the process whereby God employs creaturely reality in his service' (8-9). Speaking of Scripture in terms of these three particular aspects of divine communicative activity preserves the priority of divine action, what Webster calls \`proper dogmatic order'. Particularly helpful are Webster's explanation of his choice of the term \`sanctification' to depict God's use of Scripture, along with his critique of descriptions of Scripture as divine accommodation, as analogous to the hypostatic union, as testimony, as a means of grace, and as taking \`servant form' (Berkouwer).Chapter 2, \`Scripture, church and canon'. Where God is communicatively present, says Webster, there also is the church. The church, therefore, is rightly described as the \`creature of the word', and so a doctrine of Scripture must also address Scripture's relationship to the church. According to Webster, \`The definitive act of the church is faithful hearing of the gospel of salvation announced by the risen Christ in the Spirit's power through the service of Holy Scripture' (44). Webster then offers suggestive sketches of the visibility and apostolicity of the church, Scripture's authority within the church (\`its Spirit-bestowed capacity to quicken the church to truthful speech and righteous action' (52)), and the church's act of canonisation.Chapter 3, \`Reading in the economy of grace'. What then does God's communicative presence, within the communion of the church, achieve in the individual reader of Scripture? In this deeply moving, even devotional, chapter, interwoven with seasoned advice from the likes of Calov, Calvin, Bonhoeffer, and Zwingli, Webster portrays the act of reading Scripture as \`an instance of the fundamental pattern of all Christian existence, which is dying and rising with Jesus Christ through the purging and quickening power of the Holy Spirit. Reading Scripture is thus best understood as an aspect of mortification and vivification: to read Scripture is to be slain and made alive' (88).Chapter 4, \`Scripture, theology and the theological school'. The \`Current Issues in Theology' series to which this book belongs is intended for \`upper-undergraduates and graduate students of theology, as well as...Christian teachers and church professionals'. It is appropriate, then, that the one particular, non-dogmatic issue Webster chooses to address is the role of Scripture in the theological tasks of formulating doctrine, catechesis, and training church leaders. Taking his cue this time from Ursinus, Webster argues that theology, in all its tasks, is \`a simple sketch or outline of the different parts of Christian teaching with an eye to their scope and interrelations. There is no organising principle,...and no interest in defence or apologetic commendation: the aim is simple summary description' (113). Theology, therefore, is \`not a set of improvements on Scripture', but is rather \`most properly an invitation to read and reread Scripture, to hear and be caught up by Scripture's challenge to a repentant, non-manipulative heeding of God's Word' (130). Webster then concludes this extraordinary account of Scripture with Calvin's \`Jeremiah' prayer and a poignant appeal from Augustine's sermons on the Gospel of John."},{"Title":"Holy Scripture: A Dogmatic Sketch (Current Issues in Theology)","review":"This little book is not a light read. Webster writes at a high level of discourse and assumes the reader is familiar with theological terms and developments. As a masters level student, I read this at the tail end of my first year and still felt I was only grazing the surface. Webster is particular with his word usage, serving the purpose of delivering a very punctual, direct message. He uses terms that require industry specific familiarity, nearly to the scholar's level. It is not enough to look up the unfamiliar words in a dictionary, as the words are nuanced according to current-day use.That said, John Webster was certainly targeting his scholarly peers with this book. It is fascinating and brilliant. He addresses the both the liberal and fundamentalist position over scripture as arrogant and overstepping the authority given to the church by God. The main thrust is that the church should come before God on its knees in humility, instead of \\"lording\\" over the Scriptures. The church should not act like God, thus \\"limiting\\" God. It should not claim to know things it can not know. The church should not worship its own authority, but allow God to continually make and rebreak it, to continue to allow God's truth to speak... Jesus upholds the church, just as he upholds the individual believer. The church never \\"arrives\\", never has it all figured out. God's revelation has not stopped. The Scriptures are not God's Word without the Holy Spirit. Otherwise, it is just a book. The Holy Spirit is required for truth from the Scriptures to be grasped. This is because God's revelation is being continually revealed to us. The Scriptures are living and breathing and powerful because of the HS. We should be open to God's leading. We can not read the Bible and force our interpretation on the Bible. Instead, we should approach it with humility before God and wait for him to reveal it to us. We should maintain our understanding of it in humility. Neither the individual nor the church is ever an authority over the Scriptures. The Scriptures are in continued authority over the church, and with the HS will reshape the church over and over, perserving truth. This is much like how walking with God is a faith proposition. To try to define it and box it up, or to create a list of rules and say \\"this is walking with God\\" is to miss the point. The church must do the very same thing with regard to the scriptures."},{"Title":"Holy Scripture: A Dogmatic Sketch (Current Issues in Theology)","review":"A professor once told me, \\"John Webster does not waste his words.\\" That is certainly the case in this book. While subtitled a \\"sketch\\", and only consisting of 137 pgs of text, this is one of the \\"meatiest\\" theological works I have read in a long time. It was a difficult read, yet not in the sense that I couldn't understand it, but because Webster is packs in important theological points in every paragraph. It's as though you're in a lecture and the professor says, \\"If you doze off for even 10 seconds in the next 20 minutes then you will miss the overall point!\\" At the same time, I have read 4-500 pg books that ultimately say less than Webster did in just over 100 pages. I could certainly re-read this book over the next few years and continue to benefit from it. Webster is an excellent theologian who does first-rate theology with a genuine concern for the church and discipleship in the midst of his discussion of Holy Scripture in light of the Trinity. Other reviewers here have outlined and summarized the book, and so I will not repeat what they have said. Nevertheless, while the reading may be slow, the reward is great. I highly recommend this book to those interested in understand what Holy Scripture is (or even those interested in how to do good theology)."},{"Title":"Holy Scripture: A Dogmatic Sketch (Current Issues in Theology)","review":"John Webster's work, Holy Scripture: A Dogmatic Sketch is exactly what the title implies, it is a dogmatic account sketching out a doctrine of Holy Scripture. It is not meant to be a comprehensive account of Holy Scripture, thus it is just a sketch. Also it is a piece of dogmatic theology, thus it is a piece of theology which exists within the bounds of recognized church dogma. In the book he takes for granted the most essential pre-suppositions of Christianity and creates an account of scripture from there. What results is a brief, but dense, dogmatic ontology of scripture. It is an account of \\"what Holy Scripture is in the saving economy of God's loving and regenerative self-communication.\\"[1]This book is divided into an introduction, four chapters, and a conclusion. Foundational to Webster's account is Chapter 1. The content of chapter one, specifically his definition of revelation, sets the trajectory for the rest of his work. One might even say that the rest of the book is an unfolding of Webster's definition of revelation.In the introduction Webster tells the reader what he intends to do in this dogmatic sketch. He tells the reader that he is trying to give an account of what Holy Scripture is. Not necessarily what Scripture does, or why it does the things it does, but what it is. Any talk about what scripture does in the life of the church, or in the life of unbelievers will flow out from what it is. For Webster these other issues are secondary. Webster begins with the question of whether there even is such a thing as Holy Scripture. He claims that the Christian dogmatic position says that yes there is, and whatever Holy Scripture is, it must be understood in the context of the triune God's saving action and the triune God's revelatory action. Although we do need to take into account that Holy Scripture is still a human text, we must first understand Holy Scripture in light of what it is in the context of God's loving and regenerative self-communication.Chapter 1 begins by attempting to clear up what people mean when they speak about \\"Holy Scripture.\\" Naturally Holy Scripture can refer to a set of texts, but we must be careful not to treat it as simply another text which is religious in nature. Perhaps Holy Scripture can be considered in light of how the text is used by the church. However we must be careful about defining Holy Scripture solely in its relationship and reception by the community that uses that text. Although we may talk about Holy Scripture in these two ways Holy Scripture must be primarily understood in light of its \\"origin, function, and end in divine self-communication.\\"[2] Understanding Holy Scripture in this way will lead us to see that Holy Scripture is shorthand for \\"the nature and function of the biblical writings in a set of communicative acts which stretch from God's merciful self-manifestation to the obedient hearing of the community of faith.\\"[3]Since Holy Scripture is primarily the writings in a set of divine self-communication, but also a text which is meant to be received by a creaturely community, this means that a dogmatic account of Scripture must be about God's communication and about humanity's reception of the text. In this chapter Webster takes on the first part of this task, sketching out how Holy Scripture relates to God's revealing, sanctifying, and inspiring actions. It could be said that this chapter is the most important chapter in the book because it sets the foundation for the rest of the chapters.Webster begins by defining revelation as \\"the self-presentation of the triune God, the free work of sovereign mercy in which God wills, establishes, and perfects saving fellowship with himself in which humankind comes to know, love, and fear him above all things.\\"[4] By defining revelation Webster points out that revelation is not merely cognitive. Revelation is the act of presenting a person for the sake of relationship. The triune God presents himself so that humans would enter a relationship with him that is marked by love, fear, and presence. In the end revelation reconciles humanity to God and brings humans into the light of the knowledge of God. Webster goes on to define sanctification as \\"the act of God the Holy Spirit in hallowing creaturely processes, employing them in the service of the taking form of revelation within the history of the creation.\\"[5] Defining sanctification in this way allows Webster to bypass docetic and naturalistic tendencies that are often played out when discussing the nature of scripture. If we understand scripture as a sanctified text we are allowed to maintain the special nature of scripture and the creaturely processes involved in the writing of scripture. Finally Webster says that any definition of scripture must not primarily be about the text itself, nor how it functions in the community, but rather it must be about the divine action accounting for the formation of the text. This must include the fact that the generative impulse of the text lies in God's will and not the human will, that the action is carried out by the Holy Spirit, that the Holy spirit impels writing of words, not just subject matter.In chapter two Webster takes on the relationship between Scripture and the Church and Scripture and the canon. Webster works out how these relationships are to be understood in light of what has been said about revelation, sanctification, and inspiration. However, these relationships are primarily worked out in light of what has been said about revelation and God's saving work. Webster says that however we are to understand these relationships we must understand them keeping in mind that the church is hearing church, a spiritually visible church, and an apostolic church. First the church is a hearing church; it hears and receives God's revelation through the gospel. Secondly, the church is visible as the place where the gospel, the revelation of God, dwells. Finally, the church is apostolic in that it is sent by the mandate of the risen Christ, to proclaim the revelation of God. The church that is described by these three characteristics is the church that the Spirit has enabled the recognition of, trust in, and glad obedience to the Holy Scriptures. Finally as we talk about the canonization of scripture, we must understand canonization as the act of the church accepting, submitting, and committing itself to the authority of these writings.In chapter three Webster shows the reader what it looks like to read the scriptures within \\"an economy of grace.\\" Once again the definition of revelation helps us understand what he means. Remembering that revelation is the self-presentation of the triune God that perfects saving fellowship, we come to understand that as revelation, scripture is a part of God's saving work which leads to fellowship with God. Thus when a believer reads scripture she must read it in light of how God uses it to perfect fellowship with himself. This means that the reader must come to the scriptures with humility, willing to be confronted but also expecting to be given grace through God's presence.The fourth and final chapter takes up some of the material presented in chapter three and applies it to the field of theology. By examining Ursinus' \\"A Hortatory Oration to the Study of Divinity,\\" Webster argues that theology must be done with humility, that it must lead to the edification of the church, and that it must keep Holy Scripture central. If the church and theological schools are to do theology properly, they must understand theology as an operation of reason in the economy of grace.[6]These four chapters constantly return to the fact that Holy Scripture is to be understood in light of its position in the economy of grace. The giving of scripture is an act of grace. The reading of scripture is an act of God's grace. The studying and teaching of scripture is an act of God's gracious purposes to bring us into perfect fellowship with himself."},{"Title":"Holy Scripture: A Dogmatic Sketch (Current Issues in Theology)","review":"Barth says, \\"the doctrine of the Word of God is itself the only analogy to the doctrine which will be our fundamental concern as we develop the concept of revelation. This is the doctrine of the triunity of God\\" (I.121). Accordingly, Webster writes, \\"Revelation is the corollary of trinitarian theology and soteriology. \`The center is not divine self-identification but divine saving action\\" (17). Barth and a Bathian theologian, Webster, their theology on revelation and the Word is thus trinitarian redemptive existential dialectical modern-to-postmodern reflection.For Webster, revelation is \\"the life-giving and loving presence of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Spirit's power among the worshipping and witnessing community\\" (12). For Barth, \\"To say revelation is to say \`The Word became flesh'\\"(I. 119), and this is a catalyst which Barth engenders his doctrine of Holy Scripture: \\"The revealed Word of God we know only from the Scripture adopted by Church proclamation or the proclamation of the Church bases on Scripture\\" (I. 121; cf. kerygmatic-doxological use of Scripture by the church, Webster, 8). Frequently quoted words from Barth reads, \\"It takes place as an event when and where the biblical word becomes God's Word, i.e., when and where the biblical word comes into play as a word of witness,.... Thus in the event of God's Word revelation and the Bible are indeed one, and literally so\\" (113). On the same regards, Webster inculcates this by using a previously little related word with the subject of revelation, namely sanctification: \\"The \`sanctification' of Scripture (its \`holiness') and its \`inspiration' (its proceeding from God) are aspects of the process whereby God employs creaturely reality in his service, for the attestation of his saving self-revelation\\" (9). Thus Barth's major contribution of \\"Christological concentration\\" began the dialogue of modern theology, reviving the doctrine of the Trinity, of which its discussion of \\"The Trinity\\" became quite different after Barth: such a Christocentric discussion of the Trinity ameliorated Pannenberg's radical assertion that until the coming of God's kingdom \\"God does not exist,\\" and motivated Webster to assert that a proper understanding of Scripture includes its concept as servant that \\"the text does not have to assume divine properties as a protection against contingency\\" (25; cf. Berkouwer, Holy Scripture).Barth's trinitarian concept of the Word of God gave him freedom to say that revelation, Scripture and proclamation can be substituted with names of the divine persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit (I. 121). Speaking of revelation in this manner, according to Webster, must preserve the priority of divine action through three particular aspects of divine communicative activity. The Bible is, for Barth, \\"the concrete means by which the Church recollects God's past revelation, is called to expectation of His future revelation, and is thus summoned and guided to proclamation and empowered for it\\" (I. 111). Thus the deficiency of Barthian understanding of revelation exacerbated from modernity to postmodern era. The authority of the Bible has been only questioned and disputed throughout. Many post-Barthian theologians have tried to contextualize his theology into contemporary Christianity; from Bultmann, Brunner, Tillic, Pannenberg to Webster they have sought such integration, but despite of its usefulness Barthian seems to demand young theologians fresh start in their own context of doing theology."},{"Title":"Holy Scripture: A Dogmatic Sketch (Current Issues in Theology)","review":"Everything was good in ordering and receiving this book.

I have had to re-read passages to attempt to grasp Webster's point.What is the point of phrasing a book in such a way that it is severely restrictive in readership. Already, before even touching on content, the application is narrowed, for not many can go there. It requires a highfalutin vocabulary, probably available only to graduate and post-graduate theological/philosophical minds.I have read 'theological' books for some time, and enjoy (and am quite interested in, from a 'what's going on?' perspective) the current discussions on interpreting Scripture.

But .. wow!"},{"Title":"Ancient Israel's Faith and History: An Introduction to the Bible in Context","review":"George E. Mendenhall has been described by eminent students of the Bible as one of the most creative American scholars of the ancient Near East in the twentieth century. Yet his fundamental work is largely unknown outside the guild of professional historians, philologists, and archaeologists. Now a comprehensive account of his reconstruction of the history of ancient Israel is available in a beautifully edited, attractively produced form. It can be understood and appreciated even by those who haven't mastered the technical tools of the professional scholar.His pre-eminent interest, studied over a period of some six decades, has been the origins of ancient Israel. In Mendenhall's view, it is in Israel's origins that we find the essential clues to the interpretation of all subsequent Israelite history-including the appearance of Jesus of Nazareth and the early Christian Church some 1200 years after the time of Moses. A brief review such as this cannot hope to do justice to the enormous wealth of material in this superb book. I will attempt only a sketchy summary of each chapter.IntroductionFirst he posits several illuminating general principles for understanding the phenomenon of religion, which are applied throughout the following chapters to Israel's particular historical phases.Abraham to MosesThen Mendenhall surveys the later part of the Bronze Age (2500-1200 B.C.) in the Eastern Mediterranean, covering the rise and fall of empires. He also characterizes (the main thrust of the chapter) the emergence, from at least 2000 B.C. onward, of numerous groups of &quot;Apiru&quot;--people who altogether disavowed political loyalties. He cites linguistic reasons for associating &quot;Apiru&quot; with &quot;transgressor&quot; or &quot;outlaw.&quot; Apiru groups, lacking any legal protection, survived via banditry, mercenary militarism, or by converting agricultural assets to movable livestock and escaping to uninhabited regions inaccessible to political authorities. The less fortunate among them were prey to enslavement as state laborers--as were thousands of Apiru in Egypt.Moses and the ExodusMoses' leadership of the &quot;exodus&quot; of a few hundred Apiru from Egypt is tied in Biblical tradition (correctly, in Mendenhall's view) to two revolutionary religious innovations: monotheism in which the defining characteristic of God (&quot;Yahweh&quot;) is ethical concern; and the use of a new form for the mediation of this Yahwism--the Covenant, derived by analogy from the forms and functions of international suzerainty treaties in use already for a millennium.The Twelve-Tribe FederationMendenhall continues his historical reconstruction to the formation in two stages of the Twelve-Tribe federation of ancient Israel, created and sustained by the Mosaic Covenant, which put into practice the seemingly exotic notion of a state-less society.David and the Transition to MonarchyThe federation functioned for about two centuries; pressure by Philistines accelerated the decline in morale and prompted desires for the institution of a political state capable of dealing more effectively with them. Samuel himself foresaw this move as the repudiation of Yahweh and the Covenant. Mendenhall illuminates the ingenious strategy then employed by David and the pagan bureaucrats inherited from the defeated Jerusalem to construct a synthesis of Yahwism and paganism, for which he adopts the term &quot;Yahwisticism&quot;.The Legacy of King SolomonWith King Solomon the &quot;re-paganization of Israel&quot; reached new heights. Mendenhall relates how Solomon's building program--involving the imposition of the corv&eacute;e labor from which the Apiru slaves had escaped with Moses!--provided a new Phoenician Temple for the theologians and a swell Hittite palace for the king. &quot;Yahweh,&quot; once the repudiator of coercion, had become merely the new &quot;Baal,&quot; the Bronze Age hypostasis of state legitimacy and power. Mendenhall limns the intricate, unscrupulous struggles among Solomon's successors, and correlates the poetic oracles of Hosea and Amos to the ongoing upheavals of state, bringing into relief their invocation of the old covenantal elements.Josiah Reforms the Imperial ReligionMendenhall next turns to the fate of the kingdom of Judah and the biblical literature catalyzed by its history. He presents the historical preparation for Josiah and the latter's reforms. He also offers insights into the perverse consequences of the failure of Sennacherib's siege of Jerusalem during Hezekiah's reign (the unwarranted confidence that Yahweh's highest priority was the protection of Jerusalem and its Temple).Destruction and Exile: The Creative Reform of YahwismThe destruction of Jerusalem predicted by Jeremiah (and Ezekiel) was a catastrophe for Israel-as-Davidic-Dynasty and produced enormous suffering for countless hapless individuals. Meditations on it by some of the greatest religious geniuses of history are enshrined in various Biblical writings, especially Jeremiah and Ezekiel; Job (the book is worth having for this section alone); and &quot;Second Isaiah.&quot; But the universalizing re-expression of Israel's covenant faith by these writers was just one response to the Exile. With the return of the exiles to Palestine under the Persian Cyrus, Ezra and Nehemiah wrote another new chapter in the evolution of Yahwism.Jesus and the New Testament ReformationReading the New Testament in the light of the Old Testament makes it clear that Jesus' message hearkens back to the Covenant faith and the inspired re-expressions and adaptations of it by the great prophets. In a word, it was a creative reformation movement within the tradition of Israel's faith. Mendenhall throws a flood of light on &quot;the Kingdom of God,&quot; &quot;Messiah,&quot; &quot;Law,&quot; and on &quot;covenant&quot; itself as it reappears in the Christian Eucharist.SummaryThis magnificent book by one of the towering figures in Biblical scholarship throws an arresting new light on the universal significance of the ancient ethical-religious vision of Moses and pre-monarchic Israel. It shows how, despite the ever-changing vicissitudes of Israel's history, this vision reappears, creatively readapted, in the prophetic legacy, in the Exile, in Jesus and the early Church. It is well worth having just for the fascinating word-studies to be found throughout the text. No one who takes its insights seriously can look at either the Bible or the surviving religious institutions in the same way. I believe it should be read and deeply pondered by all who are committed to the life of faith."},{"Title":"Ancient Israel's Faith and History: An Introduction to the Bible in Context","review":"When I studied ancient near eastern history years ago, one of the more frustrating regions to gain insight into was the Levant. The area was rife with petty and ephemeral kingdoms contending for supremacy among their peers and for survival in the face of the imperialistic enterprises of the mightier rulers on their world scene. Rarely were these more than infrequently mentioned names. The notable exception was, not surprisingly, ancient Israel whose history, mythology, and culture are still known to most of us through the mechanism of the written work popularly known as The Old Testament. Though it contains information about many of the players in the political drama played out in the region over several thousand years, it is not an easy document to use. Dr. Mendenhall in his book Ancient Israel's Faith and History has done a superlative job of presenting the material in a very clear, organized, and informative manner.One of the problems with studying the Bible as a historical document lies in the fact that it has such a diverse history of its own. The authors of various portions of it had their own motives, information sources, and world view, the redactors their own set, modern day interpreters theirs, etc. As Dr. Mendenhall writes in his preface, &quot;Through the ages, whether through ignorance or malice, the Bible has frequently been misinterpreted, misunderstood, and misused (p. xvii),&quot; and he notes that the &quot;scribes were less interested in understanding their own history than they were in exploiting it (p. xviii).&quot;Nor are the motives of ancient scribes the only source of difficulties. Modern day scholarship has also lent it\`s particular spin to Biblical interpretations. Again in Mendenhall\`s words, &quot;Modern biblical scholars--who should be in the best position to help our understanding--are themselves frequently hamstrung by the enormously broad range of requisite knowledge (including ancient history and languages) and by the inability or unwillingness to separate their scholarship from the presumptions and orthodoxies of their peer groups (xvii).&quot;Dr. Mendenhall does not seem to suffer from any such problem. According to the forward by Gary Herion, the gentleman has an extensive knowledge of ancient languages, a first hand knowledge of modern day local cultures in the Middle East, and a knowledge of the archaeology of the area. In reading the book, I would also add to this list, that I found very little to indicate a religious bias of his own to defend. He approaches the subject with the objectivity and organization of one who is fond of puzzels and their solution.In writing his book, which bears clear signs of its origin in lecture notes, Dr. Mendenhall has methodically begun at the beginning. The introduction to Ancient Israel's Faith and History begins, not with the biblical narrative, but with a description of religion itself. He asks and answers five questions: What is one\`s religion, what are religious communities, what does religion actually do, how are religious values transmitted, and how does a religious system change over time? He also enumerates and describes five key &quot;observations&quot; or &quot;laws&quot; about religion: The law of transference, the law of functional shift, the law of elaboration, the law of contrast, and the law of finality. And finally he sets out how religions develop: The prologue to the religion, the formative period, the adaptive period, the traditional period, and the reform period. Armed with this instructive information, the reader is able to follow the author's progress through the various books--and by them the history--of ancient Israel and its religion.Of most interest to me was the formative period of Israel's post exilic years of which he provides a very cogent discussion. Anyone who has studied the Bible as history knows of the Habiru, of the Hyksos, of the Merneptah stele, and so on, but Dr. Mendenhall brings these early years into far greater perspective. Certainly his discussion of the Ten Commandments as ten commitments makes the history of the Exodus and its later effect on Israel's development and ultimate collapse as an ancient state clearer.Of some significance is the pertinence of the work to modern day events in the Middle East. In his discussion of the meaning of some of the commandments in the historical context of their development, Mendenhall makes some very important points, especially with respect to values. When one realizes that what one values most and fears the loss of most is what is &quot;worshipped&quot; in one's culture, one can see why those with a stricter sense of &quot;godliness&quot; and commitment, like the members of the Taliban community or of Bin Ladin's followers, would find the western world's habit of valuing possessions to be godless behavior, and to some extent it is.Of importance too, at least to me, is the gentleman's inclusion of a short bibliography at the end of each chapter which provides the reader with sources of further information. Although Dr. Mendenhall is himself now retired, the bibliographical entries vary widely in date. Included are works like Gurney's The Hittites, Samuel Noah Kramer's The Sumerians, and John Wilson's The Culture of Ancient Egypt, all dating to the 1960s. Later works like Sheler's Is the Bible True? (1999) and Frerichs and Lesko's Exodus: the Egyptian Evidence (1997), suggest that he has kept his overall knowledge base current. Journal articles, however, seem to be 1980 and earlier, which suggest that he may be falling behind in the venue of the professional literature.Overall I found this a very readable, informative and interesting book. I would recommend it highly to anyone with an interest in the history of the ancient world, in Biblical history, or in the history of the bible itself. It would make a nice gift for a religious person who enjoys studying the bible and who is able to do so with an open mind. For those who are inclined to view the Bible and religion from a more rigid perspective, I suspect it would offend their sense of Divine Word."},{"Title":"Ancient Israel's Faith and History: An Introduction to the Bible in Context","review":"Written mainly from a Near Eastern context and an archeological perspective, this is one of the few texts that are written about the historical elements of the Bible that does not attempt to fictionalize the stories within. Although, the author clearly does not take each piece of scripture literally this book should not offend anyone but the most stubborn. So if your convictions are rigid, you will not like this book. However, if you are open to other perspectives outside the Christian dogma, you will find this text educational and not offensive.The three main points that lead me to recommend this book are; 1. The author's exposition of the Ten Commandments which will surprize most Christians but not Hebrews. He mainly confirms the reason why Hebrews refer to them as the &quot;Ten Utterances,&quot; or as the author prefers, the &quot;Ten Commitments.&quot; He does so with a comparison to the ancient treaty construction which I found refreshing. 2. His basic outline of how and in what order religion evolves. What I appreciated most concerning this was his treatment of Christ as a reformer and not some revolutionary with some brand new religion as he is mainly portrayed by most even within the Church. All of which, fall right into line with those Christians that understand their Hebraic roots. 3. The diversity of those involved with the Exodus and the subsequent nature of the kingdom. All of these points are widely misunderstood among Christianity.Unfortunately, although not necessarily uncalled for, the author provides ample evidence of Israel's idolatry. I'm not quite sure why this isn't common knowledge and I'm not sure why this idolatry necessarily negates a principle faith in God, but it does in some people's minds and therefore this exposition is probably necessary.The only real disagreement I had with the author is the assumption that the Bible teaches a massive invasion and subsequent wipeout of the indigenous people of the land. For instance the Bible makes it clear that God would allow the Hebrews to conquer the land gradually as shown in Exodus 23:29-30. Although the author prevents evidence to support these verses, his assumption is that the few instances of Joshua's utter annihilation were the norm, or at least perceived to be the norm. If his assumption is the former, I strongly disagree, if the later I can appreciate the manner in which his case was made.Overall, this is a well written text written in a non-combative style that is a nice change from most of the other archeological texts concerning the Bible."},{"Title":"Ancient Israel's Faith and History: An Introduction to the Bible in Context","review":"Biblical minimalists won't like this book, because Mendenhall does not accept that absence of evidence means evidence of absence (because there is no archaeological evidence of the Exodus, for example, it did not happen); they may enjoy it, however, because they can spend their time picking it to pieces. Christian fundamentalists (and possibly Jewish ones also, though i know less about them) won't like it either, because Mendenhall does not accept that every word of the Bible is directly from God (the Exodus happened, with over a million people leaving Egypt); they may enjoy it, though, because they can send him rude letters about his failure to support Christianity.On the other hand, however, those who are seeking Truth in life, those whose view of God is not immutable (though God may be), those who are interested in learning how God revealed himself in history, they will both enjoy and like this book.Mendenhall passes through the history of ancient Israel from before the Exodus to the time of Jesus, and describes his view of that history as it relates to the religions and histories of the surrounding nations, and to the covenant with YHWH. Interestingly, he does not equate that covenant with Judaism. Rather, he calls the obsevance of the covenant &quot;Yahwism&quot; which he contrasts with &quot;Yahwisticism&quot; (the making of YHWH a &quot;patron saint&quot; or divine protector to be appeased by certain rituals) and the Judaism he shows as developing from the latter. The relationship between Yahwism and Yahwisticism is identical to the relationship between the personal knowledge of Jesus and Church attendance and singing hymns Sunday morning.In Mendenhall's view, the designation &quot;Hebrew&quot; was not an ethnic tag, but an indication that the person so labelled was an outcast from society. The originl covenant-makers were 'Apiru (Hebrews) who had escaped from slavery in Egypt and agreed to live together in a certain fashion. The practice of the covenant they made entailed in them certain ethical behaviour (Yahwism), described in the original Ten Commandments -- which he calls the Ten Commitments.Gradually, over time, the Hebrews became the society instead of the outcasts, and it became more acceptable over the land, in the towns as well as the 'Apiru villages and groupings, to join the covenant. As more and more people worshiped YHWH, though, the worship form became more important, the ethics less important, and YHWH and his requirements started to be indistinguishable from the gods of the surrounding peoples. In the same way, to relate this to something we may understand more intimately, Jesus, the Father, Mary, and Christian celebrations became much more like Apollo, Jupiter, Athene, and pagan festivals once Christianity became the legal religion of the Roman Empire. This formalised religion is what Mendenhall calls Yahwisticism. Quite clearly, as Mendenhall explains it, Yahwisiticsm developed as a response to (and adaptation of) the religions of the surrounding nations, in order to suit the political leaders' desire for power, which was the very opposite of the essence of Yahwism. The Hebrews misunderstood and re-interpreted their past, and started to view YHWH as another Baal ~ a local god of power, to be worshipped in specific ways and places. Yahwism thus lost in the battle with the Canaanite religions, though we usually view the Bible as the record of the Israelites's successful religion.The prophets who are reported all through the Jewish scriptures were those who understood the nature of the original covenant, and called the people back to their original Yahwism. Mendenhall sees Jesus as one, perhaps the last, in that line of such prophets, and understands early Christianity to have been a return to the historical line of Yahwism, rather than a radical departure from everything revealed in the Old Testament. Thus, and this is the endpoint of the book, Christianity and Christians ought to be paying closer attention to the Old Testament and the covenant contained therein, as they are their root, origin, and history.The book is well written; derived from talks he gave over a number of years, it still bears the marks of its origin in a simple, flowing style. Quite differently from many books of the genre i have read, the work is readily accessible to the person with little background knowledge. The fourteen-page glossary explains in detail many terms lay readers may find questionable; the bibliography points the reader in many directions to discover more information, should he so incline.All in all, other than for the two groups mentioned above, an excellent read, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ancient Israel's Faith and History: An Introduction to the Bible in Context","review":"Prof. George Mendenhall has devoted a lifetime to understanding the old testament and what stands behind and under it. In this splendid work he summarises 60 years of work and study. His proposals are frequently controversial (10 commitments not commandments? Moses went up the mountain how many times? Jesus as a Jewish reformer?) but more often than not have come to represent mainstream thought about historical and theological issues raised by the current text of the Bible. His approach is forensic: looking deeply into physical, literary and reliligious history in a parallel manner so as to understand the context of what he reads. The work stands by itself as a wonderful introduction to 3000 years of history before the common era but can also be used as a study guide, since Dr. Mendenhall has been generous with recommending additional readings and sources.I have been looking for a long time for a text which explains the origins of the the books of the old testament: Ancient Israel's Faith and History fills the bill extremely well, in an insightful and entertaining way. If you have a genuine interest in this subject, it is a must read."},{"Title":"Ancient Israel's Faith and History: An Introduction to the Bible in Context","review":"While the mid-east is probably the most excavated area on the planet, there is only a very very small amount of information available about the ancient days. The best anyone can do is to take that and propose what must have actually happened. The difference in the history of Israel is the existence of the Bible, a source which, depending on the reader contains a lot, some, or no historical information at all. All archaeologists, all people fall somewhere on the scale from the extreme maximalist who sees the Bible as 100% accurate to the extreme minimalist who see it as 100% fiction. Personally, I think both positions are untenable.Since I am not an archaeologist, though, it doesn't really matter what I think. The authors of this book appear to be close to the middle (a totally objective position) or slightly toward the view that the Bible contains some useful information and an effort should be made to dig (no pun intended) it out.SO, that gives us a history of Israel and that region that seems to be fairly mainstream. There are some added features though. The author writes consistently about the problem of a social coercion and how it doesn't fit in with true religion. He also explains the cycle of phases that religions experience. The prologue, formative, adaptive, traditional and reform periods comprise this cycle. He begins with the important prologue period and emphasizes the importance of understanding its contribution to a cultures religion. He takes us through the formative and traditional periods and ends with a discussion of reform. He links Christianity closely to Judaism through this cycle.This text is written for the general reader. By design, there are no footnotes but, as the author indicates, there is a well-organized suggested reading list at the end of each chapter. And each of those sources offer more sources for the interested person.Overall, this history is easy to read and for most read, fairly non-controversial. The Biblical places, times and events of the Hebrew Bible that are supported by archaeology are pointed out and so are those that are not. Anyone not at one extreme or the other should learn from this book."},{"Title":"Ancient Israel's Faith and History: An Introduction to the Bible in Context","review":"This book appears to be designed as a text book. Each chapter has a section which outlines further reading and the book is full of illustrations and diagrams.The book deals with a difficult subject but is generally pleasant and non dogmatic. It is reasonably short and easy to read.To put the book into context, some years ago it was thought that the bible was an accurate historic record of both Israel and the Jewish people. Modern archeology has created some big doubts about the historical accuracy of the bible.For example the book which discusses Abraham mentions the use of camels. It would appear that in the relevant period camels had not been domesticated. An examination of Egyptian records shows no mention of the tribes of Israel as a captive source of labour at any time in its history. There is no mention of their escape and the destruction of an Egyptian Army in the Red Sea.The bibilical account of the conquest of the holdy land by Joshua describes the siege of larged walled cities such as Jerico. An examination of the historical record shows that these cities to the extent that they existed were small and unfortified. Lastly it would seem that there is no real evidence that the Davidic Kingdom existed as descibed in the bible.These findings have led to a number of schools of thought. One school suggests that the books of the bibal which purport to be a historical record are in fact things which were written centuries after the occurance as a means of providing a rallying call for the state of Judah. That the writtings were more of a form of propoganda to inspire the present than being a record of the past.Mendenhall's book is an attempt to find a sort of middle way, which can reconcile parts of the biblical record with the historical record. He thus suggests that the basis events in the bible occured but they have been subsquently exagerated. Thus the exodus did occur but it would have been a smaller group. There would have been some form of Davidic Kingdom but it would have been smaller.One interesting part of the book is the section on the ten commandments. Mendenhall argues convincingly that instead of being \\"laws\\"these were more commitments that would identify individuals as the members of the religous group.In general terms a pleasant book, but one in which the basis of the writting is one of faith rather than hard evidence."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes II","review":"The Game's afoot again as David Timson narrates the second volume of The Adventures.

I recommend this book to all my family members and friends. Marti"},{"Title":"1001 Great Gift Ideas","review":"First, I need to express how well written this book is. I found it easy to read and very helpful. Second, I have a number of events coming up this year and have little money to spend. This book will help me stay within my budget and be creative at the same time. I am very pleased with my purchase and encourage others to make the same investment."},{"Title":"1001 Great Gift Ideas","review":"Unlike the person from California, I did find this book useful, creative, and imaginative. The fact that five talented writers got together and shared their gift ideas made it even more rewarding, because it was not just based on the experiences of one person. I highly recommend this book. The reader will certainly return to its contents again and again to obtain ideas for a variety of gift giving occasions."},{"Title":"1001 Great Gift Ideas","review":"If people have told you that you give awesome gifts, you don't really need this book. However, if you're tired of giving the same 1 or 2 gifts to your friends every year, this book is a great reference to look through for all occasions. The book is organized in all kinds of sections: what to buy during certain holidays, what to buy a person depending on their relationship to you, what to buy someone with a certain interest, etc. There are special icons throughout the book to denote if the gift idea is really expensive, inexpensive, homemade, or unusual. The icons are very helpful if you're hoping to give a gift that fits in any of those categories. Some examples of gifts mentioned in this book: a handmade box of recipes for a housewarming gift, an original poster for a movie buff, and X-rated chocolates for your significant other on Valentine's Day.The book is not perfect--I'm sure that if you're very creative, you can come up with a better book--but the point of this book is to help those who are not-so-creative. Keep in mind that the authors couldn't have come up with gifts that were TOO specific that they would be hard to find. Also, since you've seen or heard of most of these items sometime in your long life before, you can't expect these gift ideas to be mind-blowing or anything. Give the authors some credit for writing a fairly well organized, good-humored book geared towards the gift giver who desperately needs better ideas for presents."},{"Title":"1001 Great Gift Ideas","review":"Your review has placed you in the same category as you have placed the authors of this book!Certainly five contributors must have come up with something you had not thought of yourself or perhaps you should write your own book .I personally found this book enlightening and well written,with some unique suggestions.

Unlike many other books where you need to be familiar with technical terms and financial markets in order to benefit, this book is written for the novice investor. It is not meant to be a textbook. In Ms. Baker's words, she &quot;wishes to give the reading and investing public a flavor for what their dollars in mutual funds do all day.&quot; In that she succeeds. I discovered that I really didn't understand some terms which I thought I had, and my understanding of others was greatly enhanced. For those of us not yet ready for (or interested in) deep, technical, financial reading, this book provides a very entertaining introduction to the field and the analogies the author uses are very helpful. It whetted my appetite to learn more.The good news - with a little bit of luck we might do as well as a mutual fund manager; the bad news - with a little bit of luck we might do as well as a mutual fund manager who we're paying to manage our money for us!"},{"Title":"High-Flying Adventures in the Stock Market","review":"Author Molly Baker follows a top-performing mutual team around for a year, and shows you how they did it during the final six months.

That's the &quot;run with the bulls&quot; part of the story. That's a reference by me to the concept that when the market is hot, you should get into the hottest part of the market (better known as momentum investing). If you take a more conservative approach, you don't make the big bucks. A major part of the year's big gains versus other funds comes in the last few minutes of the last trading day of 1998 as AOL surges following its addition to the S&amp;P 500 Index. But how the team does it is very repetitive and boring, even though they go through a gut-wrenching drop as Russian bond failures collapse the stock market and Long Term Capital has to be rescued by the Fed. That's the &quot;watching the paint dry&quot; part of the story.This is a very challenging book to review accurately. The book has many fine qualities. Its best feature is that Molly Baker is terrific for finding everyday analogies for explaining basic stock market concepts. The priciness of P/E ratios is compared to women's shoes at different price levels, for example. So, if you know nothing about stocks, this book is actually a better source of explanations through analogies than any other book about investing I have ever read.

Content-wise it told me all about Jerry to the nth degree. In a trite, trivial voice! Oh, it could have been a contender. It could have been wonderful because the follow-a-manager-for-a-year angle is cool. But the problem is Ms. Baker doesn't know how to tell an exciting story, a story with moments and dialogue and emotion. Instead, she transcribes facts! The pacing is turtle-slow, and the writer tries far too hard to be clever by saying things with icky cliches and similies. I wanted to take a pen and edit. I'm sorry to sound harsh that's not my intention because I really think it's not all the author's fault. The editors were asleep. Needs more white space and more pronouns instead of &quot;Jerry this&quot; and &quot;Jerry that.&quot; Nothing fresh, not even a bit twisted. Sigh.

This book has all the elements for a truly fun read but as previous reviewers have stated is simply lacking in the execution. As a market watcher for 15 years I assumed that following a fund manager around during one of the most fascinating years in market history would translate well. But the book gives virtually no information about how industry professionals viewed these events, or even a nugget or two of new information or perception. Instead we hear streams of one-sided phone conversations and crib notes of market banter that are unintelligible even if you fully understand the jargon. If you are looking for an entertaining book about the stock market, look elsewhere. If you are considering a career in money management and want to understand the day to day drudgery, this may be useful."},{"Title":"High-Flying Adventures in the Stock Market","review":"The idea for this book is intriguing: follow a mutual fund manager around every day for a year and see what he does. The book takes place during one of the most volatile and hair-raising periods in recent stock market history (1998).Unfortunately, the author of this book seems to have turned on her tape recorder and left the room for the year, returning only to transcribe her notes. The events in the text unfold utterly bereft of any real context. There is little sense of time or place and often no understanding of why decisions are made. Astonishingly, during a period known as the &quot;Asian meltdown&quot; the word &quot;Asian&quot; is mentioned only in connection with a restaurant! The writing is wooden and full of hollow metaphors. There's no research, no insight, and no reason to read this book.What the book does accomplish (and this is by no means intentional) is to portray how generally useless fund managers are since 80% of the time they can't beat the market indexes. The book thus makes a great case to invent in index funds, such as those offered by Vanguard, which simply buy the whole index and don't bother churning stocks, spending money on reports, and paying people like the ones described in this turgid, lifeless book."},{"Title":"High-Flying Adventures in the Stock Market","review":"...I have to admit that I was quite disappointed.

If yourbackground is not in finance or if you have no clue as to what Portfolio Managers do, you will find this book somewhat interesting, but if you are like me, and you know a little bit about the stock market, you'll be truly disappointed. The story doesn't have a high, it doesn't get to a climax whatsoever. The story goes on to describe the daily life of an unknown Portfolio Manager. And it does just that. Each chapter starts with &quot;It's monday.....&quot;. As for style is concerned, I'm just coming off reading &quot;The Tortilla Curtain&quot; from Tom Boyle and let me tell you, Molly Baker is no match.

Close to the end of the work he makes this observation \\"..tragedy is that form of art which requires the intolerable burden of God's presence. It is now dead because His shadow no longer falls upon us as it fell on Agamemnon or Macbeth or Athalie. \\" Steiner then goes on to talk briefly about the possibility of renewal of tragedy under different circumstances.This work is a stellar piece of literary criticism- whether one takes issue with Steiner and believes Job on the one hand , and Willy Loman in another way , are tragic characters after all."},{"Title":"Death of Tragedy","review":"If you have ever sat down with quill pen to attempt a blank verse tragedy, only to tear up your notes, this is the book for you. Tragedy as a genre remains the rara avis in the history of art, and its brief appearances seem to accompany periods of history going into high gear. Its reappearance in the early modern, followed by its steady decline in modernist amnesia, is a challenge to our basic conceptions of the technological quick fix, and the presumption our potential is open to our rational powers. Steiner reviews the enigma of this history, on and off, and focusses on the 'death' of the genre in more recent modern times, cataloguing the consistent string of failures even in many of the best later poets, from Dryden to Keats. Some might disagree with the verdict, yet one must confront the facts, which cannot, however, condemn us to the final demise of this artform, since its very history shows its sudden and unexpected rebirth. Yet the whole question is bound in some primordial evolution of language and its poetics, as these seem better tilled soil at the beginning than over the course of subsequent development, witness the richness of the first source, Homer's Iliad, the master chord from which the tragical melody sounds its echoes."},{"Title":"Death of Tragedy","review":"The tragedy has lost its real dimension in the modern times .

Never letting down his guard and sticking by his own way of doing things, Peterson's pivotal point to leave the company came in the midst of too much control for one person to handle. Peterson though was able to handle the decisions for many years to his credit and definately seemed the driving force in providing overall profitability in the company."},{"Title":"AlmostPerfect: How a Bunch of Regular Guys Built WordPerfect Corporation","review":"As a long-time WordPerfect user I wanted the opportunity to learn about the history behind one of my favourite computer programs. Perhaps this is more necessary for me than for many in the U.S. because I'm from Australia, which is a little far away from where some of the early action took place.From that perspective, it's very interesting to read about the evolution of the product through various versions. Of course, the Wikipedia article on WordPerfect has more-or-less the same information, but nothing compares to Peterson's dramatic telling of the to-ing and fro-ing between departments to actually achieve this end.Unfortunately, this book is no longer in print form. A full text can, however, be found online.The politics between Alan, Bruce and Pete towards the end, when Pete is forced out of the company, is of interest, but as always there are many sides to the story. The highlight of this book for me was seeing WordPerfect grow."},{"Title":"AlmostPerfect: How a Bunch of Regular Guys Built WordPerfect Corporation","review":"W. E. Peterson joined Word Perfect in 1980 as a part-time office manager, and left as Executive VP of Sales in 1992. He says their success was based partly on luck: the right circumstances at the right time. They depended on their own efforts and finances, not on burning up borrowed money; did this concentrate their efforts on success?He says &quot;reliability was more important than price&quot; (p.41). A word processor is a means to an end, not an end in itself. A $1500 product can be less costly than a $500 product that breaks down more, once you include the effect of losses.Page 60 says the demise of word processing departments in the mid 1980s was unexpected. This happened to key-punch departments a decade earlier. Will Internet E-mail reduce the market for word processors in turn?The problem of printer support in WP was solved by the use of tables; but this resulted in slower printing. Isn't it better to use separate executable modules for each printer family?One very important item of their success was their evaluation of their product by consulting with the secretaries who used it. This is much better than an ad-hoc committee of non-users.His evaluation of other companies (p.100) is interesting. Using a &quot;lines of code&quot; rule alone may result in bloated and redundant code, which can lead to higher maintenance, overhead, and support costs.His story of the &quot;free Hawaii trip&quot; (pp.131-2) illustrates the difference between &quot;goals&quot; and &quot;objectives&quot;. A fixed cash bonus is a goal, a Hawaii trip an objective.In July 1991 Pete was informed that he &quot;was too hard on people and too many people were afraid&quot; of him. He seems to have ignored this warning. The stress of the delayed release may have been affecting a lot of people. If the VP of Development was giving lectures from a book, could this have caused the delay? Does this show a problem in a &quot;flat management&quot; philosophy? Is it correct for any large company? Can reading a book safeguard a company from Microsoft? Note that this clash of personalities did not occur when WP was profitable. &quot;Victory has a thousand fathers&quot;, falling sales has a thousand finger pointers."},{"Title":"Broadway Bound...a Play","review":"With 1986's BROADWAY BOUND, Neil Simon brought to completion the semi-autobiographical trilogy he began with BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS (1983) and continued with BILOXI BLUES (1985). For those coming to BROADWAY BOUND never having read or seen the two preceding plays, a bit of context is needed. Eugene Morris Jerome is Simon's alter ego in all three plays, while Stanley Jerome, Eugene's older brother, is Simon's older brother, the TV writer Danny Simon (who died in July 2005). Eugene is the protagonist/narrator of all three plays. BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS shows him struggling to find his identity among his large family in Brooklyn, New York. BILOXI BLUES depicts his first break with the family as he joins the Army. And BROADWAY BOUND, set in 1949, dramatizes a pivotal period in his life, made up of his efforts to launch, with Stanley, a comedy writing career - a career which would enable both him and Stanley to leave home permanently. As the decision to leave home is a major theme in BROADWAY BOUND, this comedy is arguably sadder in its tone than the two which precede it, or than nearly any other work by the playwright whose name has, in recent decades, become virtually synonymous with the term \\"Broadway comedy.\\"In terms of the Jerome trilogy, BROADWAY BOUND is a fitting culmination. It is an unusually complex comedy, alternating humor and gravity, and scenes involving three generations of family members: the elderly (Grandfather Ben), the middle-aged (Kate and Jack Jerome; Kate's sister Blanche), and the young (the sons, Stanley and Eugene). During the lengthy two acts, each character is \\"spotlighted\\" in turn: for example, Eugene in his monologues addressed to the audience and Kate in her long scene with Eugene in which she tells the story of how she once danced with movie star George Raft.In terms of Simon's output up to 1986, BROADWAY BOUND is a culmination in that it includes elements of his previous comedies. Examples: Eugene and Stanley are, like Al and Willie in THE SUNSHINE BOYS, a show-business team whose real-life interaction is funnier than the material they produce (the brothers actually come to base their comedy sketches on their lives); like Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, they are an \\"odd couple.\\" BROADWAY BOUND can even be viewed as a tribute to American drama before 1986, since Simon's habit of emulating classic American plays is present in BROADWAY BOUND, which alludes unmistakably to both Clifford Odets' AWAKE AND SING! and Arthur Miller's DEATH OF A SALESMAN. Finally, BROADWAY BOUND was the play that changed many critics' opinions of Neil Simon, whom they had previously thought a superficial playwright; the play has even been called the finest of the 1980's. BROADWAY BOUND, then, is in several ways an important play, one which must be read and seen by anyone who loves American theatre."},{"Title":"Broadway Bound...a Play","review":"I experienced this play long before I experienced the other two plays in the trilogy, and I was never lost or confused.

Eugene was much more level headed - not the sex-crazed teenage boy we knew and loved. Blanche lost her quirkiness, and the outcome of Jack and Kate disappointed me.

London: Oxford University Press, 1981.&#8232;- I had the pleasure of conducting the world premiere of Jacob's Concerto for Double Bass, aka Little Concerto for Double Bass and Strings (composed 1972), with soloist Robert Meyer, for whom it was written for and dedicated to, with my orchestra in Sidney, British Columbia, on April 14, 2000. The concerto, written many years before in 1972, is a fine piece of music. It displays Jacob's tremendous skill as an orchestrator and his first rate idiomatic instrumental writing. That orchestral knowledge shines through in this short book - 104 pages, written in 1931 - which can serve as an introduction to the art of orchestration. And though it is brief, the book contains many especially pleasing concepts which any student of orchestration can use. Particularly charming is his description of the percussion section, \\"The best way of avoiding temptation (of using the rest of the kitchen, i.e., instruments of indefinite pitch) is to make a habit, unless writing for an abnormally large orchestra, of employing only two percussion players, one for the kettledrums exclusively, and the other for the rest of the percussion. This practice has the merit of cutting down expense as well as checking one's primitive barbaric instincts.\\"Stephen Brown, Music Theory Book Reviews. stephenbrown.ca"},{"Title":"Orchestral technique,: A manual for students","review":"This is an older book, but has...........get this: it actually has helpful examples of orchestration!This is rare for books on orchestration these days.

On the other hand, the closest equivalent, entry no 137 'Attic glaze' mentions Noble J.V. 1990 which is altogether missing in bibliography. In any case, Noble 1990 is a wrong reference (I could mention instead, Noble J.V. 1960, 1965 and 1987.A second example is entry 294 on 'cobalt blue', where the text does not even mention its importance in Egyptian antiquity. Furthermore there is no bibliography for a synthetic pigment which, along with 'Egyptian Blue' is considered one of the most innovative developments in ancient technology.

I find it fulfils its stated purpose (\\"to provide a compact source of reference for those interested in archaeology..... as well as for natural scientists....\\") admirably. The 1374 entries provide an excellent jumping-off point into the vast (and hitherto largely uncharted) area, embracing dozens of disciplines, in which archaeology and the physical sciences coexist and cooperate. Of course, the book isn't comprehensive; it isn't meant to be. It is not an encyclopaedia. I find Goffer's selection, on the whole, well-balanced, and the entries generally clear and concise, though occasionally a trifle idiosyncratic (624 indigo and 740 madder each get more than half a page --- almost three times the average!). There are errors in the cross-referencing (try 932 pearlite) --- hardly surprising, when one considers the complexity of the task --- and occasionally also in the bibliographical references (which take up fully fifty pages --- more than a thousand references in all). Nit-pickers can have a ball with this book --- but they will be missing the point. Whatever its faults, there is no other book like it. Goffer is to be commended for his courage in undertaking such a pioneering work. It is to be hoped that others will follow its lead, and perhaps eventually surpass it; until that day comes, this book should have a place on the shelves of every archaeological library.The price is a little daunting; perhaps the publishers might consider eventually putting out a paperback, more affordable for the private purchaser."},{"Title":"Genetics and the Origin of Species","review":"Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-1975) was a famous geneticist and evolutionary biologist.

I currently attend Harvey Mudd College, a small, but highly regarded science and engineering school, so I like to think that I know something about the subject.For example, at one point the authors are describing solitons (a term I had never heard before), states a theory that by generating an extra bit of energy we could put the universe out of the unstable equilibrium it currently exists in and cause it to &quot;begin to boil.&quot; While this is all well and good, it makes vast assumptions that the authors neglect to mention. Most importantly it assumes that the universe is in an unstable equilibrium, a fact which although highly unlikely is not impossible. Secondly it assumes that the universe is completely clean of these bits of extra energy currently. They draw this parallel to an example of superheating water because without external particles to build upon no bubbles can form to release the steam. This is also true, but it is still impossible because it is impossible to have a perfect system like this. There are always going to be minute cracks in the pot, or imperfections in the water (fractal theory, covered earlier in the book, even states this!), and so while this might be theoretically possible it will not happen in any real world environment. The book has many other places like this where the authors conveniently leave out details that might weaken their arguments. I find this to make the book as a whole very frustrating to read, even if some of their points are valid.Another reason that I find the book to be very frustrating is that everything is very sensationalized. At the beginning of the description of fractals the authors say that the first person to think of a fractal curve created &quot;a panic among mathematicians that took some fifty years to resolve.&quot; I find it truly hard to believe that the entire mathematical community was pulling their collective hair for fifty years trying to explain this curve, but by phrasing it this way the authors make it seem like science as a whole does not want to accept new ideas because it would make them look bad. In reality though I think the scientific community is ready to accept anything that can be strongly proven theoretically, or experimentally (just look at relativity, or quantum).Because of all of these failings I would not recommend this book. I am sure that there are many other better books about chaos theory that do an excellent job of describing it without disregarding the rest of science, or trying to place it in places where it does not necessarily belong."},{"Title":"Turbulent Mirror, An Illustrated Guide To Chaos Theory And The Science Of Wholeness [1971]","review":"Very well thought out survey of chaos theory presents a metaphorical mirror as a means to magnify and project into view the hidden world of turbulence. The advent of the computer has brought chaos and fractals out of the closet. Here the authors teach the reader how to navigate in the turbulent world from the submicroscopic realms to the distant galaxies. The authors dish up a huge concept list: fractal dimensions, strange attractors, holograms, soliton bubbles, bifurcation, quantum phase locking, coevolution of species and the earth as Gaia -- all in an attempt to teach the reader the folly of allowing the part/whole dichotomy to rule your perception of the universe.The book is a stark attack on those the authors term reductionists -- those who seek answers in breaking the whole into ever smaller parts. The authors' pet writers are David Bohm, Lynn Margulis, and Llya Prigogine but they toss in another hundred ideas for irregular stepping stones to get where they are going. Where is that? They composed an evangelical message -- that man now has the tools and knowledge to step through Alice's Looking Glass into an entirely new and mystical perception of the whole. They see chaos as a source of future evolution and life.I give the authors a high mark for original thought. Although using a hundred other science writers to frame their ideas, they direct the reader to go beyond existing theories and strike a path for the center of the turbulent mirror. The diagrams and illustrations also were very helpful. They pictured the brain as a strange attractor, with thought arbitrating between the two realms of order and chaos. My favorite metaphor was the slime mold which, when food gets scarce, merges from being a collection of individual cells to a collective entity moving across the forest floor. This was to show an example of quantum phase locking which \\"could provide a bridge joining classical, nonlinear reality with linear, quantum reality\\" (P. 188).

Using a historical approach, the book walks the reader through the discoveries and mathematics that underlie fractals, chaos and complexity. It also provides a short, fascinating interview with Ilya Prigogine and a great layperson's introduction to his ideas. Turbulent Mirror makes the point that because of &quot;sensitive dependence on initial conditions&quot; one can not really separate the whole from the parts - in essence there really are no &quot;initial conditions.&quot; The only weakness of this book, IMHO, is the use of occasional Alice and Wonderland illustrations and a few too many quotes from eastern philosophy.

What I find most debatable is the responsibility of reductionism in creating the problems for nature and humanity, or detouring the course of science. I certainly believe that the scientists and thinkers before us forged the foundation for us, and from their experience, we discover the verity of past knowledge. I don't think Darwin would appreciate we calling him a reductionist because at that time, reductionism was the way of science, not to mention that 'reductionism' is a modern classification. The book also details a lot of examples to explain that most phenomenons are the results of nonlinear chaos complexity.

That's why I find this book is good to serve my purpose. It explained clearly on fractals, the relationship between chaos and order, and non-linearness.I knew E. Peters has using fratals / Elloit Wave Theory to analyze financial market. Of course, it needs more intra-day data to try to find such fratals in a small scale period, e.g. in a 5-minute charts. But I guess that, such fractal are existing in the market, if you watching index movement everyday.On another aspest, the technique of plotting data in a phase space is a tool to get the picture of financial market to me. This tools can be compared with weighted moving average, MACD, or other technical indicators. Though, phase space analysis is quite uneasy to a man without advanced mathematics. I'm quite sure such mathematical technique may apply to financial trading.Besides, the idea of &quot;quasi-periodic&quot; is likely describing financial market.

First of all, it is decidedly hardboiled, in that there's plenty of cringe inducing cruelty, unpunished violence and nonstop tough guy talk. The narrative contains a great deal of detailed description yet at the same time much is left to the reader's imagination.James Quinn is a mobbed up lawyer from New York who literally finds himself deposited in the cutthroat town of Okar in a North African coastal country, probably Libya. He is without passport and he is without money. The only thing he posesses is a finely honed knowledge of how the criminal world functions. So he does the only thing he can do and that's to move in on Okar's ubiquitous smuggling trade.He also meets a beautiful woman, a jaded, world weary American expatriate named Beatrice. Beatrice quickly falls madly in love with Quinn, though the reader will be at a loss to understand why.The Box contains a number of passages that individually make for compelling reading. But taken as a whole, the overall narrative flow is neither smooth nor logic driven. One gets the impression that this story is an allegorical one and that Peter Rabe intended it to convey a far deeper meaning. Perhaps something about the immigrant experience. I'm sorry to say that any such deeper meaning was woefully lost on me.Would I recommend this unusual novel to others? You know, I'm not really sure."},{"Title":"The Box","review":"I read this book a couple of months ago, I think I bought it based on Ed Gorman's recommendation in \\"The Big Book of Noir\\" in which he describes Peter Rabe as \\"probably the most original of the GM (Gold Medal) writers\\" if not necessarily the best. Gorman suggests \\"The Box\\"(published in 1962) along with \\"Kill The Boss Good-by\\" and \\"Anatomy of a Killer\\" as mandatory Rabe reads. Anyway \\"The Box\\" is a somewhat quirky, reasonably entertaining story about a guy whose punishment for losing out on a gangland feud in NYC is to get shipped halfway across the world, trapped in a box on a freighter.The story is about his slow resurection once he gets out of the box in the North African coastal town of Okar-which is where most of the story takes place. The book is short-only 160 pages-and moves along nicely.I almost feel like I need to read it again at some point because the first time around it didn't leave that strong of an impression on me.

Many are overpriced, a large number are worthless (\`How to Manage Like Jack the Ripper'), and a minority are actually very good. This book published in 2002 is one of that minority.Russell Linden has chosen to specialize in the study of collaboration and collaborative processes. Over the course of over twenty years of analysis and application he has developed some very sound ideas on what makes collaborative efforts work and what causes them to fail. One dose not have to read very far into this book to see that effective collaboration in an age of globalization is absolutely essential for business successes. It also becomes clear that collaboration is the cornerstone of knowledge based enterprises, which includes most government agencies.Linden has developed a collaborative model composed of four elements: 1) the basic requirements for collaboration to work (shared goals etc.): 2) the necessity for building effective relationships; 3) the establishments of mutually recognized \`high stakes' (i.e. recognition that collaboration will produce significant benefits); and 3) building a constituency for collaboration (people committed to making collaboration real). In the course of discussing his model, Linden, provides important insights on the important role of champions and the concept of institutional culture. He also illustrates his discussion with well chosen case studies to drive home the functionality of his model. Linden also provides good information on he often lost art ofinternal collaboration as well.This book is particularly relevant to the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) where barriers of secrecy, a culture of insularity, and a belief that information is power has long prevented real inter-agency collaboration and worse has encouraged building barriers against collaboration even within single agencies.

But being effective these days means working in teams, often across the old hierarchical reporting structures of agencies, divisions and units.Linden's book uses a variety of case studies to explore how collaboration can work, and what the pitfalls can be. He defines collaboration initially as what &quot;occurs when people from different organizations (or units within one organization) produce something together through joint effort, resources, and decision making, and share ownership of the final product or service.&quot; His examples range from land management to criminal justice to education to intelligence--all areas where multiple agencies or organizations had to collaborate in a high stakes environment.High stakes is one of the four keys for Linden. There must be something important enough to motivate the collaboration. The other keys are strong relationships among the collaborators, the existence of a constituency for collaboration, and what he calls &quot;the basics&quot; -- openness, skillful facilitating, etc.What makes it all work is collaborative leadership--individuals who can pull others along with them into a productive team effort. One chapter discusses the qualities of effective collaborative leaders, who must subordinate their own egos to ensure that all participants have a real stake.If &quot;Working Across Boundaries&quot; has a fault, it is that he has many good ideas and observations that don't fit neatly into the four-element structure, but that he doesn't want to leave out. Every chapter includes some of these &quot;extras&quot; and many of them are grouped in a separate chapter, &quot;More Keys to Successful Collaboration&quot; (including such things as measuring results, using each party's strengths, etc.). Since it is almost all good advice and worthwhile reading, this is really only a minor structural complaint.Also useful are the resource materials at the end of the book, including a sample agenda, a collaboration &quot;contract&quot; and some assessment materials. These are good templates for anyone starting a new collaborative effort.In describing the qualities of successful collaboration, Linden is also aware of the structural and personal challenges that collaborations often face. Budgets, for example, are usually built in line items to specific organizations; in fact, organizations are largely defined by their budgets. So sharing resources across organizations requires trust and mutual commitment. Accountability, too, both at the level of the individual employee and at the organizational level, is especially challenging when the outcome is the result of a cross-agency collaboration. On the other hand, when collaboration produces better results, as it often does, participants can all share in the glory."},{"Title":"Working Across Boundaries: Making Collaboration Work in Government and Nonprofit Organizations (Jossey-Bass Nonprofit and Public Management Series)","review":"What do James Madison, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Peter Drucker, the Book of Exodus, Robert Frost, Vince Lombardi, T.S. Eliot, Dr. Spock and Albert Einstein all have in common? They are all quoted in Russ Linden's new book, &quot;Working Across Boundaries: Making Collaboration Work in Government and Non-Profit Organizations.&quot; Linden ties them all together in an entertaining and instructive manual for managing in today's work environment.Linden's book is for practitioners, a group that includes me, since I have been practicing at this profession for almost 30 years. He holds true to the purpose he has set for the book, which is to help practitioners address the hurdles to collaboration and adopt strategies that lead to succesful collaboration, in order to achieve better outcomes for their customers and communities.What I like best about the book is the use of stories to instruct and inform. Stories are the core tool in relationship building....I know that my bosses, often rely heavily on the stories told them by their constituents to make critical policy decisions....Linden's stories about the collaborative work of the Baltimore Child Advocacy Center; the National Marine Fisheries Service; the City of Charlotte, North Carolina, and others provide practical examples of how his models work in the real world.He not only suggests numerous techniques for establishing practical, collaborative efforts. He also adds a series of four &quot;resource&quot; chapters at the end of the book with illustrations of how these techniques have been applied, the most-asked questions about collaboration together with their answers, an assessment tool, and a summary of the situations in numerous organizations that have served as the basis for his conclusions and models.I especially liked Chapter 6 on &quot;Forming Open, Trusting Relationships Among the Principals.&quot; It gave me some helpful hints on working with my council.Linden's book is a must-read for anyone trying to overcome the obstacles he says were created by James Madison and his buddies , who &quot;consciously designed an inefficient government to keep men free.&quot; This &quot;built-in&quot; inefficiency and fragmentation cries out for the cure of collaboration."},{"Title":"Working Across Boundaries: Making Collaboration Work in Government and Nonprofit Organizations (Jossey-Bass Nonprofit and Public Management Series)","review":"Todays managers must use numerous skills and resources in order to be effective and successful. And although there are numerous tools and techniques available to assist managers in their daily jobs, sometimes the best solution is simply working together. Or in other words, collaborating. This is what Russ Linden's new book, &quot;Working Across Boundaries: Making Collaboration Work inGovernment and Non-Profit Organizations&quot; ultimately encourages and demonstrates. Russ Linden has provided numerous case studies throughout the book to assist the reader with relating to particular issues confronting organizations. He also provides a wealth of resources including sample agendas, contracts, assessment tools and programs used by a variety of agencies and individuals.The author has taken on the challenge of documenting the benefits, techniques, and tools needed to successfully implement collaboration in the workplace and with outside organizations. I highly recommend &quot;Working Across Boundaries&quot; to all government managers.

His background in management, finance, and time-management gives him the mature credibility that we all need for such important life-decisions. Here is a man who is a financial-businessman first and an author second unlike so many others today.I have a feeling that this book will not become a huge best-seller because of its somewhat understated manner. But that should not take away from its incredible long-term value and excellent writing.I think this is a 6 star book in a field where best-sellers are really 3 star books. Buy this for yourself and anyone else you really care about. (Especially those who have plenty of money and little time to enjoy it.)This book is a true financial treasure!"},{"Title":"The Millionaire in You: Ten Things You Need to Do Now to Have Money and Time to Enjoy It","review":"If there is one book that is worth its weight in gold -- literally -- it's this book.I have read many, many personal finance books, and this one is the most straightforward, concise guide to achieving financial success that I have ever read. Its advice has been instrumental in helping me to grow to a net worth exceeding $1 million.And LeBoeuf's Law is worth remembering: Invest your time actively and your money passively -- that is, put your money in index funds, and then work hard at finding what you want to do and making money while doing it. I am surprised that one reviewer here at amazon thought that LeBoeuf's Law was worth belittling. It is not.Read, apply the advice, be patient and persistent, and become a millionaire."},{"Title":"The Millionaire in You: Ten Things You Need to Do Now to Have Money and Time to Enjoy It","review":"This book is concise, straight forward, easy to understand and fun to read. It includes the very basics of becoming rich as well as a lot of very good real life examples. Also, it looks at wealth not only in terms of money but also in terms of quality of life.Not only does common sense confirm the efficiency of the lessons taught but also it is reflected in the author's own life success. Some of the basic principles of success have been brought to the point in such a great way, that some of the well known self-help gurus use them in their programs quite often, I think.This books was very much worth the [money] and my time to read it.

Michael LeBoeuf is a great author and knows how to get to the point. The dedication and pride that went into this book is tremendous and it clearly beams whenever you read a passage from any part of the book. Always following LeBoeuf's Law: \\"Invest your time actively and your assets passively.\\" I advise everyone to do themselves a favor and buy this wonderful masterpiece. It's truly made me a better person."},{"Title":"The Millionaire in You: Ten Things You Need to Do Now to Have Money and Time to Enjoy It","review":"Thanks to my father, I am a second generation follower of Dr. LeBoeuf's time management and financial advice. My father purchased a copy of his first book \\"Working Smart\\" back in the late 1970's when LeBoeuf was still a business professor at the University of New Orleans. So you could say that in a way I have \\"grown up\\" with Michael over the years.How am I doing? Not bad. Not bad at all. Considering how far I have had to climb to get where I am now, that's saying something.As somebody who has had a relationship with this man for over twenty-five years, please allow me to tell it to you straight. Forget Kiyosaki and 90% of the other financial education gurus out there; LeBoeuf is the real deal. He gives it to you straight, no B.S. Even more important, LeBoeuf actually IS an educator and retired college professor, not some phony \\"advice\\" marketer (like Kiyosaki) with a shady past, mystery portfolio, and unverifiable credentials. This stuff isn't rocket science and learning about it should not cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars.Although this book has \\"millionaire\\" in the title, when you look beneath the surface the book is really about financial independence and what that means. He asks you to ask yourself some basic questions. He then asks you to hold yourself accountable. And then he gives you some sound financial advice. One of the many strengths of this book is that it does NOT oversell the \\"millionaire\\" thing; a million ain't what it used to be, and you can lose it very quickly if you overindulge yourself or start to act like you're something you're not. Once you get to a million, index investing should keep you there and produce about $50,000 in after-tax income annually. If you thought that you were a \\"high roller\\" once you hit the seven figure mark, think again. To live and act like the Jay-Z's and Tiger Woods of the world, you'll need more than a million--a lot more.Bottom line: this is financial advice for the people. Written in down-to-earth language that almost everybody can understand, and written in that folksy \\"you can do this\\" tone that is the hallmark of good advice writing, this book is a gem. I buy copies and give them out like hot dogs at a ballgame. Most importantly, I have followed this man's advice for over twenty five of my forty one years, and continue to do so with my own children."},{"Title":"The Millionaire in You: Ten Things You Need to Do Now to Have Money and Time to Enjoy It","review":"This to the most practical, straight forward book, no \\"BS\\" book I've ever read on accumulating wealth.

High deductibles lower the premium, and I only want to insure against major, not minor losses. Many insurance companies are now exempting homeowner's coverages that used to be covered in the policy. LeBoeuf advocates having earthquake and flood insurance......even if you live in a low risk area......because the premium is cheap if you live in a low risk area.....and you really do want insurance against a major loss. Its time to blow off the dust from my homeowner's policy and find out what I am really insured against.LeBoeuf also recommends an umbrella insurance policy of $1M more than your net worth. I have never really seen a rule-of-thumb published on umbrella policies before. I have had an umbrella policy for many years......but have struggled with how big of policy to have.All-in-all, a great basic investment book...full of useful and practical recommendations.The Richest Man in BabylonBogle on Mutual Funds: New Perspectives for the Intelligent InvestorThe Millionaire Next DoorThe Four Pillars of Investing: Lessons for Building a Winning PortfolioA Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing, Ninth EditionThe Coffeehouse Investor: How to Build Wealth, Ignore Wall Street, and Get On With Your LifeThe Bogleheads' Guide to Investing"},{"Title":"The Millionaire in You: Ten Things You Need to Do Now to Have Money and Time to Enjoy It","review":"Only a pompous windbag would name a \\"law\\" about investing after himself.

It should have tied Electricity and Magnetism together, but just leaves the reader confused. The rest of the text makes everything more complicated than it actually is; Tipler won't give the concepts of the reader, the reader has to discover them on her own. The examples are not a sufficient level for the problems in the book. This book is NOT FOR SELF-STUDY.Value of Book and a Better Text: the value of this book is minimal. For the price that is being asked (for just a single-volume paperback) is absurd. In place of Tipler's book, I would refer anyone to \\"Physics for Scientists and Engineers\\" by Serway; this book is sufficient for self-study, which is a quality you really need in a physics text. This book offers the material of 3 volumes of Tipler's books (the 3rd volume of Tipler's series is modern physics) at half the price. One of my friends has actually completely turned over to Serway, despite that her assigned text is Tipler (she doesn't even open her Tipler text anymore), and is now doing better in her class."},{"Title":"Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Vol. 2: Electricity and Magnetism, Light (Physics, for Scientists & Engineers, Chapters 22-35)","review":"The Tiper physics textbook, while excellent for an engineering student, lacks much of the theoretical rigor desireable in a physics curriculum. A great many of the problems at the end of the chapter prove to be remarkably simple, and boil down to hunting through the book for the right constants and the right equation to plug into to find the answer. Actual problem solving skills are not developed for a physicist. The chapters on circuits, while excellent for electrical engineering majors, are almost a waste of time for a physics major. Even though the textbook is very thorough with what it teaches, it does not teach at a very high level nor does it prepare physics majors for more difficult future classes. Having used the Kleppner and Kolenkow Introduction to Mechanics textbook for Intro. to Classical Mechanics, shifting gears to something as trivial in difficulty as the Tippler for Electrostatics just leads to frustration over spending more time finding the right constant than actually solving the problem."},{"Title":"Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Vol. 2: Electricity and Magnetism, Light (Physics, for Scientists & Engineers, Chapters 22-35)","review":"Any physics textbook would be a good one in the hands of great teachers. However, without a teacher, Tipler's physics probably will not be the good choice. His way of thinking physics has a very unique personal characteristic: simple sentence contains deep meanings but does not have clue to follow. Yes, it is an introductory text, but an introductory text should, I think, explains concepts in a way that is easy for others to read and understand. It should not confuse the naive physics majors but to help them make the basic ideas more clear and familiar. In an advanced point of view, his texts are excellent because the ideas require a considerable amount of thinking. It might have been a great intro. physics series if the sentenses are more concise and &quot;elementary&quot;!"},{"Title":"Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Vol. 2: Electricity and Magnetism, Light (Physics, for Scientists & Engineers, Chapters 22-35)","review":"I use both H&amp;R and Tipler side by side. Tipler's explanations can be very valuable in H&amp;R's shorter moments but H&amp;R has the upper hand in Light and Magnetism.

Volume 2 focuses on Electricity, Magnetism, and Light. The text is clear, the problems are great. The biggest advantage to this text is its format. It has great pictures and amazing examples. Here is what makes Tipler's text in my mind better than Serway or H&amp;R. There are numberous examples reflecting the problems set on the end of the chapter. many of these examples also are &quot;try it yourself&quot; examples, which has suggestions on one column, and the equations on one. Every example Tipler spells out the concept in words and puts the equation next to it. This builds on problem solving techniques, the hardest part of beginning and learning the introductory physics discipline. Other things worthy of note for TIpler is his subtle references to Modern Physics, indicating more is on the way in terms of the way we understand the universe. Overall, Tipler is fantastic. I highly reccomend his textbooks, He even has a Modern Physics text is the best in its class like his classical physics text.

Having glanced over some explanations, i feel tipler does explain the concepts well with very good pictures that illustrate the ideas. My favorite are the worked out problems in the sections, because i found they helped me familiarize myself with the type of math involved and generally just what to do.

It amazed me that women in such high financial positions were only described by what they were wearing. There was no mention of any kind of financial portfolio whatsoever. Our book club made the mistake of picking this for our book of the month and the overwhelming consensus was that we were embarrassed for the authors. It was a waste. It was such a good story line, but there was very little revenge. Where was the revenge on Parker, the cheating boyfriend? He should have gotten crabs or some other disease. Or the revenge on his jerky friends that thought that Dakota was the maid. Or the revenge on the company that overlooked Morgan for the promotion? They could have come with a story line that her catering company catered a party for them in which she made more in a night that she did all year and then the company's department that she was passed over the promotion for eventually failed. There could have been so many revenge lines, but there weren't. The only upside is that for a person that reads nothing, this would be a good first book."},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"Probably like many others before me, when I purchased this book I was impressed with the catchy title and the cover summary. The summary states that both Morgan and Dakota would partner up with Blake, when in actuality it was only Morgan. That slip up doesn't even matter because this book was not about revenge but a who's who in the fashion world. You can read Vogue and get a better story than this. The plot was weak and unbelievable. How could these two characters with corporate positions in New York fall for a hustler like Blake. What kind of business would you open with someone who always snuck to the bathroom when it was time to pay the restaurant bill? I can't believe these supposedly intelligent characters would fall for this scam and for these two authors to try and make readers believe it is just wrong. The authors had so much room for character and plot development but wasted it on telling us exactly what shoes were being worn. The revenge took place in two chapters at the end of the book. This book had the nerve to serve up an epilogue with a twist. I had to laugh because it was so ridiculous. If it took two authors to write this, I would hate to see what one would come up with on her own. Bottom line--save your money and borrow this book from a friend or the library."},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"I did not like this book. The story is pointless until the last two chapters. The characters are silly and superficial. The love scenes were very mechanical and I didn't \\"feel\\" the love between Morgan and Miles or Dakota and Parker. I thought I was reading a really long fashion magazine. Prada, Gucci, Dolce. Give me a break. I did not care for the characters at all. I love to read because I like to develop a \\"relationship\\" with the characters. I really didn't feel sorry for Dakota after she discovered her fiance cheating. I didn't feel for Morgan when she lost her job and discovered Blake's ruse. Come on! The man was supicious from the get go and these \\"intelligent\\" women could not see that? I don't believe someone would listen to Blake's lies and continue to be his partner. What really got me was when Morgan found out Blake stole her credit card and she only tells him that he better pay the money that he owes her. Any normal person would have had his behind in jail. Finally she does something about it in Chapter 46 (there are 47 chapters)! I bought this book as part of a set. I'm reading Talk of the Town (I always give new authors a second chance). All in all Revenge will not remain in my collection. I'm on the second chapter in Talk and it looks like this is going back too. Danita and Tracy, focus on character development rather than what designer label they are wearing."},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"I was truly disappointed to have spent [$$$] of my hard-earned money on this book. I am a well read, highly educated attorney, and I have NEVER read such a one-dimensional book in my life - and I have been an avid reader since I can remember. The storyline has potential, but the authors seem hell-bent on portraying these young, African-American \\"professional women\\" as shallow, materialistic, status-worshipping, and just plain \\"silly.\\" The actions of these women seem completely out of character for the intelligent people the authors would have you believe they are. What a shame. Save your money. According to the authors, you're probably one of the \\"have nots\\" and can't afford the [$$$]price anyway...and that's if you purchase the paperback - which Dakota and Morgan would NEVER do, I'm sure!"},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"It's hard for me to believe that 2 minds would come up with such a shallow book. Dakota's &amp; Parker's relationship had no real purpose in the book. I really saw no purpose for Nana &amp; Tricia. Blake/Tyrone story was confusing to read. The plot was very weak and they missed on the twist. There was too much name dropping, referring to the designer names meant nothing to me. This was one of the hardest books for me to read."},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"I've never submitted a review to Amazon before but I just read \\"Revenge Is Best Served Cold\\" and loved it so much that I thought others should know!\\"Revenge\\" was a highly entertaining book with not one but two compelling main characters (Morgan and Dakota) and a cunning foe (Blake St. James) whose sole mission is to charm and disarm---while he's quietly plotting their demise .In the process,he turns their lives upside down but not before they exact their 'revenge'. I won't give away the plot but trust me,they've got to use all of their feminine wiles to put Mr St. James in check.If you're running the rat race (like me!) there are plenty of references to the good life that Morgan and Dakota have worked so hard to achieve--fancy restaurants,fly cars and the finest of clothes---and I'm not mad at them! I would expect no less from two successful professional women running the fast track in New York City circa 2000.If you're the romantic type, (like my wife) the portrayal of the relationships between the main characters and their mates are realistic and very well done.Even though I'm not from New York the vivid descriptions from chapter to chapter made me feel like I was part of their posse.There was just enough suspense,action and sex (the sex scenes are HOT!....and I do mean HOT!) to allow me to breeze through \\"Revenge\\" in no time (took me two days.....).My wife started reading \\"Revenge\\" last night and she can't put it down.If you're looking for an escape from the tension of today's world events,I would highly recommend that you RUN (don't walk....) to your nearest bookseller and pick up \\"Revenge\\" right away!You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"I overlook the plastic protrayal of the two female leads in the book; the overuse of brand labels; the irresponsible use of the race card. But what I can't overlook is the lack of revenge. This story is almost totally without a climax. And that left me cold."},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"When I first read the title I thought &quot;enticing&quot;. I was right. I dreamt about the book at night and hated to put it down at work. The book is great and a huge page turner. I just hope that Danita and Tracie come out with something great in the future."},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"Kind of predictable overall a great read that keeps you turning the pages"},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"Revenge Is Best Served Cold, is a must read!!! The story moves you along at a fast pace. The characters are interesting and real and the sex scenes are sizzling."},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"This book was wonderful! Unlike some readers I loved reading about sophistiated, style-conscious African Americans; there are some of us who live, or aspire to live that lifestyle, and I found it refreshing that it was depicted in contemporary fiction. I also found the writing to be entertaining and witty and the plot had several unexpected twists and turns that kept me turning the pages quickly. I also loved the deep friendship between Morgan and Dakota, and how the sexy, Miles Nelson supported his wife, even when she was wrong. The story proves that none of us are perfect, even when we look as though we are from the outside - designer clothes and all!"},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"This book was horrible, I took it right back to the store. I can't even tell you what the story was about. Save your money and borrow it from the library."},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"I just completed this book last night and hope there is a followup because I loved it! It's about time I read an intriguing story about characters who sound like myself and many of my comtemporaries. I truly hope there is a sequel because the story line left me wanting more. I need to know if Dakota and Parker reconciled, and I love to see a brother and sister keep their marriage going despite a &quot;little drama&quot;.This novel will be fun fantasy (and inspiration) for many. For me it was a refreshing realistic view of those who really &quot;got it going on.&quot; It is great to finally read about hard working, educated, and cultured African Americans appreciating the finer things life has to offer.Congratulations to two beautiful sisters for creating a fine read.Karen Harper"},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"After reading this book, I was pissed. All that name dropping, typical juvenile storyline I just knew I would get past it after a couple of chapters, but the story just went on and on to its obviously predictable ending. Pure garbage. That book is now being used to hold up my coffee table!"},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"This book was okay - I'm basing that on the fact that I managed to finish the book. I think that the two ladies got together decided that they are living the fabulous life and felt the need to share it with everyone else.I purchased this book years ago and it has been sitting on my bookshelf. At the time when I bought the book the choice of black (African American/Black British) literature was limited in the UK so unfortunately for me I did not get the book at a discounted price from Amazon. This book is okay but as other readers have pointed out far to much reference is made to the designer labels that the characters are wearing and the plot is somewhat implausible.I truly believe that the 'authors' have used this book as a forum to showcase themselves and the fact that they've made it. However what comes across is two very fickle young women who are more concerned with appearance then anything else. The book doesn't have to serve as a bastion of morality however the whole 'Blake situation' didn't really have the repercussions that it would have had in a well written book.The epilogue was probably the most exciting part of the book however although it piqued my interest I would not be willing to purchase the next book."},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"that it took me 3 weeks to read a book that has less than 300 pages. Anyway, I had the second book and wanted to read this one first. It had a lot of mixed reviews, but I agree there is more fashion name dropping than anything. It was a very slow read not really interesting unless you want to know what everybody is wearing every chapter. And omg, the two older people in book speak like slaves which really was off the wall. It was just ok, I found myself speed reading so i could hurry and finish the book, I refused to read it another day. Needless to say all I missed was the wardrobe descriptions. I hope the other book is better."},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"To: Tracie and Danita,I will have to say keep writng it should get better for your readers.However, I must agree with one of your readers the title is very hot, catching.However, the beginning was not so hot and catching.I convince myself to continue reading so I can some kind of understanding of it.I did somewhat.Latter, in each chapter it got more interesting.End, didn't turn out quite alright. I wish Dakota could have some kind of way amend withParker.Good Luck! on other novels"},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"This book was an absolutely thrilling page turner. The authors start out very soft and mysterious. From the time all of the characters come together to the very last page, you are taken on a fun, intense, fantastic ski ride down a steep slope that never slows down.

Every character is exquisitely,stylistic and the way the authors introduce them got me comfortable and familiar- there is no wait time with this book. I couldn't help but be impressed at the surprises in the plot that hit me with the smoothness and craft of a magician.

This is their first book, they have alot of work to do. I normally can visilize the characters that I'm reading, in this case I couldn't. They had a good concept, but just didn't know how to make it a successful book. I just want to know why did we have to wait so long for the climax, the revenge and the resolution. They had a good idea but didn't know exactly what to do with it. Maybe they need one of those books like \\"Writing techniques for Dummies\\". I think they will do better on their next one."},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"Don't rush to buy this book. Borrow it from a friend or check it out at the library if you can because you're going to want to give it back. Both the climax and the resolution occured in the last few chapters. Throughout the story the writers focused too much on the designer clothing of the characters instead of telling the story. I didn't know if I was reading a fashion book or a love story. Revenge only occured in the last couple of chapters. They're going to have to do a lot better if they plan on writing a sequel."},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"I read Gold Diggers by Tracie Howard and it had a slow start but got better towards the middle. I decided to give the author another chance and bought two more of her books. I just started to read Revenge and I am 100 pages into a 296 page book and there is nothing but character development so far. There is no plot. I am trying to figure out when the reason for revenge is coming, considering I am nearly half way finished reading it. I wish I had read the reviews prior to buying this book. If you must (and I don't recommend that you do) get this from the library and don't waste any money on it."},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"I found this a terrible read!!! The characters were poorly developed and the plot was absolutely insignificant!! Just pointless name dropping, and worst of all, the plot was hinted at here and there. I felt that it was intriguing to see the niceties of the better half, but that was about the only interesting thing about the book. I was greatly disappointed, even though I bought the book from the local library for only $... I like to read before bed, and this is the perfect anecdote to help me sleep!!! I feel that reading should help people to gain a perspective on some topic, whether it is for entertainment or for purposes of educating themselves. I have not enjoyed wasting my time waiting for something to happen in the story. Why would two educated, professional, \\"intelligent, and beautiful\\" women get involved with this man anyway? They didn't get where they are by picking names out of a hat...this book is highly unrealistic, and is just a giant move backward for the sake of African-American women today."},{"Title":"Revenge is Best Served Cold","review":"This book was so good I can't wait to read it again. The title really speaks for itself. Just when you think you know someone you really don't. I kind of got lost near the end but when I continued to read and find out more I was somewhat shocked. The book had me going from start to end. Please read this book.

Maybe the target audience is the Britney Spears crowd. You'd have to be that young and impressionable to even consider this tale.The few attempts the authors made to tell a real story were thwarted by obsessive attention to designer labels while little was devoted to character development and a dramatic apex.And the revenge?

I want to read a book whereas I can pick up ten years from now and enjoy it again. This book will end up in the trash. If I could have given it half of a star I would have.

I felt close to the characters. With each dilemma it felt like it was my own. This book could have gotten 5 stars but it just took too long to get to the point.

Their humor has apparently been lost on many of the reviewers here. I don't think they are really intended to be used to issue a sincere apology. They are just funny to read through, and could possibly make a person chuckle, if they had the intelligence to recognize wit. The author, Lane Walker Foard, started a greeting card line several years ago that is apparently now defunct, but managed to garner quite a few loyal fans who appreciated the cards' clever and often poignant prose. These \\"apology\\" cards offer a sampling of what the greeting card business now lacks -- cards that are actually funny."},{"Title":"New Parent Apology Cards: 30 Cards","review":"This \\"book\\" is a collection of postcards to tear out and use in different situations. It might be good to have one on hand, maybe even several copies. Tuck it in with the gift for the next baby shower you attend.The situations covered include being disruptive in a restaurant, driving erratically while tending the baby, or keeping the neighbors awake at night with the crying baby. Hopefully it will bring a smile to the face of the soon-to-be parent, though if they actually use them, it may be with gritted teeth.

Or better yet, rather than prepare for your child's misbehavior with supposedly \\"witty\\" cards, reprimand your child when it behaves badly and clean up the mess it makes rather than make other people responsible for the consequences of your child's tantrum.We all understand that kids will act up now and then, it's passive \\"parenting\\" that antagonizes people."},{"Title":"New Parent Apology Cards: 30 Cards","review":"I hope no one would actually use these cards in lieu of real parenting or an actual sincere apology and immediate removal of the problem child. I hope these were designed with the only intention of people giving them to parents as a 'gag' new baby gift. You know something to open the parents eyes to these real life situations they will be presented with upon the growing up of their child and interactions in public places. Little cards of wisdom to show how NOT to allow your child to behave, ie. how about NOT let your child make a restaurant look like a rock band just trashed the place?

They are meant for young adults, and I think a lot of people are misguided into thinking the books are for children because they feature talking animals. This is not so, but that should not detract from the absolutely wonderful story Brian Jacques has created. The story of brave Matthias the abbey mouse learning his true calling and becoming a warrior mouse is a wonderfully crafted adventure, complete with memorable villains, unforgettable scenarios, and breath-taking visuals. The depth of detail Brian Jacques goes into describing things is so good, you can almost smell the food served at the feasts.I have read this book so many times, the binding has wore down and pages are starting to fall right out of the book. I highly recommend it---but remember, it's not for children!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"You'll find this book in the Childrens section, but more in the vein of 'The secret of Nimh' or 'Watership' down, it never reads down to the age of its target audience.I first picked this book up about ten years ago and finally got back to it this summer. I will as others before me, compare it to Harry Potter. I have enjoyed both series very much, but I admit to feeling this is the superior collection.The book weighs in at about 350 pages. The pace is quick and dense, but never convoluted. All kinds of adventures and subplots are woven into the main theme of good vs. evil. To expand on my comparison, I always felt a litte unsatisfied by some of the overwheming candy gloss in Harry Potter. I love candy gloss, but I appreciate an expensive beer as well. Whereas Harry Potter is a Childrens book that can be appreciated by adults, Redwall is a Novel that is written for everyone with a passion for fantasy.I hope I am being clear. i figure myself someone who will be a toys r us kid for life, but I've always appreciated a conversation that does not speak to me as though I am five. I don't like being protected from the world. I want my imagination to be free. Redwall satisfies me completely."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I remember one Saturday morning, as I was surfing channels, I happened across a cartoon called \\"Redwall\\". There were mice walking around on their back legs and talking as if they were human. At first I was a little unsure of what to think, but after sticking with it for the entire half hour, I found myself enjoying what I saw. Several weeks and episodes later I was hooked.One day, while browsing a table of books at an \\"Animal Humane Society\\" rummage sale, I saw a cover with a little mouse holding a sword and shield. The name \\"Redwall\\" jumped out at me and I instantly remembered the cartoon. It was then that I realized the story was first published as a book series, and needless to say, I purchased it right away-for only a buck too. Shortly after, my collection began to expand with other titles from the series.Story overview:---------------A horse drawn hay cart, out of control and filled with a band of nasty rats, ends up toppling over not far from a peace loving Church. However, these rats are anything but peace loving, particularly the evil-one-eyed warlord, Cluny, the Scourge, and so they invade the Church and capture it, taking the residents prisoner.Not far away is, \\"Redwall Abbey\\", which is a place of prosperity and good natured animals. One of which is an awkward little mouse named Matthias.Cluny realizes that the \\"Redwall Abbey\\" would be a great fortress, and so he gathers rats, ferrets, stoats, and weasels to take it over. However, the inhabitants, though uneducated in the ways of war, fight to keep the invaders from breaking through their Abbey walls. As Cluny and his gang lay siege, Matthias goes on a mission to recover a legendary weapon to use against Cluny. During his journey, Matthias creates bonds with various animals and finds himself up against many unexpected trials.My thoughts:-------------This is a cute story. I enjoyed the characters and situations they were put in, particularly the scavenger hunt (to find the legendary sword) that takes place in the Abbey, along with the antics of Basil Stag Hare.James D.

I would love to read more books by Brian Jacques."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I highly recommend this book because it is based on mice, stoats, ferrets, rats and other animals protecting and defending a place called Redwall. The ending is very strong and if you like little animals like that, I really really recommend this. I'm already starting the second book because Redwall is so good."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I was close to fifteen years old when I picked up Redwall and to be honest it wasn't because the book had been receiving rave reviews among my peers. It was simply a book to pass the half hour Silent Reading period they had in school.As I started to read it though, I gradually became more and more interested in the atmosphere of Redwall Abbey and Cluny and everything that happened in between.This book is responsible for catapulting me into appreciating novels for the first time. I would not recommend that you hand over this book to a kid who doesn't like to read period, but if they have some interest then hand over this book.

Even though ferrets get a bad rap in this story (as do the rats), it was a great little story that did a nice job of slotting into the Campbell Heroic Journey, combined with elements of a broader epic. There were nice allusions to the real-world St. Martin, a soldier saint who is patron of beggars and hospitality. The only thing I would say is that the Redwall defenders seemed to have things just a little too easy through most of the novel, which meant the story lacked real \\"do or die\\" tension. But it's targeted towards a youth/YA audience, so that flaw is definitely forgiveable. I gave a copy of this to my sister and my [...] nephew to enjoy together, but wouldn't feel comfortable giving it to him to read by himself (just a tiny bit too scary still)."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is a book that people who like animals will love as mice from Redwall Abbey known as Martin the Warrior and Matthias battle bad creatures known as Clooney the Scourge, Slagar the Cruel, and Malcariss who are trying to take over Redwall."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I thought that this book was a very good book and it tied up everything in the end so there were no loose ends. I liked how some of the characters, even though they were animals, had human characteristics. Like they can all talk, they have government, and they have human tools. This made the story easier to relate to and taught me something about life.The book starts out with the main character, Matthias, being a young mouse. Then Cluny the Scourge, an evil rat, comes to take over Redwall. Matthias needs to grow up fast so he can save his friends from becoming slaves. To do this he must take the sword of Martin the Warrior from a snake who stole it. On his path he makes many new friends, solves riddles, fights enemys, and loses some very close friends. This is what makes the story so interesting. In the end one of his new friends tells him that it doesn't matter that he had the sword because it didn't hold any magic, it was just created to kill. The magic was in the person who used the sword. Whether they used it for good or for evil, then the sword would do the same. This is where Matthias learns the importance of watching his every action and always being good. I would reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys fiction and likes a good story."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This is a fabouluos book with many great characters.

When you've read one, you'll want to read the rest!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This introduction to the world of Redwall saga is an incredibly well-written literary work (like all of the installments in this series). It is a lively, humorous, exciting, and altogether enthralling, snaring the young, the old, women, men, the adventurer, the chaste, the fighter, the poet, and everyone else who reads it in a lush storyworld equal to those of Tolkien, Dumas, Twain, Brooks, or any of the masters of the written word. I have discussed Redwall and its sequels and prequels with many other readers, and have failed to find one who was not drawn in by the warmth and authenticity of the surroundings, the characters, and the events Jacques tells of. Appropriate for children, engaging enough for adults, kindly and sweet enough for romantics and exciting enough for warriors, Redwall will leave you thirsting for a sip of strawberry cordial, hungering for a bite of celery and fennel flan, a taste of apple and cheese summer salad, and one good shot at Cluny the Scourge. HIGHLY recommended"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I have read six books(and am looking forward to my seventh)in this series and Redwall was my first book and is definatly among my favorites. It is overflowing with excitment and suspense, and kept me thinking about it even after I finished reading it. As a matter of fact, I thought about it so much that I even had dreams about it. Not that that's a bad thing, of couse. Redwall is the kind of book that makes you want to laugh and cry, the kind of book you can't let go of once you get hold of it. Brian Jacques combines adventure and friendship in such a way that I couldn't stop turning the pages. To sum it all up, Redwall is a great book. Or, as Basil Stag Hare would put it,\\" A jolly ole' book, wot wot!\\""},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I'm a 14 year old, average game playing, school going student. Also, regrettably, never got into reading very much. Only the forced book reports at school, (although even those i kinda skipped through) but this is the first book that ever truly hooked me, and kept me reading from afternoon to the wee hours of the morning. If you are remotely into fantasy, i strongly reccomend looking into this book. Espcially, any parants looking for a book to inspire a child to read. This one worked for me. Best of all, its a long series of books, and they'll want to read every one of them. Of this i'm sure."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This is the book that made me start to read. It is amazing how he does the speech for the characters. My personal favorite charcter was Basil Stag Hare who's speech I liked the best. I give it 5 stars because I like it a lot."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"RedwallRedwall is the best I ever read. It had so much suspense my eyes were glued to the book. You don't notice what is happening around you. One example is when I was reading Redwall, and we were on the runway. I didn't even notice that we were on the runway until my brother announced it. This author is amazing at catching your attention. It's definitely my favorite book.Redwall is a story about an evil warlord attacking a peaceful castle of mice. These mice are healer's not strong warriors. They need to beat a warlord who never loses any wars! How are they supposed to do that? Their only chance in winning is if Matthias an orphan can find and capture the sword of an ancient warrior of Redwall. Matthias has to take the riskiest adventures to capture the ancient sword. Can he survive? Will Redwall survive?Brian Jacques the author is very creative. He writes about rodents and other small animals in the setting of medieval times so it seems more fantasy. His description is dazzling too. When ever he goes on an adventure or eats you feel like your there. Also he uses shows not tell making the book a lot better.Did you know this is part of a series? This is the first book of the series. If you read this one you will want to read all of them."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Matthias, an orphaned mouse and recent arrival to Redwall Abbey, is in the service of the peaceful Abbot Mortimer, the defacto leader of the many rodents in this abbey and surrounding Mossflower Woods. And the Abbot notices something different about Matthias: his soul isn't as forgiving or quiet as the rest of their kind. He's restless and interested in Martin the Warrior, a legendary battle-hardened mouse who helped form the abbey by using his famous sword. Martin's final resting place and the location of his sword have been lost in time, but a sudden threat to Redwall Abbey and its peaceful inhabitants lights a fire under Matthias to find the sword.Cluny the Scourge has arrived at the abbey gates. Cluny, a one-eyed rat, commands a horde of hundreds of other rats, stoats, and weasels, and he's set his eye on Redwall Abbey. He wants to plunder it and make it his new home, killing anything that gets in his way. But odd dreams have suddenly set themselves into his mind. He begins seeing a strange mouse with a sword whom he fears greatly for reasons he cannot explain. But he knows he must have Redwall Abbey, and his horde of rough-hewn soldiers will have no problem taking it. Or will they?Time and again Cluny and his horde try to breach the walls of Redwall without success. And time and again Cluny has the dream of the warrior mouse chasing him, trying to kill him.As the threat to Redwall grows, Matthias runs about trying to find the location of Martin the Warrior's sword. He scours the abbey records, searches Mossflower Wood, and even comes face to face with Asmodeus, a deadly adder. Can one mouse help end the deadly reign of Cluny the Scourge?______________________________________________________________________________The basic format of this story is a hero's journey. In this case, a mouse hero. The layout works fairly well, but became predictable after a short time.The prose is okay, not topnotch, but the characters are interesting enough to keep you reading (I wanted to know what would happen to Martthias, Constance the badger, Cornflower the love interest, and Silent Sam the squirrel, etc.).My main problems with the book were focused on some very convenient plot twists, the size of various items, and the ease with which Cluny and his horde finally gain access to the abbey.The plot twists. One particular mouse has been searching for Martin's sword forever, and now helps Matthias find it. What was the hold-up before? Matthias makes friends of many enemies in the blink of an eye. And the list goes on...Size of items. Mr. Jacques (the author) seems to have trouble distinguishing size. Squirrels, badgers, mice, stoats, rats, foxes, weasels, etc. are all referred to as if they were the size of mice. The abbey, which we can only presume was built by humans, is small sometimes and larger than life at others. The abbey gates are easily opened by mice, but the roof of the abbey is hundreds of feet tall. Hmm.Cluny and his horde gain access to the abbey. After laying siege to Redwall for days and days, and watching how well the mice protect it, Cluny gains access through an unguarded side door. That was pretty lame.Even with these problems one can't forget that this really is a children's tale, so size, convenient plots, and ease of access to the abbey probably won't matter much to them. But if you want to try and compare REDWALL to THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS or WATERSHIP DOWN, you'd best be warned: it doesn't come close to those. REDWALL isn't a very challenging read, but does contain a fluid story with easily grasped characters that many readers will find endearing."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"First off, I wanted to comment on the issues that seem to be confusing a lot of readers:Concerning size and scale, just imagine all the creatures in this world as being roughly the same size. Some (badgers, hares, et cetera) are larger than others (mice and squirrels), but the size difference is not as significant as it would be in real life. It's closer to the difference in size between, say, a child and a large man.The Redwall series does not take place in our world, but in a fantasy universe where rodents rule the land and have advanced civilizations. This is not Watership Down, where the rabbits can talk and think but are otherwise normal rabbits living in a normal world. This is a fantasy universe separate from our own.The dwellings are proportionate to the creatures that live in them. They are not human dwellings, they were built by woodland creatures, and so there's no reason the mice would have trouble opening doors and whatnot. Same goes for everything else they build and use (boats, et cetera).These issues become clearer as the series goes on, but I can see how they could be confusing to people reading this for the first time...especially since, in the first book, Jacques does not seem to be entirely clear on what sort of world he is trying to create. As other reviewers have mentioned, there are a few mentions of human civilization, which feel out of place and are quickly dropped later in the series. Just thought I'd try to clarify that before adding my own comments.I liked this series a lot when I was younger, and I have fond memories of it. Overall, Jacques does a good job of creating a unique fantasy world filled with likeable and fun characters. I especially like that he's not afraid to write tough female characters who can fight and get their paws dirty alongside the males. But there are some things that bother me about this book and the Redwall series in general.The biggest and most enduring problem is the simplistic, black-and-white view of morality. Virtually all the mice, squirrels, badgers, et cetera, are good. Virtually all the rats, ferrts, weasels (\\"vermin\\") are evil. Offhand, I can think of only two examples of vermin who turned out to be not so bad after all and who ended up helping the good guys...but by and large, they're an unsavory bunch, purely bad with no redeeming qualities (again, with a few scarce exceptions). They're motivated by greed and power-lust, nothing else.I'm not saying that all characters have to be some complex, morally ambiguous shade of gray--I LIKE having good guys that I can root for without hesitation--but making ALL the members of a certain species good or bad, therefore creating a world where you can know at a glance the nature of someone's soul (\\"He's a rat! He must be evil!\\") is obviously problematic. I wouldn't go so far as to say that his novels endorse racism, but they lean uncomfortably in that direction.What I would love is to see a Redwall novel written from the perspective of one of the \\"vermin\\" races, describing what it's like to grow up in a world where one's kind is universally feared and hated, and maybe adding some realism and humanity (er...rodentity?) to the villains. Or better yet, a novel where the hero is one of the vermin, who overcomes his upbringing and joins the woodlanders in their fight against evil...or fights alone because they won't accept him. It could be a good opportunity for Jacques to explore the issue of prejudice in a way that children could understand: How it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, and how it's possible for individuals to break the cycle. But it's seeming less and less likely that Jacques is ever going to write such a thing.Oh well, one can hope."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This is a terrific start to the (odviously) Redwall series. Brian Jacques blends everything together, the characters, the plot, the setting, to create a wonderful work of literature. The animals of Redwall and the residing country live (or try to live) in peace. Yet, many cruel, egotistical animals create havoc in this world. Read Redwall and it's many counterparts, Salamandastron, Mossflower, and more, to find out how the creatures deal with such diversity."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I would not recommend this book, which I read once when I was 12, and recently re-read. The reason for this is that - although Brian Jacques does a great job with plot and description, creating an enthralling fantasy world and a clever tale that combines elements of epic, detective story and quest - his characters are simply too flat and one dimensional. In addition, since Redwall is primarily a story of war, this creates some serious moral problems that, in my opinion, simply ruin the book.In the universe of Redwall, all characters seem to be labeled by the author, from the beginning, as either good or bad. The characters themselves are varied to the extreme. There are \\"good\\" animals that are quarrelsome (the shrews), snobby (Gingivere the cat), ruthless (Constance the badger) and naive (Abbot Mortimer) and there are \\"bad\\" characters that are pitiable (Ragear the rat, who is eaten by Asmodeous) loyal and efficient (Scragg the weasel) and brave (many of the rat army, and Cluny himself). However, the overall label of \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" will always determine the character's fate. Moreover, all the \\"good\\" characters have nothing but contempt and even hatred for the \\"bad\\" characters. This had the effect, for me, of feeling a bit sorry for the \\"bad\\" characters, no matter how despicable their actions. But what was even more disturbing to me was how dishonorable the \\"good\\" characters can be in the book.One example: imagine that it's the middle of World War II, with Britain being menaced by the Nazi regime. Then one day, a spy within the Nazi regime, offering valuable information about the Nazi invasion plans, contacts the British government. The spy offers the information in return for a large cash reward. The British government arranges a secret meeting. When the spy shows up, at the risk of her life, British agents cudgel her senseless and steal the information from her, leaving her to be found by the Germans. A little while later, the spy is caught and ruthlessly executed; but her associate escapes and returns to Redwall (oops, I mean Britain) severely wounded, but with more secret, valuable information. The British government takes the second spy in, but withholds water and medical attention until the spy spills his guts.What would you think of the British Government after an incident like that? Would they be that much better than the Nazis? Would Britain be worth fighting for?Oh, and incidentally, after the war is over, the British victors slaughter every single German soldier they find, leaving none alive.Yet, a very similar situation occurs in the pages of Redwall. Yeah, I know it's just a kid's book. But I was a kid when I first read it, and that sort of thing bothered me then, too. A big part of the book is supposed to be about honor; but the good characters all tend to act dishonorably. The book is supposed to be about a conflict between good and evil; but the good side doesn't seem to be that much better than the bad side. Sure, the good guys don't kill and conquer, like the bad; but the good guys don't have any problem with using any chance they can get to win, or with killing and torturing the enemy. No problem at all.These problems arise, I think, with an undeveloped morality on Mr. Jacques's part."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"MC says: I haven't finished the book but what I've read so far is very interesting.

The Redwall mice struggle to stop Cluny the Scourge (a rat) from leading his army of rats, stoats, weasels, and ferrets into their home, an Abbey. It is divided into three parts, Book One - The Wall, Book Two - The Quest, and Book Three - The Warrior. I enjoyed reading this book, more than watching the show and I really like the show! I plan to read more books in the Redwall series."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"My favorite book is Redwall by Brain Jacques, because of three things included in this amazing story. One of the things is the wars of property. Cluny the rat is the attacker of Redwall with his horde of rats, stoats, ferrets, and a fox. The protectors of Redwall, witch mainly contain a badger, mice, moles, squirrels, and some hedgehogs. The weapons they used in it are things that you would be able to use in real life, the story it basicly medieval times with animals in place of humans. Next, is the search for the famed Martian the Warrior's awesome sword. When Matthias and Redwall's abbey leader, the Abbot, start on this search for Martian's sword they have to go through mind bobbling puzzles. Whenever they do solve the puzzle they figure out that the sword is missing and that there is only the shield. Once Matthias finds out that sparrows have taken the sword he must climb to the tree and retrieve it! After a long search through the nest of the sparrows he figures out that the sparrow King his self had it stolen by a dreaded snake of everyone's fear. The last thing I like about it is that how clever Cluny is, even though he ends up never getting control of Redwall. At one point he has a black night rat climb Redwall Abbey's great towering walls to steal the last picture of Martian the Warrior. He also comes up with the idea of fire slingers, rocks covered in vines and oil lit on fire, and throws them over the Abbey's massive walls. As you can see, this book should be a must read, and all continuums of it."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"My favorite book this year has been Redwall, part of the Redwall series. One of the reasons I like Redwall so much is because of Matthias. He really just brightens up the book. He is a brave, strong young mouse determined to keep the rats away from the Redwall abbey. I also like the adventurous storyline. It is exactly the way I like it. I think one of the best parts is when Matthias goes to find the sword of Martin the Warrior. This takes him a long time, but when he finally finds it he has to fight Asmodeus Poisonteeth, the giant adder, to get it. Another thing I like are the characters instead of people they\`re animals. There are a lot other things I like to, but In the end I think this is a wonderfully fantastic book every one should read"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is a truly exciting book, from riddles to the final battle.

There seems to be many opinions on this book and controversies. So let's break this down. First this is intended to be a children's book and therefore reviews should not be so hard upon the controversial problems within the book. The most common reasons for dissatisfaction of this book seems to be in its character development, themes, and its ability to capture the readers acceptance of the story. The character development is truly terrible. All characters basically have preset abilities and statistics. They do not seem to learn or develop from their experiences. For example let us look at the main character and hero, Matthias the mouse. In the beginning he starts as a humble monk who lacks self-confidence and trips over his own sandals. Then along comes Cluny the Scourge, the evil counterpart of our hero. Suddenly Matthias becomes a great warrior with a sharp mind able to analyze situations and make rapid decisions like a good leader should. This transition is not well supported. The only explanation is the spirit of a preceding warrior(Martin), that dwells within Matthias. Even in the book there was a line that went something like \\"It was as though he had grown up overnight\\". The characters are not showing the development that they should, and to suite the needs of all events in the story, Jacques simply creates another character. The themes of this story are the most obvious and basic. The story is like an Arthurian tale with a little zest from Jacques. The protagonist \\"good-guys\\" and their actions display themes such as courage, honor, love, compassion, and all the other good things that you would expect out of heroes. The antagonists \\"bad-guys\\" display terrible traits such as cruelty, brutality, indifference, and etc. They are depicted as savages almost with low intelligence profiles. These characteristics and themes are unoriginal and hackneyed. Now its ability to capture a reader's acceptance? Well a book's success depends largely upon its ability to gain the reader's acceptance. This is particularly difficult for Redwall. 1. Its characters are all animals with human characteristics. 2. Proportion is not very evident (e.g. there are badgers, which are about the size of common dogs and bigger walking alongside mice and using the same doors and facilities. 3. Why are there no humans, yet evidence of humans? (Cluny and his notorious group enter the story on a large horse-drawn wagon, drawn by a horse.) There is a church owned only by churchmice. ?????? Very hard to accept. Some critics ask how the badgers in the story are vegetarian, and one person even stated that they were vegan. Well how they are vegetarian is a puzzle, but they are vegetarian only to a certain point. (They eat fish, how can they be vegan, which is the strictest form of vegetarianism). Also surprisingly some critics have complained that Jacques' portrayal of some animals is injust. (e.g. Why are badgers good, and ferrets bad? Rats aren't all bad!). Well it is certainly evident that the author possesses some opinion pertaining to different types of animals and uses them to suit the type of character he is trying to portray. But saying that kids will think badly of the animals portrayed as evil, is kind of going far. It is up to them to make their opinions of the animals and some may not even notice this aspect. Other complaints include opinions that the storyline is too predictable or melodramatic. Remember this is a childrens' story, and it certainly has commendable qualities. Jacques' use of language and prose is absolutely wonderful and would probably improve reading skill and vocabulary of kids. It is still a fun and exciting story with cliff hangers at the end of every chapter that keeps the reader engrossed with its contents. It is a good story for people who are willing to accept it to enjoy. Most complaints are too critical. I rate this book 3 stars out of 5, however for it has aspects not suited to be a children's story. The violence and some language is very vivid and detailed. Children may not want to read about this. Sorry if there are issues unaddressed, but those seemed to be the most common ones posted. The book's cost is very reasonable, and it could be a very enjoyable way for parents to spend time with children, or for a child(older) to improve his or her reading skills."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I hated reading since I began learning the alphabet. I wasn't good at it, and it took too long. My eyes didn't focus correctly and I struggled. My older brother handed me Redwall in the second grade. Reluctantly, I took it, having nothing better to read. From page 1, I fell head over heels in love with Redwall Abbey and the incredible creatures that inhabit it. I finished the book in a day. I checked every Brian Jacques book out at the library and read every single one that summer. Once I'd finished the series, I went back and reread all of them. Every summer since then, I reread Taggerung, Marlfox, Pearls of Lutra, Redwall, Mattimeo, and the others, immersing myself into the world of mice, squirrels, and badgers. All of Brian Jacques books grace the book shelf in my room; thanks to him, I have racks and racks of books that I love to read. Were it not for Redwall, I'd still hate reading as much as I did as a child. Redwall is a great book to read aloud to children, and even adults can enjoy the delightful tales."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The book came to me in practically mint condition.

The author Brian Jacques is a outstanding writer. His style keeps you wanting more of the book. The language used is a bit hard to understand at first, but you get used to it. He uses foreshadowing to keep your attention. Its a really good book with a awesome story line. So go ahead and read it."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Red wall was an okay book, it was'nt realistic toward me, the ending was good but the book started out slow. The enemies died too quickly, expecially asmodeus. Overall, Red wall was a dissappointment toward me."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The book I read was Redwall. I really liked it because it was kind of like Mossflower, the first book in the series. Also the animals actually talk. That really helps paint a picture in my mind. All of the other Brian Jacques books out there sound really good. He writes fiction books and those are the books I'm really into.The main characters in the story are Matthias, Clunny, Constance, Basil Stag Hare, Brother Measaluth, and Abbot Mortimer. The story takes place in Mossflower Woods.The sun shown bright over Mossflower Woods. Clunny The Scourge had arrived. He had come for one thing. To capture Redwall! As Matthias is out picking berries he sees Clunny. He rushes back to Redwall to tell Abbot Mortimer. Clunny has begun to plan his first attack on Redwall. As his troops move out, Redwall archers bombard them. During the battle, Constance tries to kill Clunny, but a rat dives into the path of the arrow. The attack was fought off. Later that night Clunny sends a soldier into Redwall to steal a tapestry of a mouse warrior named Martin. Unfortunately they succeed. Now Redwall wants to beat Clunny even more than before! They will need the help from the help of Martin The Warrior's soward. As Matthias and Brother Measaluth search for Martin's sword, Clunny has a couple more surprises for Redwall. Will Redwall ever defeat Clunny? Will the Tapestry of Martin ever come back? To find out, read the book!To really like this book, you have to like fiction. Not the type of fiction where aliens come down to earth. But the animals do talk so there is some fiction in there. People who like 200 - 350 page books would like Brian Jacques books. People who like short books might not like it. So if you haven't read a Brian Jacques book, pick up Redwall right now. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book is truly amazing! First in the book there is this group of mice that live in a great huge castle, called RedWall. They are sworn to take in anything that is hurt or needs help. Then this very mean army of rats led by the ruthless and brutal rat Clunny. This book is filled twists and turns that you thought that would never happen. I give this book a 5 out of 5. I give it this rating because the story was filled with action and I loved every minute of it. The book also had many characters and kept you thinking. I also rated this book a 5 out of 5 because the book did not keep you waiting it got you right into the action and you stayed there the whole story.Matthias is a very good mouse. I think that he is the Protagonist because he is the leader of RedWalls army. He also is the leader because he really wants to give Clunny a beatin&#65533; around. Matthias is also very nice in person but when he is ready for a fight you do not want to be anywhere near him. His personality is also very different because he cares about people even if he really does not like them that much at that specific time. His behavior is also very different at different times when he is around the girl that he likes he is a totally different person then he is by himself or with a friend.This book was truly a treat to read. There were many good scenes that certainly made the book for me. But one of my favorite parts of the book is when Constance the badger kills a rat that is wearing Clunny&#65533;s clothes while he is gone trying to think of a plan to take over RedWall. Constance comes up with the super bow an arrow and was waiting for the sky to get dark so that the sun would not be In her eyes and then when she shot the arrow she actually hit a rat that was acting like Clunny while he was gone.I think that action lovers would especially like this book, but that is all there really is. I think that a drama or romance reader would really not be into it as much as a person that enjoys action/adventure. But this is not for everyone I think that this book is a little deep for some readers I think that parents should read book with their kids or at least hold them off to read it until the age of 11."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is a captavating book that kept me reading straight form the beginning to the end.It involves fantastic battles, interesting animals, and creative characters.Antborg909"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is a story that will keep you saying \\"just one more chapter\\"every time you have to do something else.this story is about a huge stone building named redwall where moles,mice,otters,hedgehogs,badgers,and squirrels.But an evil rat named clooney the scourge wants to take redwall and rule all he sees with his horde of stoats,rats,ferrets and many more different hordebeasts.Matheus,a redwall mouse,is trying to find the legendary sword of martin the warrior to help against the horde of clooney.you will be amazed at how Jacqes makes different language for different types of animals like moles.This book is a deffinite buy."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This story takes place in an abbey named Redwall.

Lewis to Tolkien and L'Engle, I have enjoyed them all. When I started Redwall, I planned on an excellent read. To my dissapointment, I found it redunant, filled with superlatives, and amazingly uninteresting...there is a common sympathy for Matthias, which I found admirable, but I found it hard to turn the next page, and the next..there are authors out there with a much more distinctive style, like L'Engle or Yolen, or authors who go with the mainstream, yet shape their books with a unique point of view, like newcomer J.K. Rowling. what is surprising is the fact that there are so many books in the Redwall series. Jacques is a good author, but there is something lacking."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The whole Redwall series is written with over-done cultural dialects!

The book is plagued with point of view shifts, author intrusion, needless exposition, and the hand of God is at work throughout the novel, allowing just the help the heros need to be at just the right spot at just the right time at every turn. Most characters have no depth at all, but are simply in place to fulfill a necessary role and nothing more. The rest are cliches. That said, it was at times entertaining and I think must be an excellent book for preteens. Unfortunately, most bookstores have it inappropriately placed with adult Fantasy. Though the writing really is lazy, this serves a purpose. It helps the story move along and allows Jacques to focus on the meat of his tale. Is that an acceptable excuse? In adult Fantasy, no. In novels intended for preteens, yes. While older readers will certainly notice that things are amiss with Jacques's writing, younger readers, having less reading experience/sophistication, won't. And though the characters truly lack anything resembling depth or originality, they fit their roles wonderfully and mesh together just right. Plus, for preteen readers there are few cliches. Things we see as trite are still fresh to them. If I could, I'd give this 2 stars for the grown ups, and 4 for the kiddies."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This quasi-Medieval fantasy about mouse monks, and various other small woodland beings, taking shelter in an Abbey besieged by a bandit army of rats, stoats and ferrets, is good enough to make me wish it were better, but not good enough to make me read more of the series.One flaw is the descriptive writing. Despite an imaginative premise, the author rarely gives enough info to let the reader form a picture in his mind. For instance, a horse with cart galloped past our heroes as they traveled on a road, and it was not until a chapter later that I was able to determine that the horse was traveling in the opposite direction than I had imagined. A more lasting problem is imagining the relative scale of the various animals and their surroundings. Though much of the action takes place in Redwall Abbey, I was more than halfway through the book before I managed to resolve the nagging question of how large the Abbey was relative to its inhabitants, wasting many of the images I had formed in my early reading. Turns out that though these Mice are normal mouse-size (they are smaller than rats, 400 of whom can fit in a horse cart), the Abbey they live in is human-sized (with outer walls over 20 feet high, and an even higher Abbey roof). But even this left me with nagging unresolved questions of what sort of doors these mice open, and what sort of steps they climb, in what sort of rooms they hold their feasts, and how they could possibly defend so large a structure. At other times, the author seems to switch to the idea that these are human-sized animals living in a Giant-sized Abbey, as when he assumes that a fall from a wall or roof will almost always mean instant death for a rat or mouse.Another major flaw is the sloppy, lazy plotting, by which the author just forces one event to follow another. Here's a very early example: Cluny, the evil leader of the villainous rat horde, asks for a private audience with the Abbot, and in order to achieve this, permits himself to stripped of weapons, separated from his horde, and ushered into the Abbey. Having thus rendered himself helpless, he proceeds to tell the Abbot \\"surrender immediately, or I'll kill you all\\". The incensed Abbot knows the horde will be helpless and disorganized without their leader, but honorably decides not to kill the helpless villain, instead permitting him to leave and continue his siege. The explanation offered for the Villain's inexplicable risk-taking is that he knew the mice were too honorable to harm a guest. But it is odd for Evil to have such mighty faith in Virtue. Why take the risk? Why not have his herald shout out these simple terms? Why did Cluny need the private audience. The answer, it turns out, is simply that, unbeknownst to Cluny, the Author needed an plot device to get Cluny into the Great Hall of the Abbey so he could see a certain Tapestry which will later haunt his dreams.The lazy plotting cannot be forgiven by claiming this story is a fantasy and a children's story. When an author puts more effort into a story, plotting it carefully, it does not make the story harder to read -- quite the reverse. True, kids are undemanding critics, less likely than adults to notice flaws, but that does not mean we should throw trash at them.Another problem I have is with the story's morality. On the plus side, it is not clear that it is completely amoral, like, some children's literature these days. On the other hand the morality is, as another reviewer put it, \\"underdeveloped.\\" In this, it is roughly on the level of the Harry Potter books (though ultimately more violent and bloodthirsty). It has a sort of Ron-Harry-Hermione syndrome, wherein the central hero is flanked, on the one hand, by more bloodthirsty and amoral friends (such as Constance) who do his dirty work for him, and on the other hand by a more restrained friend (here, the Abbot), whose moral scruples are treated as a lovable character flaw. Our hero (or the reader) gets to have it both ways, participating vicariously both in the viciousness and the virtues of his various friends, without having to stand up to any of them or make any real moral choices.I was, however, particularly disturbed by the central hero's mistreatment of a female sparrow prisoner, wherein an oath extracted under torture and threat of death leads instantly to a Stockholm-syndrome type friendship.The author makes the villains ridiculously exaggerated. Their zeal for wickedness transcends self-serving evil-doing and crashes headlong into self-destructive stupidity. This ploy makes it easy enough to contrast villains with heroes, but it obscures, rather than highlights, any real moral awareness. A related issue is that heroes and cartoon villains are neatly divided by animal species. Rats, Foxes, Ferrets and Stoats are all automatically Evil. The Mice, Squirrels and Moles are simply Good, and any flaws they may have seem to be regarded merely as amusing character traits.My problem is not that Jacques has written a violent tale featuring death and killing. It is a mistake to criticize violence in the abstract without regard to whether the violence is justified. But it still seems to me that the author botched a golden opportunity to give these such issues a better treatment."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Since seventh grade I've heard nothing but accolades for Brian Jacques's Redwall and have never read it. Now i'm ten years older and a quarter of the way through the book, and i'm bored to tears. For about fifteen minutes I've searched high and low through book reviews seeing if anyone else in the world dislikes it quite like I do, and the result leaves me a little lonely. Am I an ogre? First, there's only so much rodent chivalry I can handle. If you're going to write a book about mice and badgers, make it more than exceptional. Now, The Wind in the Willows, that was quality animal fiction. I suppose if animals are talking and carrying on like humans in any story, it has to be above average to get me to enjoy it. I'm more willing to care about characters in a story if they're bigger than my thumb.I mean, I find fieldmice just as cute as the next person finds them, but, I'd rather see them scuttling across a dirt road doing normal mouse things, like eating, not thinking, and scaring the mercy out of my Grandmother. (Not that I want to see my Grandmother terrified...)Beyond that, as other reviewers pointed out, the story is a little hard to follow. Where exactly is the Abbey? How are things laid out? Is Matthias allowed to love Cornflower because he's a mouse monk? (Is he even a mouse monk? I mean, he wears a habit...) Perhaps that's not how it works in Redwall. And perhaps I have to read further. But, I think I will have to stick with Catcher in the Rye.I feel like Will Smith in \\"I am Legend\\" calling out for anyone around him, if you are out there, and you also did not like this book, though it may seem like it...YOU are not alone."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Terrible. The plot is just one long cliche. The peaceful &quot;good guys&quot; are attacked by the evil &quot;bad guys&quot; and rise up to defeat them. Big surprise. The characters are entirely one-dimensional. The &quot;good guys&quot; do no harm to anyone, and the &quot;bad guys&quot; are completely bloodthirsty. Jaques could at least have had a tirant for the leader of the &quot;good guys&quot; to add some diversity to the storyline. The only plus side to this book was the rich descriptions and myriad adjectives. Still... my dog could have done better than that!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I don't know why this book got so many 5-star reviews. There's nothing groundbreaking about it, nothing that makes you think. Is America this shallow?This is a simple book in that it just tells a story and has a lot of action. It doesn't delve deeper. I have mixed feelings about it. At times, I enjoyed it; other times, I was bored and wanted to put it down or didn't care to pick it back up. Mostly because it doesn't really make you afraid for the characters. I wasn't itching to know what would happen to them because I knew they would be alright.If you want to read a similar, but far better book, read Watership Down.Now, I don't know if you would consider this a children's book or not. I am an adult and will read anything. But, if you argue that this book is simple because it is meant for a younger crowd, then I would have to say, read A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle. There are other books out there, including children's books, that explore complex topics, delve into the character's minds, books that challenge your ways of thinking.If you are a simple person, you will probably enjoy this, but if you hunger for books that will challenge your mind, you might want to skip this one."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Like a previous reviewer noted, there are a few problems of scale that occasionally hurt the suspension of disbelief. Also, I have trouble reconciling the death and violence with the kiddy wordings that appear here and there (such as the second paragraph in the book: \\"Bump!\\"). I mean, it's not like the violence is incredibly graphic or disturbing, it's just out of place if this is to be considered a children's book (which I think it is).Mainly, though, my gripe is simply that it's not a compelling book. I managed to get all the way through it, but it wasn't exactly a page-turner, and I don't plan to read any more in the series.Instead, I recommend the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling, the Xanth series by Piers Anthony, and any of Robert A. Heinlein's juvenile science fiction books (such as Tunnel in the Sky). These are suitable for kids, yet are not \\"kiddy.\\" They read just as well for adults as for kids."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The book itself gets four stars, but in the audiocasseteversion I bought, Brian Jaques speaks way too fast.

It puts you on the edge of your seat and you won't want to put it down. If you read Redwall there are other books by Brian Jacques like, Marlfox,Martin the Warrior,The Outcast of Redwall, and Salamandastron.Brain Jacques is the writer of many books. He can write in a amazing way by putting a realistic feeling in the book and making the book so good you won't want to stop reading it. He is still alive and writing more books.

My cousins recommended them and a found this one at my local library. I CANNOT STOP READING IT!!! How Mr. Jacques keeps readers clued to his books (especially me) I do not know! I really like how he does give details, but doesn't stay to long on them, just enough to let you know about it. Actually, I would rate it 4.9 stars. Simply because Matthias is looking for the sword that he thinks is the only salvation for the Abbey. Now I do read it, but I read fast, because I love the action that goes on with Cluny and company. Out of opinion entirerly, I wouldn't recommended these books (or at least this one because it's the only one I've read) to younger children under the reading level (9-12). Simply because of the magic (not much), violence and language (still not much).I am eventually going to buy the whole series and read them in order.At the end of each chapter you are dieing to find out what happens next (Matthias fall into cat's mouth), but the next chapter is somewhere else (goes to fight at Abbey). Sometimes I'm dieing to skip the next chapter to see what happens, but that chapter is just as interesting! I definitly do not like long books, but somehow read it in just a couple of days!I like Basil Stag Hare and Methusalem for the good guys, and Shadow and Redtooth for the bad guys (I liked others, but these top the list (and Scragg too)).I also like how there are smaller adventures and how Asamodeus has the sword (supprisingly enough, I new he was for something).Best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is great!I've read all the books twice and still it's not enough!

It's a nice change to see the various woodland creatures as different sorts of fantasy races instead of using stock elves and dwarves. I especially liked having a snake in the story as a vicious monster instead of a dragon, but I don't understand why it would keep saying its name over and over. Mostly it troubles me that I can't tell how big these creatures are. Was Redwall Abbey made by humans, and so is incredibly large for the woodland creatures? Why else would it seem so high up when Matthias is up in the attic? And yet all the doors and fixtures seem to be designed for the current occupants. It's puzzling. And the whole prophecy &quot;am that is&quot; thing is handled in heavy-handed and improbable way that won't be much satisfying to an adult audience. Regardless, the characters are extremely engaging, and the full cast audio production, with a few sound effects, is very well done."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"\\"Redwall\\" was Jacques' first book [written] in teh Redwall Series. I read it somewhat after a few of the other books, and was disappointed (I tried to read them chronologically in the way that the info in the stories goes). This was a great book, but definitely not my favorite. If you are new to this series, I suggest you read them like I did for many reasons: 1) It allows you to see how much Jacques refined his thoughts, which GREATLY improved the books, and 2) it makes more sense. Call me a freak, but I would give some of the other books a six out of five -- they are just that good.Do not get me wrong, though: THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!A must-read for any fantasy lover, and even someone who is not a fantasy reader.Dispite popular theory (at least from around here), Redwall is not a weird crazy book about mice killing rats; it's like REAL LIFE, only with personified animals. Roughly medieval, Jacques did a great job blending human traits with the animals' natural abilities."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"RedwallBy: Brian JacquesReviewed by: D. BooyPeriod: P-1Redwall is a book that describes the deeds of one heroic young mouse named Matthias. When Matthias was young he was kindly taken into Redwall Abbey by the Abbot Mortimer. Matthias then turned into the clumsiest novice at Redwall. Matthias seems the last person one would choose to save the abbey from the clutches of the evil rat warlord named Cluny the Scourge. Matthias must find the long-lost sword of the Abbey's Founder, Martin the Warrior. With this sword Matthias must drive away the vermin, just as Martin did many years ago. Miracously, Matthias manages to save the Abbey, and peace is restored in Mossflower Wood.I liked this book because I can relate to how Matthias feels in the beginning of the book. Martin is a young and like me is a person who is always making mistakes. I wish I could be like Matthias and turn myself into someone who can do some real good for people around me. Matthias wanted to be a warrior. \\"If only I could be like Martin the Warrior.\\" Matthias accomplished his goal by showing persistence, intellect, and bravery.The book Redwall has lots of action but still keeps the instilling plot that makes the Redwall series so interesting to read. Matthias doesn't just pick the sword up off the ground. He has to solve riddles, travel to distant places, and battle monsters to regain possession of Martin's legendary sword. I really enjoyed looking at the puzzles given in the book, but not looking at the way Matthias solves them, but trying to solve them myself.\\" It is indeed a riddle, but don't worry Matthias, we will solve it together.\\"My favorite part of the book is about three-quarters through the book. It happens when Matthias is searching for the sword of Martin in an adder nest with two shrews. One of the shrews is killed by the adder, while the other panics at the sight of the huge snake. Matthias then takes up the sword of Martin and hews the vast snake lifeless."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The book Redwall is a very entertaining book.

It does have some bad launage like hell.I enoyed reading the book because you cant put it down. It has a mixtuer of comedy,horror(gore),and action. It is written with such creativity and deatil. Sometimes you get over whelmed with deatil but for the most part it is perfect. You can picture everything perfectly. You get so attached to the charecters that you are scared for them, you laugh with them, you cry when they die, and you smile when they over come obsticles. i would suggest this book to almost anyone."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book is truly amazing! First in the book there is this group of mice that live in a great huge castle, called RedWall. They are sworn to take in anything that is hurt or needs help. Then this very mean army of rats led by the ruthless and brutal rat Clunny. This book is filled twists and turns that you thought that would never happen. I give this book a 5 out of 5. I give it this rating because the story was filled with action and I loved every minute of it. The book also had many characters and kept you thinking. I also rated this book a 5 out of 5 because the book did not keep you waiting it got you right into the action and you stayed there the whole story.Matthias is a very good mouse. I think that he is the Protagonist because he is the leader of RedWalls army. He also is the leader because he really wants to give Clunny a beatin' around. Matthias is also very nice in person but when he is ready for a fight you do not want to be anywhere near him. His personality is also very different because he cares about people even if he really does not like them that much at that specific time. His behavior is also very different at different times when he is around the girl that he likes he is a totally different person then he is by himself or with a friend.This book was truly a treat to read. There were many good scenes that certainly made the book for me. But one of my favorite parts of the book is when Constance the badger kills a rat that is wearing Clunny's clothes while he is gone trying to think of a plan to take over RedWall. Constance comes up with the super bow an arrow and was waiting for the sky to get dark so that the sun would not be In her eyes and then when she shot the arrow she actually hit a rat that was acting like Clunny while he was gone.I think that action lovers would especially like this book, but that is all there really is. I think that a drama or romance reader would really not be into it as much as a person that enjoys action/adventure. But this is not for everyone I think that this book is a little deep for some readers I think that parents should read book with their kids or at least hold them off to read it until the age of 11."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This is a great book. I always sort of ignored the REdwall series but when it was recomended to me, and it was supposed to be very good, I read Redwall, the first one. This bookis just packed with events and plots. Action! Adventure! Sword Fighting! Bad Guys! Battles! A Deadly Snake! Even though it kind of starts out slow in the beginning, DON'T STOP READING IT!!! It's about an evil rat named Cluny the Scourge, who wants Redwall, which is an Abbey, home of many woodland creatures and is surrounded by a red wall. When the Abbot of Redwall refuses to give Cluny Redwall, Cluny gets very angry. He gets a huge army and they start attacking Redwall. Redwall has an advantage and a disadvantage. Their advantage is that they have a badger named Constance who is very strong and kills many rats. Their disadvantage is that they don't have swords like Cluny's army, they have wooden staffs that don't do much damage to the rats. Matthias, who is just a mouse, knows that he will need Martin the Warrior's sword, who is a great mouse that protected Redwall long before and all of Redwall adores him. Matthias's friend, Methuselah, finds a riddle on a wall. It tells Matthias that to get the case for the sword, then he has to go through this secret passage. There, he finds another riddle, if I remember correctly, telling him how to get the actual sword. Soon, Matthias is sent on a wild adventure, facing many dangers, trying to get Martin's sword. This book is now my favorite book and that's saying a lot, because I've read many of them. If you are making the mistake that I made (ignoring the Redwall series), then you should buy this book.

Along the way, he meets many interesting characters and some scary foes, chief among these the villainous Asmosdeus.

It features one great hero and many other ones who all take part in each other's salvation and friendship. Mattias mouse is the hero at the center of it all and he spends the book bringing unlikely allies together while rushing headlong to meet his destiny.Redwall is written, by Brian Jacques, in a manner that clearly fills out the reader's imagination with visuals and sound that leaves no stone unturned. Every word comes to life. While clearly a children's story, the author pulls few punches, so if a parent wishes to coddle their child from the realities and consequences of life, the characters who die in Redwall often meet gruesome ends, will want to steer clear. Stories like this are a good way to introduce children to the life and death that they might face growing up. It also covers the ideas of tolerance, the value of friendship, and standing up to injustice. Redwall is an adventure story more than anything and it is quite exciting while it lasts. It doesn't let up from start to finish, so children are sure to enjoy the swashbuckling adventures of Mattias, Constance Hedgehog, Jess Squirrel, Basil Stag Hare, Warbeak Sparra, and many more. Highly recommended for young and old alike."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Brian Jacques originally wrote Redwall for the students of the Royal Wavertree School for the Blind in Liverpool.

Matthias makes his way from being a clumsy mouse to an adventurous, brave mouse that is seaking the possesions of the great Martin the Warrior, the great warrior of Redwall. And Cluny goes from being the fear in everyone's mind and fire in everyone's eyes to, I think we can beat this guy and, ohhh wow, Cluny the Scurge, I'm so afraid. This well written book, by Brian Jacques, keeps you reeding as he brings you back to the olden' days and makes you feel like you're right there in the action fighting Cluny and Matthias yourself. He makes you feel like you are wondering through the woods just waiting for what will happen next. So pick up this bbok and enter the lives of the animals of Redwall."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is my favorite book in the whole world! And I have taste too. A lot of it.

For that price, I expected FAR nicer quality."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"As a retired middle school English teacher whose favorite genres were Sci-Fi/ Fantasy, I don't know how I nanaged to miss reading Brian Jacques' compelling epic tale about medieval woodland animals -- mice, moles, weasels etc. and their antagonists -- sea rats, foxes, etc. Even the various bird species inhabitanting Mossflower take sides -- sparrows and owls with the protagonists, ravens and magpies with the antagonists.The protagonists and antagonists represent diametrically opposed societal outlooks. In today's partisan politics, one could assign parties, but I won't go there.Redwall is the first of a l-o-n-g series. Although I am currently reading just the third book in his series, Mattimeo, it is apparent that Jacques had begun with an underlying master plan that entailed revealing his intriguing characters, and their relatives through a number of generations.Both sides plot and problem solve, one more cooperatively and by consensus, the other under a dictatorship.Unfortunately, Brian Jacques passed away several years ago. There are a lot of questions that I'd like to ask him about his craft."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book was recomended to me for my 10 year old son by one of his teachers.

He has two children and still lives in Liverpool.One reason why readers like this book is because, the characters, especially Matthias, because he's a true hero.

Although it's first in the series, I read it second, but I enjoyed it just as much. The characters are so funny, and the story is well written. Jacques' style really comes out in his books, this book especially. Charming, this is a story that includes amazing friendships during the hardships of war. The beauty lies in the plot development, showing how true fantasy should be written. I enjoyed the different characters and trying to realate all of the peronalities to my life and people I know. I was really excited when I read this book, and I got up early in the morning and went to bed late, reading as fast as I could in those brief hours before I had to start doing the days things or get to sleep. I'm not embarrassed to say I enjoyed it. Through out the sad parts and the glorious parts, the parts where certain characters showed really bravery (like Matthais, my favorite), and the parts where I just wanted to jump in and help, I felt like a proud parent (in a good way I mean), or rather an amazed bystander, watching as the characters grew to have more meaning.

Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The book Redwall, by Brian Jaques was very exciting. Every page was filled with adventure and action. Jacues made the story come to life. Matthias was very brave and a good main character. I liked this book because it was well written and made me wonder what was going to happen next. I liked Cluny and Matthias, the two main characters, they were enimies. Cluny was a big warrior rat and he had a giant tail. Matthias was a little, brave couragious, mouse that heard stories of redwall's hero Martin and wanted to be just like him. During the war between the people of redwall and Cluny's horde Matthias found Martin's sword and defeated the horde. I loved this book. The only bad thing was I got confused when they would switch from talking about redwall to cluny. Therefore I rate the book with a four star."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"...Then Redwall is for young children. This book is rather tough to describe. It's all about a mouse named Matthias who must save Redwall Abbey from the evil Cluny and his many servants, but you probably knew all that.The characters are all rhodents or small animals of one sort or another. This isn't too much of a problem, and it doesn't really get in the way of character-interaction, which in some cases, is quite excellent.First, let me commend this book on the dialogue of its main villain. He was really something, and I almost found myself cheering for him because of what a keen and calculating mind he was. His servants were all dispicable little vermin, but Cluny himself was really quite a treat.I only wish I could say I found the other characters to be as likable, but to be honest, I thought many of them were a little too \\"nice\\" for me. This is why I reccomend the book for kids. It presents a collection of varied characters and watches them interact.Kids won't pick up on this either, but the book doesn't really have the depth it could. As I said, the book's strong suit is in making new characters, and it does this repeatedly right up until the very end, but the characters bare much the same amount of depth as those seen on your average saturday-morning cartoon show. Each has their own talents, skills and personality, but they aren't changed, or rather, aren't put in situations that would change them. The characters exist, but they don't really \\"develop,\\" like real people do.Perhaps this can be attributed to the fact that they are not real people, but I kept hoping that Jaques would finally get around to developing a character, and he kept introducing several new ones.Still, for all my gripes, it's a pleasant book that contains many direct and indirect moral messages and is pretty darn cute, but once you get past that, and kids WILL be able to get past that, it's good stuff. Anyways, it's better than sitting your kid down in front of a Nintendo, and more involving for the parent. At least in this reviewer's humble opinion."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"These were just coming out when I was a kid of that age and everyone loved them. As a college student, all my friends read these as kids and loved them. Then around mid-high school we all went back and read them for another familiar happy re-read and realized they are really terrible - cliche, terrible writing, fake drama. But kids LOVE them. So it's not good for read aloud as adults will lose their minds. But so meaningful and fun for kids. You do need to be a good reader/book lover for them as many of the characters have accents or dialects that are phonetically spelled with lots of apostrophes and such. This tripped up my brother at a young age. Also you should be able to skim or else kids may get bored with long descriptions of scenery and food unless they are into that."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"As the author ofJUKEBOX HEROI've always loved the Redwall series especially the first novel. I also love their jovial scribe, Brain Jacques. A multi-talented and prolific genius he took the animal story to a totally new level. A gifted and amiable man he knew how to weave a tale better than anyone and touched millions with his fertile and wondrous imagination.I can still remember the moment when I first read about Cluny the Scourge, a despicable bilge rat on his way to overthrow Redwall Abbey with his motley band of vermin. He still stands as one of the best villains ever created. To quote the book:Cluny the Scourge was coming!He was big, and tough; an evil rat with ragged fur and curved jagged teeth. He wore a black eye patch; his eye had been torn out in battle with a pike.Cluny had lost an eye.The pike had lost its life!It still gives me chills. Our hero Matthias, a young clumsy mouse, seems an unlikely choice to defeat Cluny, but we're with him all the way as he slowly turns into a noble and fearless champion over the course of the novel. But Mathias is not alone in his battle. We come to love and care about the many and assorted inhabitants of Redwall. Peaceful by nature they are forced to fight for their very lives as Cluny seeks to storm the abbey's walls. As Cluny's relentless forces raise up their ladders we are standing firm on the battlements, side by side with the brave souls of Redwall tossing stones and shooting arrows to turn back the onslaught.Needless to say, this book holds a very special place in my heart. I envy anyone who gets to read it for the first time. Sadly, Brain Jacques is no longer with us, but he lives on in his many books and in the hearts of his readers. He died of a heart attack on the 5 February, 2011. I can't help imagining as the last breath left the body of this kind and generous man that he wasn't alone. Matthias was there excitedly tugging on his arm saying, \\"C'mon, let's go! It's time for another adventure.\\""},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"\\"The Tales of Redwall\\" (all books) are exactly that - Tales. This is quite different from Fantasy in my opinion. They are very nice and entertaining, but just don't have enough depth (see more bellow). They get solid 4 star rating for been tales about very likable characters having thrilling adventures. The only thing I found missing is a morale in these stories. Evil is defeated each time, but not punished and typically to a simple bad luck. A great tale ought to teach you something, other than reading skills. So I took one star out for that.On the other hand good fantasy is not about teaching, but escaping to an alternative, believable reality. The cornerstones are: solid ground rules, \\"realism\\", character development and shades of gray. Thick plot, adventures, drama and humor are the bricks and mortar. Song of Ice and Fire would be a good example or Tiffany Aching stories for the younger crowd.The world of Redwall is full of logical holes - time, size and other animals, including humans among the main opened questions. The characters have no development - they gain no skills or wisdom, don't change opinions or have any doubts. Everything is pictured in white and black colors only. Just 3 of 4 characters among the hundreds are not clearly good or evil. Almost each story is spinning around the same stuff - evil vermin horde battling good furry creatures.The adventures are good, plenty of heroes and villains chasing each other on the land, sea and through the tunnels, fighting each other one to one and with the armies behind. There is some level of death and brutality, but nothing a 10 year old couldn't handle. There isn't much humor or witticism, but there are plenty of moments where you'll smile or have the wet eyes, when friends reunite or escape a dire peril.So, overall this book is recommended to young adults and recommend with some caution to everyone else - get your expectations right and you might enjoy it too. I did."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I loved this book. It was exciting and interesting. You might like this book if you like fantasy or action animal stories. There is a lot of fighting so it might not be good for little kids."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Along with the Harry Potter books, this is one of the best books I have ever read.

Matthias quests for the sword of Martin the Warrior, the founder of Redwall Abbey.Martin's sword is rumored to have magical powers, the power to defeat any enemy! Although it has no power of it's own, it brings bravery to the entire Abbey.

When I'm reading, I can actually feel what's happening, like I'm there watching it happen. I will read for hours, not wanting the book to end. I know this'll sound strange, but when I'm done with the book I feel a terrible sadness, I'll cry even, because suddenly the magic of the words will vanish. I also feel this horrible despairing feeling because I realize that I'm really not there, watching and helping the wonderful characters. I want to be there so badly, that I just start sobbing myself silly. When I'm reading, I feel like I'm living in two worlds; the first is wonderful Mossflower, or the Abbey, or Salamandastron, and second is the vague feeling of the real world around me. You may be surprised that a fifth grader can feel this emotion, but it happens to me all the time. I truly love these books, and I encourage everyone to read them, because even though the perfectly woven tale will end, the only way it can end is for you to start at the beginning. :-) Lail"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I read this one after my grandsons recommened it. I am glad they pointed me in it's direction! This is a very well written fantasy and reminds me somewhat of \\"Wind in the Willows.\\" The complete cast of characters is of course animals, with a Medieval setting. This is an easy read which seemingly captivates readers of all ages. I do a lot of teaching and it seems as if half the kids I see in my classes have one of the books of this series tucked in their backpacks or under their arms. This is a good thing and there are certainly worse books they could be cutting their teeth on. There has been some comments as to the violence found here and there throughout the books, but I found it pretty tame compaired to the evening news or most of the vidio games. Character developement is good and the story moves right along, making it a page turner. I highly recommend this one to kids of all ages."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. Redwall is a peaceful animal village that is beautiful and very elegant. The animals that inhabit it are ethical forest creatures.The main character is Matthis, an adventurous, young, and spirited orphan, left at the Redwall entrance. He is now, still young, but quite mature for his age. He has become one of the pack. Full of morales, and caring. Now, Cluny the Scrouge, a rat known for being terrible and for taking over villages, is trying to take over Redwall. Since everyone in Redwall is refusing to surrender, they are forced to fight a awr with Cluny, even though it is against their ways. A part that I thought was quite descriptive and exciting was when Mathias and Guosim, a shreww friend of Matthias', fight the adder for possesion of Martin the Warriors' sword. The adder is a legendary snake, foe of all. He is known as &quot;Asmodeus&quot;, for the sound thta he makes. Asmodeus is huge, and legendarily known for his viciousness and poisoness fangs. I can't tell you who succeeds, though. The brutality of war even affected Cluny. He literally went mad. I'd describe this book as adventurous and eventful. The characters and plot are unbelievable. Although the plot is, at times difficult to follow, it is riviting at its higher points. I'd recommend this book for anyone who's read Any other Brian Jacques books."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is awesome. It has a great plot, has cool action scenes and it has good dialog.I wish I could give this book 10 stars instead of 5.I recommend this book for ages 9 and older because there is blood and some profanity.If you don't have this book then get it."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"You're looking for books to recommend to your youngest relatives - books that, you hope, will give them the same addiction to reading that has brought you so much enjoyment and value. But you know that kids today have different tastes, concerns, and outlooks than you in your formative decade. What to offer?Be VERY careful before you offer them this book or its sequels. You can see by other reviews that Brian Jacques has garnered lots of enthusiastic fans. But there are some things that you, a doting parent, grandparent, or uncle or aunt, should know.First, this is a violent book. There are a number of deaths, some quite awful. Jacques does not dwell on them, but he describes them vividly. Some are bad enough to cause shudders in some kids below the teens, and could play into the fears of some sensitive ones -- like when the fox backs into the giant snake in the dark, or when the brave defenders stop the invaders who are tunneling in by pouring big vats of boiling water down the hole to boil them, and then force the tunnel to collapse on them, burying them. There's an explicitly described, cold-blooded murder by strangulation. And there are many scenes of brutal cruelty, when sympathetic characters are beaten, clawed, and humiliated.Just because these things happen in a beautifully pastoral setting among cute woodland animals doesn't mean they aren't violent and won't have an effect on the readers' imaginations.Second, I was irked throughout by problems of scale. Jacques treats all characters and settings as if they were the same size. You have mice working alongside a squirrel, a hedgehog, and a badger. But how can that be? It's as if cocker spaniels stood alongside a horse, an elephant, and a tyrranosaurus rex -- that's how much bigger badgers are than mice. One other reviewer noted this, and the lack of humans. The mice inhabit an Abbey which seems to be built to human scale -- or is it? Because the mice manage to operate the doors and use the stairs, but then, so does the badger, who's 100 times as large. There's a Church of St. Ninian (so it must be C of E!) but it's occupied only by churchmice until the rats take it over. They, too, manage the doors and locks -- how?In the other talking-animal books we love, scale is dealt with explicitly. In Walter R. Brooks's Freddy the Pig series, the spiders take care to keep out from underfoot, and small animals explicitly ride on big ones, etc. Scale is admitted and dealt with. In Watership Down, the rabbits are rabbit-sized, and other things in the world are their proper sizes too.In REDWALL, things implicitly grow and shrink to be whatever size suits the animal and the needs of the plot. And that is simply sloppy. It makes it quite evident that Jacques wants to tell a tale of heroic fantasy among people, but he also wants to cloak that tale in the sheep's clothing of a cute animal story.And that brings me to my final caution, the morality of the tale, or its lack thereof. It seems to me that Jacques has no particular moral stance or concern. He just wants to tell an exciting story with sympathetic good guys beating the snot out of unsympathetic bad ones. And he does, fairly effectively. But the only protagonist who even considers the possibility of nonviolent resolutions, the Abbot mouse, does so only for about 10 seconds, and then turns everything over to his military captains to run the show. There are two foxes who delight in double-dealing, and you might say there is a moral in that both end up brutally dead, but there's no connection between their perfidy and their deaths. One gets caught and is killed by the baddies, the other just has the bad luck to run into that snake. The only lesson to be drawn is that if you want to play both sides of the street, be more careful.There are many sub-plots, and every one of them that I can recall is resolved through force or trickery. Matthias the Mouse is a Hero because he's a Hero, not by any virtue of a learning process; he never doubts himself or questions the rightness of what he does.All that said, this is fair page-turning entertainment for a well-balanced child with a healthy understanding of the difference between reality and fantasy."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"There are very few series, literary or not, that one should devote a good deal of ones time too. These are the Star Wars Trilogy, the Indiana Jones Trilogy, Lord of the Rings, this new Harry Potter deal looks promising, and finally the entire Redwall series to date. Never before have I seen such an interesting and promising premise behind a novel, and never have I seen a series of books more original, addicting, and thought provoking as these. And Redwall is the beginning of it all. I had Redwall read to me when I was younger, and I found it so interesting that I could identify better with a freaking mouse than with any other novel character I had ever read, or heard before. Jacques style is not hampered by a &quot;target audience,&quot; nor do I feel he writes with one in mind, this is why for many years I have continued to read and enjoy the series, and I am guessing I will continue to read the Redwall series either until Jacques stops writing them, or my eyes fall out. Whichever comes first."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Those readers who love intricate fantasy worlds and complicatedplots, with rollicking good action, will enjoy this and any of theseveral &quot;Redwall&quot; books by Brian Jacques. To describe the main storyline sounds almost silly. Mice and other woodland creatures living in an abbey must protect themselves from the evil creatures, usually weasels and ferrets, who would take over their riches. The characters are richly drawn, and the action is at times intense. Sometimes a character dies, sometimes a character allows the bent for revenge to transform them into less than good--just like in real life.Brian Jacques creates intricate plots and subplots, but always keeps the main action moving forward. He delights readers with his dialects and language variants of some of the creatures, most noteably the moles and sparrows. The peculiar speech of these characters is a challenge to anyone who reads this aloud, but my kids, who are now 10 and 14, can't get enough of these books for family reading time. If you haven't discovered the world of Redwall, it's time you did!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"While waiting for the latest (4th) edition in the Harry Potter saga, I started reading Redwall to my 6 year old at bed time. I would highly recommend it! While I don't think this story is quite as imaginative &amp; spectacular as those penned by Rowland, Jacques still writes a compelling tale. His command of English prose is formidable, and his plot line is very tight and well-developed. In my opinion, he also does a better job of character development than Rowland does in the Harry Potter series too. Another plus, is that the story actually extolls some good moral virtues. So while it's definitely not Harry Potter it is still an excellent story, and one that I highly recommend. My son loved it, and truth be known, so did I! If the proof is in the pudding, then know that we liked it enough to purchase the next few books in the series, and my son is already mentioning that he wants to pick up with those when we finish with &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Fans of Watership Down and heroic tales of battles and quests will be intrigued with the unique world of personified animals that Brian Jacques has created. Bizarre but equally entrancing, Redwall will captivate readers and keep them prisoner until the very end. The book opens with a description of Redwall Abbey which is owned by an order of monk-like mice and an introduction to Matthias, a clumsy, awkward, \\"brother-in-training.\\" Matthias, Father Abbot, and the other brothers have lived in relative peace for many long years, providing shelter and care to local woodland residents and all those in need. This humble but satisfying way of life is threatened one summer night when Matthias first lays eyes upon the legendary warlord, Cluny the Scourge, and his horde of rats ready to plunder and pillage. Where these villainous rats have come from is unknown but it is quite clear that Cluny has his one eye set upon claiming Redwall as his stronghold. All that stands between the death and destruction of the entire Mossflower region is the monastery brothers and sisters. Now these practitioners of mercy, healing, and love must become skilled defenders of their home.Young Matthias experiences a tremendous transformation from an orphaned immature mouse to a natural born leader and developing warrior. To save Redwall from its invaders he embarks on a quest to find the lost sword of Martin the Warrior, a founder of their abbey. During his search he discovers his past and destiny, learning valuable lessons of life, honor, and what truly lies in a warrior's heart along the way. Join the mice and their companions as they encounter new friends and enemies during their struggle with the terrible Cluny the Scourge. Redwall is a strangely imaginative and enchanting story that will change your views on furry rodents forever."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is the best book I have ever read.If you liked the Harry Potter series you will love this series.

His books combine friendship, fun, happiness, anger, hope, and everything else into one adventure story. His talent in being able to do this without losing the reader -ever- is truly astounding!!!In this unique book, a young, somewhat awkward mouse named Matthias learns how to be a true warrior and, through riddles and mysteries, finds that he is to take the place of the legendary founder and warrior of Redwall Abbey.

A battle between mice and rats may sound a little corny at first but once you start reading you'll be hooked.

I strongly recommend this series for fantasy lovers everywhere!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I started reading the Redwall series just a short time ago and I must admit that I am completely hooked. For anyone who enjoys classic storytelling in a fantasy theme, this series is a gem.Yes, it is violent...there are battles, characters die, villains are truly villainous...both to the good and to their own followers. The violence might disturb some (particularly younger children who have not been exposed to the realities of war, death, and evil), but on the whole I found it to be very realistic, which is probably why it is not especially suitable for younger children. Good and evil are mostly treated in a black and white manner, but there is just enough gray to make it believable. And, of course, Good always wins out in the end...but at a realistic cost. Characters you love die horrible deaths at the hands of the villains, or in sacrificing for others.There is absolutely no inclusion of any sort of sexual content whatsoever, beyond the fact that there are families, babies, and so forth...it is completely innocent in that way. Otherwise, there is no candy coating to how depraved the truly evil can be, nor to how difficult true courage and bravery are.I feel the primary \\"moral\\" of the Redwall series is this: Peace and Happiness for individuals or a community requires vigilant protection and Good people must oftentimes act to preserve their bounty from those who would destroy it by force.Beyond the philosophical aspects of the writing, the detail and consistency of behavior, mannerisms, and speech in each of the characters is delightful. As one progresses through the series, it becomes apparent that there are no humans involved...the buildings, ships, crafts...everything is done by the animals themselves, to their scale. Whether or not there are humans elsewhere, that is unclear, but is rather beside the point of the stories. No, these animals don't look like people...a badger is a badger, a mouse is a mouse, a sparrow is a sparrow...but they think like we do, they scheme, they go on adventures, and they live fascinating or mundane lives...all in a world where things are just a little bit magical.Various species have dialects and some are so entertaining that it is hard to not attempt to read passages out loud just for the sheer joy of how the words sound to the ear. Knowledge of the many accents of Britain will help in this and oftentimes the accents imply a type of social stereotype to a character. Coupled with the natural behaviors and temperaments of the real world animals, this is quite a fascinating set of characters Jacques has created and it is full of humor.This truly is classic storytelling at its universal best."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The book Redwall by Brian Jacques is a very exciting story.

I was pretty much a fan of Howard, Moorcock, and other assorted fantasy writers that generally have adult-themed stories. I mistakenly assumed that Redwall would not appeal to me. Thank goodness I couldn't resist picking up a used copy of Redwall.This first in a wonderfully long series really captures your imagination and brings you into this intricate and detailed world of squirrels, otters, owls, stoats (still don't know what sort of creature this is!?!), ferrets, foxes, and of course rats and mice.Matthias' and his journey to find his purpose at Redwall is well worth the read. Redwall is a place of great beauty, happiness, and danger mixed with the appropriate dose of tragedy...not so unlike our own world.Adult readers will find themselves enjoying Redwall and the volumes that follow, because they are filled with so much genuine humanity. How strange that we can learn so much about the good in humanity from the smallest of woodland creatures.And of course there are the many wonderfully imaginative foods and dishes that the denizens of Redwall are forever feasting upon.

It is both serious and adventurous, and humerous at the same time. It is abut a young mouse, Matthias, and all his fellow companions at Redwall Abbey. Their all-time opposite, and mortal enemy is Cluny the scourge and his horde. Over and over again they clash in battle after battle. All through the book Matthias completes myriads of tasks from attempting to capture Redwall's legendary sword from Asmodeus, the giant adder,to defending Redwall against Cluny.Along the way there are an uncountable number of creatures, all with their unique character traits and voices. There is a whole lot of suspense in this story. The whole plot is stuffed to the brim with climaxes, the storyline hardly ever slows down. It is probably the hardest book to set down in the middle (for me at least) that I have ever read. Also, in this book they solve one humungus puzzle, but there's no solving involved for you, so that's not anything to be afraid of if you don't like puzzles. The best part of the book for me was the last battle. I can't tell you who won the final battle but I'll tell you one thing, it's extremely exciting and witty.Another book that has something to do with this book is The Watsons Go To Birmingham-1968.

I loved these books around her age, and actually found myself excited as I went and got these books out of storage from my box of childhood books. I will probably start reading these to my seven year old son as soon as we finish the Harry Potter series. I hope my friends step daughter gets as hooked on them as I did."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book was awesome! It had so much suspense that I couldn't put it down for the 1 1/2 days I spent to finish it. The descriptions of the animals, their emotions, the humor, the peaceful creatures of Redwall vs. the evil murderer Cluny the Scourge! I loved everything about this book. It is a bit sad in some parts, but it couldn't be exciting without them. I had to look up a few words in the dictionary, like sibilant.(Which means hissing sounds.) This book has a bit of everything: fantasy, mystery, the works. i can't wait to read the next 21 in the series!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I bought a used copy of this book (here on Amazon) a few weeks ago, and I wasn't able to get into it. Now, to clarify: I am a 22 year old English major who loves fantasy. I tried reading it when I was much younger, and could not emerse myself into the series or really enjoy it. As a young adult, I figured that giving the series a second go would be prudent. My roommate, who has great taste, swears by Redwall so I picked up the first book and read it from cover to cover. But I did have to force myself: this is clearly a children's chapter book. While I see why people love the series and why it's lasted the test of time, I wouldn't recommend it to readers over 15 or so. The sentences are very short and direct, with simple language and rather rudimentary elements. Characters are very basic, and the plot is predictable.However, I would very much recommend the book for young readers. It is creative in the same way that NIMH was creative (you could almost think of Redwall as being a history before NIMH, in a way), and has a few funny moments. My niece recently discovered Arthurian stories, and is eight, so I'll be giving her my copy."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Brian Jacques' books are great for any age but especially to encourage a child to read more than spend time with computer or video games. Did this with my girls and moved on to grandchildren and nephews and nieces. That's why this new copy was bought, a gift.Redwall (Redwall, Book 1)"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Who says that I am dead knows nought at all. I - am that is, two mice within Redwall. The Warrior sleeps 'twixt Hall and Cavern Hole. I - am that is, take on my mighty role. This is only the first part of the poem Matthias and Methuselah found in Great Hall. I really enjoyed the book. I can positively say that Cluny is one of the best bad guys ever excepting the Urgan Nagru from the redwall book The Bellmaker. In reading the redwall books I noticed that I became attached to the good guy characters. When some of them died I cried, and of course I got angry at the bad guys. I also watched the PBS show on Redwall. I suggest that before you watch the shows through youtube, you should read the book. It was the start of the Summer of the Late Rose. This sentence is the start of one of the cover pages. I would have to say besides The Bellmaker this is my favorite book. I have not listened to the audio book yet but I have read the book. Of course at one point Matthias does get lost, that's when he meets Silent Sam. All of the characters are really good.

The characters come alive and their world is fascinating. Makes one wonder what goes on in the underbrush as you stroll along a wooded trail. Highly recommend reading."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I loved this book! I was very disappointed when it was over. There was a lot of action, because there were many little battles. It was a real cliffhanger, because every chapter it would change characters.The story starts out, with a small, clumsy mouse named Matthias. He is carrying a basket full of hazelnuts, and he's looking at the sky. All of a sudden, he is caught daydreaming, he trips spilling the nuts, rolling down the hill, and bumps into the Abbot (Redwall Abbey's leader). Timidly and quickly, Matthias starts to gather the nuts. The Abbot lends his hand in helping the novice pick up the spilled basket of nuts.Meanwhile, Cluny and his army of rats are out trying to find a place to stay. They stop at a place called St. Ninians Church, where John Churchmouse and his family live. Fortunately, they are at the Abbey. In the morning, Cluny orders his horde to go into the woods and find soldiers willing to fight for Cluny. He also said that if they refuse to join, threaten them with death.Cluny goes to Redwall, and tries to cut a deal with the Abbot. Surrender or lose and be a slave under the rule of Cluny. The Abbot will have none of it. He says he would rather die than surrender to Cluny the Scourge. Cluny says the Abbot will be granted his wish.The strategizing is on. Deceit and war lie ahead, for both armies. The first battle goes to the Abbot, but the war has just started.READ THIS BOOK!!![...]"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall, by Brian Jacques is about a group of peaceful mice and woodland creatures that get attacked by an evil rat called Cluny the Scourge. One of the main characters is a mouse named Matthias. Matthias really looks up to a mouse called Martin the Warrior. Matthias wants to find Martin's tomb and sword.There are two plots in this book. One is where Matthias goes through all his adventures trying to find Martin's sword. Another is at Redwall (where the mice live) when Cluny attacks it. The setting is at Redwall, which is in a place called Mossflower Wood. The theme is to be brave and never give up.I really liked Redwall because it's very adventurous. When you read this, you won't want to put the book down!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is obviously the best book in the series. Even after or the sequels and prequels, it is still the most amazing one. The plot is crafty, the badguy, Cluny the Scourge, is the most evil one of all the villains, and the hero, Mattathias, is second best hero in the series (Martin being the coolest). This is the best of all of them."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"If you're looking for a story about cute animals inviting each other to tea, this isn't quite what you want. But if you want to read a high adventure with lots of action, puzzles, truly evil bad guys and a different setting (along with a feast or two), then this book is for you. It just happens to also be a story about anthropomorphic animals, but that usually takes a back seat to the fantasy setting.The hero of the story is a young and adventuresome mouse named Matthias. Raised as an orphan among the pacifist monk mice of Redwall Abbey, Matthias dreams of following in the legendary footsteps of Martin the Warrior. Soon, however, the opportunity is thrust upon him, as the notorious rat names Cluny the Scourge has brought his horde of rats, weasels, ferrets, and stoats to attack Redwall! Fortunately, Matthias taps into unknown reserves of bravery, intelligence, and leadership skills to help the friendly animals of the forest (mice, badgers, moles, etc.) to defend Redwall from this threat. With the help of the ancient mouse Methuselah, Matthias tracks down the burial place of Martin, along with recovering Martin's legendary shield and, more importantly, his sword. Along the way, Matthias befriends a flock of Sparra (sparrows) and an army of guerrilla shrews, meets the eccentric hare Basil, and must confront the deadly snake Asmodeus. Meanwhile, Cluny the Scourge hatches plot after plot to try and claim the fortress-like Redwall for his own, all while ruthlessly driving his army and having strange dreams about a dark mouse warrior he must inevitably face.While it is important to remember that this book is, in the end, about animals acting like humans, that is a surprisingly small part of the overall picture Jacques paints. Rather, it is a high fantasy that happens to involve animals. It does start out slowly, but picks up to \\"can't put it down\\" speed quickly enough. Not only is the story itself compelling and the characters vibrant, the language and imagery used is refreshingly unique. It does have the rare violent scene (it is war, after all), but it's overall a great read. Besides, with seventeen plus sequels (and more likely on the way), this is a great introduction to what is likely a rich world that will keep readers entertained for years to come."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The tale of a struggle between good and evil, we have all read some book about that. Yet Redwall delivers this battle with a great fairy tale like sense. The story is heart warming and although a little odd at first you couldn't imagine Redwall without its characters being animals. This book is worth the read just for the originality and its feel good plot, not to mention Jacques talent for writing an excellent book."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is the story of a mouse. This mouse is a novice at the renowned Abbey of Redwall. Orphaned at an early age, Matthias has been taken in by the Abbot and his company. As mice go Matthias is a young mouse who seems to have a peculiar knack for tripping over his too-large sandals. Despite his unlikely exterior, his heart holds a yearning for adventure beyond what the Abbey can hold. The mice there are the peaceful kind; they advise him that his need for adventure will dissipate with time. Matthias is less than convinced.Not far outside the thick abbey walls an unknown enemy lurks. Cluny the Scourge draws ever closer a gian one-eyed monster of a rat draws ever closer. One appetite consumes his entire being: unbridled greed. He and his army ride a commmandeered hay-court which overturns not far from the abbey walls.The residents of the abbey soon discover the presence of Cluny and his army, and both sides prepare for war. Young Matthias proves to be a military prodigy and takes a role as one of the captains of the Abbey forces. Natthias draws strength from the legend of Martin the Warrior, the founder of Redwall and a brilliant soldier. In a hope to ensure victory for his side, Matthias and a new friend, Cornflower, set forth on a quest to return Martin's sword to the abbey. They embark on a riddle-strewn quest through the heart of the abbey to recover the sword. In their absence the rats seem to be gaining ground.Brian Jaques enjoys his trade and his writing is easily understood, but intirguing none-the-less. I found myself lost in the words and the imagery of the story, coming up for air less and less often. This book is an easy read and should be suitable for audiecnes of all ages, but more specifically for the young at heart."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"A Review by KyleRats are horrible creatures. They most certainly are the most horrible thing that could have happened to the peace loving mice of Redwall. Cluny the most feared rat in all the land, with his ruthless horde is feared by all. Cluny seeks to take over Redwall to use those who live the invasion as slaves to gather food for his growing horde. Cluny has not left any fort still standing in the past, but maybe Cluny and his horde have finally met their match, the mice of Redwall.Some things I really liked about the book is how the author kept me guessing though out the whole entire book as to what was going to happen next. There were quite a lot of characters, which made it fun to read. Each character had his or her important role in the book at some time. This means lots of characters means lots of things that can go wrong and make it harder for the main character or easier. I don't think it got too much easier for the main character. Some other things I liked was that the main character lost something very valuable to him at the end of the book. It was the main characters father figure.I recommend this book to anyone who really enjoys an adventure book. Also to a person who likes a good read. This book is a book I know I will be reading even more."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"A truly great book. This is a book that thinks out of the fantasy premise. All the bases for a classic tale. This is a must if you have read and enjoyed another book in the series. The entire book nicely flows and keeps you flipping the pages as fast as you can. If you like a good fantasy then this is a book you will enjoy."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The book I am reading is Redwall. It's a very good book about mice in a stronghold fort called Redwall Abby. There is a hoard of rats that want to capture Redwall. A young mouse comes to the Abby. His name is Matthias. He studies the legend of Martin the Warrior who lived a long time ago.Brian Jacques is an excellent writer and Redwall is an awesome book. Brian Jacques puts lots of detail into the description of his characters. He describes Shadow's voice as \\"a whisper of wet silk across a smooth slate.\\" Asmodeus had a voice like \\"dry leaves rustling.\\" The names of his characters use vocabulary that describes them perfectly. For example, Cluny the Scourge is the Warlord with a very long tail like a whip and a poisonous barb on the tip.. Scourge means a lash, a whip, an affliction sent for punishment, to harass. Abbot Mortimer is the only Redwall defender to die from the enemy's attack and mort means death.The names of Cluny's captains are also very descriptive. Cheesetheif probably stole cheese. Frog blood probably spilled the blood of a frog. Redtooth got a bloody tooth. Fangburns fangs probably hurt from chewing on a lit cigarette. Skullface and Scrag sound like they look kind of skinny. Ragear sounds like his ear is damaged.Brian Jacques keeps the reader going in suspense about Cluny defeating the Abby. His attacks get more and more severe. The defenders are smart, wise and skilled. The archers never miss, it's hard for them to miss. They even shot Warbeak down by accident when they were just trying to scare the sparrows off to save Jess. Jess was looking for the sword up on the roof.Warbeak's Mother knows where to find Martin's sword. The 2nd part of the book is called the Quest. Methulsa has all the old writings and knows things Matthias does not. He and Matthias follow clues to solve the riddle of what happened to Martin's sword.Redwall is not just your usual book with a story and a plot. It has something for everybody.

If I had to find some problem with the book (there aren't many) I would have to say I disliked the fact that all the good animals were TOTALLY good and all the bad animals were TOTALLY bad, this left no inbetween and it is sometimes these grey areas that make a story interesting.

Then one day, your home is attacked by the army of Cluny the Scourge, a one-eyed rat who plans on taking over Redwall Abbey. This is what happens to Matthias, a young mouse who must now go to find the only hope for Redwall Abbey, the legendary sword of Martin the Warrior.The story is about Matthias, a young mouse who dreams of adventure who lives in Redwall Abbey, a refuge for animal in need. Because he dreams of adventure, Matthias is not quite satisfied with a peaceful life, but is brought to patience with it. One day though, the evil one-eyed rat, Cluny the Scourge, launches his evil army to seize Redwall. Now Matthias must find Redwall Abbey's only hope to save their home, the legendary sword of Martin the Warrior. The title of the book, Redwall, is the home of Matthias who must save it.The pacing of this book a somewhere between medium and fast. The author's craft is quite good, because the way he writes is not only capturing, but he is careful to make sure there is no conflict with religion, so it has no impact on a Christian perspective. This book is part of a series of the same genre and the same author. I don't really have any opinions of the book, other then it was good, but I do recommend this book to fantasy and adventure lovers."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"BUY the unabridged audio for this and you will NEVER regret it. Brian reads it himself and he has every character voice down pat because they were all stuck in his head for so many years. His history in the BBC also makes his voice in mesmerizing and enchanting so much that you will have a hard time turning it off. You need to buy the Redwall series because the story plays out over a few chronicles so do not just buy the first in the series get the first three. It is a great pick for those who would like more adventure with less magic. It takes place with woodland creatures and could also be considered a coming of age story.RICH CHICKS reviews specializes in media that is purchased by women.

I read many of the redwall series while I was in middle school and I still enjoyed reading it. I love adventure books and these are all great adventure books. The characters being rodents is a little wierd but creates an interesting picture for your imagination. I sometimes wish they would make movies, obviously cartoons out of these movies to go along with them but that would take away from the amazing picture you develop in your mind. This is one of my favorite Redwall books and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"To start things off I would like to be genuinely honest and say that I am not an avid reader by any means, not because I don't love to read, but because many books fail to capture my attention. Once in a while a book will fall into my lap that can get me to spend my Friday night on my couch, something that not even the best movie or video game has ever accomplished. Redwall, I will say is one of those books, like Harry Potter, like The Golden Compass, and like The Lord of the Rings books that is very easy to fall in love with and not be able to put down.The previous reviewer, while showing some likeness for the book stated that the book was too gruesome at some points. While I noticed some of this in the book, I would hardly say it is nearly as bad as described and I would like to add that the book would not have been able to achieve the level of prestige it has gotten were it not for these fight scenes. Although it is pointed out that this would only be a problem for children, it is easy to see why that is a pointless thing to say. The book is 416 pages long and unless your child is young Einstein II it is not geared towards children. Would you take your child to see an R rated movie when they are 12? Probably not, which is the same idea as letting them read this book, and it hardly achieves what I would call a PG-13 rating by any standards. The second thing I would like people reading David's review to understand, and while the review he wrote is much appreciated it seems to have one more flaw. The scale of the book seems to be the main \\"knock\\" on it because in other stories we all know and love the scale is different? Just because Jacques did not go into great detail about why the badger is the same size as the rats and the mice does not mean it was done sloppily or without any thought. I for one don't think the book would have been quite the same if the badger was so big it could not fit inside the castle to protect Redwall. Well maybe you can argue that different animals could have been used in place of the badger that is more mouse and rat size. I don't think however that it would have been the same if a guinea pig or hamster were protecting Redwall, nor do I think he would have been able to convince me that they are capable of doing an even adequate job. The scale Jacques used was for good reason, and to say that it took away from the book or was sloppily done is simply incorrect. On top of that, the book is a fantasy book with talking animals that are capable of constructing castles, plotting attacks, and solving riddles, why is it so inconceivable that the scale used for this book makes most of the animals approximately the same size? It is not bad thinking to make the scale this way in comparison to other fantasy books, it is simply different, and as far as I'm concerned, if you really think about it, it makes sense.It seems as I look at other reviews, many people shared the same passion for this book that I had. Others argued flaws that they obviously haven't thought too much about and are easily refutable. Why didn't some of Cluny's army leave him to go join the mice of Redwall? Well why didn't the German's just come join us during World War II since they knew what Hitler was doing was wrong? Why didn't one of the Japanese come warn us that they were coming to bomb us at Perl Harbor? As well as this, I really doubt that the mice would have taken in a rat from Cluny's army, and given him full trust and responsibility with weaponry inside Redwall.So if you have come to Amazon looking for a good book to read, just read some of the other 608 five star reviews that were written in favor of this book, as well as 99 four star reviews. Any of those people who rated the book any lower I am open to responses as to why this book is not exceptional. The book contains a character to cheer for, a likable cast of characters as well as many to hate, a fun story plot, an outstanding writing technique by Brian Jacques, a lot of action and fighting, riddles to be solved, a hero to be born, and when you're done reading it, eleven more books in the series to read."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"As owners of the book and cassette tape versions, we were a bit confused by the packaging of the Audio CD version when it arrived. We wanted the whole book, but the packaging is all labeled \\"Book One: The Wall\\", when all familiar with this work know that \\"The Wall\\" is just the first third of the \\"book\\", the other two sections being \\"The Quest\\", and \\"The Warrior\\". This caused us concern until my son investigated it further. He saw that the CD version was 10 hours 43 minutes long, just like his cassette tape version, and found that the last CD started with chapter 8 of \\"The Warrior\\".Since all the reviews, seem to be of the book and not this audio CD version, I thought I would write this to spare others the minutes to hours of concern about the completeness of their purchase. It is all there. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"My older boys both read Redwall and many other books in the series growing up, particularly between 4th and 8th grade. Met the author at a bookstore in Pa. Now my 9 year old was reluctant to read them because as a 6 year old he was put off by the cartoon version he once saw on PBS. So I bought this for his birthday and played it for him in the car and he quickly got into it and now wants to read all the rest on his own.The production is well done, its fun hearing the voices characterized appropriately. I recommend the audio book highly, and the series as well."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book is an interesting story about a young mouse [Matthias] defending his home [Redwall Abbey] against a hoard of rats who want to capture Redwall. Matthias must solve mysterious riddles, battle many rats, befriend allies, and uncover the legendary sword of Martin the Warrior. Will he be able to drive the evil rats out of Mossflower? Buy the book to find out."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book is the first volume in a long series of books which I consider to be the best series I've ever read. It centers around the adventures of a clumsy, unsure young mouse called Matthias. He is forced to grow up abruptly with the arrival of Cluny the Scourge, a rat warlord who commands vast armies of murderous rats, ferrets, stoats, and weasels. Cluny's aim is to conquer the immense Redwall Abbey, which is Matthias's home. However, the Abbey's inhabitants are peaceful creatures, most of whom have never handled a weapon in their lives. The Abbey dwellers manage to keep Cluny at bay, but their skills are too poor to ward him off for too long. Meanwhile, Matthias has gone in search of a legendary sword that once belonged to the famous mouse warrior, Martin. He hopes to use the weapon to defeat Cluny's infamous army and save Redwall. Helped by different friends along the way, he finally discovers the sword's location, but is unprepared for the grave danger he stumbles across while searching for the sword... This book introduces the reader to Redwall, one of the best children's book series ever written. I recommend the book (and the rest of the series) strongly if one is looking for a creative plot with many twists."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I got this book from a garage sale (I despise the people who sold it; I never will)I am a good reader, and am constantly looking for books. This series was recommeneded to me by a friend, but in the library it was completely checked out. That obviously meant people wanted to read it (it's not the kind for a book-report assignment), so the second I saw it I bought it. I finished it in two days (a record over my reading of Harry Potter) but read it over and over again. Then when I went on holiday I took it with me. It was one of the two english books I had with me. I read it six times.The plot-line of this book is amazing. It doesn't lag or speed, when it's sad you cry (at least I did) and when it's happy you smile. Brian Jaques (did you know it's said Jakes?) keeps you in the palm of his hand, until the very end.The only noticeable bad thing in this book is that the good characters are REALLY, REALLY good, and the bad ones are HORRID. Otherwise, this book is perfect.I also recommend this book to the people who would rather play nintendo, or whatever, rather than read. This book is gripping, and has more action than any nintendo game.The descriptions are so good you don't have to strain your mind to visualise the scenes. Also, this book has many Wordmaster words -8th grade-(something that other reviewers complained about, I noticed) which I have learned partly by rereading this book.Good luck and read this book!!!!Also read the rest of the series, and THE GOLDEN COMPASS and SABRIEL"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book portrays an epic tale of a young mouse trying to be someone. This mouse is clumsy and is often found tripping over himself. When a ravenous bend of rats shows up on the scene, he does all within his power to save Redwall. Hiya! I've read all the books in the series and enjoyed them all very much. Jacques naturally follows in the path of some of the greatest fantasy writers from the twentieth century such as JRR Tolkein and many others. A great book children of all ages and even adults with a sense of adventure and enough courage to possibly be seen reading a childrens book. I've found myself curled up in an easy chair on lazy Saturdays reading it. Redwall is a story that I will always remember and read again and again."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The peaceful mice and woodland creatures of Redwall Abbey find themselves suddenly, without provocaton, under siege. The enemy wants not only their lives, but their sacred abbey itself--to convert into a fortress for murder and carmage in the surrounding Mossflower Wood. Who can repel the vicious, audacious leader of the rat pack, Cluny the Scourge, (so named because he uses his long tail as a weapon)? Bigger than life and twice as evil, he uses his one eye and whip-like tail to convert rats and other lowlife animals into his soldiers/slaves for his personal reign of horror.If only the ancient hero of the abbey, Martin the Warrior, could return to life--HE would defend them all from this vile dictator! But the champion's body lies in a secret tomb; his valiant sword has disappeared and all that remains of the legend is a faded tapestry hanging in the Abbey. Alas, Redwall needs a champion now, but the best they can proudce at short notice is a bumbling young novice named Matthias. The three major sections of the book (The Wall, The Quest, The Warrior) reveal the transformation of this young apprentice as he embarks on his private odyssey: to locate the Sword and slay the Scourge.Redwall is an abbey of Healing, not of Religion, but the Father Abbot speaks with gentle authority as he strives for harmony among the various creatures. Many species must cooperate to defend the Abbey, as we witness a catalog of medieval siege tactics. Cluny's cruelty and diabolical schemes produce unlikely allies in the Resistance, as well as dangerous games of counter-espionage; suspicion and treachery stalk the innocent and the unwary.If Martin is encouraging Matthias, why does he prove so elusive? His hints are veiled riddles and word puzzles--ancient mysteries to be solved by the combined wisdom of both young and venerable minds. Cooperation and dedication to Justice are underlying themes, but the story rips right along, switching suddenly from the thrusts of the attackers to the parries of the defenders. Until the ultimate Confrontation, which will determine the fate of Redwall Abbey. There is no end to Jacques' inventive plot, with frequent sudden twists and foiled schemes. This fabulous Fantasy which recreates the medieval world will delight, amaze and enthrall the Reader."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},R=["disabled"],B={key:0},x={key:1};function q(s,o,n,u,r,i){const c=y("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",H,[(e(!0),t(f,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),g(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",x,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",B,"See more"))],8,R)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(M,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-770b6116"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/8.md","filePath":"quotes/8.md"}'),D={name:"quotes/8.md"},L=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,L as default};
