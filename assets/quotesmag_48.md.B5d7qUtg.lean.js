The semi-autobiographical by Miss Lee encapsulates just about every nuance of human nature and morality worth describing. No wonder she decided that she needn't write another book. The heroes: Scout, Jem, Boo and Addicus are like shining lights in the midst of a world gone morally dark. The morality is as apt today as it ever was; only the names and faces have changed.

I won't tell you much about the book(read it to believe it, or see other reviews) but I will tell you that this book has really changed me, more than you would believe. Harper Lee has done an astonishing job describing the depression through a child's perspective, and the plot is just the plot for not-quite-but-somewhat historic fiction fans. To Kill a Mockingbird has a touch of historical fiction, but not too intense a slap of it. I would reccommend this book to any age group, but mainly above the age of eight, since most of these reviews seem to be by teens who enjoyed the book. Like another reviewer said, most high schoolers in my community had to read To Kill a Mockingbird in their freshman years, so I'd also say that middle schoolers who haven't read this book should read it before they get into high school, so they have a head start.

I don't know why, but I was expecting a boring, plodding story. To the contrary, this is a quick, fun, easy read.

It's mandatory reading for school kids, and rightly so. One of the best novels of the 20th century. It's a pity Harper Lee only wrote this one novel.

Usually I'm one to keep my mouth shut as not to show my ignorance, but I just can't keep quiet about this. I've never read a better book to date and don't ever expect to, and I suspect if you read it you'll feel the same way. I know Atticus Finch is a fictional character, but he has been a role model for me since the first time I read this masterpiece.

The themes and characters are universal, and they go right to your heart. The book revolves around the expierences of a young Jean Louise &quot;Scout&quot; Finch in a rural south town called Maycomb. Other main characters are her brother Jem and father Atticus, along with a cast of others. There are thousands of little stories within the novel, and it is amazing to see how each event effects the life of this young girl.

I am now a Junior in college and it is still my favorite book. I fell in love with the characters; Scout and Jem.

It is never to early to teach these lessons."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The Cunninghams were a family of truthfulness, loyalty and able to carry on great responsibilities. They did not want to hurt anyone, they were grateful for the people that had helped them on their journey of life. When the Cunninghams were wrong they admitted it, when they were right they didn't show it. They had great respect for anyone who walked on the face of the earth. But as usual the Ewells were just the opposite, they did not tell the truth on a consistent basis, and it wasted a human life. After the trial of Tom Robinson versus Mayella Ewell, the Ewells were ashamed because Mayella may have like a black negro, Bob Ewell caught them in the bedroom kissing and suspected the worse. He claimed that Tom raped his daughter and then beat her. All of the bruises were on the right side of Mayella's body, Tom had no left arm. It was Obvious that Tom did not do it. But the Ewells which were ashamed to admit it, costing Tom Robinson his life. He was very upset and was disgusted how long it took for the jury to deliberate. He fought retribution against Atticus's kids and hurt them coming back from a Halloween party. Bob Ewell could not stand that his word was barely good enough to overcome a black African American. The Cunninghams were very much respected by others because they kept their word, they would do anything to pay you back, they would help you, and never worry about what was in it for them. The Cunninghams renewed their resources by doing this, people were glad to help them. As for the Ewells used up their resources, they scrounged around taking, taking, and taking from others and used up their resources. People were disgusted when they helped the Ewells. Both Cunninghams and Ewells had special privileges Cunninghams were able to pay people back with other things than just the American currency, while the Ewells were given privileges because people were ashamed of them. Cunninghams also never had to worry about getting themselves into trouble they never lied and were very hard workers, ! the Ewells were liars, and were too ashamed to stop the slandering of Tom Robinson before it came uncontrollable, costing Tom his life. This story shows that Hard work is difficult and tough to maintain, but it will pay off, it maybe easier to beg and mooch like the Ewells but sooner or later the beggars and moochers have no where to turn, so they lie and cheat and quickly their life become corrupt, much like the Ewell's. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" reflects on every day society and how outcasts of society can be misread and understood.

My thoughts changed when I opened up the book and began reading about Jem and Scout. My feelings quickly changed from not wanting to reading this novel to not wanting to put it down until i was done ( which is unusual for a 10th grade student to say.) I felt that in some way I was connected to Scout through her storytelling. Miss Lee's writing shows that racism occurs in society but some people can see ast the color of ones skin, that there is a lot of hatred in the world, and that going from innocence to experience can occur within the blink of an eye. I strongly recomend that all young adults read this sometime in their school career, even if it is not assigned.

Scout lives in the small town of Maycomb in Alabama. The novel examines her life and how she responds to large-scale issues and small, petty problems in her own life. This novel is more of a slice of life, with the main narrative problem and solution not coming until the end.Scout Finch is 8 years old when the story begins. She spends most of her time acting out stories with her brother Jem and their beloved friend Dill. The trio also has a fascination with Boo Radley, a man who has evolved into an urban legend. The three make it their goal to make him leave his house. The book focuses on Scout's small worldview for the first half or so, how all she cares about is making Boo Radley come out and acting out plays in the summer. That all changes when her father, Atticus, decides to defend a young black man accused of rape. As racial issues and prejudices broaden Scout's view of things, we can only go along for the ride.This is a true masterpiece, with excellent characters like Atticus and Dill, along with the youthful innocence of Scout. \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is a classic, a read that truly depicts life in a way I had never experienced before."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book over the course of 2 months.

I can remeber scout being attacked in the woods while wearing a halloween costume.I remember the sounds, and darkness almost as if it was a memory.

The company will publish a new audio edition of Harper Lee's Pulitzer-Prize winning book in September under its Caedmon Audio imprint.To Kill a Mockingbird was previously available in audio format from Books on Tape and Recorded Books in the library and rental markets. In 1997 Audio Partners obtained the rights to sell the Books on Tape production, narrated by Roses Prichard, at retail, and that agreement ran through late 2002 when the license expired.The forthcoming audio edition of Mockingbird will be recorded in late April by an Academy Award-winning actress (who does not want her name divulged prior to the title's release) and is planned for unabridged CD and cassette formats.Lee's beloved novel is in familiar territory, as it was originally published by HC in 1960 and remains a strong seller for the company in hardcover, paperback and large print with over 30 million copies sold worldwide. (In addition to its many distinctions, the book was recently named, in a World Book Day poll conducted by Britain's Museum, Libraries and Archives Council, the number one book everyone should read before they die.)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"For years, I have heard so much about both this movie and the book. Having just finished the unabridged audio version of it, I can safely say that both are worth investing your time in. Written from the point of view of a lawyer's daughter looking back on three years in her childhood, it is very obvious that author Harper Lee drew much of her book from her own life, and her descriptions of both the people and places are probably not just derived from thin air. In fact, Gregory Peck's performance of Atticus Finch reminded her so much of her father, that she cried on the set of the film!True, this is a story about the cruelties of injustice and prejudice--very anger provoking and often managing to stereotype characters that really probably existed in Lee's world--but it also speaks about the common human condition we all share no matter where we are: our collective human lack of infallibility. With some wit, wisdom, and innocence that gives way to grace through the comprehension of human imperfection, we see the lives of Scout, Jem, and Dill unfold in the middle of controversy that need not exist if it weren't for the small minded logic that far too many people possess. Innocence dies in the face of cruelty--like killing a mockingbird. This is the reason the children are never the same after witnessing the unfair trial of Tom Robinson and, as one of them observed about Boo Radley, the town recluse, he hid in his house because he wanted to, and sometimes we want to do the same.Our hero Atticus Finch is a bit unbelievable in his overabundance of goodness, but he sets a great role model for his children, and I believe that Harper Lee idolized her father enough that she wrote the book to immortalize and place him on a pedestal. We all have blind worship for at least one person in our lives, but I think the real purpose of Lee's novel was to stress integrity, honor, and graciousness in all walks of life. In a world full of adversity, these three things are really all a person has, and the rest is just smoke and mirrors."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. You know the one book you could have on a desert island. It is so amazing on so many levels. This should be required reading. I only wish Harper Lee had written more. This book is a must have."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Behind the eyes of Scout; a young girl growing up in Alabama, Harper Lee's first novel helps us to realize the hardships of growing up in a place where everyone is against you. Lee paints a perfect picture of truth in the mind that readers will never forget.Atticus Finch is a successful attorney until he is given a case that could ruin his reputation as well as his family's. Doing what's in his heart, Atticus steps up to the plate and uses all his skills to fight for the life of a innocent black man accused of rape by the town lunatic; Mr. Ewell. As Atticus fights for the life of the innocent, he teaches his children an unforgettable lesson about doing what's right now matter how it affects you.To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer prized novel that will surely have you connecting to your own childhood as you watch the magic of growing up from a different perspective. This suspenseful story is about racism, youth, and from my opinion, most importantly of all, love."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I first read this classic novel during my eighth grade year of junior high. Although I loved the book the first time I read it, I recently decided to pick it up and read it again for fun. Today, I am a high school chemistry teacher in a struggling school on the southside of Chicago. In light of both the education I have received since I last read the book and my experience with the wonderful students I wok with on a daily basis, I now realize that I missed much of the book's significance and wisdom my first time around.Whether you grow up in the suburbs, the country, or in an urban metropolis, the lessons of love, race, class, justice, and personal growth contained within the pages of To Kill a Mockingbird are invaluable to an individual's growth and development as a citizen of a our diverse democracy. The story narrates the events that occurred in the lives of a sister and brother, Scout and Jem Finch, over a time period of three years. Told through the viewpoint of an innocent child, Scout, the tale brings to life a town's struggle with racism. The book also brilliantly exposes the complex varieties of good and evil that exist within each of us.In Lee's tale, Scout's father and brilliant lawyer, Atticus Finch, defends a black man, Tom Robinson, wrongly accused of raping a white woman. Atticus's pursuit for honesty and truth demonstrates to all the importance of standing up and fighting for what is right. Without the individuals like Atticus Finch that have lived throughout our nation's history, we would not have the freedom we often take for granted.This novel is essential to the education of all children. It helps them understand the historical background behind of the social problems that still exist within our society today and, hopefully, inspires our youth to take an objective look at these problems and work to discover effective solutions to them."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The author of this book is Harper Lee, with characters Scout, Jem, and Atticus who spend years bonding and going through everything together. I would recommend this book to anybody who is old and mature enough to recognize, and take forth, life lessons. What I did not like about this book was the general form of their dialogue. Some things were pronounced and said differently back in the 1930s and especially in Alabama. By the way it's typed, sometimes it was difficult to understand it, at first. What I really liked was the exquisite compassion from the story. The author left in the perfect amount of information for the serious consideration of the horrid racism from their times. This story was a very big eye-opener and it was very moving. If this book had only connected the two parts more smoothly, then I believe the story would have flowed better. The ending was unexpectant, which can be a good or bad thing. In my opinion, it was most enlightening conceieved finish. If I were to amend or edit anything, I would make the title more attention-getting, although the true meaning for the title is revealed after reading the story. This novel was one of the best I have read; and probably ever will read, because it shines the spotlight on the historical fiction perspective, while not casting a shadow too dark to realize this era's truth."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The book begins with an observation from Charles Lamb that lawyers were children too. Since its publication date in 1960, this novel has lost none of its popularity. Atticus Finch, a lawyer, is the narrator's father. Maycomb is a tired old town. The family lives on the main residential street.When Scout is six and her brother Jem is ten, a playmate, Dill, age seven, appears. He is visiting his aunt for the summer. Calpurnia, a servant, structures the children's days. The children are fascinated by the Radley place. I will not disclose the plot importance of the Radley connection in order to preserve the suspense for the reader. The description of an Alabama childhood during the Great Depression is priceless. It is no wonder this one book author could not repeat her achievement when, on the first try, she produced a masterpiece.At school Jem and Scout are subject to a progressive, John Dewey-style education. (Amusingly, Jem confuses the new plan with the Dewey decimal system.) Atticus has to teach Scout the meaning of compromise as she attempts to understand and participate in the confusing world of the first grade. Scout thinks that laughter is coming from the Radley house. The children believe that Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley, a former resident of the insane asylum, lives in the house. They ask a neighbor, Miss Maudie, if Boo is dead, and she says no. Atticus tells the children to stop tormenting the man.The children start to find chewing gum in a knot in a tree on the Radley property. Later they find a watch and a spelling bee medal in the knot hole, and still later the hole is filled with cement by somebody. Scout hears from a relative that her best friend Dill just gets passed around and does not have a home. (Truman Capote claimed that he was the model for Dill, and indeed, circumstances of his childhood match the attributes of the character.) In one scene there is a deserted waiting street and a mad dog. Calpurnia has an alert telephoned to everyone through Maycomb's telephone operator. Since the Radleys do not have a telephone, she yells in the direction of the Radley house for the Radleys to stay indoors, too. In the evolution of this episode, Scout learns that Atticus is a crack shot.There is a caste system in Maycomb. Scout's father is handling an unpopular case. Someone is accused of rape and Scout does not know of what the factors in the crime are. Atticus sits in front of the jail guarding the life of his client. A mob went to his yard earlier. Atticus has a crowd of sullen people surrounding him at the jail. Scout's conversation with one of the members of the crowd causes the crowd to disperse. Atticus later cautions the children that a mob in every little southern town is always made up of people, regular people. The trial attracts numerous spectators. When the jury convicts an innocent man, Scout and Jem and Dill are shocked. The man dies in a jail break.A wonderful feature of the book is that the story is told from a child's perspective. In addition, the rich oral culture of the region is evident in the book's pages."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a MockingbirdHarper LeeScout remembered her father saying, \\"You never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.\\" At the end of the novel she says, \\"Just standing on the Radley porch was enough.\\" To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic novel about growing up and the loss of childhood innocence. One of the major themes of the novel revolves around the meaning of courage. Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch is growing up in the 1930's in a small Alabama town. Her single father, Atticus, is a well-respected attorney. Readers are taken through a period of three years in the lives of the children and their neighbors. A fire, a rabid dog and stories of Boo Radley fill the otherwise slow days of Scout, Jem and their friend, Dill. The children are focused mostly on Boo and trying to catch a glimpse of him. Atticus is annoyed with their fascination with Boo, but finds himself in the middle of a rape trial which will challenge the soul of the town. Tom Robinson, a black man, is accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman. As the children watch their father take a stand, they learn lessons which can only be taught by example. This is a powerful story of growing up. It is easy to be drawn into the book as it explores the message of true courage and standing up for what you believe. I recommend this book to all.BIBLIO: October 11, 1998, Warner Books; Reissue edition, Middle-High School, $ 6.99REVIEWER: Katie GordonFORMAT: NovelISBN: 0446310786"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Growing up, my mom was a high school English teacher. Every year I would hear her talk about 'To Kill A Mockingbird' and how wonderful of a book it was. I always thought she was saying 'Tequila Mockingbird', so I never really understood. It wasn't until my 7th grade year, when I was assigned to read this book, did I 1) realize how right my mother was and 2) what the actual name of the book was. I have to say, I was quite apprehensive to read it, due to the fact that the title seemed like the whole book was going to be about killing a mockingbird. I guess I judged a book by it's cover, which is mainly what this beautifully written book is about.Scout Finch (Jean Louise Finch was her birth name) is a young girl growing up with her older brother, Jem, and her lawyer-dad, Atticus. As the only girl around the house, besides their African American help, Calpurnia, Scout is an entergetic tomboy. With their new friend, Dill from Meridian, Mississippi, Jem and Scout go on many adventures, mainly including the town-mystery, Boo Radley.This book is not just about a young girl becoming a young lady, it's about her having to realize that not all of society is as understanding to change or different people as she and her family were. The case of Tom Robinson (an African American man accused of raping a white woman) had a huge effect on Scout's life.I don't want to give away too much of this book, so I believe I will stop there. All I can say is that Harper Lee, a friend of my grandfather, really hit the spot with this one. This has always been and will always continue to be my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee is intense, sad, funny,yet a very good family book. Throughout the story Scout Finch is the narrator, and in a nutshell,the story is basically about Scout going from a girl to a women and the problems she encounters and the things she learns. But on a higher level the book is about the Finch's ( Scout, Jim, Atticus)who live in a small town where everybody is poor,and everybody knows everybody and their business. There are certain people in the town who everyone is scared of such as the Eweulls, and most of all the Radly's. During the story Scout and Jim have many adventures and they learn many things. For example, they learn about education,prejudice, family values, and learing to be tolerant of people's differences. But their biggest lesson was learned through the trial of Tom Robinson. So, if you a interested in hearing about Scout's journy from girlhood to womenhood, then this is the perfect book for you!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I like this book a lot, not just for its themes of social justice, but also just for its characters. Atticus is someone everyone should try to emulate, and I love Scout.The movie's awesome too."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, is the best book I have ever read. It is about how people deal with major issues of racism during the segregation period. In the town of Maycomb County, a little family dealt with a lot of these serious issues of being bothered because Atticus Finch, the father of the family, defends black people. Atticus, a lawyer who is considered to do all the dirty jobs no one wants to do, is defending a Negro by the name of Tom Robinson. This wasn't considered a brave thing to do in their town, it was mainly thought of as stupid or a joke. The Cunninghams, another white family of Maycomb accused Tom of abusing and taking advantage of their older daughter, Mayela when he was allowed inside their fence, just to do a few chores. They claim that Tom beat her about the face, and on the arms, and then he got on top of her, just when the dad walked in and caught him.During this trial, the two Finch kids have struggles with other kids at school, because their dad is defending a Negro. The ending is unpredictable, and leaves you wanting more. If you want a good read, I urge you to get this book as soon as possible. It is one of the greatest books of our time, because it is realistic, and the author writes so well. To Kill a Mockingbird is really well written and it is written so that you have to infer a lot of the time, about some background knowledge of what went on in the past, during that time period. It is a good book that keeps you thinking, and you actually feel like you are there with the characters. i highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; when I was 16 for my GCSE exams in England. Then, I liked it, but I wonder how much of that was my teacher's opinion, not mine. My sister is approaching 16 now, and apparently about to start studying it, so I said I would re-read it to see if I could help her with it at all. My mum re-read it too, so we could compare notes.In a way, I wish I hadn't read it when I was 16: I wonder whether putting this book on a syllabus for 16 year olds is a mistake. Harper Lee, after all, never intended the book to be studied by children.I couldn't put it down this time. I was at that stage where you almost remember what happens, but don't quite, so the story is just as engrossing the second time. This time, I was struck by the mockingbird analogy more than ever. It is a beautiful metaphor and actually applies to many of the characters in the book: not just Boo Radley, but Tom Robinson and Jem too. When you think about that the whole way through, it gives the book a whole new depth and meaning that is not immediately evident on the surface. I think before, when I read the line &quot;it's a sin to kill a mockingbird&quot; I fell into that trap of thinking &quot;oh good, that's the title of the book mentioned at last&quot;. It's easy to attribute the metaphor solely to Boo Radley because of Scout's (very insightful) comment at the end of the book &quot;it'd be kinda like shooting a mockingbird,wouldn't it?&quot;, but I think that is just scratching the surface of this wonderfully written novel. I hope every 16 year old reading &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; has a wonderful teacher willing to give them everything it has to offer.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"&quot;Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between. Boo was our neighbor. He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain, a pair of good-luck pennies, and our lives. But neighbors give in return. We had never put back into the tree what we took out of it: we had given him nothing, and it made me sad.&quot;Its prose is simple but breathtakingly beautiful. Its truth is self-evident. I have read this book repeatedly and, at 43, it still moves me to tears. It is one of a handful of books that changed my life."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I feel that 5 star reviews are given a bit too often on amazon. However, here is a book that deserves every one. This is just a fantastic story. I first read this in Highschool and did not really care for it. I picked it up again and wow! Harper Lee's writing is simple, humorous, touching, nostalgic in tone, always bringing you more and more, step by step, into her world. At the end I found myself on the inside, looking out, not wanting to return to the real world."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I'm not going to go into all the depths of what this book is about, and what it symbolizes. If your 9th grade English teacher did not make you read this book, or you only read the cliff notes, you must read it. It is a classic for a reason, and everyone should read it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I have juss finish reading To Kill a Mockingbird and i liked it. The story starts off in a town called Maycomb. The characters are Jem and Scount Finch along with their father, Atticus Finich. Atticus is an attorney and he is defending an african-american man, Tom Robinson, because he is acused of raping a white girl, Mayella Ewell. Jem and Scout are the two kids that try to get Boo Radley out of his house. Boo is supposedly a big, tall monster-child. Jem and Scout meet a new kid from the block, Dil, who is visiting for the summer. He dared Jem to touch the side of the Radley house. Jem does it and they never messed with the Radleys til Dil came back next summer. When he comes back, they are wiser, so they decide to go to the Radley house at night. When they do Nathan Radley, Boo's brother, scares they off with a shot of his shotgun. When they run off over the wire fence, Jems pants got stuck on it. When he came back to get in the next night Jem went back and tried getting his pants back, and he found the rip stitched up and ready for him to get it. It was the work of Boo Radley. They find that Boo isnt a bad person, but they he is friendly.I would really recommed this book if you like reading race-related books. This book also has mischif in it when Scout and Jem try to get Boo to come out. I thought this book was really good because I like the whole jist of the book. The whole getting Boo out of his house part was really good because of the sneaking around part and stuff. I really liked this book and recommend everyone to read it atleast once."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"A book that covers everything from the lose of innocence to racial tensions in the 1930s, To Kill a Mockingbird is the perfect novel for all ages. I really enjoyed this book told through the eyes of a young girl. the only reason why i did not give this novel a 5 is because of its very slow start. It was kind of hard for me to get into it at first. Once i did get into the book at aroung the 3rd chapter, I could not put it down."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"My review for this book (To Kill a Mockingbird) is that its not fake, its real. It talks about true life lessons, and how you can deal with it and ignore the problems that surround you. But overall it was a pretty good book.This book (To Kill a Mockingbird) is first about three kids Jem, Scout, and Dill. One summer they were wondering what on earth happened to their neighbor Boo Radley who no one has seen for years. He is supposed to be some kind of spooky figure, but they find out that he's not so spooky and is actually a kind of nice guy. Then it talks about how their father (Jem, and Scouts dad)takes on a case defending a negro who is accused of raping a white girl. Their dad gets all kind of ridicule,is critized, and even called names just because he was defending a black man. But that doesnt bother him and he continues to believe in what and who he believes in. But in the end the negro is end up shot, because he tried to escape from jail because he was in fact convicted of raping the white girl."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I really liked this book. It was very well written. The characters were well done and interesting and there was quite a bit going on in the plot despite the book's short length.I really liked that the story began before the characters got involved in the main plot. I was able to get a sense of the characters lives before they were changed by the events in the book. The characters were all very well written, I really felt like I was sharing the experiences with them instead of just being a spectator. I thought Atticus' character may have been just a bit too perfect, but it didn't bother me that much.I didn't have the really strong feelings about this book that I have seen from others, but I still think it is very good. And I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a good, interesting story."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This story is about a trial in a small town in Alabama and how it affects the locals, especially the narrator, Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, her older brother, Jeremy Atticus \\"Jem\\" Finch, and their widowed father, Atticus Finch. Other characters include the Finch family's housekeeper and nanny, Calpurnia, their neighbors, Miss Maudie Atkinson, Mr. Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley, and his father, Nathan Radley. The trial is about a black man, named Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping a white girl. Excellent reading."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"A wonderful book for young adults, full of moral wisdom and coming of age nostalgia. I actually enjoyed the first half exposition more, with its childhood cycle of school years and long hot summers filled with games and stratagems for luring out the mysterious Boo Radley. Of course, Atticus Finch shines as a timeless moral icon, and the tragedy of the Tom Robinson case was a lesson much needed during the early Civil Rights days. However, in purely literary terms, I thought the message came across as rather preachy and heavy-handed, especially in the false ingenuousness of some of the children's conversations on race and social justice.I'm in my 30's and somehow missed this book during my adolescence, nonetheless I can see why it has long been required reading for so many high schoolers."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I recently read this book for an honors english assignment.

There was many conflics and it is a great story of growing up and maturing."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To begin with, we should really rate this book more than 5 stars, but we can't. It is the tragic story of unjustice in a small Southern town which is full of prejudices and mysterious secrets which are uncovered by the heroine, Scout, her brother Jem and their friend Dill. This is a wonderful coming-of-age story, though it does not talk of the passage from adolescence to adulthood, but shows how an 8 year old girl loses her innocence. We would strongly reccomend this book for young adults. The end succinctly wraps up the story, and the way the author puts the climax in the beginning is wonderfully clever. In conclusion, this book shows so much of our life, and we reccomend adolescents read this book because of the insights of life it presents to the reader. Reader beware, To Kill A Mockingbird will play upon your heart and soul and it will leave you thinking about values you and others hold in your lives. In short, we loved it, and it is possibly one of the best books we will ever read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is great not only because of the moral value it brings but for the description of the point of vue of a 6 year old child that's going threw things that kids usually experience at age 13 or 14 but what I think fascinated me the most was the people thought in the southern county of Maycomb.Why did Miss Lee decied to make Tom Robinson die maybe she could of made him a hero and prove that life was good for everybody.But I guess it made me think more about reality.The part that touched most and made a few tears run down my cheaks was when Boo Radley saved Jem at the end.Iswear it made me love his role in the book.I wish there was a sequel to this book.But there would probably be no point.I wish people who read this book don't have to read it by force but by pleasure.Thank youA great touched fan."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is great not only because of the moral value it brings but for the description of the point of vue of a 6 year old child that's going threw things that kids usually experience at age 13 or 14 but what I think fascinated me the most was the people thought in the southern county of Maycomb.Why did Miss Lee decied to make Tom Robinson die maybe she could of made him a hero and prove that life was good for everybody.But I guess it made me think more about reality.The part that touched most and made a few tears run down my cheaks was when Boo Radley saved Jem at the end.Iswear it made me love his role in the book.I wish there was a sequel to this book.But there would probably be no point.I wish people who read this book don't have to read it by force but by pleasure.Thank youA great touched fan."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book was really good.

I have read it over and over since the first time I was introduced to it as a young teenager. The characters are real and the story is timeless. This book moves me every time I read it.

The characters are so poignant, so real and so touching. The plot realistically portrays racism, as well as it's effects and reactions to it, in the South at the time. Lee does an excellent job incorporating reality, the somberness of the matter at heart, as well as a few laughs for good measure, into this book. You may laugh, you may cry-- but the inevitable truth is that you will end up reading a book that is very difficult to put down, and impossible to forget."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"TKAM is a wonderful book about growing up in a small Alabama town in the 1930's. It shows the maturing of the children, their life struggles, their trimuphs etc. Harper Lee does a wonderful job of letting you get inside the mind of Scout Finch and puts you in her shoes. Putting yourself in someone else's shoes is a common theme and Harper Lee made me feel that I was Scout, I was a close confidant of hers, or that I could see right into her mind and feel what she felt. TKAM is full of symbolism and is a touching novel. A+"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It was probabaly the most interesting book I have ever read.

I was sucked into the story of Scout, a six year old girl who innocently watches the events that unfold in her town around a black man accused of rape. This story is full of interesting characters, truthful morals, and humorous irony. I was also suprised to find a writer who does children justice. Instead of having them be &quot;a bunch of dumb kids&quot; they show insight and personality. Go Harper Lee!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Everyone who can appreciate a wonderful book, that is. Masterfully done, sweetly written, with a flowing style that seems to read itself. Almost perfect!!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I rated To Kill a Mockingbird 5 stars. This book is the &quot;handbook&quot; on racism, sexism, and descrimination against social classes. I enjoyed this book due to the understanding level it was on. I think because it was though the eyes of a young child they made it very plain and comprehendable but because Scout was smart and intelligent, Harper Lee could still use knowledge about a second grader's. I think this book helps teenagers especially deal with the idea that racism and sexism will never completely go away but that they can still deal with it to the best of their ability. I think the author definatly intended this book for young adults. If a young child read this book, it would fly over their heads and leave them with more questions than answers. The language is inappropriate for most children but yet is understood by young adults. This book helps teenagers in many ways."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"One of the best things about To Kill A Mockingbird is that is excellent without trying to be. Lee's writing is totally unpretentious and straightforward, yet vivid and poignant. I also liked very much the way the writer treated the delicate subject matters in this book, with dignity and grace, but without sugarcoating or making it a sermon about political correctness. The beginning is a bit slow, but since the rest of the story is so great I can overlook that tiny detail. If it was possible I would give it ten stars."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee gets to you, from the start. she covers important issues like racism and growth. She creates such a vivid picture in your head, and covers the alabama accent clearly. I had to read this in 9th grade, and I plan on buying this book soon. There is a lot of symbolism in the book and hidden messages. Everyone should read it at least once!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee is based mainly on racialprejudice, love, and injustice in society. The main ideas that reallystuck out in my mind were the ideas of racial discrepancies and human dignity. Harper Lee really captured these two ideas in her book. Back then in the 1930s it was normal to look dowm on people because they were a different race. Atticus said it best: &quot;you don't really know someone until you walk around in their shoes.&quot; I think this quote was a very significant part of the book. There was another part in the book when Ms. Gates stated: &quot;We live in a democracy kids, over here we don't persecute other people.&quot; That simple statement really reflected the whole idea of the town and all across America"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"&quot;To Kill A Mockingbird is an excellent book I just finished and think that this novel is the greatest one I have ever read in my life.

It was. Scout's literal,honest narration brought the effect across fully."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book when I was in high school. I loved it! It contains a fair mixture between fiction and history to make it both interesting and educational. If you enjoy studying details of American history, such as the Great Depression, racism, and the Ku Klux Klan, among others, this book is great for you. However, it doesn't entirely focus on history, making it boring. On the contrary, the author develops a great plot that uses suspense, and a bit of mystery and passion, using historical events as a mere basis. I strongly recomend this book to you all!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a brilliant classic. Itportrays the views of Harper Lee, who didn't believe in racism. Bywriting this story, she was taking a stand in her own way.

The title itself is very clever, as is the phrase used in the book by Scout Finch."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"'To Kill a Mockingbird' is the epitome of good English Literature. This heart-warming novel by Alambama native Harper Lee brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion. Once you pick up this book you definitely cannot put it back down. A true classic, in my opinion. It's a story of 8 yer old Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch dealing with her white Father defending negroes in a small prejudice Alabama town as well as her adventures with Boo Radley, a boy who hardly, if all, sticks his head outside the door of his home. A compassionate tale - to say the least - of dealing with grown-ups and trying to understand their way of thinking and the way their adult world works. And for anyone who thinks thing timeless masterpiece is overrated would honestly not know good literature if it came up and bit them in the a**! The book is just that good."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I learned so much about human nature from this book.

I hear those who say the book was boring or didn't have enough &quot;of the real plot,&quot; when in fact the plot is all about growing up and growing older, where the world gets frightening and all the people we used to run to for protection are helpless. This book was meaningful to me in this way. There are also people who say that Harper Lee spends too much time with exposition. The exposition was totally necessary. It set up a safe, known environment for the children we hear from- only to have it crashed down and turn into chaos. Its message of equality and condemning of racial attitudes was a lesson powerful in that time and is now. Those people dissapointed with the book don't look beyond Tom Robinson's trial to see it's real meaning. If this book is &quot;boring,&quot; I hope never to read an exciting book as long as I live."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's to Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful piece of literature that brings meaning to it's title.

This is so incredibly well written-and to those of you that say it's not &quot;well researched&quot; Harper Lee based it on her father, who was a lawyer. He must've provided her so much &quot;research&quot;! What disturbs me is the students' reaction to this book. Here's a tip: You might not like this book because it's too &quot;slow&quot; but wait a couple of years, reread it, then you might be ashamed that you could ever found this book &quot;boring&quot;"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I recently finished To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee. The book is set in a time when racial discrimination was a huge problem and is based in finding justice despite the barriers racism presented. I found the plot a little slow for my liking, and parts of it did not make much sense. However the characters were easy to relate to and likeable which made it a bit faster to read. The book starts out in summer with the main characters, Jem and Scout, who are siblings. For quite a while I was not sure where the plot was going, if it was going anywhere. I kept expecting something big and dramatic to happen. Unfortunately, the excitement took a while to kick in so the first third of the book was really slow. The book plods along through fights at school, petty family disagreements, class discrimination, and a neighborhood tall tale. Even now that I am finished reading it, these events have little to no relevance to the rest of the story and do not make much sense. Finally, emotions start to stir when Tom Robinson, a black man from the black side of town, goes through a grueling trial for rape. Thankfully there is a saving grace, for many reasons, the characters spark my interest. Harper Lee explains their little quirks to a tee which I like. I find them easier to relate to this was. Jem, Scout, and their father, Atticus, are the only one's in the novel that are not racist. Due to the abundance of other discriminant characters, the Finch family is even more enjoyable in the book than they would be in the 1990's. To Kill a Mockingbird is worth reading because it teaches a very important lesson about racism and humanity. It could be condensed though, which would make it an easier read. All in all, it was long, but had a good theme and interesting characters. I recommend this book to people who like to spend good quality time reading."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading To Kill a Mockingbird. It was a great story and i would recommend it to anyone intersested in reading a fast paced,sometimes funny and definitely an unraveling mystery. Reading a bout the way the children thought and reacted brought back memories of a time when i was their age, and I was extremely afraid of ab old man that used to live in my neighborhood because of my wild imagination. After reading this stoy, I accepted Atticus' advise that &quot;you never know a man untill you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.&quot; I would recommend this book to be read by anyone in their early tens but, I'm sure this story could be enjoyed by people of all ages. Jem and Scout lived with dad, Atticus and Calpurnia, the housekeeper. They meet Charles Baker Harris or Dill, which is his nickname, when he comes to visit his aunt Rachel for the summer. the kids keep themselves busy finding numerous ways of getting into trouble. They spy on Mr. radley, who reacts by trying to shoot them. Curious to what Atticus does all day, they peek in the courthouse until Atticus sends them home, and they're always late getting home, and Scout tends to insist on using unlady-like language. Summer ends, and Dills returns home to Meridian. Jem anxiouly rretuns back to school and Scout begins first grade. Scout meets many new children and starts troulbe with many boys. Scout especially doesnt get along with Walter Cunningham. Walter is from a poor family and Scout quickly learns many life skills from her teacher and her new school environment. Atticus believes taht everyone should be treated equally and agrees to represent Mr. Robinson, a black middle-class citizen who is accused of raping Mr. Ewell's daughter. Mr. Ewell's family is a poor white family from the same community. The story leads you to believe that Mr. Ewell's family invents the entire rape situation to gain a higher status in the community and to ruin the Robinson family reputation. The trial draws much attention to Atticus and his family, and the community because it was unusual case. Many folks shared their opinions about the trial making life complicated for Jem and especially Scout. Atticus patiently explains his morals and beliefs to his children to help them try to understand society. Mr. Robinson is convicted if rape and is sent to jail. While trying to escape he is violently shot and killed Mr.Robinson. i didn't except this to happen, and I was shocked and sad. Jem and Scout are attacked while walking home one night from a play. The book leads you to believe that it was Mr. Ewell who drunkenly attacks them and breaks Jem's albow. Mr. Ewell is later found dead of a stab wound. The story laeds you to believe that Mr. Ewell could have been killed by a vendictive suspect, but Atticus explains to the children that Mr. Ewell accidentally fell on his knife leaving me to wonder what might of have really happened in that community on the night of Mr Ewells death."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I am very pleased!It was a gift for my mom, and she was thrilled to get it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Not only did I have to read this book in high school (way back in 2002 during my sophomore year), but since then I sometimes goes back to it to read certain parts once in a blue moon. Even if that means just hitting up the CliffNotes version, I still go back to this book. I even own the movie on DVD and have seen my own cousins perform this play at her high school about 4 1/2 years ago.This book may not be for everyone. One reason is because of the pace. I don't mind a book that goes slow as long as the writing is modernized a little and the plot makes some kind of sense by the end of the story. Oh and as long as there is no greek tragedy sequence that makes me want to poke my own eyes out and ring my own brain through some bleach to get the images out of my head (MacBeth! YIKES! lol) than I'm willing to read some of the classics.Beyond the main theme of acceptance, the book was written in a time when racial segregation was still happening in the deep south. Black people couldn't use anything a white person used in public and so many other horrible things Jim Crowe Law's did to any black person was a horrible reminded of our nation. But this book makes you believe in justice and the heart of the story that comes to fruition from some of the characters.All in all, this book is a treasured piece in my library. My own children someday will be reading this book. I'm hoping before they get to high school so that they can have a better understanding of life in general and learn to accept everyone for who they are and not what they are... which is the message of the story as well."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Purchased for my 12 yr old grandson.

The movie is the same as the book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The plot of TO Kill a Mockingbird get's two thumbs up as they say in the movies. I felt that the author did a good job by making us see it from an eight year olds perpective.Well it took place in old town during the time racism occured. I felt that alone had me intrigued to read the book . It was intersting tome because the book had two different stories going on at one time.I felt that the author showed me as a reader that a kid growing up with a single parent was hard and that it's even harder when your parent is a hard worker and he doesn't have time to see you so you go and start own adventures like Scout and Jem do by trying to find things about there scary and mysterious neighbor Bo Radley.In my opinion I would say that the author portrayed Atticus as a man who does what he thinks is right by defending a African American man who he thinks is innocent eventhough knowing the whole town will look at him and his kids differently.That made me think about all my past situations where I had to the do the right thing. I thought the book had key elements but the part I liked the most was when Scout met Bo and found out that he was a good man. That tells the reader to don't judge a book by it's cover.I recommend for everyone to read this book because this book has a lot of meaning to it. It shows the way a kid grows up in rough times and the racial issues in that period of time. I gave the book four stars because after every chapter I wanted to read it not knowing what to expect."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I had to read To Kill a Mockingbird for school and I thought, a book for school, this will suck. After a few chapters, it got really good and I didn't want to put it down. The back of the book doesn't describe it well. It is not a love story (I don't know what that's about, there's no love), but about this guy Atticus who had to defend a black man who was obvously innocnet (if you want to know the end scroll to the bottom). the narrator figures out her views of life a rasism through the issues raised. It's a great book, a must read (esp. for me). I must admit though, once you take notes on it, it looses some charm.Off2mars2@aol.com The end of the book is belowThe end of the book: Atticus's client is guilty, and gets killed running away from jail.

The first half of the book jumped around too much and was simply a waste of about 130 pages. However, I truly enjoyed the second half. Atticus Finch is really an interesting character, and Bob Ewell is truly dispicable. TKAM is certainly worth reading, but don't expect too much. It is definitely not what what I would call Pulitzer Prize-caliber."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Killl A Mockingbird is a slow start book. Harper Lee put herself in the book as Scout. She has a brother, Jem, her father is Atticus, and a family cook, Calpericus. The time period is of when people were very racist. Their father is a lawyer and ends up defending an &quot;innocent&quot; black man. The family is singled ou, plus they have a black cook. Time passes, and Atticus gets older, so Jem does more things with Scout. Yes, I would have someone read this book. It goes through a very interesting court trial. The trial displays the feelings white people had for black people. Once you get past the begining, the book keeps your attention, and makes you want to keep reading. There are many exciting &quot;run-ins&quot; with characters that are a joy to read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Again, I was forced to read this, and once again I was disappointed. The only memorable part I actually enjoyed reading was the very first page, where whatsherface talks about the heat of the city.

Reading was more of a drudgery than it was an enjoyment. Then, I entered my freshman year and God's providence placed me under the guidance of an English teacher named Mrs. Lemke. She had an uncanny ability of matching students up with just the right reading assignments. A few weeks into my freshman year, after she had gotten to know her students, she assigned me two books, WATERSHIP DOWN and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, to read and report on. When I learned that one was about rabbits and the other, a little girl, I was furious. The least she could have done would be to give me westerns or war stories. Eventually, I conceded to the fact that the two books would have to be read and so began my journey into a life long love of books. I credit those two books with totally changing my outlook or reading for the sake of enjoyment. What a brilliant teacher Mrs. Lemke proved to be and I thank God for putting her in my life.That was over 30 years ago and I would venture to say, I have read Harper Lee's TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD probably 15 times. It's one of those rare volumes that you just have to take down off the shelf, dust it off and re-acquaint yourself with its brilliant narrative. I just consider it a travesty that Harper Lee wrote only this one single masterpiece. She had such a way of luring the reader into a love affair with her subjects.The story of Atticus Finch and his two children, Jem and Scout, or Jean Louise as she so detested being called, encompasses so many of life's lessons and virtues. We read as the children struggle with their father's identity, racial tension, social differences and a neighbor shrouded in mystery and myth. We romantically consider their world \\"simpler times\\", but to these two children and there good friend, Dill, they seemed anything but simple. And the portrait of their father, Atticus, is so magnificently portrayed by the author as a bastion of virtue. There should be a little bit of Atticus Finch in all of us.These days, I don't read much fiction, but this old favorite comes down every couple of years to be enjoyed over and over, and I can honestly say, with each reading, I enjoy it as much as ever. Thank you Harper Lee, for giving us this treasure, and thank you Mrs. Lemke for changing my life.Monty Raineywww.juntosociety.com"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book years ago in my highschool freshmon Literature class. it was amazing then and the values held are still held todya.

This fiction novel takes palce in the times of racism in the south around the 1930's. It takes place in Maycomb, Alabama. This setting completely sets the tone for the entire storyline. The prejiduce thoughts guides the aactions and words of every white citizen in town except one brave and thoughtful individual named Aticus Finch. He represented a man convited of assult and rape named Tom Robinson.I feel that this was an intersenting and memorable book that prevoked some questions in virtues and morals.

Their father is defending a man that people think raped a young girl. one of their best friends come every summer!I loved this book, it made me think of what life was back then.it was wonderful."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The book, To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee, had primarily involved a lesson in racism and society reaction towards it. The book surrounds itself towards a society that has different opinions concerns people of different classes and races maybe because the story surrounds itself in the south. The novel describes a family named Finch, which is lead by a father Atticus who tries to teach his children the right way to think. The daughter and son, Scout and Jem, are basically children born to learn through a society that doesn't seem too kindly towards African Americans. It shows the life of Scout from her friends like Boo Radley, which describes his home almost as a Haunted House, to her days in school with a teacher who has a negative attitude towards her. The teacher basically believes that she is almost like a showoff and that her learning is a sort of a distraction towards the class. This sense leads to a trial that deals with a case involving Atticus Finch. It basically shows a black man named Tom Robinson who was accused of raping a girl named Mayaella Ewell. Even though in some parts of the trial where Mr. Robinson was known to be innocent, the white panel named the man guilty. The ending shows a situation where even under certain situations; a black man cannot be victories under white power.I believe this book a gives a good piece of information on just how the lifestyle is in the south or a white dominated society. The people seem to be lacking equality and don't really tend to have a sense of pity towards Africans. The people avoid interpersonal communication, which is necessary in a development of a society. This communication basically gives equality to all classes by providing conversations to each person. If every is talked to and involved equality then racism and class difference wouldn't need to be a major problem in the southern society. Some of my favorite parts would have to be when they imagine the Radley's house as mysterious and frightening. Especially when the children were spying on the Radley's and they arrived at there house in fear while Jem forgot that he left his pants on the fence. Another scene which is more touching than funny is when they execute Tom Robinson. A person could almost feel the pain of Atticus Finch when he feels that he has died and all the work he has done to help the man went to waste. This book touches a person in many levels and explores many different controversial subjects by describing it in a situation of a Lawyer and his family. I believe people who are interested in a book who like adventures, drama, and comedy while being told a lesson on racism should read it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"THIS BOOK WAS VERY RELAXING...AND I LOVED IT. IT HAD QUITE A PEACEFUL SETTING, DISTURBED BY THE HARSH REALITY OF RACISM, EVIL, AND PREJUDICE. I LOVED HOW IT WAS TOLD FROM A CHILD'S POINT OF VIEW. ALSO, HOW ALL THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE CONCLUSION REALLY SUMMED UP WHAT THE CHILD (SCOUT) LEARNED. AT THE END, SHE LEARNED ABOUT COMPASSION, FAIRNESS, EQUALITY, AND KINDNESS. EVERY SO OFTEN, THIS BOOK HAD SOME SURPRISES AND IT REALLY DISGUSTED ME HOW MUCH HATRED THAT HUMANS HAD. I THOUGHT THE TITLE WAS EXCELLENT, AND THE ENDING WAS SPECTACULAR. I QUITE LIKED THE BOOK BETTER THAN THE MOVIE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THE OUTSIDERS AS WELL, AS IT IS ALSO ABOUT CONFLICT BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE.

And to me those are the strenghts of this book. The author starts out giving you an review of the family, friends and businesses. Then the author goes to one of the main focuses of the story; the Radley's. Whenever she( Haper Lee, the author) began to talk about the Radley family or about the Boo Radley, who is an important but quiet character, my interest level would go from dull to the level oh... oh... tell me more.If i had to rate this book from 1-10, would give it an 7.

You get pulled into this novel and feel as though you are reading about Scout mature and grow-up, you are grwoing up and maturing with her.

This was written many decades ago, so it isn't fair to judge it to these action or romance smut on the bookshelves today. The first chapters were slow, and I admit, the reading level was over my head, but not concentrating too hard, I followed the book quite fine. The story about a middle-class lawyer who defends a falsely-accused black male in Alabama. Many characters and side conflicts, with other citizens of this town who have small stories and problem of their own, which a young little girl experiences. Gives good morals.

This is hands down the best book on racism (followed by A Time to Kill, which owes a lot to this novel) in the South.

I can happily say that my apprehensions were ridiculously misplaced.True - the writing is generally pretty facile, only occasionally brilliant: &quot;...like Mount Everest, she was cold and there.&quot; This notwithstanding, the development of theme, and the beautiful ideals described by this novel make it both timeless and necessary.

Those kids are so funny and real and the town of Maycomb comes alive in your head (Maycomb is actually the small Alabama town of Monroeville fictionalized). The character of Dill is based on Lee's childhood friend Truman Capote!This book gave me a wonderful sense of what the South was like during the depression and I loved the author's illustrious descriptions: Nehi soda , the Chinaberry trees, Collard patches etc. The character of Aunt Alexandria was never seen in the movie, but she's a welcome addition to the story as is the dope addicted Miss Dubose (who's seen all to briefly in the film version) Lee is such a gifted writer that it's a shame that this is her sole entry in the world of literature."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was probably 12 years old then I read &quot;To Kill a Mocking Bird&quot; for the first time.

The book came out in 1964, the Cold War time and I think was a great example for propaganda, that Americans are bad and discrimination in America is a normal thing. But for 12 year/old all that was not so obvious. I fell in love with a book and it became my table-book. For my Literature classes I memorized parts and monologs, which was unusual choice of book in Russian school. I brought that old Russian copy with me when my family came to America.

While the core plot revolves around the trial of black man accused of assaulting a white woman, there are actually a host of themes: prejudice, isolation, fear, class struggle, education and race. The hero of the book is Atticus, a kind of Ward Cleaver of the South. Atticus is the soft-spoken lawyer, the father of the narrator, who maintains his composure while others are giving in to irrational impulses like revenge or murder. His self-control and ability to empathize with others are the shining lights of this book.

I can't quite say that, since I loved reading before I was given this book by a neighbor when I was about 13 or so (around 8th or 9th grade if I remember correctly).I remember reading it in two days and starting it all over again when I finished it. This was the book that made me take note of writing for what it was rather than for just telling a story. I remember repeating certain phrases that I liked over and over. I also recall that I was reluctant to return it to my neighbor and took some of my paper route money to buy myself a copy which became dog eared over the years. I have since lost it, but have replaced it with a couple of hard cover copies. In any case, I remember being taken with the simplicity of the way Scout told the story and drew me in. The tormenting of Boo Radley by Jem, Scout, and Dill reminded me of similar escapades my friends and I would pull on the Radley-like folks in our own neighborhood...you know, everyone had that &quot;one house&quot; in the neighborhood that had a scary reputation. I'm sure that added greatly to my enjoyment of the book.I also remember the quiet dignity of Atticus and how, inadvertently, Harper Lee taught us all a lesson in tolerance, love, and especially the meaning of family. This book still makes an impression on me nearly thirty years later, and it is the one book I re-read twice a year without fail just for pure enjoyment and to spark those memories of when I first read it.

What's more, it is definitely identifiable with reality; everything the kids did is certainly in the realm of what kids do every day.

Though the subject of racial discrimination is a tough subject, she deals with it in the easiest way possible.

The lessons taught here, about humanity, tolerance and love, are ageless"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Author Harper Lee captures a large portion of my own childhood in &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird.&quot; Like Jem and Scout, I spent a good deal of the late 1950s and early 1960s creating adventures in forbidden places. My friends and I would explore forbidden construction sites while the workers were still there, sneaking into unfinished basements, or entering a church so we could climb up to the steeple, hoping the janitor wouldn't catch us. It might have been as simple as spying on a school janitor, trying to get as close to him as possible without being seen. What I didn't know, and what Jem and Scout didn't know was that our game was spotted by the &quot;victims&quot; long before our adventures were over.I don't recall what year I first saw &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; on TV, but it was a Saturday night, and the following Monday I had to go out and buy the book. Over the next five years I must have seen the movie and read the book at least a half a dozen times each. Harper Lee somehow manages to capture a story as if she was there, and makes us feel as if we also were there.Watching the movie, or reading the book is like looking at an old scrap book of memories. This is what good literature is supposed to do, and why this book should be in everyone's home"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is Harper Lee's only novel and it clearly reflects how society is during the 1930s. The story takes place in Maycomb County, a fictional town in Alabama. Scout and Jem are two innocent children who think that the world, along with everything inside it, is good. However, their perspective changed gradually with their father, Atticus, who was to defend Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman.At the beginning of the story, we get a peek of children's imagination and curiosity as they try to get Boo Radley to come of the house. Eventually, as the Tom Robinson trial begins, they began to see how cruel people can be towards others. The children eventually become more mature as they realize that adults, although mostly good, still have their blind spots like everyone else.Family is an important aspect of this story. From the conversations between Atticus and his children, one can tell immediately how great a father Atticus is. He is not only wise and humble, but caring as well. By teaching the children to stand up for what they believe even if others would despise them for it, Atticus wanted them to be righteous just like him. By defending Tom, he is setting a good example for Scout and Jem to follow.This novel contains many morals that one can unveil by carefully reading the book. Harper has a talent for capturing the reader's attention the moment they started reading the book. Throughout the novel, the reader's heart follows the plot of the story going up and down. One can actually feel being in the audience as the court progresses. It is a sin for not reading this great classic by Harper Lee!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Why not go hardback when buying this ultra-excellent timeless piece of literature?

One of the best books I've ever read...."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best books I have ever read! The story is set in a small, old town, Maycomb County, where a black man called Tom Robinson is accused of raping a white woman. Atticus Finch, who works at the state legislature, defends for Tom.The story is written from the point of view of Scout Finch, who is Atticus's youngest daughter. Because of her innocence and curiosity, Scout often finds it hard to understand why adults act in certain ways. She makes simple, but true and honest remarks about the world around her - about how life can sometimes be so unfair. Scout's thoughts often make me reflect on my own opinions of life.This book is definitely a page-turner! I am very touched by Scout's relationship with her family. To me, Atticus is the best father a daughter could ever ask for. He is intelligent and patient. By defending for Tom Robinson in court, Atticus teaches his children to follow their hearts and \\"do the right things\\" even when others condemn them for doing so.By the time I finished the book, I felt like I was one of the characters in the story. I almost thought that I was standing beside Scout and watching her learn more and more about life. Harper Lee has written her book with such vivid details that any reader can easily be captured into the story she created."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This a lyrical novel, written from a child's point of view, of the South, racial prejudice, and courage of one man. The child's point of view softens the hate and violence, but permits an innocence that promotes the theme of emerging conscience. Scout, Jem, and Atticus are well defined characters who form a loving family with children growing up amid \\"the Southern problem\\". The subtheme involving Boo Radley is tender, as the \\"monster\\" turns out to be a kind, but withdrawn, man (played by a young Robert Duvall in the movie version). As is often, but in this case truly, said: a must read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee put pen to paper 50 years ago and wrote a classic.

All of Haper Lee's characters have a fun southern accent witch we all enjoy.The most colorful voice is the narrator, Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch the daughter of Attikus Finch and the sister of him, her big brother. Attikus is a lawyer in Maycom County, Alabama and is forced to defend a black man named Tom Robison who has been charged with a rape of a white women. This is the central event that links all of the scary and funny characters that Scout tells us about in her child hood. However the most mysterious character is Boo Radely, there next door neighbor is the object of much fascination for scout Jem and there little friend Dill.This book had such a huge impact in Alabama that even today parents are naming there children after characters in the book. It was turned into one of the most famous movies ever made with Gregory Pec.Haper Lee lets us see all the different races and economic classes that struggled or had power in the south at the time. She lets us see how Attikus fights to teach his children to live a moral life even though there is a lot of violence and racism around them.Haper Lee lets us see all the different races and economic classes that struggled or had power in the south at the time.

When this book was handed out one morning, the normal reaction occured. Everybody looked at it as another book that we are all going to sleep through, and BS our way throught the tests and quiz's. What happened next was to all of our suprises. The book was mind blowing, mind inspiring, and mind turning. The way Harper Lee can bring the plot 360 degrees, even in the very end when Scout is reitterating the book that Atticus has read to her, it all still fits in. Reading this book will not be a waste of time, but a growing experience. It will teach you how to grow as Scout has to realize that prejedice is one of the worst issues we deal with in this day and age, as in the 1930's.

This book was about 3 kids in the town of Maycomb. The setting of this stroy was during The Great Depression. The main characters are Jem, Scout &amp; Atticus Finch. They are poor, but luckily for them their dad, Atticus, is an attorney. Jem and Scout meet a boy, Dill, and get into all sorts of mischief throughout the story.I thought that this book was interesting and learned the true meaning of the title. I thought this book was very meaningful and Lee has written a lot to teach his readers. this book is great for those with time on their hands and prepared for a good text. Harper moves the readers with the profound thoughts and quotes of the characters."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I liked the book. It was interesting how the book was based on a flashback, insted of a present time."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The only book that Harper Lee ever wrote. Good enough for me!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mocking bird is a novel that talks about the everyday life of a family. The novel has been writing on first person, having Scout as the narrator. Scout is a young girl that narrates all the conflicts that trouble her childhood. Scout lives with her dad named Atticus, Calpurnia the housekeeper and her older brother named Jem. Atticus works in the Alabama State Legislature, he practices law. Another important character in the novel is Dill, Scout's best friend. Throughout the entire novel Jem, Scout and Dill spend most of the time together they practically become inseparable. The setting of the novel is a small town called Maycomb found in Alabama. It is a very small town where everyone is related to everyone and gossiping is one of the main activities. Bob Radley is a character that represents the fear and the unknown. Scout narrates her fear for this man and how scary his house is. The main conflict of the book appears when Tom Robinson is accused of rapping Mayella Ewell, a white nineteen years old girl. The conflict becomes evident when Scout reveals that Tom Robinson is black. Atticus takes Tom's case knowing that it will be very difficult because no blacks have ever win a case of rape in the State of Alabama. Atticus stands for his believes no matter what the people say about defending a black. Scout narrates all the fights she has at school because of her father situation. She does not really understand why some people are so unfair only because of the colour of the skin. The book then turns into a novel about racism. The book teaches us about how we sometimes have the wrong idea about people we do not really know and most importantly about injustice.I think the book \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a very interesting and enjoyable book. It is very easy to read because it does not use complicated vocabulary. It is particularly interesting because it focuses in a worldwide problem called racism. The book has a plot that makes it very intriguing and it uses a flash back that creates a situation of expectation for the reader. To conclude I would like to say that I really like the book and I will definitely recommend this book to other people interested in good stories."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"While my book favorites are usually modern murder mysteries, I was impressed by Harper Lee's _To Kill A Mockingbird_. The plot sequence is excellent and has the reader constantly hoping the good will win. There's also the suspense surrounding the Radley Place and &quot;Boo&quot; Radley, and everyone can relate to the narrator, Scout's, innocence and curiousity. Personally, I was bored by many details that Lee throws in as extra facts, but if you love description, you'll love this book!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is a touching and cute story.

It was a beautiful and very well written book that should be in every high school curriculum. I recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I really liked this book except for the fact that it was a pretty slow reader for me. It has a good plot, characters, story, and a pretty good ending. There were many boring points in my opinion during this book.Scout and Jem are brother and sister(Scout's the girl). This story tells of their growing up together with a friend of theirs named Dill, who comes to Maycomb every summer. He and Scout want to get married some day. ^_^One of the goals of the children is to get a peek at the mysterious neighbor of theirs, Boo Radley. They have heard lots of stories about Boo like when he was cutting up newspapers and stabbed his mother in the leg...(eek!)Boo Radley had never left his house. One of the children at Jem and Scout's school even goes a mile out of her way walking home just to avoid having to walk by the Radley Place.The kids decide to make a game called &quot;Boo Radley&quot;. It starts to turn into a play and they end up playing it for a very long time. It tells of the story of Boo and his life(I'm guessing that Scout, Jem, and Dill made up some of it on their own).Will they ever see Boo? And if they do, what does he look like? How will they meet? What would they say? Maybe they won't even see him...you'll have to find out for yourself. ^_^"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Recently, I had the opportunity to read this great book. &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; is a must read.

The world seen through the eyes of a child is so simple, yet so complex. The book also illustrated the power of perception. When many people enact reality in a similar way, without second thoughts as to whether there are alternative perspectives to the &quot;reality&quot; they are seeing, it can create a destructive force."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Having re-read To Kill a Mockingbird several times since childhood (including this special edition). A southern tale of a widowed Atticus Finch raising his two children, Jem and Scout, in a community where people help each other and often times hurt one another. It is a beautiful story of family, childhood friendships, playful summers, injustice, hate, and love.Some have speculated that Truman Capote, cousin of Harper Lee, actually wrote this classic tale. I believe that Ms. Lee simply shared her wonderful childhood experiences with us. Thank you Harper!The writer Anais Nin has a wonderful quote that captures the personalities of Jem, Scout and Dill as portrayed by Harper Lee.&quot;The people I find irresistable are those in whom the child was not killed. The qualities of openness, trust, inquisitiveness, tenderness, eagerness, enthusiasms...come from the child in us and are the source of charm. The laughter and smile that do not calculate, the spontaneity that is not arrested.&quot;For those who haven't learned why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird...READ THE BOOK."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I would recommend this book mostly for its sumptious descriptions of the American South in the 1930s. Through Scout's tomboy eyes, we get a glimpse of societal customs, children's games, weather superstitions and a privileged's child's race observations all emulsified in the tastes and smells of the Deep South. The rich descriptions of the world around the narrator is in my view the novel's main strenght.That said, I must admit I was quite surprised at how one-dimensional and predictable the main characters were, and the main race issue is largely a mixture of the tiresome \\"Uncle Tom\\" phenomenon and white liberal smugness. I was quite dismayed that the black folks were portrayed as little more than good-natured simpletons with just the right amount of \\"colored wisdom\\", while the enlightened white minority (who, if you are a white reader, you are to identify yourself with) are the good and noble characters in an evil and prejudiced world.Furthermore, for good measure, the rednecks are given all the convenient charcteristics of being the truly evil representation of the white race, closely followed by the stereotypical white gossiping Ladies who \\"sip their tea and eat their dainties\\" and busy themselves with charity work while reiterating every cliched racial hypocracy imaginable.In my view, if Harper Lee had dared to infuse her characters with more realistic humanity and depth beyond Good and Evil, this would have been a more compelling and honest story about race relations. As the story stands, the white reader gets his white guilt assuaged by being able to identify himself with the saint, while the black reader gets little more than the charitable handout to feel good about himself simply because he belongs to a repressed group of good people. I am not quite sure which race should feel more insulted...That said, I still enjoyed other parts of the book. The children's fascination and impatient curiosity with the mysterious neighbor is delightful reading (even though this very person predictably ends up a hero). The narrator's notions of first love also feels genuine and compelling as does the close realtionship between the narrator and her older protective brother.All in all, I would recommended the book as a look into the adolescent culture of the rural South; however, I would stick to the history books when it comes to learning about the true nature of the extreme racism that polluted the area during this time period."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is one of those books that has become so much a part of the cultural landscape it's easy to forget you may not have actually read it. I did - but now I have.A classic of American literature Harper Lee's first and only published novel is the story of small town 30's Alabama with all the \`\\"Why ah jez seen Miss Polly down bah the riversahde\\"ness it implies.Progressively minded lawyer Atticus Finch defends a young black man who, as far as that time and place goes, was born guilty. The story is narrated by Finch's young daughter who with her older brother are the first to register the rancour of a community united in ignorance and qualified by fear. The story's real climax comes halfway through the book and for me subsequently fails to justify much of its continuation thereafter.Being published on the eve of affirmative action and the civil rights movement it's not difficult to appreciate the impact it had when it appeared on the best sellers lists of the early 60's - but to fully appreciate To Kill a Mockingbird's power and importance you feel you really had to have been there. Then again, the tune may have changed but the song remains the same."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee is a genius. This is a cleverly written book that deals with prejudice in the South. Scout Finch is a child growing up in the South, whose father defends a black man, Tom Robinson, who is falsely accused of rape. Lee spins a story of Scout Finch encountering taunts about her father defending Tom Robinson, and eventually, Tom Robinson is shot while trying to escape from jail. This is a poignant book, and a definite must-read. (PS I think that when Atticus tells Scout that it is a terrible sin to kill a mockingbird, it is a clever metaphor for the sin of killing Tom Robinson in cold blood.)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is not the cover I got.

It was ordered for my daughter's sumer reading assignment. Quick shipping and good condition. Thanks."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The setting is 1935 Missippi in a small town divided by race. A trial pits justice against bias. A black man stands falsely accused of raping a white woman with a dubious reputation- there is no evidence except her testimony backed by that of her idle father.Tom Robinson stands to lose his life if the conviction stands. Atticus Finch is a lawyer motivated by justice despite the culture of bigotry he grew up in.Atticus must fight the state's case which is backed by no physical evidence or corroborative testimony. Tom Robinson's good character seems to count little in the eyes of the town as the dubious character of the alleged victim's father is overlooked. The father, Tom Ewell, testifies and is quickly discredited by Atticus.Despite the conviction of Tom Robinson, Tom Ewell, the victim's father is down in the dumps...quite literally since that is where he lives...in the city dump...white trash perhaps in a very real sense. The angry Ewell seeks revenge on the kindly Atticus.Perhaps predictably, the black man is killed in a fusillade of bullets as he tries to escape a work farm pending an appeal which may have succeeded.MOCKING BIRD- in an apparent nod to Faulkner- has a dark id force residing in the house next to Atticus'. Boo Radley is the son who disappeared twenty five years before as the apparent victim of a repressive religious upbringing that stresses fundamentalist pietism.Boo communicates throughout the book with furtive glances from his window and gifts left for Atticus' children. A ghost of a man is Boo when reality should have made him a sociopath.MOCKING BIRD is narrated from the point of view of Scout who apparently learned to read at four on the litigation weary lap of her father when most children have bedtime stories. Scout by the second grade describes the local judge as speaking \\"ex cathedra\\" to the court which is amazing since most adults have no idea what that means. Scout's account of life in the town is as languid as a hot summer in Dixie and at times as confusing as well...Would you say the Finches have a Incestuous Streak? Aunty said no, that's where we got our small hands and feet. p 147.Perhaps this is the way the family really thought so I guess confusion makes the tale authentic.MOCKING BIRD was written in 1960 the same year that Steinbeck's TRAVELS WITH CHARLEY appeared. 1960 was a year of social convulsion in America with the throes of desegregation rocking the (un) reconstructed South.History helped write both books. The real author of both books was as much the Zeitgeist of 1960 as Steinbeck or Lee. In TRAVELS we find Steinbeck talking to three characters picked up on a long road trip through the South that began in the East and was quickly becoming rushed and boring as the novel withers.One character was a kind black sharecropper, another was an idiot white bigot while the last was a young black radical...all in an almost movie like sequence. A real account with a fiction like reality to it. MOCKING is fiction that seems fictional indeed.In MOCKING BIRD we find a lawyer strangely removed from the culture he grew up in and unmoved by the passions of ego, angst or the lust created by loneliness. A kind of secular saint who turns his cheek to all and answers only with wise sayings and dry wit.Atticus is no Huey Long being ruthless to the ruthless in the name of the working class. Atticus seems strangely eastern in the dark land of Faulkner and decayed houses...he is no sweating redneck messiah as Govenor Long was but an abstraction with no real faults except perhaps his idolatry of the law.Atticus is a hollow icon incapable of true good because there is no struggle with evil in him...Atticus is programmed for justice.Atticus' South is only a New England with humidity...its soul is hollow because it lacks the creaking floorboards of dark carnality. There is not enough rot in this book to make it great; it can only preach to us from a pulpit or as a footnote to TV documentaries on Civil Rights.MOCKING BIRD cannot see into the dark souls behind the white hoods.Would the issue of justice had been less if Tom Robinson had been a poor white falsely accused of raping a wealthy white woman or a communist union organizer murdered in the cotton fields of the anti-labor South? Would the accolades given this book on the back cover from newspapers and librarians been less if the economic power of anti-union media and the political bias of the middle class been questioned?MOCKING BIRD was a good book made great only by the Tsunami Zeitgeist of 1960."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Havent read this since High School.

Maturity showed from Scout and Jem, they finally realized what Atticus was trying to get across the whole time to them. The plot seemed a bit hard to comprehend, but it unraveled into maturity for the theme i'd say. Beleive me, Boo Radley wa something else, he was such a good character, it kept you intrigued to wonder about him.

This town is so small so everybody knows everything about ecah other and their family and what is going on in their home. As the Title says the killing of Mockingbird which is a sin, if anybody ever kills a Mockingbird, it considers as a big sin. In this book the father of the kids, kills the Mockingbird by accident and all of them get worry about that. This book talks about the curse they had. It is a nice and intrusting novel to read. This novel will introduce you with so many different kind of people, and it will show u a totally different world and society and culture. This is a great book and I would like to recommend every one to read this book. I am sure that everyone would love to read this book.

The plot is very simple, the character development is mediocre, and the writing is okay. In short, I simply do not see why this book has become as popular as it has.Was it interesting? Sure, it was okay, but in my humble opinion it simply does not stand up to classics like Uncle Tom's Cabin, Tom Sawyer, The Lord of the Rings, etc.I do think, however, that everybody should read it. It's not that it is that amazing of a book, it is that it is once of the icons of American literature."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is a classic that most of us read back when we were in High School. I read it way back \\"in the day\\" as my husband says, then just re-read it as a book club selection this month. And while I enjoyed the story, sadly it just didn't live up to my expectations.I enjoyed reading about this time period. The novel is set during the depression in Alabama. I liked Scout, the narrator's, voice, and the way she tells her story. I thought her father, Atticus (what a great name), their cook Calpurnia and the neighbor Miss Maudie Atkinson were wonderful and endearing characters.There are many good lessons, some great symbolism and good topics for discussion...there is much to enjoy in this book. But as I've said with another book I recently read, I think that I am not the intended audience for this novel.I really think that this book should be read by young people who are figuring out the world and the complexities of class structure, discrimination and moral values and who may still be able to think that most things in life are black and white. I think it will have a greater impact for them than for more mature readers who already see things in shades of gray."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird, written in 1960, is a work that I feel has literary value and is worth examining. It is a story of a father, Atticus Finch, in small-town Maycomb, Alabama during the depression who is raising his two children on his own. Jem is the older brother who is constantly initiating explorations, and Scout is the tomboyish younger sister who helps him stir up trouble. Their mother died when they were small children, and Calpurnia was a black woman who kept house and watched over the children while Atticus was working as a lawyer. It has many subplots, but the mainly the novel is about a legal case in which Atticus is fighting a battle he knows he can't win. He is defending a black man, Tom Robinson, that he knows is not guilty of the murder of a white man. As racism was still common during the depression, Tom Robinson was essentially automatically guilty, but Atticus decides to fight for him regardless.After reading this piece three times, I have come upon and changed many opinions concerning it. The first time I read this novel, I didn't like it at all. I didn't understand how a book could be titled To Kill a Mockingbird and only mention mockingbirds three times in its duration. Reading it a second time with newly acquired maturity and comprehension, the title made more sense to me, making the reading experience less frustrating. As a ninth grade honors English student, I was finally forced to take the book for more than its face value and truly appreciate all it had to offer. The development of characters is exquisite, the uses of metaphors are intense, and the underlying theme of the novel was one that kept me coming back to further understand it.Harper Lee spends a great deal of time describing new characters in this novel. Although the specific details of the physical appearances, backgrounds, and mannerisms of each character might seem to some as redundant and a waste of good page space, I feel it really enriched the experience for me. When I know that Calpurnia was \\"all angles and bones; she was nearsighted; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard ,\\" I can create an image in my mind. I no longer picture a simple, black housekeeper; I see a woman who works with dedication and vigor. I can imagine her standing in my own kitchen, squinting out the window at my brother and me causing trouble. I feel that this descriptive mental image further ties me into the story.The mockingbird is a simply a \\"common grayish bird, especially of the southern U.S. that is remarkable for its exact imitations of the notes of other birds ,\\" until it is used in this novel. It then takes on a much deeper meaning as a contextual symbol. In this novel, the use of symbolism as a metaphoric method is extremely prevalent. Mockingbirds represent innocence. When their uncle gives Scout and Jem air rifles, Atticus tells them they can shoot as many bluebirds as they want, but reminds them that, \\"...it is a sin to kill a mockingbird. \\" This is because mockingbirds do one thing, and that is make music that people enjoy, as opposed to doing destructive things, like other birds. To kill a mockingbird would be to kill an innocent creature, which is mirrored in Atticus' case with the innocent Tom Robinson. This symbolism really made me interact with what I was reading, because it was a lesson I firmly believed in and was taught as I was growing up. When a literary piece captures my beliefs or thoughts or feelings like that, it really connects me on a deeper level that makes the experience much more intense because it is personal.Atticus also teaches his children that they can \\"never really understand a person until you consider things from his point-of-view... \\" This theme is not only something I can also relate to, but it is used in a repetitive, but not redundant, way in the novel. Harper Lee provides examples of this so discreetly that it takes a great deal of focus to pick them out. When a mob is threatening Atticus for his defense of Tom Robinson, Scout picks a man out of the crowd and talks to him about his child that is her age. This made him back down from the mob's threats, because she put the man into her father's position, as a parent who was teaching right and wrong. This need for heightened concentration on the text really made the book thrilling above its existing entertainment on the basic level. When I had to give the extra attention to the small, seemingly unimportant events in the novel, it made the story come to life and provided me with a desire to delve further into what Harper Lee had hidden in this book for me to discover.To Kill a Mockingbird is a literary work that has had an impact on my life in many ways. I was encouraged to follow the lessons my parents had instilled in me during my childhood, including being understanding of other people and the challenges in their lives and recognizing, valuing and respecting innocence. I really interacted with the characters and metaphors in a story for the first time while reading a novel. I learned that novels can be much more complex than we take them to be, but sometimes it takes patience and focus to find out what the author is trying to tell us. It was the first book I ever examined at a deeper level, and it is still the book I have spent the most time digging into and contemplating. For this reason, I can say I truly liked this novel."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Over all i liked the book to kill a mocking bird. It was great and exciting to read. It keep me reading to the very end. Chapter 29 was mine favorite chapter. I couldn't put the book down to see what happened. Part 1 of the story rellay sets up the book. It is not as exciting as part 2. Though it is importnat cause it explain the story. You find out all of the charters and what the part in the story are. so you really need to read all the parts of the book to get the whole exprence. my favorite charcter in the book was auther radely. he is very missterious and I wanted to know more about him. So i would say to read this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's masterpiece &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; is a well written dramatic story about the life of a family growing up in a small Southeren town. I just read it for my Sophmore English class and I loves it. It is by far my favorite book!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I thought that this book was great. It showed that you shouldn't judge a person that you enver met and don't know. There was great depiction of when blacks were at an all time high. The whoel story of Arthur Radley was very saddening. He was actually a good person, but his past kept him from going outside. He lived out is life in hishouse and iddn't have any children of his own, but had Scout and Jem as substitutes. It was all quite touching: how he have Jema and Scout so many things, and did so many things for them. THe relationshipe between Atticus and his children is really cool. Jem and Scout are allowed to call their father by his first name without giving him any thoughts of disrespect. Atticus is a really nice father, it might seem to many that he isn't a good father, but he is. He lets his kids have space and lets them do as they please as long asi it doesn't involve violence, foul language, disrepsect, or making fun of people. He teaches his kids many things an dis a good role model. He keeps calm, shows respect, is polite, and does pretty cool things. Fore example, he was the greatest shot and best chess player in all of Maycomb, and he gets lots of respect for doing the right thing for all of Maycomb. The Ewells are low down dirty scum, in my opinion. The Ewell that was in Scout's class was so rude to the teacher, when she tried so hard. Tom Robinson helped Mayella Ewell so many times and she doesn't even thing of returning a favor. Mr. Ewell is worse, he beats on Mayella and goes ot any length to get revenge, even if it goes below the belt. All their wrong doings make me sort of happy that they have lvies with great hardships."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mokingbird is a book for people who like to feel good and like to come away heartwarmed. Harper Lee has done a splendid job of capturing the innocence of a girl growing up in the south. Harper Lee's style of writing is one to be comended. She made the book easy to read, thus making it moe eligible to groups of all ages, and yet the story line is something that takes time to comprehend. The actions of racism are not as clear today as they were when Harper Lee wrote this book. Lee's twisting story line does keep you on edge, but it also keeps you wondering why things happened and what wil be the effect of this event. In a way, I feel that Lee kept you waiting too much. She entered characters that were senseless to the plot and little stories that did not fit. Yet in a way they did fit. A little girl like scout, telling a story of her adventures, would tend to ramble and add a story or two that happened, and that they think is important. All in all I think that Harper Lee has penetrated the emotions and brought out the fellings that we all may have forgotten to carry with us from our childhoods to our adulthoods."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I purchased this book after going to three different stores that said they had the book. I bought it for my son who needed it for a school project. The book arrived a day before his deadline to have it. The local library did not have it. Thanks so much to the former owner and Amazon."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Set in Maycomb Alabama, Harper Lee has created a wonderful story for all ages.Lawyer Atticus Finch along with his daughter Scout, son Jem and their friend Dill Harris,are at the nucleus of this tale. The children are adorable and innocent but as they spend theirsummers together in this Southern state of Alabama, they are brought into direct contact with class distinction and racial discrimination at a very early age.Their father Atticus, a very fair and practical man is appointed to defend a black man Tom Robinson, who issaid to have allegedly raped a Caucasian woman Mayella Ewell.That crime is more seriously taken or just as seriously taken as a murder.It should be noted that this particular family although considered 'white trash' by the Macombe society are seen as extremely prejudiced and extremely poor, headed by a father who can be very violent at times.The innocence of these children are broken as the are caught up in the events which lead to the trial of this man. They witness the case which brings to light the hated and racial society they live in of which they want no part.This is a book that I wish I had read a long time ago. I recommend it highly!!Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE 13/05/02)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read that Harper Lee never wrote another book because everything she had to say she said in &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird.&quot; And did she! In a heartwarming story, set during the Depression in Alabama, she teaches us all about race, class, justice, and leaving childhood behind.I read this book every other year or so and it just gets better with each reading. I particularly enjoyed my last reading having just finished Melany Neilson's &quot;Persia Cafe.&quot; It is a similar story except that its hero is a young woman named Franny. Both Atticus and Franny are exceptional people who follow their conscience and are rewarded. Also, Leif Enger's &quot;Peace Like A River&quot; has a character that reminded me of Scout. Her name is Swede and she is utterly charming.It is wonderful to be reminded of my favorite characters in &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; through reading some of the great contemporary fiction that is out there today. If you liked &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; (and how could you not?!) I would highly recommend either of the two novels previously mentioned in this review."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I remember reading this book back in high school. I wasn't really into reading books, but somehow this one really got my attention from very beginning to the end. I don't really need to write about this masterpiece since this masterpiece is backed with many acclaimed reviews. What this book really wants to point out is the presence of racism. Not only Harper Lee describes this small town with his own imagination beautifully, but also writes what he wants to say to the world of racism. There's this one speech by Atticus toward the end, and let me tell you, it will touch your heart with inspiration, the sense of justice, and determination."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I loved this touching story, as told by 8-year old Scout Finch, about growing up in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama amidst racial turmoil and the depression.

Wish us luck, although with this book, we won't need it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I can still remember the first time I read this book. I was in my early teens at the time it wasn't required reading or anything - I read it because I had heard it was good - and it was. I was surprised then how good it was and it surprises me each time I re-read it. I think because it is deceptively simple that I forget just how complex the themes are in it between re-readings.It is told from the point of view of Scout, who is about 8 years old when the story begins and because it is from her point of view much of the 'lesson-learning&quot; themes in it are beautifully distilled. It is left to us, as much as to her, to interpret the actions and the consequences. What starts as a simple summer holiday for her and her brother Jem slowly builds into a complex story of forgiveness, patience and understanding. There is Boo Radley - a mentally deficient neighbour who is seems to only be a figment of legend rather than reality, the angry elderly neighbour who they are forced to visit, their father, Atticus, a lawyer, and the case he has to defend, a black man accused of molesting a white woman.I just loved the way each new story was introduced - in the episodic way things do in childhood, but gradually each story seemed to interweave.Its so beautifully and simply written and the storyline so satisfying that I recommend it - and re-read it every year or so."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"My first memory of the book To Kill a Mockingbird came in the eighth grade. We had to bring a book to school to show to our teacher. Well, I forgot my book. I knew we were reading To Kill a Mockingbird in ninth grade and it looked really boring but she didn't know that i knew. My teacher said it was an honest mistake. I was relieved because I had gotten away with it and I sure didn't want to read it. Then came the day we had to start reading it and I found out that it wasn't as bad as I thought, but it was actually good. The main character in this book is Jean Louise Finch, otherwise known as Scout. She is young, stubborn, and a tom boy. Her older brother, Jem, grows up and matures in this book. They have a friend named Dill who spends the summer with them and loves to exagerate. Atticus, Jem and Scout's father, is a hard working and honest man. His sister, Aunt Alexandra, comes to live with them to help raise the children and she is very tough to live with. There are two themes in this book. The first one is the Need for Compassion and Understanding. Atticus tells his children that they should get into the other person's skin and walk around in it. This means that they would see things from the other person's view and they would be more compassionate and would understand what the other person is going through. One important character in this book is Author (Boo) Radley. Author stays in his house all the time and the kids are scared of him. They realize what he has to go through and are more compassionate towards him. The other theme is the Need for Conscience and Courage. Atticus is a man of conscience and courage. He takes a case where there seems like he has no chance of winning. This case is for Tom Robinson, a black man, who was charged for rape on a white woman. Atticus can't turn down the case because he feels he can't live with himself if he does. This took a lot of courage and shows what kind of man Atticus is."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To kill a mockingbird was a really good book. It is a book that, though I had heard a lot about, I had never had the chance to read. I was glad that I got the opportunity to read a book that interested me in a classroom setting. This story takes place in the early nineteen-thirties (coming out of the great depression) in a small (fictitious) town called Maycomb located in Southern Alabama. The novel's plot revolves around the lives of Scout, the narrator looking back on her childhood, her brother Jem and Atticus their father. The book tells how these children, growing up in an extremely prejudiced old southern town learn from their father how important it is to show compassion to all and be people of conscience. Another main figure in the book is the town scare and scapegoat Boo Radley. Boo was put away in his own house to be kept prisoner by his parents and brother for many years. Naturally the people of the town not understanding the whole Radley family's introverted and sometimes odd ways are cruel and prejudiced against them especially Boo when the truth is Boo hadn't ever hurt anyone and didn't deserve the unkind treatment he was receiving by both his family and the town. The children, Jem and Scout were taking part, to some degree, in this talk and gossip against the Radley's but as the book progressed they realized that Boo really wasn't a creepy bad person at all, but a person just like them with a heart and feelings. They realized that like the mockingbirds in the trees he was there only to help and not hurt and by gossiping and making fun they hurting an innocent thing who needed compassion and care instead of cruelty. They found in the end that he was their friend and that one truly can't judge by appearances. This book was a good lesson on human nature, showing both the positive and negative side of how we treat people. It was a very moving story and I enjoyed it thoroughly."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is a book that is about compassion, dicrimination, and predgidous. It takes place during the 1930's in Macomb, Alabama in the depression. It is about a man who is blamed for a crime because of his race.This book is similar to a lot of other books that have been written predgidous or racisim. Author's who have been a part of predgidousism or racisim can probably write a better book than others by thier experience. My personal reaction to the book is that I think that it is wrong to treat another human being different by thier race or ethnic backround. This book was about a man, Tom Robinson, who was accused of raping a little girl. Atticus tries to defend him but the jury still find Tom guilty. Tom dies tring to flee but is shot by the sheriff. Mr. Ewell, the father of the girl, attacks Atticus's children when they are coming home from a play at school. A man named Boo saves the chlidren and they run to go get help. My reaction to the book is that it was very interisting. I also feel that it showed a lot of truth about how people that are different are treated better or worse. Although this book might not be for some people I think that people should read this book to help make them realize how people are really being treated."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I really like the theme of this piece.

It is an interesting and touching story about two kids growing up in Maycomb, Alabama during the great depression in the 1930's. It was a time with racism and discrimination. The whole town turns on Atticus Finch, the father of Scout and Jem, because he was the attorney for a black man named Tom Robinson. Tom was accused of raping a young white girl, because he is black. Even though he was innocent, no one in the town believed him but Atticus.The story is told through the eyes of Scout Finch, a six-year-old tomboy who was dragged into this racial battle with her father and brother. Her and her brother Jem became friends with Dill. Dill lived with his aunt in Maycomb over the summer and they became very mischievous and discovered their neighbor who hasn't been seen outside of his house since he got in trouble with the law at a young age. His name is Arthur Radley, or more known as Boo Radley, and the children became fascinated with him. They tell scary and mysterious stories about Boo. Their main goal is to get a peek at Boo, but then they started communicating with him by notes and objects left in an old tree.The trail brings out the towns ugly side, but Lee also has many offsets, like the elderly lady that tried to overcome her morphine problem before she died. Or, Scouts understanding that most people are kind when you really get to know them. This understanding is what is truly amazing about this book. Her thoughts are very clear throughout the book and she makes you feel the things that she feels. This book makes you feel like your living in Maycomb, Alabama during the 1930's. She often went on about the characters appearance, and even smell to make it seem like they are standing right in front of you.The story is based on Scout learning to be empathetic. Atticus explains to Scout how she needs to get into other peoples skin if she wants to understand the way they live or feel about something. Atticus's words are very heartfelt throughout the whole story. He is an unforgettable character, and impressed me many times while reading the book. He is a great father, and he stood up for what he believed in, even though the whole town was against him. He never gave up through the hard times that he was having with not only the trial.It is a very rough and soft story about class, justice, race, and growing up. This book will get you thinking and your heart pounding. I would highly recommend this inspiring, powerful, and classic novel to anyone."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; takes place in Maycomb, Alabama, in the 1930's. The whole story is told by a little girl called Scout who tells her growing-up and what happened in that time. The novel is about different &quot;Mockingbirds&quot;, for example Boo Radley who is locked in the Radley's house and is a kind of monster or scapegoat for the people. The children invent stories about him, but later he saves their lifes. Another Mockingbird is Tom Robinson, a black man who is accused of having raped a white girl. He is innocent but the jury sentence him to death. He dies while trying to escape from prison. Atticus, the father of Scout, defends Tom Robinson, so he is also a Mockingbird because the society is against black people and attacks him and his family.The first part of the book is very boring but interesting for people who are interested in society and people with their problems. I had to force myself to read the first part because I am not very interested in every detail of the society and the black-white contrast. The first part is necessary for the second part, but it could have been shorter.The second part is very exciting and interesting because the trial and threats and so on are described. People who are interested in dective stories will like the second part most.The novel itself is narrated very well and detailed, so you can identify with Scout. Besides, it is very interesting to see how Scout and Jem get older and how their relationship becomes different."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The main story of \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\" tells the tale of Jem and Scout Finch, brother and sister and children of lawyer Atticus. When a young man is accused of the rape of a white woman, Atticus agrees, amidst tremendous controversy, to defend the accused in the town's court of law. During the lead up to the case Scout and Jem have to tolerate racial slurs and insults because of their fathers role. In spite of his brilliant performance in the courtroom and the overwhelming evidence against the white family's accusations the defendant is found guilty. He is later shot dead whilst in Prison.The issues of this book include poverty against wealth, racial separations and boundaries, relationships between people, religion and self-discovery. A book packed with issues is always thought provoking and this is no exception.There are three main characters in the book, Scout a tomboy who looses her temper a lot, Jem her older brother who is the more level-headed of the two and Atticus their laid back, gentle Dad. The book is written in Scouts perspective giving you an insight to her views of life. Other characters include Dill, a young boy that spends summers with Jem and Scout, Bob Ewell a nasty lazy drunkard whose daughter is the accuser from Atticus's case and Boo Radley. Boo Radley is the mysterious character that was once accused of stabbing his father in the leg with a pair of scissors.The style of this book is in the narrative of Scout. The genre of this book I think now is slightly dated and old.Personally I thought this book was interesting to read although probably only once. I think that this was because I found it really slow at the beginning but it did get gradually better towards the end as there is a big twist in the storyline. One good point to this book is that after reading this book your vocabulary is enriched with long completed words. I can understand the book but I am slightly unsure what all the fuss is about? Maybe when I'm older my interests will have changed and I will want to read this book a lot more? I mean don't get me wrong this book is well written and everything but considering it takes a lot of concentration to read it, it didn't really leave me with a satisfied feeling. I wasn't inspired."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I actually enjoyed this book. For a classical book, it really isn't all that boring or difficult to read. It starts off a little slow in the beginning, but it gets a lot better if you give it a chance. Scout is a great choice to narrate the book, because since she's the youngest, her perspective on their world is a lot different, younger and more innocent. I think it's really humorous to read her views on adult issues, because she doesn't always understand them. If it were Jem or Atticus narrating the book, I don't think it would be as good.Even though some of the language used in the book is a bit confusing, it isn't enough to where you don't understand what you are reading. It took me a while to read this book because you have to concentrate on the words to really comprehend it; you can't just fly through it and expect to understand it all.I think parts of this book are really sad, like how racist people where to blacks back then. I mean, we're all human, aren't we? What does it matter what we look like on the outside? Being different does not make you a bad person.Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good classic to read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I finally read this book because for some reason I never had to read it in school and this is one of those books you are \\"supposed to read\\".I was ready to declare it overrated. After all, it is a little dull at times. I also thought much of the humor is...well...unfunny. I also thought the character of Tom Robinson should have been developed more to heighten the sense of tragedy.But then I read the last few pages and I cried like a little girl! Scout's realization that Boo Radley was watching over her and Jem all along like a surrogate father is one of literature's most beautiful epiphanies.For that alone, this book deserves its elevated status despite its flaws."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Joana MiraflorAugust 17, 2006Period 1Jem and Scout, the children of a Maycomb, Alabama lawyer, Atticus Finch, deal with hardships and prejudice throughout the story. They share a secret friendship and adventure with Boo Radley, who lived across the street and left them all sorts of surprises in the tree hole until it was cemented. Their father, Atticus Finch, was responsible for the life and case of Tom Robinson, who had been accused of raping a white woman named Mayella Ewell because of his race. Scout was raised without a mother-figure because she passed away and was known as the tough girl with attitude. But she grew up with Atticus's perspective of equality for all. They were taunted by townspeople because that reason. Mayella's father, Bob Ewell, is shocked that Atticus proved him wrong during the trial so he end up trying to kill Jem while walking back home with Scout, after a school play. Boo Radley rushes to the scene and saves the two children bringing them safely back home. After staying by Jem's side, Scout finds out that the creepy man across the street wasn't so scary after all.\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" was very influential. Before reading this story, I thought to myself,\\"Great, I'm being forced to read this, I won't like it one bit.\\" But surprisingly, I loved it. It taught me life lessons about people, family, friends, and how people dealt with conflicts back then. This story showed me that without great minds that believed in equality, the better and comfortable environment we live in wouldn't exist. Plus, we'd have to deal and live with everything these characters went through.This story taught me that there were numerous people out there that didn't show or give respect just because someone else was different. It showed me the hatred different races had against each other back then and how racism affected one's life greatly. Atticus gave the Tom Robinson case his all, even though people said only the negative about it. His children went through the obstacles with him and stood up for him in front of Tom Robinson's jail cell. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" has a lot taught me that if you work as a family and keep each other on their toes, you can get through anything and everything regardless of everyone else's opinions.From reading this book, I learned how much self esteem a person needs to get through life. Once that self esteem lowers, everything else goes downhill with it. Atticus was ahead of his time and had his own point of view on people and how life should be lived, especially without racism. I agree with his perspective because racism just builds up to more issues and no one out there needs more problems. I am thankful to be living is a more positive society compared to those times. I am also grateful that the intensity of racism back then isn't repeating itself today as well.Lee's style of writing contained the southern accent in most of the character's dialogue, especially the townspeople. The dialogue helped the reader sense the character's feelings, a stronger way without having to describe everything plainly. Some of Lee's choice of words was words used long ago. Although this could have complicated things, each chapter consisted of a different situation happening in Maycomb. This made it easier for the reader to understand what was going on and when even with the complex vocabulary and terms."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The majority of the people that did not like this book can't even spell, so I would not listen to them. Obviously this book is a classic for a reason. Maybe Amazon can start putting spell check on reviews....."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I think that no younger then age 14 should read this book, it has extenxive language. The situation the book evolves around is a topic for teenagers and/or adults.I strongly think that rape is a topic for high school and older students. I didn't really enjoy To Kill A Mockingbird as much as I thought I would.I would have to say the best part was the end of the book,and I also think there is too much prejudice in this book. Examples of some of the prejudice in the book were people making fun of black people,being racist and seperating blacks from whites.In the book they categorize the families from wealthy to poor. Finches came first,then,the Cunninghams,then,the Ewells and last,the Robinsons. The book was mostly based around the trial of Tom Robinson raping the Ewell's daughter. The first half of the book talks about Dill,their new neighbor and Boo Radley,their other neighbor.The second half deals with all new characters coming into the story such as Mrs.Dubose,she was another neighbor that was a morphine addict and died in her sleep.Some of the characters in the book had that kind of weird side to them like Mrs.Dubose did.It seemed to me that each character in the book had a problem all the time but that makes the book better because some books make the characters sound so perfect and the author makes you think that these people never have problems,so in this book it shows that no one is perfect and that everyone has problems all the time.That's another thing I like about this book.At the end of the book I think that they could've found a better way of dealing with Tom Robinson then how they did. Over all the book was ok.I'm not one to read books,I actually hate reading but some of the things in the book kept me reading but other things made it seem like the book was dragging on with the same subject.In the book they changed the subject a lot so it made it kind of confusing at times.I think if they didn't change the subject a lot then the whole book would have seemed like it was dragging on not instead of just little parts here and there. I feel that the second half of the book was more interesting then the first half,there were more details and more excitement then the other half of the book. I recommend this book to high school and older students."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I thought that the main idea of this was very good. In the beginning it was very stupid though.

However, these facts stretch the truth a bit.The \\"Foreward\\" is simply a paragraph, taken from a letter from Lee to the editors of the book, that says she doesn't like Introductions to books. What kind of a \\"Foreward\\" is that?? Is it worth paying $5.00 more for over a paperback edition?Also, the hardcover is not very well put together. It is your standard unlaminated hardcover with glossy dustjacket, but the binding is cheap and the book will not survive several re-reads like a hardcover should be able to do. In fact, if you want longevity I suggest going with a paperback edition... I've had mine for many years and it still is as strong as ever.Granted, the book does LOOK nice sitting in a shelf, especially if you are a collector of the various hardcover editions of the classics that have come out recently (\\"On the Road,\\" \\"The Bell Jar,\\" \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" all of Ayn Rand's novels, etc) but that isn't my purpose for owning books.

If you are reading this book you are proboly thinking, what the heck, where did the mockingbird part come from. Well here you go, I'll save you a couple of hours thinking about this book trying to read between the lines... To kill a mockingbird first appears when Atticus Finch{did you get the Finch part, as in the bird} tells the kids that they can kill as many blue jays as the want, but to remember that to kill a mockingbird is a sin. Scout asks Mrs.Maudie why it is a sin to kill a mockingbird and she said it is because they don't do anything but sing theire heart out for us! If you still don't completley understand, mockingbird means innocence. It also comes when a newspaper ad is put in the paper about killing crippled, and lastly when scout tells atticus that to try Boo Radley would be like shooting a mockingbird!

That doesn't happen often. It transported me back to childhood and reminded me to take people where they are at. Beautiful."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Thr first 125 or so pages of the novel seem a real disconcerting affair,a tedious plough through the simplest chain of events seemingly unrelated to the whole essence of it. And then'the reader suddenly stumbles upon the theme of the novel and finds himself contemplaing a dark,impelling truth,the truth of the Western society being divided by race,class and colour.Set against the backdrop of the Depression, Harper Lee's \\"To Klill A Mockingbird\\" traces 3 years in the life of 8-year-old Scout Finch in a country town of Maycomb,Alabama in southern Unite States of America as she and her elder brother Jem perceive through their young,quzzical eyes the irrational prejudice of the people against blacks and are unable to comprehend or accept the racial tension that's readily staring at the reader from virtually every page of this entertaining classic.\\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is the saga of Atticus,the father of Jem and Scout,a widower and lawyer,the hero of the piece, and his eternal fight for justice for a black man charged with the rape of a nineteen-year-old white girl. Tom Robinson is the real mockingbird of the story;wronged,hapless,hopeless and circustancially crippled negro chased by the intellectually limited white hunters. Atticus is the odd man out and is severely chastened for despite being a white,he defends an ignominable white. He's called \\"a nugger-lover\\" and his children are consistently hackled at school as well as by Mrs.Henry Lafayette Dubose,a sinister,cynical woman who subsides to death due to morphine addiction.\\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is indeed a social tragedy but the plot of Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel consorts other fragmented dark pieces of the jigsaw puzzle and the final picture is a ghastly one framed in a social contour of deep hypocrisy and abusive racial segregation. The agony of Tom Robinson when he undergoes a clinical segmentation of his alrady distorted character during his trial as the rapist of Mayella Violet Ewell symbolises the eternal blasphemised black community's urge to fabricate itself into the social realm. Little Scout---the narrator of the novel---and Jem are confounded by the town's conscience and find the deep-rooted prejudice and hypocritic mind-set of the people a tough feature to digest. These \\"inquisitive children\\" endure a complex relationship with their father and their innocence and bemused exclamatory remarks lends a superaded charm to the mesh of events. \\"Jem,I ain't ever heard of a nigger snowman\\",Scout asks her developing broter once and on another occasion lays bare the stark double-standard sustained by the people:\\"Jem,how can you hate Hitler so an' then turn around and be ugly about folks right at home---?\\" Boo Radley's queeness of locking himself up in his house for good transfigures from a mere item of comic relief both to the reader and to Jem,Scout and their friend Dill to a suden realisation of truth that he does so \\"because he wants to\\" escape from the bitter cold gale of base racism outside.Written in first-person narrative through the confused but unrelenting hand of Scout Finch,Harper Lee's scheme of ideas aptly ekes out the social scars and humanity's vices. A sly humour underlines the multidimensional perspectives of the town,a small area chunked out of the large human landscape and portraying life as it is. Witty ironies and direct sarcasms as in the issue of First Purchase M.E. Church being worshipped by negroes on Sundays and \\"white men gambl(-ing) on it on weekays\\" underline a much deeper insight into the Western society. The unscrupulous running away of Tom Robinson from the crime-scene,the subsequent alegation of rape against him,the stripping off of the illusion that the sheriff of the Macomb county Mr.Heck Tate bore against the the alleged criminal,coloured cok Calpurnia's blendind of dual lives of a white and a black,Jem and Scout's comprehension of the Cunningham's true identity,the mistaken judgement of the jury,Mr.Link Deas's sympathy towards Tom's wife Helen,and the architect of the doom of the negro as wel asthat of the novel Mr.Bob Ewell's poetically just demise all conform to the interfusion of the light and dark shades of life.\\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is not even 50 years old and already it has been acclaimed as a classic,an enthralling explicit book which aims to elucidate the biasness of the society towards the minor fractions. Even in this 21st.century,racism,racial tensions and racial abuse are still loitering around in all nooks and corners of the world and Harpe Lee's mssively massively successful book exposes the violence and meanness that lurks underneath the nobleman's surface. Attiucus advises his children:\\"Shoot all the bluejays you want,if you can hit 'em,but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird\\". And this sin is being shouldered and would be loaded on the posterity of all generations. Scout and Jem would now be old and still retain their armour of innocence but others,who're diabolically more abundant in nature,such as Mrs.Dubose,Mr.Ewell and Miss Gates,never expound themselves out of their self-made cocoons and consequently never grow. The relevance of this superbly conceived classic in our age is hollering at us from virtually every oppressed man's cries and the need for the Atticuses,Jemes,Scoutes and Deases couldn't arrive at a more appropriate time."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is one book which never fails to make me smile and cry at the same time,everytime i read it.Atticus & Miss.Maudie bring back my faith that there are still some good people in this world(Iam not 65years old!!)and till the time people keep reading this book and be moved by it,there will still be(more the merrier!!).Everybody must read this to their chidren&grandchildren; and gift it to their friends coz there's no other word for it than PERFECT !!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I've just begun to read this book.

Jim and Scout do many things during the book: they get in some arguments, play games they aren't supposed to, and go place they aren't allowed to go.

When I was toward the end of high school I really got into 20th century history, specifically US, and was told to read this book. The story centers around a black man wrongly accused of raping a white girl. In the south (imagine that). Of course, we all know what \\"should have happened\\" to him (I'm not saying it's right, rather that was the normal course of action then. History is history, it cannot be changed no matter how awful it is.), and have him sent away to prison for the rest of his life, if not worse. This is where the story takes a twist. A determined defense lawyer steps up and takes the case, and do what's right. He is ridiculed, harrassed and threatened, but remains steadfast in his role of defender of the innocent.The only disappointing thing about this novel is that it's Harper Lee's only novel. The writing is wonderful and the story is brilliant. We may never know why she only wrote this one novel, but she did a damn good job it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"October 22, 2011Without exaggeration, this must be my 20th reading of this classic of American Literature. It never fails to move me and inspire me and educate me. I find something \\"new\\" - or at least new to me - virtually every time I read it.This time I paid closer attention to some of the minor characters, especially the women - Calpurnia, Aunt Alexandra, Helen Robinson, Mrs Merriweather, Lula, Miss Maudie, Mrs Dubose, Miss Caroline, and Mayella Ewell. I was struck by what a wide range of personalities, strengths, weaknesses, and ethics Lee was able to express using just these minor characters (some appearing for only a page or two) living in a small town.Many people feel this is a book about racism. I don't think that is the core theme of this book, though it is the central plot device Lee uses. I think the major theme of the book is personal integrity and courage - doing what you know is right when all about you seemingly disagree and even when it may be dangerous to do so, being true to your own moral compass, and instilling those values in your children by example not just words.In 2010 I listened to the audio book, performed by Academy-Award-winning actress Sissy Spacek. She does an admirable job, though her accent is wrong. She is a Texan, and the Southern Alabama accent is softer than her twang. Still, by the 2nd disc I had stopped noticing this, and allowed myself to be carried into the story by her expert reading."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I lost her book that she's had since she was in eighth grade and felt really bad so I purchased this edition and she appreciated it very much.

The dust jacket is made of glossy photo quality, heavy-duty cardstock paper, with the printing embossed; the actual cover itself is just a plain fabric cover. The book is about the size of a DVD case. The font is a good normal size, I would say the text is about the same size as this review.

One of my favorite books ever."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Scout is a young girl in the racist southern part of the United States. She, her brother, and their friend get into mischief, trouble, and have fun. But even as they continue to play games for kids, the town they live in is going crazy over a court case--a case in which Atticus Finch, Scout's dad, is on the side that most people disagree with. The case is relatively basic: a black man is accused of taking advantage of a white girl. It is obvious that the black man is innocent. But the racism that is rampant in the town is against him, simply because of his skin color. Scout watches the trial unfold through the eyes of a child who doesn't completely understand what is happening.Another aspect of the story is Scout's relationship with her dad. She often doesn't like him that much: he is older and won't play baseball or do anything else that other dad's do with their kids. But slowly, Scout's perspective of her father--and of the world--begin to change.This is a wonderful read for anyone looking for an interesting story, a story showing the two racism that was obvious in the south 70 years ago, and of a marvelous coming-of-age read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I just reread this as an adult and parent now living in the Deep South.

The book also shows how children's perceptions are changed through time. To see her llife through a man's she was afraid of to begin with and grew to know and like him. The best book ever written, now or in the future."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is a book that I have read over 100 times, since I was a teenager. I probably re-read it every two years for the last ten years, and everytime I read it, I learn something new about attitudes towards life. There are many characters in the story, and we learn something from each character. In some ways, we learn with Jem and Scout. We learn not to take people at their face value and what other people say about them (Boo Radley). We learn to stand up for what we believe in. We learn about what real courage is and we learn how gentle people can easily be victimized and misunderstood.The great thing about this book is that even with all these great &quot;lessons&quot;, it is a very interesting and funny book. It is interesting because it is narrated in the eyes of an eight-year old. The book was about Jem's and Scout's childhood experiences. We cheered and sympathized with their fortunes and misfortunes. We smiled when Scout asked Walter Cunningham &quot;what the samhill he was doing with the syrup&quot; and we gasped when Scout was stuck in the tire going into Boo Radley's front yard. And aren't we all touched, just like Jem, when we found Jem's pants were mended, however clumsily, by Boo?"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"A great novel in the respect that it shows how the world really works and how life used to be.

That is the story(s) these book tell true on a higher level. The minor characters are deeper then the main characters in many novels (take that atrocity called &quot;A Seperate Peace&quot; for example).

Part one takes you through their summers, school years, and inumerable attempts to provoke Boo Radley out of his house. Part two takes you into the rape case between Tom Robinson(negro) and the Ewells(white).

This version is done wonderfully by Roses Prichard who has the perfect voice and inflection to give each character life and distinctness. Her pacing and soft, subtle voice fit exactly the time and setting of the story. It made me want to take time to listen."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Author ofAfinidad: A novel of a serial killerTo my mind, this is the best book ever written. It has everything in it that a novel should have: unforgettable characters that you come to love, especially the two children at the heart of the novel, Scout, who narrates the story that takes place over three summer vacations, and her brother, Jem, but an erstwhile villain, Bo Radley, comes to find a place in your heart in the end as well; so descriptive of place and time (Alabama,1930s) that you have to re-orientate yourself to your own surroundings when you put the book down, and the superb regional dialogue plays no small part in that; and a truly interesting storyline that keeps you deeply involved until the last page. There is great drama in the book. Scout's father is forced to confront a mob set on lynching a black man; Jem gets stalked by some terrifying presence one night; a rabid dog goes beserk and needs to be shot et al. Atticus is a fair-minded liberal lawyer choosing to defend a black man charged with raping a white woman. This fact makes for some very tense scenes as this choice is not very popular at all in the early twentieth centure South. The writing is so powerful that you are on the edge of your seat as these scenes unfold, and that includes some great courtroom ones. But there is so much more than drama in the book. It is a truly heartwarming story of a father's love and respect for his children, and also the angst those children experience as they grow into maturity. Poor Scout, for instance, struggles with the then accepted notion of what a young Southern lady wears and how she behaves.There is a persistent rumor that this book was written by Harper Lee's great childhood friend, Truman Capote, and that wouldn't surprise me at all. I didn't get to Truman's books until years after reading and loving this one, but when I did, I thought the style of writing was exactly the same, and just as brilliant. So I personally think that there may be some truth in the rumor, or at the very least, that he gave a great deal of assistance.....As a bonus, it is a must for anyone who wants to gain insight into the Southern way of thinking seventy odd years ago."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This audio book is a wonderful version of the classic novel. I love the idea of listening to this on a long road trip. This novel captures life in a small southern time during the time of segregation and the Great Depression and brings to life the quirky personalities one might find in any small, close-knit community, as well as the great and not-so-great qualities of humankind. Of course, one of the best aspects of the novel is Atticus, a great classic father figure.As a high school teacher, I find this is a great resource to use when we do whole class readings. Not only does this save my teacher's voice, but the reading itself is very enjoyable and authentic (Southern accent and all!) The narrator accurately captures the tone and characterization found in the dialogue, and reads at a slower pace, allowing for students to interpret the meaning of some parts that contain difficult vocabulary words. The audio CDs are also wonderful to use since I can monitor students during the audio portion, and pause to discuss important scenes and events. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"One of the best books centered on issues of racism and segregation.To Kill a Mockingbird represents the major theme of coexistence of good and evil but does so by enhancing the plot with gothic elements and underlying events that build tension and suspense. For example, the fire that destroys Miss Maudie's house, the children's superstitions about Boo Radley, and the menacing night of the Halloween party seem to be out of place in the normally quiet, predictable Maycomb. These elements create tension in the novel and serve to foreshadow the troublesome events of the major conflict- the trial of Tom Robinson and its aftermath.The title of the book itself has very little literal connection to the plot, but it carries a symbolic meaning in the book. In this story, innocence, or \\"the mockingbird\\" is destroyed by evil. Thus, to kill a mockingbird is to destroy innocence. Throughout the book, a number of characters: Jem, Tom Robinson, Dill, Boo Radley, can be identified as mockingbirds.In saving Jem and Scout from Bob Ewell, Boo proves the ultimate symbol of good.At the beginning of the book, Boo is merely a source of childhood superstition. As he leaves Jem and Scout presents and repairs Jem's pants, he becomes gradually real to them. At the end of the novel, he becomes fully human to Scout upon saving her, illustrating that she has developed into a sympathetic and more mature individual. Even though she lost her innocence, she is now more understanding of her father's moral law that made him stand firm to his beliefs in the midst of raging storms of criticism from society for taking the case of Tom Robinson- a Black man falsely accused of raping a white girl.With the main conflict of Robinson's trial foiled by the mysterious story of Boo Radely, the reader can't help but to sympathize with the characters and feel a sense of familiarity with the town of Maycomb."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I already love this book.

It will fill your heart and it will stay with you the rest of your life.Peace"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I honestly have no idea how many times I have read this book. I read it first as an assignment in the eighth grade; most recently, at the age of 41, I read it aloud to three of my children. As with the more recent readings that I recall, I choked up a bit at the end as Scout is experiencing the tragedy and love that surrounds her in the form of her conservatively eccentric father, her mythically reclusive neighbor, and the whole Depression-era, post-Reconstruction sugary gothic Alabama town of her home.There seems so little to add in reviewing this book. I will say that even as I read it I ponder the strength of its charm. What is it that is so powerful? Scout is herself quite endearing, although even a casual reading should tell the reader that the first-person voice that is speaking is not the voice of the eight-year old Scout; Harper Lee somehow conveys a tone that retains the childlike innocence of Scout (the child), but the story told is mature and the vocabulary is college-educated. So is this Scout (or Jean Louise Finch) as an adult? I don't think so, as there is very little biographical/autobiographical information provided beyond the timeline of the story (e.g, did Scout grow up and marry?; what happened to Scout's mother?; does everyone live happily ever after?).I read once that Harper Lee considered this to be a simple love story, or something like that. I've wondered who she was thinking about: Atticus and his kids, or Boo Radley and the kids, or some other pairing. I guess it is all of the above. It's a simple story of relatively normal children with an independently thinking father who all live in the politely racist South of the 1930's. The circumstances that confront this family (racism of the lowest order and ugly poverty and dysfunction from the underbelly of society) are really not abnormal until the violent climax. Blood is shed; much blood. But it is all presented with a humanity and Southern nostalgia that draw us into a world - as ugly as it is - that makes us wish we were there, and that we could have changed a few things.Highly recommended, if you haven't read it yet."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book has to be among the best in human history. Flawlessly written from the perspective of a child and full of wisdom. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird is a relief after the numerous tedious pieces of \\"classic literature\\" forced upon us by our county's curriculum. This book interlaces themes related to both adulthood and childhood which parallel the stage of our lives which we currently live.To Kill A Mockingbird centers around the lives of Scout and Jem Finch and their explorations of the facets of maturity. The two spend there summers with Dill, exploring their sleepy southern town and trying to coax Boo Radley out of his house. The siblings grow apart as the each begin their own transition from child to adult. Jem's changes manifest themselves in his habitual \\"maddening superiority\\", while Scout learns more about the intricacies of the more adult world. Their new found maturity is tested when Atticus takes on the job of defending Tom Robinson. Then they learn the true meaning of growing lies in making the right decision when faced with the wrong.This novel resonates with teenage readers in a way uncommon to many of the books imposed upon us in school. Everyone should read this timeless classic because it is more that just a classic. It is a catalog of life lessons imparted to the reader through a collection of memories."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Scout is the main charater in To Kill a Mockingbird. She has a brother named Jem. They and their friend try to see the mysterious neighbor Boo Radly come out. As they grow up, a young white girl is said to be raped by a black called Tom Robinson, or so says her father, Mr. Ewell. Scouts own father, Atticus, is the defending lawyer for Tom Robinson. Scout and Jem really want Atticus to win because they don't think Tom Robinson really raped the girl. Did Tom Robinson really rape the girl, or is the story fake. Read this book to find out."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is a novel of racism, tragedy, and hardships, but mostly it is about the priceless time of growing up. One will be helplessly immersed in the happenings of Jem's and Scout's life. Of the many; their quaint relationship with their father, and also that of with their neighbors, the Tom Robinson case, and their interaction with Boo Radley, but one will be particularly captivated by the charmingly innocent way in which the story is told. This book, no matter who you are, where you are, how old you are, can teach us all a great many things. An appealing aspect of this book for some is that the story is told from the perspective of a tomboy in a time where that was not generally encouraged."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is the best classic: It is overflowing with life and has a memorable and vivid, gentle persuasive humor and a glowing goodness. It is a gem of a book. To Kill A Mockingbird is beautifulluy written. About crisis in race and in life, this amazing book will never be forgotten.

Everything about this book is perfect."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I'm 14 years old and I thought this book was beautiful. I wasn't forced to read this book for school--it was choice, and one of the best I've made. My only hope is that if you read it, you can identify the hidden messages laced throughout the book AND appreciate them. To me, it was a book of innocence vs. corruption.

While reading this book, you feel as though you are actually friends with Jem and Scout. The characterizations are first-rate. I read this book for school years ago, and recently picked it off my bookshelf when I was in the mood to read a &quot;Good Book&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. The reading was better the second time, after not having read it for a long while. I only wish that Miss Lee had written more books-she's a major talent, not ever to be forgotten."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book was not all that good.

About thrity years earlier William Faulkner had published the short story Dry September. ITS THE SAME STORY. To Kill A Mockingbird is not a bad book, its just simply not original (I won't say plagairized because I'm not sure that it is). Read Faulkner, particularly the short stories Dry Semptember, Barn Burning, and That Evening Sun Go Down and the novels Santuary, Light In August, and The Sound and The Fury. You get a much better look at the same time, place, and issues that Lee looks at, but you get it from the original source who happens to have been a much better writer."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"nope sorry uh uh cannot do it I cannot do it. Making fun of people because of race and killing birds is not good. I do not believe in that and I cannot believe they wrote a book about it.

Here Scout and her brother, Jem, grow up while some wierd stuff happens all around them.This book confused me, alot. I could not say I was entertained in the least bit. The plot, if there was one, was derivitive and often meandered form a single idea. First, it starts out like many books do and recollets past events, then a mystery, then a court drama, then a regular drama, then a mystery again."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book only reminds me of the ignorance of racism and how horrible people can be to each other. This also made me remember I read this in my spare time in 3rd or 4th GRADE! I also think this book may invoke and remind people of the horrible acts done to people,such as lynchings, attacks, and arson, that were usually done to innocent people."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is not great literature, and I avoid teaching it at all costs. It's not even good. The characters are black and white two-dimensional cardboard cutouts. The rednecks are evil, the blacks are victims, and the self-righteous Atticus is too good to be true. There is nothing here to examine or explore. Critical thinking skills need not be applied for understanding. Moreover, if the lack of complexity and verisimilitude doesn't stick in your craw, then the insipid narration of the androgynous Scout will. This novel is popular due, in part, to the fact that the reader can feel morally superior to white trailor trash as he identifies with the demigod, Atticus. Shakespeare, the consummate craftsmen of characterization, understood that even the evil (save Iago) have some redeeming qualities, and the good flaws. To Kill a Mockingbird is about as deep as a rain puddle."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of the most overrated and hyped books of our time. It's an uneven paste-job of short stories and pieces by Harper Lee promoted by her liberal New York publishing friends.Some sections are absurd, such as Ch. 26, where third-grade students in a rural Alabama school in 1935 have a discussion about Adolph Hitler's treatment of Jews in Germany.Without the compelling 1962 film version, this novel might have been forgotten by now."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Although the author had some good points, I must say that this book sucked a big fat one star. I thought it was horribly thought out and it was considerably a snoozer. I seriously feel asleep readin this. I advise and suggest that nobody dare pick up this book. You may die of boredom."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I have a personal policy to re-read To Kill A Mockingbird every three years. It helps me remember how to exist in the modern world as a moral person. This reaffirmation of justice, honesty, integrity and compassion in the daily lives of common American people involved with uncommon events may be why To Kill A Mockingbird won the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Harper Lee has an intelligence about people -- or at least about the best of us as we'd like to remember ourselves. Is our daily America as decent as this book recalls? Probably not. So, it isn't accurate literature exactly. But it IS an exceptional moral story: how David slew Goliath, how Atticus and Scout beat a thinly-disguised KKK by insisting on the integrity of the accused and accuser alike. It works because it's seen through the eyes of an adult woman remembering everything as a precocious 6-year-old tomboy. Atticus Finch represents a sure and convincing morality, almost larger than life. He's able to shoot a rabid dog straight through the forehead in order to save the street from it, just in time. He's almost mythic. But mythology works sometimes, especially when transported to a dusty Alabama town to explicate terrible mundane events which are, all things considered, equally mythic in force. Racism IS a dragon. The Klan IS a monster. They're just mundane, so we don't recognize them as such. An innocent African-American is accused of an unspeakable crime because the &quot;victim,&quot; and then the town, needs it. Finch systematically dismantles the accusations based on simple evidence which no one in his right mind could disbelieve. The story becomes a matter of basic decency and justice because Scout, the girl, has the ingenuousness and moral bewilderment of a smart 6-year-old who sees no racial lines, and who thus is able to express the fundaments which adults either ignore or have become blinded to. Mythologizing her father allows us to understand that, in some things, the fundaments are valid. In some things justice is, in fact, this simple--an deliberate act of integrity and will. A side note: Truman Capote was the model for Dill."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This novel speaks with cultural clarity of the attitudes and actions of a large portion of the US, some of which still persist today. The point of the novel is to explore the awakening of a child's mind in understanding the adult world and being guided on the truth and deceptions of humanity by a pivotal and herioc parental figure. Slowly paced, it beautifully reflects the dangerous pace of rotting minds and attitudes in the depression era, the story of Tom Robinson's court case and treatment by the majority of the Townsfolk is beautifully reflected by the Children's treament of and fascination with, Boo Radley. The Finch's are a fine family and you will ache for a Father like Atticus. A deeply important and highly daring Novel and a must read for school age children.Almost like an Anne Frank diary of the deep south."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The story is set during the great depression of the 1930's, in a small town in the southern United States. Scout and Jem Finch are the motherless children of a lawyer in the town of Maycomb, who spend their carefree summer days with their friend Dill. Their sunny-sweet world is turned upside down when their father is appointed to defend Tom Robinson, a black man, who is accused of committing a terrible crime against a white woman. The children are exposed to the narrow-mindedness and hypocrisy of their community, and the discrimination faced by black Americans in their town.This book is without a doubt my all-time favorite, and is easily endearing for many reasons. The characters are varied and colorful, from Ms. Maudie, the children's acid-tongued neighbor, to Miss Stephanie Crawford, the neighborhood gossip, from Mr. Avery, the pot-bellied gainsayer, to Arthur \`Boo' Radley, the mysterious recluse who lives in the \`haunted' house down the street. Above all, the most engaging characters are the children - innocent, sweet, mischievous and absolutely delightful.The thing I liked most about this book was the flow and innocence of the narrative. The entire book is told as seen through the eyes of a young child, making the language straightforward and easy to comprehend. The style is bold and forthright, putting forward debatable issues with a candid frankness.While it is a book with a serious theme and a solemn message, the book is interwoven with instances of carefree childishness and subtle comedy. The perfect balance of solemnity and pleasantry make this a hearty, wholesome book.This book is both emotionally thought-provoking and educationally stimulating. As Harper Lee's first and only novel, To Kill A Mockingbird is a touching story of innocence and humanity that I believe everyone should read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this for the first time in English class, & I always hated having to put it down at the end of class, 'cause the books stayed there.

If the reader is interested in mystery they will like this book because you will want to learn more about the mysterious Boo Radley. There is also a feeling of humor in the book as we look at the world through Scout's eyes.

I was a little reluctant to do so as I was always mistakenly under the impression that \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is an old-English, Shakespearean-like read for highly educated scholars. I wouldn't understand a thing of it and be bored out of my mind, was what I thought. Oh boy, was I wrong.This is undoubtedly one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life. Never before have I fallen in love with so many characters in one book, as I have in this one. For as long as it took me to finish this book, I was part of a close-knit community in a small town, with all its daily ups and downs. I walked in so many characters' shoes; I got to see every facet of human nature from various angles. I have experienced every emotion a reader could possibly get out of a one-of-a-kind book, and I grew as a person.Someone once asked me to define a \\"talented\\" writer. I had many answers to that question, but in hindsight, the answer should've only been this: Harper Lee is the epitome of a talented writer. Her writing is pure liquid gold and it leaves you in awe.If you haven't yet read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", you haven't yet experienced ultimate reading bliss. You can take my word for it. I highly recommend this unforgettable, thought-provoking, beautifully-written, delightfully charming book to absolutely everyone. No matter what your age, no matter what your genre preference - you have to read this book! It's a classic for a reason."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life.To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I lived 4 years in America and have heard so much about the book.

The story seems very simple and technically it is. However, it is a book with moral and meaning. Many misadventures take place in the small town. Mainly, the trial Scout's father decides to take on. In it he decides to defend a black man in this judgmental community. The book has a very controversial perspective.There's not much to be said about this classic that hasn't already been heard.

It's amazing how false perceptions about things can keep something that really is good out of your life.A few months ago I decided to finally start opening up and reading some of the books that have always been touted as \\"required reading\\" for schools. Being homeschooled, I was never required to read any particular books - and as I read quite voraciously, it was never really an issue.A few months ago I read The Catcher in the Rye and did not see what the big issue was. It was okay, but not the best thing I'd ever read and I was far from astounded by it. With that further prejudice in mind I approached To Kill a Mockingbird with not a little bit of hesitation.I was sucked in almost immediately though. I could picture the town, the setting. I could see Scout clearly and found myself catching my breath and blinking back tears more than a few times. I fell in love with Atticus - what an incredible man he was in this story. I loved the quirks and the twists, the \\"spooky\\" nature of Boo, I cried at the story of Tom Robinson and I cheered at the dismal ending to Bob Ewell.But most of all, I felt ashamed of myself. Shame that I had let something silly like enjoying the shock people had when I told them I hadn't read this book - keep me from reading this book. Truth be told, I denied myself something pretty special and I plan to make up for it by reading this one again and again."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I don't often read books more than once. Two times is pushing it, and three is just impossible. Yet I can safely say that I have read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" four times and have fell in love with each and every time. People will ask me what it is about a book that makes it so good? The answer lies within the connection the reader forms with the book. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" reminds me of everything I love about life. I see myself in the story of Gem and Scout. I see my heroes in Atticus Finch. The book in a very odd way reminds me of home, even though I'm not from the south. Lee's writing style has an immediacy and intimacy that the reader can easily warm into. I don't hesitate when I make the claim that this is truly one of the best books I've ever read. Everything from the characters to the plot have a richness and vibrancy that is at once southern and at the same time universal. Gem and Scout's story is really a growing up tale. A time in life where you begin to grow into yourself and leave your childhood behind. At it's core it's unabashedly American and is a true representation of all the joys and sorrows that make up the American diaspora. So no matter if it's your first or fourth time, cherish this classic novel. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Jean Louise Finch, better known as Scout, narrates this tale that covers roughly 2 years of her childhood starting from shortly before she started the 1st grade. The story is a mixture of many elements including a mysterious neighbor named Boo Radley, various coming of age issues regarding Scout and her brother Jem, and her father, Atticus, defending a black man accused of raping a white woman. As the story is set in Alabama in the 1930s, the rape case is particularly incendiary.To Kill a Mockingbird is such a classic piece of American literature that most people read it in high school. I somehow missed that experience and curiosity prompted me to pick it up and give it a try. While there were a few descriptions of rural southern life that ran on a bit long for my taste, the novel was well worth reading. For sheer entertainment value, I enjoyed the Boo Radley subplot the most as it is both mildly suspenseful and immensely interesting.Of course, the novel is most famous for the rape trial and this is also compelling in a fairly horrifying and very sad way. Harper Lee paints a vivid portrait of the extent to which African Americans were relegated to a status far below even second class in that place and time. Atticus Finch does a masterful job of defending the accused, but he knows that the all-white jury has practically cast their votes before ever entering the courtyard. The author uses the narrative voice of the children to highlight the blatant injustices and the outrage that any decent person would feel as a result. The technique is highly effective if not exactly subtle.To Kill a Mockingbird is easy to recommend. The story is interesting, the characters substantial, and the subject is still relevant today. It's a shame that Harper Lee has not published a second novel but this single book is likely to ensure that her voice will continue to be heard fro many years to come."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This timeless novel by Harper Lee is a semi-autobiographical story about a girl named Scout Finch growing up in 1930's Alabama. When her father, Atticus, is assigned to defend a black man on trial for rape, Scout must learn to keep her head high in spite of the taunting and threats of a town gone \\"stark raving mad\\". Scout's brother, Jem, represents adolescence and its uncertainty, while her friend, Dill, provides a more nave and straightforward point-of-view; with Scout's tenacity they form a balanced perspective on the discord that surrounds them. Their distant communication and friendship with the hermit Boo Radley teaches Scout that people are not always who they appear to be.The first-person narration by Scout as an adult is effective in making the reader feel like he or she has truly lived the story, and in allowing adults, as well as kids, to relate to the theme of growing up while facing adversity. Atticus, truly the model father, shows through example the values of courage, honesty, and respect. The different ways that Scout, Jem, and Dill, respond to the injustices they witness allow for great insight into the human character. To Kill a Mockingbird is known as a high-school staple for its message of courage and tolerance, but readers of all ages have been and will continue to be impacted by this poignant narrative."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This ever-popular, Pulitzer prize-winning novel is written from the first-person perspective of \\"Scout,\\" a young girl growing up in a small, segregated Alabama town during the Great Depression. I did not read any descriptions of the book before I began it, so it was fascinating as I began to realize what it was about. Its gentle, childlike, Tom Sawyer, heart-of-America cadence drew me in, but provided a counterpoint to the hypocrisy, racism, and bigotry that was revealed in the town little by little.The writing itself, of course, is excellent, telling the story subtly but powerfully - or perhaps the power is in its very subtlety. In my opinion, this is not the most compelling book I've ever read on this issue, but it is significant and memorable."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"You know it, when you have had a bad day at work, so you just go home, and you pull on your favourite woollen jumper - the one where you can smell the wool mix from the last time you washed it as you slip it over your head, and curl up with your favourite book.So often to kill a mocking bird will be that book.Life-affirming, that's probably a fair description - the passage at the end of Part 1, where Atticus is explaining to Jem about Mrs Henry Lafayette Dubose and courage, is a favourite."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Excellent read! Strong characters with a teasing story left me wanting more and more so I read it in one sitting over the thanksgiving break. The book was easy to fold back, the print was not harsh on my stigmatism and the feel of the book was great. The story was fascinating, engrossing, and I was totally captivated by the unfolding drama. The narrating character, scout, unveiled the hipocricy of americans in their attitudes towards people of a different color, different economic status, different religion, and people with disabilities. She allowed her reader, through literature, to see the human nature of many people to pass judgement on others without judging themselves first. A deep descriptin of social life in Alabama during the Great Depression and New Deal."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"atticus is a person that will do anything out of his way to satisfy what he needs to accomplish. he is not a person that in is in his own bubble and doesn't base his opinion on other people that negatively influence him.one major thing he helps out with is a black person that was innocently charged for raping Mayella ewell.atticus beliefs and nice values makes him the nicest person and is a good example for his children."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book years ago. My 14 year old granddaughter will be required to read this in her second semester of her freshman year in HS.

Harper Lee takes us on a journey of a young Alabama girl, Scout, who lives in the lazy town of Maycomb. In Maycomb, everyone has a certain social standing and they play by the rules of this society. This all changes when the town is rocked by court case that skews the dynamics of Maycomb: the formally polite Southern folk become vicious and unforgiving. Scout tells her story of being exposed to the cruelty that hatred can bring out in good people. The reader experiences a moral crises through the eyes of the innocent, which is deeply thought provoking. To Kill A Mockingbird will bring you to question not only the society of the 1940's, but also of today."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I had heard about this book for years. I saw the movie decades ago and decided to 'give it a try'. What great characters and insight into life as it was in 1935 in Alabama. A small portion of the book is about \\"the trial\\". The rest of it is character-rich, emotional everyday life situations that make it impossible to put the book down. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was required to read this book freshman year of high school and i'm glad I did because it changed my life. If I wasn't required to read it probably would have never have. It takes place in the south when racism is still heavily present and the langauge does get a little salty at points but it's not all that bad. It was a little dry at first but once you get to part two you're completley sucked in. The court scene was the part that changed my life. I absoultely adored Atticus Finch he's what inspired me to want to be a lawyer. This is an amazing read i say it's a great book to read late august early september.

Literary perfection."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In the novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, it tells a story of standing up for justice and what you know is right. It is told from the point of view of Scout, the daughter of a lawyer. 1935, in the peaceful town of Maycomb, Alabama, a disruption of sorts occurs. Tom Robinson, an African-American, is charged on account of raping a white girl. Of course, at that time, when a black man was charged with felony, he was immediately presumed guilty. Atticus Finch, a respected lawyer believes in his innocent and steps up to defend him. A trial must take place in all fairness and as Atticus calmly states the facts, he also reveals the real culprit. Atticus asks numerous small questions that seem unimportant. However, the evidence shown from the answers makes it clear. The final verdict... well, you'll have to read the book to find out.Meanwhile, Jem, Scout, and Dill have a little adventure of their own. Jem and Scout are the children of Atticus Finch. Dill is a strange boy who visits Maycomb every summer and comes to stay with his Aunt Caroline. They are determined to get the infamous Boo Radley out from his dark and mysterious house.This book caught my eye because I had always wanted to read this book, but I never even knew what it was about. Just by reading the front flap, it seemed really interesting. I loved this book because of Harper Lee's language. He made Scout describe all the things she saw in such beautiful ways. It was creative and really used your mind's eye. It was as if I could see every scene right in front of me. Also, he discussed so many issues that are going on in some parts of the world. For example: the racism is evident and discussed. I saw how there was a lesson and moral that rung clear as a bell. Racism was and still is a problem now. Although he was good at showing points from history, I thought the strongest part was his description. It was detailed and very imaginative. I absolutely LOVED this book and now it is one of my all time favorites. This book is a great classic and a must-read. If you liked this book, I would suggest other great literature books such as, Catcher in the Rye."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In the book: To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee, the author is very varied in the writing. It tells the story from a girl, Scout, who is normally dis-regarded. She tells the powerful story of her father, Atticus who decides to take on the case of a black man. During these hard times, her brother, Jem and Scout were often hurt and made fun of for her father's decision of taking on this specific case especially when the African- Americans were looked down upon. The children deal with hurt and emotions run high in this powerful novel. It is the type of book that makes you cry as the read the most powerful words ever put down on paper."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I reread this book semi-annually.

Harper did a great job in showing the point of view of a tomboyish girl called Scout who is just realizing the horrible secrets of her town and discovers more than she wanted to. This is a book everyone can relate to. If you haven't read this book go find a copy and read it now!!!!!!!!! I promise you'll love it as much as I do."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Twenty-five years after first reading it, I zipped through the story again. I wanted to understand why the novel has endured so thoroughly, and I think it has something to do with Lee's wise acknowledgement of the flawed South of her childhood filtered through the innocent eyes of a child. Or something like that. It doesn't hurt that the story is a page-turner."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I gave this book to my niece and she called me, weeping, the next week when she had finished it.

This fictional book is full of Courage and friendship with hard times to get through. It is based on three kids Dill, Jem, and Scout living in a world with troubling times, having to grow up real fast. This was a time when racism was something. In this book you will dicover the point of view of a seven year old girl, scout. Everything around her i changing."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is an interesting and complex book. The main character, Jean Louise, is well characterized as a young, inquisitive girl. Their are many twists and the real climax can be hard to find. The writer included several very convincing false climaxs in the book. The way it ends is not definitive and leaves you wanting a little more. This is helped along by the fact that the beginning states just a little of what happens later. This is the only thing that deters me from the book. It is a great intellectual book that requires much thought. Although that deters some people more than others."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's story of life in Alabama in the mid-thirties is amarvelous work of art at its best. Had seen the film, loved it, and am not sure how I missed reading the book until now.But, at age 74, I am so happy to have corrected that omission.My belated congratulations to Ms. Lee for telling a timeless story in an unforgettable manner. I consider it a book no serious reader should miss."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Even though 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is most definately one of the classics, it was a wonderful book that managed to keep my interest. One thing that struck me about this book was the absolutely amazing characterization. ALL of Harper Lee's characters are well thought out, and believable. I can easily see everyone, Atticus, Scout, Jem, Dill, even the Ewell's, as being a real, flesh-and-blood person.The book tells the story of a few years in Scout and Jem's life. They spend their summers gallavanting about with Dill, making up plays and spying on the neighbourhood recluse, Boo Radley. Scout struggles with becoming a lady, while previous passtimes include beating up other children.Then, Atticus takes on a case defending a black man of raping a white woman. The case throws the entire town into uproar. Scout and Jem now have to deal with the remarks of classmates, and disapproval from a part of the community.'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a book essential to anyone's library, and would be a good choice to help educate people on racism in the past."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Very happy with this product.

I could hardly wait to get it to read it again after several years. It showed up only days after I had purchased it which was nice..."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book probably 35 - 40 years ago as a young teenager and had forgotten about it until I came across the movie on TCM (Turner Classic Movies) which shows up every so often in their schedule. Anyway, I wanted to read the book again because it was an intriguing book and the subject matter was race relations in the old south. Author Harper Lee never wrote another novel as successful as this one but if one had to write an only novel in ones lifetime, this was the kind of book to write.It was painful to read the old practices of the old south because racial prejudice was so prevalent back then that confronting it was not advisable. The story of the Finch family and the perspective from Scout and Jem's point of view makes the story so inspiring and touching because it represented the hope of better race relations based on what they had witnessed in the court room. The young children of Atticus Finch were the epitome of hope in raising the hood over the ignorant blind rage of bigotry.There are other characters in the novel worth reading about. If you live in the southern part of the United States, some of these people are very familiar to you. They are your uncles,aunts, cousins, neighbors and acquaintances. They are as familiar as sunrise. The character of Boo Radley and the Radley family was enough to make you keep reading. The climactic end was so satisfying.Learn from the book - and study other people. It will help you with a better understanding of who you are as a person with prejudice, even if you believe that you have none. We all have prejudices - it's just the way it is. The key is to learn about them and try to unlearn them, especially when it comes to dealing with other people other than yourself."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I'm sure I read this book a long time ago, but I had forgotten the story. It was a delight to read it again and to be reminded of what life was like when I was a child....the things we talked about, the ways we reacted to things, etc. This time, it was really hard to put it down at night and go to bed!The main theme of the book was the somber truth, though, and just a terribly sad part of our history.I highly recommend this to anybody, whether you read it 40 years ago or not."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To kill a mockingbird takes place in Macomb, Alabama. Maycomb is a quiet, innocent little town until one day when a Blackman raped a white woman. You follow the life Scout Finch, who is the young girl, she has a brother Jem, and their father is called Atticus and he is a lawyer. Their mom died when Scout and Jem were both young; therefore, Atticus have a black nanny called Calpurnia employed, who helps raising the children. During the book Atticus have to defend a Blackman, Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Butch, and in the times of the 1930ies a Blackman's word is worth nothing against a white man's. The Finch's has neighbour called Boo Radley, who Scout and Jem find quite scary and evil. But as the children get older and wiser they start to see things from other points of views and develop more understanding about.After a couple of long pages the book became better and better. Things got placed where they belonged and you could feel how the life in Maycomb was like. I liked the description as I went along, it's not too short, so you don't understand anything, and at the same time not to long, so you don't fall asleep and the choice of word is thought-thorugh (as Lee went over it over and over again) but not to complicated. As the book discusses serious racial issues you see the view of it from two sides, one from the majority of the people in Maycomb and one from Scouts father, Atticus. Atticus is several times accused of being a \\"niggerlover\\", but he tells his children not to bother about it. Atticus is my own favourite characters because he has got a character, he has everything under control and keeps \\"cool\\" all the time. Every once in a while there is small things happening to the main characters that is nothing really special, but on a second though it teaches the reader about something. about the characters in Maycomb, or about how they are in there minds. And of course, as usual, the book is better than the movie. I think the book is a very well written book and I would recommend it to anyone that has some spare time to dedicate to a work of art."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I taught this book in summer school, and every chapter had a wealth of vocabulary words, not to mention a great story with many underlying themes to be explored in discussion and essays. An all-around great book that touches on many important issues like race and prejudice; filled with wonderful southern characters. I showed &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; in class to give the kids an idea of life in rural Alabama during the depression, then started a three week study of the novel. It is one of my favorites and should not be missed by anyone: teacher, student, or lover of American literature."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In my opinion, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was both entertaining and educational. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book, and, under normal circumstances, I do not read purely for enjoyment. However, I feel that most anyone could read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD purely for enjoyment and come out having learned, in a unique way, how the South was, and in many ways still is. The book brings to light many problems that are so very simple, yet nearly impossible to solve. This novel is a mere tool for dealing with the simple minded problems such as prejudice and hypocrisy."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"When I started reading this book I just could not put it down. The story was told through the eyes of a little girl in Alabama during the depression. The plot revolves around the trial of a black man and a white girl. It has many themes; race, predjudice, class and fear are just a few. The hero of this book was Atticus because he stood up for a black man in a time when it was very much looked down on. Atticus is the father of the narrator and also the lawyer. He stands up for Tom while everyone else in the town is looking for murder or revernge. His self-confidence and control is what really stand out and make this book. For it being in a time when blacks were blacks and whites were whites, Atticus really shows a another and better way."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I am sure that I am not the only one who considers To Kill a Mockingbird their favorite book. I was required to read this book in grade school, and my resentment for being forced to do so quickly turned into a hunger to finish it, read it again, and numerous times thereafter. I know of few other books that I can say this about. The charaters are endearing, and the story is incredibly written. Everyone should read it at least once in a lifetime."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"When I hear the word &quot;classic,&quot; I almost always think about &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird.&quot; Even after reading the novel ten times, I find something new and exciting within its pages. Scout Finch is an audacious six year old who grows up during &quot;Mockingbird.&quot; She and her brother Jem and their neighbor friend Dill spend their time play-acting and bugging the neighborhood. When their father, Atticus, becomes lawyer for an unwinnable case defending a black man, their lives do a flip-dee-flop. Harper Lee tells an engrossingly wonderful and heartfelt story that every American should read at least two times!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I thought To Kill A Mocking Bird was a really good book The author, Harper Lee does a really good job of tricking you into thinking you know exactly what is going to happen and then the unthinkable happens. My favorite part was the end when the last thing you think could possibly happen actually happens. This book is fiction but it sounds as though it could or really has happened. The story takes place in Alabama, 1932 during segregation. It is told by Scout, an eight year old girl who does not want to grow up. She has an older brother named Jem and every summer their friend Dill comes up and visits them. They play games and try and get their creepy neighbor who never comes out, to come out. I think if the story had been told by Jem it would be totally different and the points of view would be very different. I thought it was a very good book because something is always happening and you can't put it down. I highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This beautifully written story of a southern family is a masterpiece of American literature. I can only assume that the negative comments written below are the result of deliberate sabotage or ignorance. It is a heart-wrenching and heartwarming tale that superbly reflects the times, including the very real presence of race and gender discrimination. An astonishing read that helps us appreciate just how far we've come and how far we've got to go."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"What an incredible piece of work! I really enjoyed this book. It gave me Southern life during the great depression, and taught me a little something too. Scout is rambunctious and spunky, her adventures with Jem and Dill made me laugh quite a few times. Atticus is quite impressive, he had a sense of justice and an intelligence I've never seen in anyone. This is a real life story, if not true, and it'll make you really think about the predjudices we hold against other people."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird contains criticism of the prejudice and moral laziness that allowed Southern society to have a double standard of justice. The novel also presents a somewhat optimistic view of white Southerners that was somewhat unusual at the time the novel appeared. The story indicates there are good human beings like Atticus Finch everywhere, even in the midst of a corrupt society. Even those who do wrong, the novel goes on to suggest, often act out of ignorance and weakness rather than a deliberate impulse to hurt others.Another theme of the novel is the transition from innocence to experience. At the beginning of the story Scout's world is limited to the boundaries of her immediate neighborhood. She feels safe and secure, and totally confident that the way things are done in her home is not just the right way, but the only way. The arrival of Dill, who comes from a broken home and has lived in another state, gives Scout her first hint of a variety of experiences beyond her narrow horizons. Then, on her first day of school, she begins to discover that not everyone agrees that the way things are done in Maycomb, Alabama, is necessarily correct. She also learns that sometimes it is necessary to compromise in order to get along. Even though Scout's teacher's ideas about how to teach reading may be wrong, Scout must respect the teacher's authority. Her own father advises her to ignore the teacher's ban on reading at home, but to pretend to go along with the teacher's methods while in the classroom. This kind of social hypocrisy is new to Scout, and she is surprised to hear her very moral father advocating it.Related to the theme of innocence and experience is the novel's suggestion that innocent children can often see large moral issues more clearly than adults. Scout, Jem, and Dill never waver in their horror at the injustice done to Tom Robinson. The adults in the story, however, see all the complexities of the situation to the point of being blinded to the central issue of right and wrong. However much Scout may grow through her exposure to new experiences, one hopes that she will never lose her childlike undertaking of justice. In the view of this novel's author, justice is a simple concept. To recognize the difference between justice and injustice does not take any special degree of wisdom or sophistication. In fact, the learned members of the community--such as the judge and prosecutor--and the proudly religious Baptists who are spectators at the trial are, willingly or not, allied with the machinery of injustice."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is the best book to read to understand the evil and human price paid because of racial prejudice. Outstanding in every possible way. Thank God for creating Harper Lee!!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I absolutely love this story. It is my all-time favorite.Tom Robinson is a negro who has been falsely accused of raping a white woman in Alabama in the 1930's. Atticus is a lawyer whois appointed by the court to defend him. The story shows how Atticus' family and his friends deal with the racial hatreds and other social conflicts that result from his participation in the case.The beauty of the writing is that it is told through the eyes of Atticus's little daughter, Jean Louise, \\"Scout,\\" who is such an endearing and appealing child. Lee doesn't over-romanticize the wisdom of a child. Scout and her older brother Jem are completely natural characters who emerge as heroic figures.There are so many other memorable characters that it seems impossible that this novel could be only 323 pages long. There is Scout and Jem's annual summertime friend, Dill. There is the family maid and de facto female head of household, Calpurnia. There is the painfully naive and judgmental Miss Caroline, a recent graduate from ed school who is assigned to teach Scout's first-grade class. There is Boo Radley, the town's mysterious recluse. There is the \\"white trash\\" family that started all the trouble with their accusation of rape. Above all, there is Atticus himself, a figure of towering integrity, love, and loyalty.As wonderful as the book is all the way through, I must call special attention to Chapter 15, where the eight-year-old Scout, with simple love and unconscious courage, tames a gang of thugs who have assembled at the local jail to lynch Tom Robinson. This is a very moving chapter.It is pretty amazing that a writer who could create so many memorable characters in so few pages confined herself to this one novel as her lifetime output."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"A true American classic. The only book/film tandem in American history that are both 5 stars... Could anyone other than Gregory Peck play Atticus who is so well portrayed in this tale? No."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Well, this is another classic novel that I hadn't yet read....hadn't seen the movie...didn't really know much of anything about it at all. I basically knew that this was a book set in Alabama in the 1930s and it involved a legal case with some sort of racial tension. In honor of its 50th anniversary, I decided it was high time I pick it up and get to it.Right from the start I was drawn in by the youthful, vibrant voice of Scout, the 8 year old narrator. I absolutely loved the way she described the town, the county, the people and everything in her life. She has such an innocent and honest way of drawing the reader in. Her simple storytelling narrative is humorous and disarming (which comes in handy as the theme gets heavier). She did a wonderful job of painting an accurate description (at least as far as I'm concerned) of 1930s Alabama. I really felt like I was there...like I knew and understood (at least through the eyes of a child) the people of Maycomb.As I read, I kept waiting for \\"the shoe to drop.\\" I knew that there was a trial somewhere in this book and that it had some climactic underpinnings in the plot. As the story continued, I kept telling myself not to worry about the trial...that it would come eventually and that I should just enjoy the wonderful writing. Harper Lee made it easy to forget the other problems that were coming up (the trial) and keep us engaged in the intrigue and curiosity of Scout, Jem and Dill. I loved the various \\"side stories\\" along the way. They gave great insight into the characters in the town as well as the character of the society/community.Slowly (but very interestingly) we finally arrive at the trial. The tension is huge naturally and Scout is worried. Because of her young age, some of the details she focuses on and her reactions are a little different than might be expected. It was cool to see Jem's reaction through her eyes (as he gripped the railing so tightly his knuckles turned white). I absolutely loved her confused and innocent reaction to the outcome of the trial.What I found even more interesting is that when the trial ended, there were still a considerable number of pages left in the book. I thought perhaps it would follow an appeals process or something but was glad that the rest of the story was much more engaging than just more courtroom drama.I loved (and at the same time was disgusted) by the hypocritical action and behavior of the townsfolk after the trial as compared to their behavior before hand. Most telling was the conversation at the afternoon meeting of the ladies that Scout was compelled to join with her aunt. The way they almost acknowledged Tom's innocence and Atticus's benevolence and saying that Tom would have been fine if he'd been patient.Then the conversation about Hitler and the Jews was an excellent counterpoint to the racial tension. I loved the way that Scout could sense that there was a disconnect in the behavior/talk/action of the townsfolk as they discussed Hitler after behaving the way they did towards Blacks. She could sense something was wrong and could almost quantify the nature of the disconnect, but she had a hard time acknowledging that there could be such a broad disconnect in the minds of people.As we reach the end of the book, another climactic event sets events into turmoil. I \\"predicted\\" one potential \\"sad\\" ending for the book and was actually relieved to see the book turn out the way it did. There was still a degree of ambiguity as to exactly what happened, but I agree with Heck that there are times when things should be left alone. Regardless of what actually/definitively happened, the end result is good for the community. I'm a little concerned to know what happens to the Ewells and to Boo, but those sort of \\"loose ends\\" are to be expected in a novel with such an extensive depth.There are so many wonderful themes in this book. The racial tension and description of southern life and souther racism are at the forefront. But Lee also explores themes of class and family structure, moral courage and the nature of innocence. The idea of innocence was especially interesting to me and felt especially poignant with the book coming from the voice of a young child going through such adult ordeals. Scout's innocence about the world slowly fades as she watches the destruction of Tom's innocence as well as having her conceptions of Boo Radley transform from one of horror/monster to innocent and heroic.I am very glad I finally got around to reading this book. I feel like it is a great commentary on culture, society and prejudice. I loved the narrative voice, the humor and fun way such a heavy bunch of themes were presented. I really enjoyed the discussions between Scout, Atticus, Jem and the others. The characters were deep and very well developed and provided great depth to the story. There are so many small threads running through the story that I'm sure there is a lot to digest beyond the first read (aspects such as the fire, the teaching methods in the school, the various gifts in the tree, the other inhabitants on Scout's street, etc). This is a rich and wonderful novel that I will gladly read again.*****5 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"For a person who tends to be overly critical of religious institutions, I am hardly ever critical of \\"good\\" religious people. In this book, there's an exemplar of what a good religious-Christian person is in Atticus Finch. For anyone who thinks this book is solely about racism, which I did prior to having read it or even having seen the movie-adaptation, would be a gross oversimplification of the novel. It's an exploration in morality and Lee uses a very powerful vehicle: Children. Children learn through, what most call growing up, socialization and the social norms and understandings guiding everyday life. Here, Lee focuses on primary agents, notably the family. You see a stark contrast within the Finch family between Atticus and his \\"proper\\" sister Alexandra. The morality each shares is different. Therefore, it stands to reason that children will think in very different moral terms.Using children is powerful because in many ways, they are a tabula rosa. However, if you have an extraordinary person like an Atticus Finch teaching morality, then you realize that the social word is full of immorality and illogicalness. This is what Harper Lee points out with the problems of Social Inequality, of a pseudo-Caste system, and of racism. Both Jem and Scout see and come into conflict with these ideas in major and minor things: Who is acceptable to bring home to dinner all the way to institutional racism within the legal system. These are norms and values most people accept in the town. However, she implicitly points out that that everyone is a product of some environment and some way of learning: As Atticus tells Scout and Jem to put themselves in others skin before they act... They understand why some people act the way they do, such as poor Boo Radley. What this does is point that there is both good and evil in people but if you got to know them... you'd see the good. Although she does give a caveat later in the novel about how some people can never be reached. In the end, there is good and there is evil... and they both co-exist."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I had two purposes, prompted by the 50th anniversary of publication.1. Is the book worth reading (or hearing) for those of us who haven't read it for many years, if not decades? Answer: absolutely. The novel is still wonderful, with such finely drawn, memorable characters in a story that is straightforward and easy to understand in its morals and message.2. How is the narration by Sissy Spacek and does the novel work while listening in the car? Ms. Spacek is excellent, with her acting talent applied generously. I have no idea whether she had to work at the Alabama sound, but to this Yankee she did not sound unnatural at all, including presentation of young Scout and Jem. Even without demonstrating exceptional range in distinguishing among the characters, I really liked the pacing and general sound. Drive-time fiction can be a challenge when there is mystery and suspense, as \\"can't put it down\\" could be problematic. In this case, I already knew the basics of what would happen, so calling it quits and picking up later was ok."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I had put off writing this review for a long time because, really, what can one say about this memorable, widely popular coming-of-age story except that there is a good reason To Kill a Mockingbird was voted one of the best novels of the twentieth century by librarians across the U.S.For you contrarians who haven't read the book, this is the story of the Finch family told from daughter Scout's point of view. Scout's attorney father, Atticus, is defending a black man accused of raping a young white woman in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama. The story is set years before the civil rights movement began, and the plot is a catalyst for a novel that is so much more than a scathing commentary on racism in the deep south. This is a gripping, gritty portrayal about growing up amidst the fury, ignorance, intolerance, and fear that fueled peoples' lives and thoughts, and still does, to varying degrees.Like many people, I first read this novel through our school's curriculum about forty years ago. Five years ago, my daughter read it in her high school English class and she loved it too.

Now as a literature instructor I have read many novels, both new and old; I have not yet uncovered a text so rich in revelations of the common thread of humanity. I now teach this book as the core of a Civil Rights unit, dealing primarily with the 60's era in the united States.

For this reader, the most emotional part of this terrific, terrific piece of work comes as Atticus is leaving the courtroom after Tom Robinson's guilty verdict. The reverend for the black community whispers to Scout, &quot;Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passing.&quot; How many of us would hope that our life's work would command such respect? Standing on the Radley porch at the novel's closing moments, Scout gives a stirring retrospect of the last three years--she had never seen her town from this angle before and so, sees her life in a different perspective with one season giving way to another: Autumn again and Boo's children needed him."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at this book.

I was bored one afternoon and asked him if I could borrow his book so that I could check out what his summer reading assignment would be. Well, I sat on the porch most of the day reading and had a hard time putting the book down. It's wonderful for all ages....it has lessons that all of us can benefit from. Scout is a wonderful character, I can see why so many people name their children (Demi Moore) and their pets (my dentist) after her!I recommend this book for anyone who is hesitant...who may have read it years ago and doesn't remember it well, or who didn't enjoy it then.

The truth is that when I had to read this bok it was so that I could write a book report. I was sure this book would be so boring. But then I started it and I read it in 2 days (I couldn't put it down!) To Kill a Mockingbird deliveers strong messages of conscience and the realization of how strongly racial prejudice is embedded in the hearts of some people. The book mainly tackled issues of discrimination , but you will be surprised at how NOT run-of-the-mill it is in comparison with other books of the same topic. The narration by Scout is perfect, the metaphors of Mr Raymond, Boo Radley and of course Tom Robinson as mockingbirds is pure genius. I really think everyone who has the ability to read should get this book.You will undoubtedly fall in love with it. And when you read it a second time the very first page suddenly becomes so much clearer!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. That's hard to say because I've read a lot of books. I never imagined I would enjoy a book we were assigned to read in school. I literally almost cried during some of the book. Right now we are supposed to be on chapter 17. I finished it - twice. This is a beautifully written book. The way the author can put all of this together in one little girl's mind is remarkable. Like the book says &quot;It's a sin to kill a mockingbird.&quot;"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"A compelling novel about the challanges we face everyday.

He fights against the accuser Mayella Ewell, a white girl who is the daughter of the town's well-known, immoral family. Believe me-you CAN'T PUT THE BOOK DOWN! A great novel I would really recommend to anyone!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The place is Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's. The book is told through the eyes of Scout Finch, an eight- year old girl. At first you get to read about things as they are \\"today\\", and then the book actually begins by leading us in to the three-year journey through the life of Scout, her brother Jem and her father Atticus that led to how things are \\"today\\". Atticus Finch is a trial lawyer representing Tom Robinson, a young black man accused of raping a white woman. This is the very central thing about this book: Atticus is white and he represents a black man, which is a very controversial thing to do in Maycomb at that time. Robinson is found guilty and he is sentenced to life, al though it is clear to everyone he is innocent. It is this case that presents the ugly, racist side of Maycomb. The things concerning the case happen mostly in the second part of the book. In the first part Lee concentrates on telling about Scout's and Jem's relations with the towns other people. Hear you find many unpleasant people and Atticus is forced to explain a lot of things to Scout and Jem about why people act the way they do sometimes. But all in all I would say that Scout and Jem were very happy, because they had a loving and wise father and although their mother had died when they were very little they had a black cook, Calpurnia, who was kind of a mother figure for them, a part of the family. This book is very good in many ways. I love Atticus as a character because he holds such wisdom and because he really is a man who stands by his principals through the whole book. I noted these words by Atticus because I think they say it all: 'You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view - until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.' I think it was very clever of Lee to tell things through the eyes of a child: You read about a child's thoughts and feelings but at the same time there is a very mature side to the text.Another good thing about the book is that although the first half of the book was sometimes quite \\"slow\\" the end was so good that I must say this book is worth reading again. It is truly an unforgettable novel about fatherhood, honesty and justice."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"&quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; is about growing up in a lazy town in South. The story focuses upon two young children and last throughout a few year period. The main character is a stubborn little tom girl named Scout who is very adventurous and completely innocent at heart. Her father is a lawyer who is a great person morally and will always stand up for what's right. One day, a case comes into town about a black raping a white girl, and the father, Atticus, is assigned to the trial. The whole town is shaken up by this case since the old talk of the town was a confined neighbor by the name of Boo. The racism issue comes into play during the trial. The part that shows how wrong the racism is, is that a little girl, free of any past experiences or any hatred, is amongh the few that realize the extreme wrongness that is taking place. This book can be taken on at the least two levels. The higher level is much more extreme in the overall moral being displayed. This is one of my favorite books because of the amazing way that such a deep feeling and concept of &quot;wrongness&quot; is brought to a reader through words. Without a doubt, this is recomended to anyone who can read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is very inspirational, and good read. It describes the setting of the southern living back in the day of slavery. The plot of the story is, Scout Finch, daughter of Atticus Finch, watches her father defend a black man, who is accused of rape. This is a fun story, compassionate, loving, and dramatic. I believe all people should read this, sometime in their education, that way they can be inspired and learn from their adventure."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Everyone else has said it all. I don't know how I avoided this book for so long, but I did, until a week ago. What makes it a classic? Harper Lee could have written that book last week instead of 50+ years ago.

Luckily, there are still people like Atticus Finch to uphold moral values."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is one of the best books I have read in my entire life. In a small Alabama town, a trial against a black man named Tom Robinson shakes up the whole town, when Tom Robinson is falsely accused of rape. This is told through the eyes of a tomboy, Scout Finch, who encounters moral questions along the way while her father defends Tom Robinson. The parts about her first experiences in 1st grade are wonderfully humorous :) This is an enthralling book, and a true classic. What I think the author is saying about mockingbirds and Tom Robinson, is that it is a sin to kill either, with a BB gun or prejudice, because they are both innocent."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This was one of the books I have been wanting to read since my daughter was in school.

Besides, you would be doing yourself a great disservice not to read that amazing novel."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Tom Robinson is accused of a crime he didn't commit and when Atticus Finch is assigned as his defense attorney the lawyer knows he has a difficult task ahead. Atticus not only has the burden of proving Robinson's innocence, but of convincing a southern jury that they must see past the color of Tom's skin and realize an innocent man is an innocent man even if he is black.This book is an excellent example of well crafted American literature and should be in the library of any bibliophile. Lee re-creates the feelings and attitudes of many southern states through the eyes of Scout, a female character that has been an inspiration to many girls. Scout has an interesting perspective on the events of her town as she is both a child and raised by an open minded white-man in a time when being open-minded could get you killed. Lee's descriptions and dialogue fit perfectly with the mindset of the girl as she grows and we see as unbiased a picture of the town and the people in it as possible to see.Lee's message is still relevant today and while this book has been labeled as one of the \\"classics\\", it is still something we can feel and see today although the prejudices have changed.

I didn't know that there was such as thing as 'racial-segregation'.It was in reading this book as a young girl that I realized then that racism did not end there. As a little girl I had seen Alex Haley's Roots and the rise of black power but I had no idea that Southern parts of the US did not move on with the times. To me we had Duke Ellington records, we loved Michael Jackson and Jimmy Hendrix and thought the rat pack with Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. as typical of modern America.Reading the America less known through Harper Lee's eyes as a little girl brought home to me a dark side I never knew. We were West Coast trans-continental immigrants who moved to lower middle-class multi-racial neighborhood and couldn't imagine the backward South.Having read it then opened my eyes and changed me and my outlook forever towards, race, justice and even childhood. I took those lessons with me that season and together with Graham Green's The Quiet American and Leon Uris' Exodus have since continued to expand my understanding of the world by traveling and sharing with other people.No one who has read this can ignore the increasing racism and radicalism prevalent wi America's right today and not be harkened back.As a measure, I am buying this book in French for my 15-year old daughter so she understands that once in America justice was not available for people of color. I want her to know that heroes come in all shapes and sizes and that it is principle that makes one.It could be the lawyer dad or the freakish son of the neighbors."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This story points out racism in South America in the 1930s. It is related through the gullible eyes of an 8 year-old girl, Scout, who spends a lot of time with her brother Jem and a friend, exploring the world around them. They spy on their neighbour because they have never seen him outside and keep on imagining he is a ghost. This is the children's world, rather nice and funny.On the other hand, there is another world, more serious. The one of their father, Atticus Finch, a court-appointed lawyer who fights for a black man, unfairly charged with having raped a white girl. Atticus is a really good man; a model of integrity for nowadays' lawyers. That is why, when he get insulted because of the case, Scout can't help asking herself questions and trying to understand what he did wrong.We witness a trial, which implies facing all the social prejudices of the 1930s, narrated by a little child who realises that there is unfairness, good and evil.

And where better to get a candid view of life - all its quirks, little joys, terrible meanness, and what is truly important - than through the eyes of an unworldly, but wise, child (Scout). But here lies the power in Harper Lee's mid-20th century story, To Kill a Mockingbird. In one sense it offers little more than some visits over a few years with Scout, her brother, Jem, and their father, Atticus - along with associated kinfolk, neighbors, and small town notables - but it gives to you the feeling that you haven't been alone in how and what you felt as a child, and what you knew and always will know was right and wrong; and the irreconcilable despair you felt and feel when you haven't much control over the bad things that happen.Scout's family is somewhat enigmatic; her mother has passed away, her father is a lawyer and elected state government representative, and she and her brother are both well read, intelligent, and sensitive. This lends some of the objectivity to the story as she witnesses and experiences ignorance and disdain for non-conformance. It also provides clarity and incisiveness in illuminating readers about the extent of discrimination - very pervasive and practiced during this time period - against the town's black people, and in particular, a black man accused of a crime who is being represented by Scout's father.Knocking around from her adventures in elementary school, summer playtimes in outdoors - where imagination was the roux of recipes for fun, excitement, and inevitably trouble - visits with neighbors, Q & A with her lawyer-father, her relationships with the townspeople, etc. - the perennially inquisitive Scout collects and analyzes information and tries to make sense of it all.Told through dialogue, observations, and reflections that embody the simple and mundane activities of day to day life in small-town Alabama during the depression, the story always seems lively and fresh with Scout's sense of humor, as she struggles to understand the world she lives in and the people who are part of it. The closeness, honesty, and love shared by her small family - always in their own way - warms you like a wood fire on a chilly night, and leaves you with a glow with which to remember it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I can't believe I hadn't read this book until now.

First, our teacher announced this is her favorite book of all times. Second, I absolutely detested theo ther books we had to read, Potok's The Chosen, for example. But when I first received the book and started reading, I was awed. The use of language and vocabulary weere stunning and remarkbale. THe book is brutally honest, using original profanities used at the time in 1935 Alabama, but that did not tarnish the brilliance of the book. The tension escalates during Atticus' defense, and resolves in a tragic yet credible ending. However, the book taught a lesson that we would never forget.What made this book special to me is the moments between Atticus and his children. The dialogues are witty and at times funny that made me laugh out loud (the second book in my 15 years to do that). The plot is slow moving, yes, but that built the tension and kept you at your seat through the 200+ pages."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"'To Kill a mocking bird' is a tapestry of anectodes vividly brought out by an excellent american raconteur - Harper Lee. It's a narration of the childhood days of a girl nicknamed Scout, who is too intelligent for her age with the intransigence of a child, in which her apparently dull & talentless father, Atticus Finch, reveals his heroism through his headstrong uprightness & optimism to rebel against the amoral racist prejudices of his village.The beauty of this book is its style, which is effective in convincing the reader that the whole story is from the viewpoint of an immature young girl. Lee achieves this by intertwining the main plot, as if it were unimportant (from the girl's viewpoint), with the story of a mysterious neighbour Boo Radley, whom the trio of Scout, Jem - Scout's tutelary elder brother and Dill - their friend, set out to discover. The quiet wit that is strewn all over is another plus that makes it an unstoppable read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird deals with the theme of racism in a prejudice society. The main conflict in this book is the trial of a black man, Tom Robinson, for the alleged rape of a Miss. Mayella Ewell a white girl. The dilemma throught this book is whether or not the fair trial of a black man is possible in the deep South, and if justice truly does prevail. The novel is narrated through the eyes of Scout, a seven year old tomboy who is quickly learning of the existance of prejudice in the society she lives. Her father, Atticus Finch is a well-respected lawyer who takes on the case of Tom Robinson.Aside, from the obvious theme of prejudice the author has also created a mysterious character that is the center of intrigue to the population Maycomb. The purpose of this character, who is Boo Radley, is unknown to the reader and to both Scout and her brother Jem. They become obsessed with him and won't give up their struggle to discover his true identity, aluckily for the reader they do. This mysterious character ends up playing a very important role in the outcome of the novel.Regardless of age, this novel will touch people on a personal level. It will make the reader think and xplore the ramifications of hate and discrimination. At least this will be the case if there is to remian the hope that racism, predjudice and discrimination will someday be irradicated.

Ms Lee has a way of capturing your heart, so you don't ever want to put down the book.The story follows Jean Louise Finch, a.k.a. Scout. Scout narrates her life in the boring little County of Maycomb, Alabama. Life is good until her father, Atticus Finch, starts defending a black man against the accusation of rape of a white woman. Scout and her brother, Jeremy Atticus Finch, a.k.a. Jem, are teased a lot about it by both children and adults, for, at that time, whites were very much against blacks. Both Scout and Jem are going through a lot, for they are both growing up and, having no mother, life is a bit tough. In the mean time, a boy called Charles Baker Harris, a.k.a. Dill, comes to stay with a neighbor and the three become good friends. In this context, the story is about their whole lives and the wicked plans they come up with. In the end, Scout finds that, if you get to know a person, you always find they're very nice.This is one of those books that, when you finish reading, you just can't find the right words to describe it and it's so amazing that there are no words to describe it! I have to congratulate Ms. Lee on her amazing book and her extraordinary talent for writing.I would recommend this book for people of atleast 12 years of age, for the language might not be understood by younger people. This book is good for people who want to just curl up in bed and read, read, read, till they can read no more. I guarantee more than just satisfaction to anyone who reads it!My only complaint is this: the book shouldn't ever finish!

For me, the best part is Boo Radley, the man who stays cooped up in his house all the time, and the rumors that people like Stephanie Crawford spread about him. The ending is great, and is what I was hoping it would be like. You should definately read this book!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book tries to do so much, and actually succeeds. It combines mystery with morality and intrigue. You cannot read this book and not be touched deeply by it.The basic story is seen through the eyes of a child. This child's father is hired to represent a black man who is standing trial for raping a white woman in a racist town.Bottom line: This book is excellently written and deeply moving. One of the all-time bests."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I had to read this book in school and it was pretty good for an educational book. It had many adventures and exciting parts in it. It is about a woman named Scout who is in her thirties. She is narrarating her memories from when she was 6-10 years old. Some memories she talks about include how she and her brother Jem would always walk by the Radley house. They would sometimes find small presents in the knothole of the tree outside and they knew Boo (Arthur) Radley would come out a night to put them there. His brother Nathan wasn't supposed to let him out of the house and Boo had been locked up for the past 15 or so years (ever since he was 16). Another event that takes place is that Atticus, Scout and Jem's dad, is the lawyer representing a black man who has been accused of rape. Many people in the town are racist and don't think he should represent the case but he has to, to keep his moral value. This book takes place in the 1930's. The only reason why I didn't give this book five stars was that it isn't my type of genre, I don't really like historical fiction type stories, but other wise this book was very good!!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Delightful dialogue, lots of pearls of wisdom from Atticus to Scout and Jem(father to kids), and a surrealstic view of the South in that period through the eyes of Scout- a pre-teen, confident and spunky narrator."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"First read this book at age 12 and have read this book often over the years since.The main characters are clear and fine. The subject of the trial and human nature at it's worst is dark and shameful. Atticus Finch shines a light on this world and tries to uplift it, as observed through the eyes of his children. He teaches them through his example, truly he teaches us all."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Like many of the reviewers i had to read this book at school,and was not looking forward to it. But to my suprise ,i found it really refreshing and after a slow start ,i really got into it. It is a truthful and definetly a book for those who are openminded and understanding. Although it gives a rough description of the south,it doesn't make the south seem unpleasant but just illustrates the racism ,predudice and class system that exists to this very day. I will keep this book with me for times to come,a definete classic for all ages."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book has been a favorite since 10th grade (that's been many many years)! Each time I read it, it still captivates me and I learn more from it. It's a wonderful story."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book i found quite compelling. It was an easy read, but made your mind wonder to far off places. Harper Lee illustrates each moment so tediously that you find you yourself become apart of the adventures with Scout, Jem, Atticus, Dill, and Boo Radley. YOu feel for the characters as if they were really special to you. I would recommend this book for someone who definitely knows they can understand this book, for there is far deeper meaning within itself. It also reviews black racism in an interesting way.Atticus is a lawyer and father to Jem and Scout. The town of Maycomb assigns him to defend an African American. You see what happens to this upper class family through the stages of this task. You are shown what happens between the towns people and this family and how many of them become dynamic characters. Changing their views and beliefs.Would reccomend this to anyone who is a good reader and has a little interest in historical fiction."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This controversial book, published in the 1940s, is about a black man brought to trial under the crime of raping a white woman. The setting is in a small town in Alabama called Maycomb County. The main characters are Atticus Finch, a lawyer, Jean Louise (Scout) Finch, and Jem Finch. Scout and Jem , Atticus's two young children, start out as ages 6 and 10 at the beginning of the book, slowly growing older as the book progresses. In the first half, Jem, Scout and their friend Dill have small adventures during the summers when Dill visits. Dill has a fascination with Boo Radley, a neighbor of the Finch's. He lives in a house with his brother and never comes out, to the town's knowledge. The trio tries several times to make him come outside with no success. Eventually they move on to other things.In the middle of the book, the trial comes around and Atticus Finch is selected to defend Tom Robinson, the accused black man. Scout learns what a \\"n_____-lover\\" is after repeatedly hearing herself and her father called one. The first time a young boy calls her a n_____-lover at school, she promptly starts a fight with him, even though she hadn't known the definition of it yet. After a stern lecture from her father, she promises not to fight with anyone ever again. She breaks that promise when she goes to her aunt's house on Thanksgiving and is taunted by her second cousin. Atticus faces problems around town before the trial. Mobs seek to hurt him while Atticus is guarding Tom's jail cell door late at night. The group of angry men recede after Scout, Jem and Dill come running up to Atticus and Scout has a friendly, somewhat one-sided converation with Mr. Cunningham, one of the men in the mob.I enjoyed this book because it portrayed the image of what the black people had to go through in the South, even after the Civil War and slavery had long passed. They were always second-rate and treated very poorly. I would recommend this book to any middle school to high school student."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I thought this book was a really good book, considering this is the second book that I ever finished reading in my life. This book talks about how strong people feel about racism back in the days, and it is still strong today, but the only difference is that back then people was racist to African Americans, but nowadays there's racism toward Whites, Blacks, Asians, Arabs, etc. That's what I like about this book, it is talking about something that existed back then that is still existing today, so we can see how Jem and Scout is feeling when an innocent man is pleaded guilty and guilty man is free. This also shows how 2 kids perspective on African American people could change in one event. I could relate to this because I use to think African American people were bad since the movies and shows portrayed them as bad people, but when I met my first black friend in middle school my whole perspective on African American people changed.I recommend this book to anybody who is interested in seeing how 2 kids could change their whole perspective about racism in one event. They knew that other humans are treating a human being the wrong way just because of their skin color. I think this book could relate to anybody because everybody meets another person who is not their own race before and probably treated them the wrong way because they were different, but after a while their attitude towards them changed because they were able to get to know them, and realize that they are not really that different from each other."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a MockingbirdHarper LeeScout remembered her father saying, \\"You never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.\\" At the end of the novel she says, \\"Just standing on the Radley porch was enough.\\" To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic novel about growing up and the loss of childhood innocence. One of the major themes of the novel revolves around the meaning of courage. Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch is growing up in the 1930's in a small Alabama town. Her single father, Atticus, is a well-respected attorney. Readers are taken through a period of three years in the lives of the children and their neighbors. A fire, a rabid dog and stories of Boo Radley fill the otherwise slow days of Scout, Jem and their friend, Dill. The children are focused mostly on Boo and trying to catch a glimpse of him. Atticus is annoyed with their fascination with Boo, but finds himself in the middle of a rape trial which will challenge the soul of the town. Tom Robinson, a black man, is accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman. As the children watch their father take a stand, they learn lessons which can only be taught by example. This is a powerful story of growing up. It is easy to be drawn into the book as it explores the message of true courage and standing up for what you believe. I recommend this book to all.BIBLIO: October 11, 1998, Warner Books; Reissue edition, Middle-High School, $ 6.99REVIEWER: Katie GordonFORMAT: NovelISBN: 0446310786"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Ever since I read this in 10th grade, it has been my favorite book. I have read it several times and each time, I find something in there that is new. It is definately a timeless classic.I think having Scout narrate the book as an adult looking back on her childhood isn't a new concept, but this is the kind of story that it works great in. Seeing Macomb County through the eyes of a young child gives it a bit of nostalgic innocence.If you want to see the movie, read the book first."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The Pulitzer prizewinning novel To Kill a Mockingbird takes place in a small Alabama town. The book covers Scout's life from age six till age nine. Scout is a curious girl who is trying to understand and see the world through her father's eyes. You watch though Scout's eyes as times change around her and how her life and the people around her change with it. Scout learns there are many different sides to people, what they appear as and who they really are. Read and see how her views change about her father, Mrs. Dubose, Aunt Alexandra, Arthur (Boo) Radley, Miss. Stephanie Crawford, Miss Rachel, Miss Mauidie, and the rest of the town. I liked this book because it shows after the Civil War how African-Americans were still treated wrongly, and how grudges can hurt you and people around you. It also shows you how we view each other and how views might not be true. This book is a great book to read and learn from. If you are looking for a classic book with a great plot I'd read To Kill a Mockingbird."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I, like many, read _To Kill a Mockingbird_ for the first time in high school. And no doubt, like many, was tepid about it - the book was ok, but nothing to get excited about. Years later, with the benefit of some living, however, I have an entirely new appreciation for it. Like good wine, the story improved with age.The story is a vivid description of the pre-civil rights south, with its rigid racial divisions and class structure. The plot revolves around the alleged rape of a white girl by a black man and the trial that takes place. Naturally the prejustices and social mores play an important part in the tale - as do the lessons Harper Lee has to teach about growing up and the injustices that life has.It is an American classic and Pulitzer Prize winner - but I think for most readers just entering adulthood, the beauty and honesty of the book is lost for a lack of years.

Although the book is extremely well-written, the last few chapters didn't really flow with the plot. Although exciting, I found that it was slightly out of sync.

He takes up the defence of Tom Robinson, a black farm worker who innocently stands accused of raping a white woman. Robinson is found guilty and killed while attempting to escape, and Finch is confronted with the hate and injustice of the community he lives in. The novel is told from the perspective of Finch's 9-year-old daughter, Jean Louise (&quot;Scout&quot;).I enjoyed reading this book very much. It gives an insight into how life must have been (and, perhaps, still is) in a racist community like Maycomb (which, of course, is a fictional location). The novel's plot is well-elaborated, its characters are complex and realistic. I especially liked the second part of the novel, dealing with Tom Robinson's trial and the effects Atticus' stand against his racist community by defending him in that trial has on his life and his family. It is also quite interesting to see how Scout seems to &quot;mentally grow up&quot; when becoming aware of the &quot;ugly face&quot; behind the nice and clean facades of the town.

A lot of times you have to stop and think about the deeper meaning of what you just read, because it's not spelled out for you.The story is basically about how dramatic events in a small town affect a family that lives in it. It is set in Alabama in the 1930s. The single father of the two main characters is not very strict, so the kids get in the middle of things that they are probably too young for. The kids learn a lot, but there are still some things their father protects them from.This is an amazing book. It has suspence, because you don't solve some mysteries until the end. It has friendship, because the kids make some important new friends. It has entertainment, because there's always something going on.

Atticus is a respected white attorney representing Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. Most of the white folks assume that he is guilty from the beginning. Atticus believes that everybody should be treated fairly regardless of race. Many people try to make Atticus drop the case, but he refuses to give in.My favorite character is Atticus because he treats everyone with respect and fairness. He has the courage to stand up for what he believes is right even when it's not popular. He values education, believing that education is an important tool to fight racial prejudice. My other favorite character is Boo who represents the good in our society.I love this book. Through the eyes of Atticus' daughter, the author is able to point out the injustice of treating people according to skin color. Every eighth grader should read this book as it is interesting and educational.

Being accused of rapeing a white woman puts Tom in a predicament that no man wants to be in.Jean Louise or Scout, as she is called by her brother Jem, is the main character and the one telling the the story.

When a brave man named Atticus Finch stood up and defended a black man named Tom Robinson in a fictional book called To Kill a Mockingbird.A little girl named Scout and her brother named Jem always have had fun in the city of Maycomb. There was also a man named Boo Radley who never came out of his house and everyone seemed to have wondered why he never came out his house.Atticus, Jem and Scout's dad is a defense lawyer for the city of Maycomb and being brave and ending up defending a black man accused of rape. Because nobody wants to see him win the trial because he is a black man and back then black men never would have anything.I personally liked this book because you would never know what is going to happen next it is like a surprise birthday party and also it has a really good ending but it really is expected that back then the black person would never win even if the evidence shows that he is innocent which spoils the book.I think you should buy this book or if it is sitting around the house pick it up and read it because you have a fun time reading it, even if you do not like to read you should still read it.

She discusses her views on a very important topic, racism. Scout is a curious girl who along with her brother, Jem, is fixated on her neighbor, Boo Radley. Boo is a strange man who has spent almost all of his life inside his house and never comes outdoors. Scout unsuccessfully tries to meet Boo Radley many times.Atticus Finch, Scout's father, represents moral values and justice in this story. Atticus is chosen to defend Tom Robinson, a black man, in a trial where Tom was accused of raping a white woman. Atticus does what is right and accepts this challenge and puts his whole heart into this case. He knew it would be very hard for him to persuade an all white jury not to convict this black man of rape, but he does not let this stop him. This appeal was not just a simple rape trial it exemplified racism in the world of the 1930's. Atticus does more than expected, he tries not only to win his case but break a barrier between whites and blacks.This is a timeless novel that will always be viewed as one of the greatest story ever written.

Growing up in the scorching heat of Maycomb County, Alabama, may be hard for Scout, her headstrong brother Jem, and their wise friend from Meridian, Mississippi, Dill, but throughout the story the kids have many good times.In the small town, everybody knows a little about each family except for the Radleys. Even though the Radleys live close to the Finches, all the kids ever hear about them was deranged rumors of their child, Boo. Dill was especially interested in trying to find out who Boo Radley really was. The kids invent a lot of stories about Boo, but will they ever get to see him?Scout and Jem's father, Atticus Finch, was my favorite character in this story. The voice of knowledge and reason came from Atticus, who was a role model not only to me, but also to his son Jem. Atticus was a lawyer for the town who believed that no matter what race, there should be an equality within a courthouse, which will be proven when Tom Robinson, a black man who was accused of raping a white girl. Atticus has to muster all his strength to win this case because the jury and the whole town against him. Will Atticus ring true or will racial injustice win this case, read To Kill a Mockingbird to find out.Racial injustice was huge in this book, being in 1935 slavery is abolished but not all of the white people respect black people yet and sometimes took advantage of the black people's nice intentions. The black people were the scapegoat of many of the white people's misfortune when they didn't know whom to blame. Even in the court, where the color of your skin shouldn't matter, there is a big bias with black people. Hopefully Atticus's loyalty to Tom Robinson will bring a wind of change to the community of Maycomb County.In a town where everything is changing, even Jem and Scout as they get older and hit puberty, a line is crossed in Tom Robinson's court case, but by whom? To Kill a Mockingbird sends every reader back in time so they can witness how far we have come from the 1930's and how racist our country was then. Harper Lee does an excellent job at describing even the minute details in an eight year olds life. If you want to know what happens to Scout, Jem and Dill in this thrilling novel pick up a copy today."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"As soon as I read the first page I felt like I was a part of the story. The narrator Scout makes you want to Jump right in. Harper Lee did a fantastic job with making sure the reader would not get bored or lose interest in the begging. Witch is a good thing because I am one of those readers who get bored easily. This is a book for kids who are mature enough to handle the racial comments and actions.This wonderful story takes place in 1935 in the fictional town Maycomb. Which is located in Alabama? The seasons vary so you get a good idea of what they do during each season which makes for some pretty interesting events. This is a very small town so everyone knows each other. There is nothing that goes on in the town that everyone doesn't know about.The main characters in this story are Scout who is a little girl who is very much a tomboy. But she becomes very much a lady by the end of the story. She is also the narrator of the story. There is Jem the big brother. He is very responsible and smart. He is the one who makes sure the two of them stay out of trouble. Then there is there father Atticus. He is on the smartest and nicest people in the book. He is a defense attorney. He gives the children a lot of freedom and treats them like adults. Then there is Boo, he is the man who lives down the street that never comes out because his family hides him from the world. They do this because he is mentally retarded. Next there is Mr. Ewell; he is like the low life of the town. He is considered white trash and is a drunken slob. Then finally there is Tom Robinson, who is African American. He was a very nice and extremely hard working. He is just trying to make enough money to support is family because at that point in time blacks were the lowest on the social scale.The plot of this story is a big court trail. This trail is being help because Mayella Ewell accused Tom of rapping her and beating her. Atticus comes to Tom's aid as his Attorney. While Tom is waiting to be tried and angry mob comes and tries to lynch Tom but the Kids come to his aid. Atticus puts on a great show in the court room it almost seem like Tom cant be guilty, but you will have the read the book if you want to see what happens.The theme of the story is to protect the innocent when you know they are right.In conclusion I have told you about what I thought of the book, where it took place, the main characters, the plot, and finally the theme.

A young girl and two boys are seen in the yard of a brick house playing a kind of role-playing game. One is swinging a pair of scissors around while the others are laughing and trying to avoid him. Suddenly a call is heard, and the children put down their things to greet a coming man. Scout Finch runs up to her father, Atticus, and hugs him.The book, To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, takes place in Northern Alabama, in the city of Maycomb. People in Maycomb live by an unwritten caste system of insiders and outsiders. They live almost alone and separate from the rest of the world, with few visitors, and an absence of commuting. Segregation funs free, and the community lets one woman's claim cause the trial of another, Tom Robinson, just for the color if his skin.The story is seen through the eyes of a young impressionable girl, Scout Finch. Growing up, Scout sees prejudice all around her and is brought up to accept it by her community. However, her father, Atticus Finch, and her brother Jem are always there nudging her in the direction of equality when she fall astray.The main theme in this story is the tortures of prejudice and the striving for equality. The emotions of prejudice ring clear not just between blacks and whites but inside the races as well. There are strict social classes so that no matter where one turns, prejudice is staring right back at one's face.The story is based around the life of Scout Finch in the town of Maycomb in 1935. For years, her brother, her friend Dill, and Scout dreamt of the almost legendary Boo Radley and of meeting him. Their summers were spent dreaming of Boo, until their livers were shattered by the highly public trial of Tom Robinson. In the coming months, Scout faces torment of all kinds, all because of her father defending Tom.All in all, I thought this was a book that most teenagers and adults could enjoy. Seeing the world through the eyes of a child again really spoke to me in many ways. Scout is so young and virtually unaffected by all the racism in her world, it takes me back to my experiences at her age. If you want a classic novel that you won't be able to put down, then I highly recommend Harper Lee's masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In Harper Lee's book \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" you get a vivid sense of what life in the 1930's was like.

It arrived quickly and no damage and the price was excellent!Gordon Ferguson"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"A marvellous story told from the perspective of a ten year old girl growing up in a small town in Alabama. Does any other story capture so vividly the perspective of a young child?The story is roughly divided into three parts. The first is about the narrator Scout (Jean Louise), her older brother, and their young friend Dill. We follow them as they explore their house, neighbourhood with assorted and eclectic neighbours, and their father Atticus. Gradually the focus shifts to the trial where their father is to be the defence attorney. This is the centerpiece of the book - with strong passages about racial prejudice and intolerance. It is blatantly obvious that their town has two levels of justice - one for the dominant white people and another for the black people. Woe to the black person who transgresses any part of this racial divide (in this case a sexual one) - for \\"justice\\" will be served.By taking a child's perspective the full inequality of the system is brought out. The trial also serves notice that even if a poor white man is \\"victimized\\" by this racial code the black person still has no chance. Scout, her brother Jem, and Dill sit in the segregated black area of the court. Dill's feelings during the trial are most eloquent.After the trial the book seems to lose momentum somewhat - the events after seem anti-climatic. The attempted murder of Scout and Jem by Ewell is somewhat contrived and mundane compared to what has taken place - so the ending is rather weak.Nevertheless this is still an American Classic. The childhood viewpoint makes this an ornate and delightful read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"\\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is more than the usually discussed issues of racial bigotry and the human condition under trial. Don't let me take away from those values at all... but Harper Lee has written a book transcending a literary social commentary. She has written a love story.A love story? huh? Who gets married? Does anyone kiss? Are there passages of deep romance? No, no, no... none of that. Try instead family love.Atticus is the kind of single dad we need to see more of in this generation. He cares for his children so much that he protects them from the fires of his grown-up life of representing an innocent man. He protects them from the full impact of his neighbor's lies. He shows them how to love them, even though he knows his neighbors hate him and the love of fellow man he represents.If all Atticus, the father, did, was love the innocent man, he would be doing a good thing, but he demonstrates love and allows dignity (when possible) for the ones persecuting the innocent. He shows he is a big man, and his children mimic this sense of understanding.Deeply rooted in the memories of his children, the story has a gentle subtext of growing up. You can almost taste the lemonade of the porch and smell the flowers in nearby gardens.Lee's power as an author here is that she does let her statements about humanity overtake the story. Rather, she lets the story tell the story, and she just writes down what happened in her imagination.Her characters are not paste-up Southern children or adults, but complex characters all of us relate to (even me up here near Chicago!). Relationships are embedded in the depth of being neighbors. This creating a milieu of angst in Atticus' children when they see the adults warring in court and out of court in matters of truth.I fully recommend this book, and think to give it the best reading possible, examine how interwoven the story is with its various cultures and characters. The power of Lee's message will be plenty clear.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.com"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I bought this book for my son to read. We have watched the movie several times and I had read this as a freshman in HS. As required literature appears to be a thing of the past in our school district, I wanted him to have an opportunity to read and discuss this book.Simply put, this book is the best piece of American literature because it's story appeals to all ages and still (unfortunately) reverberates in our present culture. If you are looking for a compelling, touching, insightful book for your child (junior high age is best) purchase this book without reservation. If you are not familiar with the story get a second copy for yourself. Do not miss the film with Gregory Peck. It too, is timeless.

Scout is the youngest child of Atticus Finch who is a lawyer in the small town. We see the poor conditions is this small town. The poor children who go to school with Scout and her brother Jem. We see the segregation and hate towards the African Americans.We see a small town gripped in the prejudices of the age. An African American man is accused of raping a poor white girl and the linch mobs form up.

Every time I read it, there is something in it I did not see before, and I imagine that is because my own view of life and the world has changed over time. There are many novels that I loved at some point, but when I read them again I find they aren't what I remembered. This novel is not one of them. It grows richer and deeper with each reading, and no matter what, I weep at the end when Scout realizes it's Boo who saved her brother's life.It is a novel rich with characters, interesting complicated characters, and that is what always draws me back to this story. If you read it in high school because you had to, please set aside what it meant (or didn't mean) then, and read it again. It is larger and more expansive than you ever could have understood then.

Also, I found that the dialect in the book was filled with slang, but the narrator used elegant language and the two contradicted each other. As the narrator, Scout, and her brother, Jem, go through their lives in Maycomb County, the plot thickens with a court case accusing a black man of rape, and the county's expectations. The ending was really great, and by the middle I was quite happy with the book and I loved the personality of the little county and all the wonderful characters. I would recommend this book, but advise the reader to keep reading even if the beginning starts slowly, and not judge the book by the first half."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was supposed to have read this book in Mrs. Braswell's tenth-grade American literature class sometime in my 1989-90 sophomore year. Instead, I was imbibing fantasy novels by Raymond Feist and daydreaming about what life would be like with a driver's license. Now, twenty years later, I'm fairly pleased with myself for putting off such great writing until my early-middle years when I'm far more capable of appreciating its quality and the depth of the moral tale Harper Lee has bestowed upon the world from her humble memories of childhood in Alabama.As Scout Finch puts it, I'm a \\"person of no background\\" (i.e., born and raised in north Alabama), but that doesn't mean I don't recognize the very common human elements faced by the small-town folks in Lee's novel. The struggles are universal and, unfortunately, some are not eroded by time.I enjoyed the tale-spinning of the novel, it sucked me in. The themes are still relevant. I whole-heartedly recommend it to any audience. There's a reason the classics survive."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I loved this book. Sissy Spacek was the perfect actor to do the book. She brought it to life. I was sorry when the book was over!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I have never understood those who talk about who will write or when \\"The Great American Novel\\" will appear. It has already been written, by Harper Lee.Sissy Spacek was an inspired choice to narrate this book, with her soft Southern accent. Indeed, as you listen to her read you can well imagine a grown-up Scout reading her memoirs. Ms. Spacek does not try to 'mimic' other voices, such as Jen or Atticus, but simply changes tone a bit.This audiobook is unabridged: you get every single word (including the wonderful quote about lawyers having been children once). There are no 'sound effects' or such during the reading. At the end of each chapter is some soft music (lutes or such) to lead you into the next chapter.If you are a fan of To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, you will want to obtain this audiobook. I will remind all that there was another audiobook version put out in 1990 or so (I forget who read it); I thought about buying it (at Barnes Noble), hesitated a year or two, and then it was gone. They simply did not make that many copies and they were soon all gone."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Really, history texts are \\"more entertaining\\" than this book?Now this reviewer has something that can be used as a good talking point about the book \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" but rather than saying it-he/she would rather bury their point in sarcasm. As many of you know, students have trouble learning by reading only textbooks. It's safe to say, textbooks can be dry, fact-laden, and lack the appeal necessary to engage a student who finds flipping their pencil around more interesting. Given the sarcasm, this reviewer knows that history books are generally considered \\"not entertaining\\" and uses a tongue-and-cheek approach to say that Lee's \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\" is less entertaining than what is already established as \`low entertainment.'My question is why? Why not say what you mean? Why the sarcasm? Why not suggest a resource or piece of fiction that portrays history better? But perhaps this reviewer can't. Perhaps their sarcasm is a tactic to hide their misreading of an important piece of literature.Yes, Harper Lee's book does contain stereotypes, but let's take it further. Let's see Lee's book as a spring board to question the use of stereotypes at all?Instead of dismissing a novel written in the late 50's (published in 1960) along side a late 70's television show (Goodtimes aired between 1974-1979), why not use this to question the case a television show duplicated the same stereotypes of a book twenty years its predecessor? Or how is it that such stereotypes are still used in fiction and film in our current times? This reviewer dismisses a book like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" rather that seeing that it can be used to talk about the human condition (no matter how unfortunate this condition may be) that things outside individual perceptions are generalized and used, (often commercialized) that then perpetuate the misunderstanding of others to the demise of everyone, but in particular to minorities?This reviewer writes that \\"Simply put, this is a novel about racism written for people who received their knowledge about racism from this book!\\" What I think this person wants to say is that instead of standing against racism, this book serves to perpetuate it. But how can this reviewer not take in consideration the time period in which the book was written (which was the same decade Lucile Ball could not say the word \\"pregnant\\" on television). But this reviewer fails to recognize that this book does not only show us prejudice thinking but calls it to question and provides us with the opportunity to talk about it. And this dialogue begins from where the book starts-from the point of view of children.So reviewer, how is this book an \\"insult to intelligent readers\\" when readers you speak of sit some 50 years after its making? Isn't this book history itself? If you peal back its coming of age story, we get a first hand look at what at the time (as sad it as it maybe to us now) were controversial ideas? The situation where a man can be guilty simply because of the color of his skin puts to question how these notions have been embedded in our culture. This can be used to start a dialogue of how far we have or have not come. Instead of judging it, let's learn from it and put our contemporary egos aside to look at what is between the lines in this text.For example, this reviewer calls to attention that the stereotypical use of minorities being saved by \\"archetypal\\" \\"perfect\\" white man and calls it a fault of the book. But isn't the fault of prejudice times the book is set in? Could Lee have created an African American lawyer character to do the saving of an innocent African American man on trial during the 50's? Sadly, no. Lee was using examples of what were available at the time to bring to question how others are condemned because of something as arbitrary as the color of a person's skin.This is our shared history. I am not proud of it, but it is where we have evolved from. But when I read a review like this one I question that very evolution. We have the privilege of being somewhere else in time, we know better. Should they have known better then? I say \\"yes,\\" because I live now. Did others at the time see what we see now? Sure, there have been people throughout history who have fought to the point of loss of life for the equality of all. Those people were visionaries. Lee in writing \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" does represent a piece of that visionary notion that says, \\"There is something wrong with condemning a person not by their actions but by who they are that others do not know.\\" You seem say how dare she call this to question by using stereotypes? When really there wasn't enough integration of people to see differently. Going by the publication history of this book, people where finally coming around to question how they believed.So yes, this book contains the dangerous notions that have been used to justify not only supremacy but also hate and horrible crimes against others. But it also exposes the idea of how tyrannical popular belief can be. Use extreme care when relegating a book of this magnitude to the pile of the unreadable because you can't get over the time period in which it represents. To say something is racists when it shows racism is to dangerously stop the conversation that such literature brings.So let's use the luxury of being forward in time (and it is a luxury as those who will be 50 years a head of us will have), we can peer into the systems at work in this book, and learn to not repeat the mistakes. Use it to question our notion of humanity by what others had to endure.As Scout in the novel says, \\"when you really see them,\\" I think this reviewer failed to \\"really\\" see Harper Lee and this book. He/she claims to be an intelligent reader, but somehow does not understand that time-stamped literature show us ourselves and sometimes (dear, I say often) that side of us is not a pleasant one. Let's question the book, not dismiss it as something that perpetuates it unless it is in the hands of a person who chooses to use it as a perpetuation. Because in actuality, it's the times we stand juxtaposed against not the literary products thereof.Classical literature helps us do this by getting inside, seeing the composite faces and lives of who they were.So please drop the sarcasm and say what you mean. Then a great conversation and learning, learning about who we are-where we've been and where we're going-can really begin."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I loved this coming-of-age story set in Maycomb, Alabama that takes place during a two-year period in the 1930s. The narrator and main character, Jean Louis \\"Scout\\" Finch, enters first grade and her brother Jeremy \\"Jem\\" fourth, at its outset. Their father, widower and attorney-at-law Atticus Finch, is assigned to defend a black man accused of raping a white teenager who comes from a poor, motherless, family \\"led\\" by an abusive, neglectful, racist father. Kids can be cruel, and as the Finch children soon learn, their classmates, oftentimes following their parents' lead, tease them mercilessly about their father's willingness to take on the case. An assortment of well-developed characters, both friends and foes of the Finches, round out the cast, including their young friend Charles \\"Dill\\" Thomas (the relative of a neighbor) and the secret but significant younger son of a neighbor, Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley, who is said to have stabbed one of his parents with a knife one day (a scenario reenacted repeatedly by the three children). Although the dialogue includes (perhaps a dozen instances of the) use of the \\"n\\" word, it's the means to an end. The overlying theme of To Kill a Mockingbird is that no matter what the consequences, racism must not be tolerated. Perfectly plotted and filled with well-developed characters every one, this meaningful-messaged story is one of my all-time favorite classics. Also good: In Cold Blood by Truman Capote, Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, and The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Product in excellent shape and was shipped faster than I had expected.

Harper Lee uses strong emotion, laughter, and reason to relate a time of controversy and \\"the crisis of conscience\\". This story is told from the perspective of a young girl named Jean Louise, nicknamed Scout. She lives with her older brother Jem and is raised by her single father, which relates to her less than typical upbringing.The main focus point of this story relates to a case that Scout's father agrees to take. It is a case that is surrounded by controversy. A black man is accused of assaulting a white woman, and in this time frame, a white person is not to be disputed by a black person. Atticus, Scout and Jem's father, believes that he has no choice but to take the case and he must struggle with the town that he lives in to do what he knows that he must do. This also has a strong affect on Scout and Jem's life. I would strongly encourage anyone to read this book and learn how Atticus, Scout, and Jem handle the town's reactions and to learn the outcome of the case.This novel tells a story filled with humor and excite, sadness and emotional conflict. This novel is especially good for young adult readers, because the story is related from their viewpoint. This is a novel that you can sit down and enjoy, but also take away a good life lesson from it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I am not going to write a really long review.

To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee goes over the many adventures and experinces that Scout has in her childhood. Every sentence, every word draws you into the story as if you were there yourself. You could imagine living down the street from a crazy lady and have mysterious neighbors who have a haunting history. Attivus is assigned drags the whole family into a roller coaster with drops that come unexcpected. At times this nobel was a thriller, prickling up and down your spine with danger lerking around every corner. Other times this book had a sweet romance that is adorably cute because of the age of the destined lovers. There is also taumma. This is a historical book that takes place during the time of descrimination against African American people.

I would recomend it to any body. I especialy like the end when Scout goes and stands on Boo Radley's porch and sees the world through his eyes. Five stars this was an easy pic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is one of my all time favorite book as well as my favorite movie. I think that those of us who have read the book love the fact that narrator as well as one of the main characters is a little girl named Scout. The story is seen through her eyes and this makes the book more enjoyable as well as easy to understand. Sometimes she's funny and witty, other times she's very intelligent and through out the story she's just trying to understand the world around her. Atticus Finch, Scouts father, is a wonderful character because he shows his love and respect for his children as well as for everyone else. He shows he has moral values rather than social ones when he defends a black man being accused of having raped a white women. This shows that no matter how bad or how wrong things are, there is always someone willing to stand up for what they believe, and that there are good people in the world. This took alot of courage on Atticus's part considering they lived in the South. And although he loves both his children dearly, he seems to have a special bond with Scout. He teaches her that a person doesn't really understand someone else until they've walked in their shoes. That is excellent advice no matter who you are or how old. What is also highly interesting, and very original to this story, is the mystery behind Boo Radley. He's one of the main characters in the story yet he never really appears in person. In the first half of the story the children talk so much about him that they make jokes and at some points make him sound like a monster, not knowing that in the end he's the one who saves the day. I believe that what I love the most of this story is that it isn't a love story or an action/adventure kind of story, but one that tells the experiences that all of us can learn from. They're experiences we see happen sometime in our lives. Justice and injustice, prejudice in the society we live in, and courage and respect for other human beings. Anyone and everyone can relate and learn from this story, this is why it's a wonderful story for anyone to enjoy."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"No doubt, over the decades, many people have written fine summaries and analyses of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", the novel. And so I shall refrain from writing one. Suffice it to say that it is one of my favorite novels. I think that reviews of the \\"50th Anniversary Edition\\" should not so much be about the story as it should be about the edition. Here are my observations:The cover is nice. Nothing is wrong with it.The pages have a deckled (ragged) edge, on the side that is opposite the spine.The copyright page does not indicate as to whether or not the paper is acid-free. The paper does not seem to be acid-free, but I could be wrong about this.The print on each page is consistently dark, and this is good. The font size is sufficiently large.In terms of content besides the novel itself, there is nothing special. It has a one-paragraph foreword that was written by Harper Lee in 1993. In the foreword, she requested that no introduction ever be written for her novel.In short, I give five stars to Harper Lee for her novel, and three stars for this particular edition (because I suspect that the paper is not acid-free and because I don't particularly like deckled edges), yielding an average of four stars."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Certainly not much can be added to the accolades already given to &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel which has become a classic of modern American literature. This is the powerfully told story of a family's struggle for justice in a small Alabama town in the 1930s, written from the perspective of the young daughter of a lawyer defending a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. With wit and honesty, the book examines the racial and class attitudes prevalent in the Deep South in the years leading up to the Civil Rights era.I recently finished reading &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; for only the second time (the first was in 1963, when I was 12 years old.) I found it to be just as wonderful a reading experience 37 years later! The characters and the setting come to life like no other novel I've ever read. The book made me laugh some, cry some, and get angry some. But, the most important thing it did for me was to make me evaluate once again my own attitudes and actions toward other people.

My two friends and I were on a bus ride at 2:00am (do not ask why) and the bus driver suddenly asked: \\"What is your favorite book\\"? My friend since high school pointed his finger in the air while rocking in his seat and shouted: \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\"! I knew it was an honorable book to read, but somehow I missed the opportunity to read it in my twenty four years of existence.Two weeks after that occurrence I was headed to a basketball game. I had a half hour to kill before game time so I made a pit stop at the library one block away. I sat in the community study area browsing for books when I glanced at a crossword puzzle. Of course, the answers to the crossword puzzle were formatted for To Kill a Mockingbird.One, I wanted to find the answers to the crossword puzzle. Two, this was no mere coincidence that the book was brought to my attention again. Clich&eacute; as it sounds; it was destiny that I read this book. I feel dumbfounded that I did not read this in high school. I hope to teach this book to my students in the future. Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is in the literary cannon for a reason; it theme still touches home today. It is a must read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"What do you do when you sit down to write a book and you get it absolutely perfect the first time? Unfortunately, you never write another one. How could Harper Lee have possibly followed this up? Anything she wrote after \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" would have been anticlimax. So on the strength of one book, Harper Lee will be forever remembered for writing one of the greatest books of the contemporary American literature.I picked up this book late one night the year it was first published, after my mom had been raving about the book for weeks, trying to get me to read it. Well, what the heck, the late movie was boring that evening... next thing I knew, it was two o'clock in the morning and I had just turned the final page on what was the most magical reading experience of my entire life.From the opening line, \\"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow...\\" Lee hooks the reader with a deceptively simple story of a Southern family and a Southern town caught up in a cataclysmic moral crisis, and keeps us enthralled till the very last word. Lee's writing style is that of the storyteller who mesmerizes her audience telling a tale so simple, yet so compelling, that you never want it to end. Her narrator is Scout Finch, a delightfully devilish little tomboy who sees her world through the all-observant eyes of childhood. Scout is one of the most enchanting characters in modern American fiction. She's bright, funny, totally real; there's nothing contrived about her. She's someone we all knew in first or second grade, or wished we'd known. Scout lives with her brother Jem, four years her senior, her lawyer father Atticus, and their housekeeper Calpurnia, in a sleepy Alabama town where everybody knows or is related to everybody else. Lee spends the first half of the book drawing us into the life of the town and the Finch family, Scout's hilarious and problematic adjustment to first grade, and brings us into the mystery surrounding the notorious-yet-never-seen Boo Radley. The second half of the book is about the moral crisis that tears the town apart.Lee has a way of saying a lot by saying very little, and her laconic statement that the people of Maycomb had recently been told they had nothing to fear but fear itself sets the time squarely in 1933, the depths of the Great Depression. Times were bad for most people in small Southern towns; they were especially bad for poor whites and all blacks. In 1933 the South was rigidly segregated down every possible line, and a white woman's false accusation of rape was enough to get a black man hanged. When Mayella Ewell accuses Tom Robinson of rape, in the eyes of most of the white populace, Tom has been tried, convicted and is awaiting execution. Judge Taylor disagrees, and asks Atticus to take Tom's case.In Atticus Finch, Lee created what would eventually grow to be the best-loved character in all American fiction. Atticus is a loving but not a doting father, an able lawyer, and an individual of towering integrity. He takes Tom's case because he knows Mayella's accusation is full of holes, and he believes Tom is as deserving of good legal representation as anyone else. Atticus knows better than anyone else how his decision to take the case will affect his children, but as he explains to Scout, who wonders how Atticus can be right if everybody else thinks he's wrong, if he didn't take the case, he could never hold his head up in front of his children again.Atticus knows he's fighting a losing battle, but deep inside himself he believes he may lose a battle but win a bigger war. The chapters describing Tom Robinson's trial and Atticus's defense are some of the most powerful in American fiction. On of the most moving passages in the book is at the end of the trial when the town's black minister tells Scout to \\"Stand up. Your father's passin'.\\"Along with Scout and Atticus Finch, Lee created a host of other memorable characters. Jem is the perfect big brother for Scout, sometimes protective, sometimes antagonistic, always encouraging. Lee only needs to pen a few details about Calpurnia to bring her vividly to life: \\"She was all angles and bones; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard.\\" Calpurnia isn't the stereotypical Mammy of Tara; she's a no-nonsense maid and housekeeper who dishes out ample amounts of love and old-fashioned discipline in equal doses. And Miss Maudie Atkinson is a delightful creation; funny, ditzy, and wise all at once. Anyone would want her for their next-door neighbor.The two major villains, Bob Ewell and his daughter Mayella, are compelling characters in their own right. Bob Ewell is quintessential white trash, spending the family's relief money on moonshine while his children go hungry. But poor Mayella is as much victim as villain; we can't help but feel for her, ostracized and isolated, knowing only her father's physical violence and sexual abuse; her attempted seduction of Tom Robinson is a desperate cry for love and affection. But, as Lee reminds us, it's all for naught. Tom Robinson was dead the minute Mayella, caught in the act of attempted seduction by her father, opened her mouth and screamed.After the highlight of the trial, the book might have slid into anticlimax, but it's Lee's genius that she keeps the tension heightened after the trial and its denouement, through Ewell's drunken, insane attack on Atticus through his children, and their rescue by Boo Radley. And after everything she, her family, and the town have been through, what has Scout learned from all this? Pretty much what Atticus set out to teach her all along: that you can't get to know a person until you put on his shoes and walk around in them.I turned the final page of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", unbelieving that it had come to an end. I opened the front cover and immediately started reading it over again from page one. At two o'clock in the morning. The book had that much of an effect on me. One doesn't just read this book; one experiences it. At best, one lives it. I did.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is so wonderful. I suggest reading it in the summer, when the book takes place. But no matter when you read it, read it. I was born in the late 60s and this reminds me so much of hot summer days, sibling relationships, all kinds of wonderful things. It's great for a casual read that takes you to another place. It's also great for the deep thinking reader who loves symbolism and likes to read between the lines. If you have not read it, you may want to get a study guide to do along with it. I know, you are not in school! But the study guides really point out the deeper meanings, get you thinking in a new light. NO you do not need a study guide at all, I just find it adds a new element for the reader.After you read the book, see the movie!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The most amazing thing about this book is that even though it is fiction written more than forty years ago about events that took place more than seventy years ago, it is as relevant today as it was during the Civil Rights struggles of the late 1950's. One need only to read about the Jena Six to realize that we have not come as far as we might like to think.The cover of the book says this is a story of \\"growing up\\" and \\"human dignity\\" and this is true. Harper Lee described it as a love story and this is true as well. But it is also a story of hatred and not just racial hatred. It is the story of the hatred those who are more refined feel for those below them; the hatred of those who are poor for those who are even poorer; the hatred of the poorest whites for the blacks who they feel are below them. The lowest white man in town, who is constantly drunk, lives on welfare, mistreats his children and forces them to pick through the town dump for food still expects to believed over the word of a hard-working, honest black man. And when someone refuses to believe his lies, his anger knows no bounds. It is a story of not just racial prejudice but class prejudice as well.But beneath all this hatred is a story of love and innocence and of growing up. Growing up deep in the South during the heart of the Depression, Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill learn a lesson about the hearts of men, that although there is darkness in men's souls that there is also a brightness that can be reached.Harper lee has written a beautiful and believable story. None of the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes, rather they all feel like real people. When Scout and Jem are welcomed at Calpurnia's church, when Atticus stands in front of the sheriff's office to protect Tom, when Jem must read to Mrs. Dubose as punishment for destroying her garden, when Scout, Jem, and Dill try to coax Boo Radley out of his house... each of these events build a complex story of childhood and innocence and losing innocence. At the end of the story, Scout says, \\"Atticus, he was real nice...\\" and Atticus replies, \\"most people are, Scout, when you finally see them,\\" and that is the ultimate moral of this story."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is one of those works I reread ever few years. Each time I read this wonderful novel I am even more impressed than the last time. This work has some of the best character developement I am aware of. It is a absolute delight for no other reason than this. Of course the book gives us a wonderful picture of the South during the 1930s. I actually feel that you can and will appreciate this work more had you lived during that time and in that area. This work was no \\"required reading\\" when and where I went to school, which is a pitty. It is a work more people should be exposed to. I do note, through reading these many reviews here, that there is a direct relationship between the age of the reader and the appreciation of the book. I am not at all sure the younger reader (and I do not mean this as a put down) can truely appreciate this particular work until they have been around the block a few times, both in life and in literature. I think there may have to be a certain maturity reached before the appreciation can be reached. This is true of so many things. Had I read this in my early teens or late teens, I am not sure I would have like it all that well myself. That being said, I do feel that any reader will be much richer, in the long run, for having read this work. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Surprisingly, the novel To Kill a Mockingbird only took one week for me to finish reading the whole book. In fact, it usually takes about one week to finish one book for me. This novel contains humorous and serious aspects that made me not want to put it down. The strongest point of this novel is the distinct characters that are in it and the way it is written.My favorite character, Atticus, the father of Jem and Scout, is a very attractive character in that he is not biased, intelligent, and open-minded. Unlike other characters in this novel, he is the only Caucasian who tried to prove Tom Robinson's innocence. In the section where he cares and worries about his children, I was truly impressed by him. Atticus reminds me of my warm-hearted father. My father never admonishes me but gently explains what I did wrong. He is like Atticus. In my eyes, Atticus is the ideal father figure. I also liked the other major characters in the novel, especially Jem and Scout. Other characters such as Boo Radley, Calpurnia, Dubose, Dill and Cunningham also make this novel outstandingThe way this story is explained and expanded throughout from Scout's point-of-view makes this novel more special. From a pure and nave perspective, Scout sees the world and interprets it in her own way. I think this is a good aspect of this novel.It is not a surprise that this novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961. I strongly recommend this novel to everybody, because it's easy to understand, humorous and teaches a lesson that relates to everybody. I can guarantee that after you read this novel, you definitely can feel your heart getting warmer."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's, To Kill a Mockingbird, is a wonderful and touching book that offers a beautiful theme that you discover early on in the book. The book is narrated by eight year old Scout and she tells of the adventures that she faced while trying to figure the identity of Boo Radley. Her brother, Jem, and her friend, Dill, join in on the fun. Scout's father, Atticus, is a respected lawyer in the tiny town of Maycomb, Alabama. Atticus is working on a case involving the rape of a young white woman. The defendant is a black man. The two storylines tie together in the end and reveals the universal theme of the entire book. Harper Lee does a meticulous job of developing characters and plot. The book is so enthralling, I found myself reading the whole book, cover to cover, in three hours! I recommended the book to my family and friends and they all thoroughly enjoyed it. Overall, the book takes readers to the roots of human behavior, and uncovers a message that all should keep in mind. This book is certainly a literary masterpiece and all should read it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"When did ISBN's come into use? The 1962 Popluar Library paperback edition (price: 60 cents) that I own has a Library of Congress card catalogue number. I also have the fortieth anniversary edition.I grew up about forty miles from Miss Lee's hometown. I graduated from Miss Lee's alma mater, the University of Alabama. I have climbed to the top of the clock tower of the courthouse made famous in this book.I grew up a couple of decades after Scout, a couple of dozen miles down the road, in another small Alabama town. I read To Kill a Mockingbird as a child, and reread it every year or so. My paperback copy is held together with Scotch tape. My anniversary edition is a treasure I do not lend out.As a child who lived pretty much the same childhood as Scout and Jem, I identified heavily with them, and like most who have read and loved this American Classic, I have longed for a father like Atticus.It is no exaggeration to state that this novel, more than any other, influenced my thinking, and shaped my life. I am a writer, you see. It is certainly no surprise to me that readers tell me they see similarities between my first novel and the one that told the story of my own childhood better than I ever could, the one that certainly influenced both my desire to write and the topics I choose to write about.Whenever I think that I might write a memoir of growing up in Alabama, I read this book again, and know that I don't need to. Miss Lee told my own story, those long, dusty summers filled with friends and playing outdoors, the neighborhoods where everyone knew all the children and generally, what they were doing, the lurid rumors and legends constructed of gossip and cautionary tales, secret pacts and promises, moss-covered trees hanging over slow muddy rivers, the far-off rumblings of trouble and upsets as the civil rights movement marched inexorably closer to us, and the quiet in which it finally came to face us. I remember the silence in which they marched, and I remember reading To Kill a Mockingbird again, lying on my bed, windows open to non-existent breezes, wondering. Was Tom Robinson real? Did that really happen? What is happening now? Can I stop it? Can I do something? With all the restless yearning inside me, at ten years old, I reached for something, reading that book, lying on my back, staring at the ceiling, trying to see clearly what was coming.When I read this book, I remember Scout, the little girl who fought against change, who didn't quite understand the changes that happened despite her best efforts, and I see the girl that I was, straining to see, to understand. I wanted Scout to be my best friend, and you know what? She was. I have always liked books better than people. Some books are better friends than many people I know. Some books have helped me more, sustained me, taught me, kept me entertained, and led me closer to the person I want to be, than any person ever could. Like Scout, I am too stubborn to be told what to do and what to think. But books, that's something else.To Kill a Mockingbird will remain a treasured, dear old friend."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In a recent writing assignment, my son noted:My mom chose Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird as our family book club's March book. I flipped through, saw the number of pages, and thought, \\"Boring!\\" Later that night, I read the first page and discovered that the main character's brother was about my age and wanted to play football and own an air rifle. Then, a few days later, I continued reading and even though I found the writing a little \\"fancy,\\" I was finally able to find the beauty of Lee's book - it's a pretty \\"grown-up\\" story, but it's seen through the eyes of kids like me. That makes hard subjects easier to understand, which makes the book so much more interesting.The novel is told from a young girl's perspective. Because the theme of racism, the subject of rape, and the idea of injustice are a little \\"over the top\\" - even for bright readers -Lee chose a young narrator to tell the story of a black man falsely accused of raping a young white woman and one man's fight to free him. If the story had been told by an adult, readers would have to suffer through the unnecessary chit-chat, opinions, and worries of that perspective. Seeing Maycomb County through Scout's innocent eyes, however, prevents this \\"masterpiece of American literature\\" from being an \\"I-had-to-read-it\\" sort of book.Scout, her brother Jem, and their father form one of many families of Maycomb County, Alabama. In that southern state during the Great Depression, \\"[t]here was no hurry for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy, and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County.\\" As the novel begins, Scout is six and about to start school, where she will be criticized for coming to class already knowing how to read and write. Her young teacher scolds Scout: \\"Now you tell your father not to teach you anymore. It's best to begin reading with a fresh mind. You tell him I'll take over from here and try to undo the damage.\\" (p. 17) Jem, a fifth-grader, allows his sister to join him in many of his adventures, including his plans with Dill to make Boo Radley come out. But he thinks Scout \\"is getting more like a girl every day.\\" (p. 52) The children's father, Atticus Finch, is a state legislator and one of the county's leading lawyers. He is selected to defend Tom Robinson, a Negro accused of rape.Racism still exists today, but the problems don't compare to those described in To Kill a Mocking Bird. The main problem seems to be that Negroes are considered the least human of four kinds of people. As Jem tells Scout, \\"There's four kinds of folks in the world. There's the ordinary kind like us and the neighbors, there's the kind like the Cunninghams out in the woods, the kind like the Ewells down at the dump, and the Negroes.\\" (p. 226) To make the point about Negroes being somehow less important than other folks, the author tells Tom's story. He is a Negro whose left arm is stripped of muscle from a childhood accident. He stops to help nineteen-year-old Mayella Ewell with several chores because, as Tom admits at his trial, \\"I felt right sorry for her, she seemed to try more'n the rest of \`em\\" - referring to her family, who gathers their supplies from the nearby dump and whose father is a drunkard who beats them. When Bob Ewell catches his daughter hugging the black man, he accuses Tom of raping Mayella to save their family from disgrace. \\"And so a quiet, respectable, humble Negro who had the unmitigated temerity to \`feel sorry' for a white woman has had to put his word against two white people's.\\" (p. 204) Atticus Finch does his best to make Tom a free man. His efforts, though, only buy more time from the jury, which still returns a guilty verdict. Unlike her brother, Scout believes that \\"there's just one kind of folks. Folks.\\" But Tom still ends up dead - shot as he tries to escape from punishment for a crime he did not (could not) commit. To Kill a Mockingbird could be a pretty \\"heavy\\" book for young readers if it only concentrated on racism, rape, and Atticus Finch's unsuccessful attempt to free an innocent man. So Lee combines the story of Tom Robinson with the mythology surrounding the inscrutable Mr. Arthur Radley, whom Jem, Scout, and their summertime friend Dill call Boo Radley. One story about Boo is that he stabbed his father with scissors while cutting newspapers for his scrapbook. Another story has Boo scratching neighbors' door screens. Yet another says that he eats squirrels. Kids love creepy stories, and the antics of the three friends as they try to make Boo come out of his house give the novel light and humor.Although I had a rough time \\"getting into\\" To Kill a Mockingbird, when I finally did I was surprised by how good it was. By the way, the book has such a cool title. I didn't understand it at all when I began the book. Then, in chapter 10, I realized where the title came from. \\"Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\" (p. 90) But not until Scout says to her father, \\"Well, it'd be sort of like shootin' a mockingbird, wouldn't it?\\" (p. 270), did I realize who the book's mockingbirds were. I will read this book with my children someday and hope they will with theirs."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee only wrote one novel, To Kill A Mockingbird. I think she only wrote one book because it was perfect.This is a story set the South of the Depression era. It's a story about injustice and prejudice and one man's attempt to stand up and do what is right. It is also about growing up and losing childhood innocence, about terror and about mis-judging all kinds of people.The theme of intolerance and fear plays itself out on many stages in this book, from the frightening character Boo Radley who is a strange recluse and a fairy-tale monster to the town's children, the black man Tom Robinson unjustly accused of raping a white woman, to the white-trash Ewells and Mayella Ewell herself, the supposed victim.All the horrors you usually hear about on daytime television are in this book, however their portrayal and the revelations are not shock TV but lessons about human weakness and human nobility.It's a great novel, written in such style that you can smell the dust, feel the humid heat and experience life in a small Southern town in the '30's. Just as an interesting bit of trivia, the character Dill, childhood friend of Scout and Jem, was in real life Truman Capote, a childhood friend of Harper Lee."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Listening to Sissy Spacek's reading of this book is an amazing experience.

I must confess I have read this book either in high school or junior high, but I barely remember it. After reading it again the second time, I have to say, that it is one of those books that every time you read it, it leaves with a greater impact on your soul. I plan to read this book again in 10 or 20 years just to see what new insights I can glean from this book.The story is told from a young girl's eyes, as she witnesses some doings in Maycomb. Scout and her brother Jem are the town's lawyer's children. While growing up, they begin to discover why their father is really a gentleman, especially when he defends a black man accused of rape. That trial is not only felt throughout the town, but it affected Jem and Scout too in coloring their viewpoints of the world around them.This is not your typical coming-of-age book. This is a book meant to provoke people to think and ponder on some of the issues she deals with in this book. It is a book I think every one should read ~~ regardless of their values and beliefs. I know that it is one book I plan to have my children to read as well as the nieces and nephews in my family.

I'm a 13-year-old from Reykjavik, Iceland, and my American mother told me to read this old book she had on her shelf. She pulled down an old thing with an orange sketch of a bird on the front of it, and I thought: What in the sam hill does she want me to read now? It wasn't until later that I found out where mom had picked that familiar phrase up, just like it wasn't until later that I realised how wrong I had been.This novel is about kids, and how their peaceful little town was transformed into a place of racism and hate by one lie told by a white farmer.Jeremy Atticus (Jem) and Jean Louise Finch (Scout), the children of a lawyer in the town of Maycomb, spend their time just like any ordinary kids. That is, until they meet Charles Baker Harris, better known as Dill, and the three of them start plotting how to get their mysterious neighbor Arthur (Boo) Radley to come out. They are blissfully unaware of it when a negro man, Tom Robinson, is accused of the rape of the daughter of a drunkard farmer, Robert E. Lee Ewell (Bob). But when spring comes and their father is appointed to defend young Tom, the children, along with the whole of Maycomb, are drawn into the swirl of strong feelings, racism, lies and hate that is building up aroundthe case. One of the best scenes of the book is the trial of Tom Robinson.I'm not going to tell you any more about it, but I'lll let you in on one secret. The two storylines: That of the children and Boo Radley, and that of Atticus Finch and the &quot;rape&quot; of Mayella Ewell, will be tied together into a perfect bow.If you aren't interested in the book after reading a few of the reviews on this site, I'm very surprised. This book is meant for people of all ages, not just adults.

I have read it so many times that I have lost count.There are so many important issues addressed through the eyes of an innocent young girl living in a small town in the south; racism in the 30's being one of the most critical but also tolerance &amp; understanding of differences in others such as socioeconomic level, mental illness and personality traits.This is a book to read over &amp; over again; learning each time something new about mankind, both good &amp; bad &amp; how best to live as a human being. I believe you can discover something different at different stages of your own life as you view the world differently with new experiences so I would recommend it at each new stage or decade of your life.I did not want this story to end and was sad that an author of Harper Lee's talent hadn't written another book. The characters are so vivid that the readers may begin to feel that he knows &amp; loves Scout &amp; her family like I have. Even if you aren't looking for a book addressing the above issues, it has all the elements of an exciting novel...suspense, drama, humor, a bit of romance, a trial, murder, compassion, love &amp; mystery. All that &amp; it is completely wholesome too!Enjoy this wonderful book!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book, which has set in the small town of Maycomb (Alabama), follows the story about a little 8-year-old girl named Scout, her brother, Jem, and her father Atticus. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class. The conscience of a town based in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the quiet heroism of one man's struggle for justice. Atticus is an excellent example of someone who is ahead of their time, he has an unbelievably large amount of love in his heart, and his children really are his life. He is very up front and honest with Jem and Scout, always treating them as equals. By looking for the good qualities within even the poorest or socially marginalized of his clients, Atticus Finch personifies the true goal of his profession, which is to provide each person with equal standing and dignity before a jury of his abilities. It explores human behavior, kindness and cruelty, innocence and guilt love and hate. This novel gave me a better insight to prejudice and life in the south during that era, and left me an impact I will never forget. I learned and understood many new aspects of life by reading this book. Harper Lee has a point to make and she does it very well. I would recommend it to anyone who is ready to sit down and really read a great book. This book has been one of my favorites, because it taught me different ways to see life and the most important...values that changed my mind."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"TKAM is not just a novel about a man's struggle for justice &amp; truth; it is not just an indictment of racial prejudice &amp; blind conformity to traditions of society; it is not just about the agonized, confused growing up of two intelligent &amp; sensitive children - it is about man's struggle to be loyal to his conscience; about man's recognition of the sacredness of the human personality; about man's respect for man.Above all, it attacks that aspect of life which deserves the greatest denunciation in human existence - irrationality.I would not call TKAM one of the greatest novels of the world of all times, but it is certainly an excellent one.One of the main reasons I'd offer for saying this is that it is not a novel which explores several ideas in all their depth and profundity, such as the novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky, neither is it a masterpiece in characterization - exploring the innermost recesses and complexities of the human soul, like the plays of Shakespeare.Therefore, I'd give it four-and-a-half points; but between a choice of 4 and 5, I'd select 5.Nevertheless, it is a novel which captures several themes which are weighty by their basic import and weaves them into a story which brings them out wonderfully.One of the best aspects of this novel is its perfectly delightful humor.It exudes a sense of joyousness &amp; benevolence, having been narrated from the perspective of an intelligent, precocious, sensitive, aggressively defiant and highly individualistic girl - Scout Finch, who, in the course of novel grows from the age of 6 to 9.Another element which endeared me to this novel is its highly appealing characters, especially Atticus Finch - a man of conscience, honor, &amp; dignity, full of benevolence &amp; goodwill, and the perfect gentleman; a father who doesn't want to impose on his children the stifling tradition of society or family, but allows them their space to develop their distinct individuality, at the same time inculcating in them, without the use of fear, a unique value system which can make them strong, proud, independent and compassionate individuals whom no tragedy and suffering can embitter or break.The character of Jem - Scout's elder brother, as intelligent, sensitive and proud as Scout, but less aggressive &amp; defiant &amp; obviously, comparatively more mature; Miss Maudie - firm but loving; and Cal are well-drawn &amp; lovable too.Harper Lee has captured the mood and \\"feel\\" of country life - of a sleepy, old, rather poor &amp; conservative town; of a small boy stepping into adolescence; of a young child's very simple, straightforward &amp; honest way of looking at life, with great insight &amp; truthfulness.In conclusion, TKAM is a must-read. It is a novel which re-affirms one's conviction in the innate goodness and nobility of the human soul."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Scout and Jem Finch adore their father, Atticus.

An African American man, Tom Robinson, is falsely accused of raping a white woman and goes to trial. The crime, at the time, could potentially result in the death penalty for Tom; certainly, racist \\"mob-rule\\" to take Tom's life coexists with his trial proceedings. A white man, the lawyer Atticus Finch, takes up Tom's case in the face of racist resistance and taunting. A keenly felt subtext in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is how Finch's children and their friend soak in what is happening.As \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1961, its tension, suspense and address of racial issues were timely as it fell in the midst of The Civil Rights Movement. Yet, its themes of racism, injustice, and the passing on of values to our children for the generations to come will be timeless and universal. Lee's prose transports the reader into the worlds of all its characters - the lawyer, his children, the man on trial and his family, as well as Macomb's many racists - and its soft moralizing, so poetically and rightly put, touches any open heart."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I cannot recommend this highly enough.

The book is riddled with details of everything from the people to their scenery. I would give it a five out of five star review. This book was so popular with people that they actually made a movie about it, which is also a classic. Besides the great story it tells TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is also unique. This book was the only book that the author, Harper Lee, ever wrote. The synopsis of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is about a southern lawyer, in Alabama in a sleepy little town called Maycomb during The Great Depression, who teaches his kids right from wrong and about how wrong it is to segregrate people and shows his kids firsthand through a trial about a black man who is on trial for rape. The story takes place through the eyes of the youngest of the children who is called Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a captivating tale that \\"takes readers to the roots of human behavior-to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos.\\" This book has sold over eighteen million copies in print and also has been translated into ten languages and today it is considered \\"a masterpiece of American Literature.\\""},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I decided to revisit this timeless classic since I hadn't read it since high school and hardly remembered it, which made me feel like I was missing out on something. The whole novel was entirely fresh to me and I was swept away once I got into it (and got past some of the southern language, accented speech and Ebonics). Mostly, I was enamored with Atticus Finch. His demeanor and sensibilities were remarkable under the circumstances and I admired the way he handled his relationships with his children. I also enjoyed watching Scout and Jem mature over the course of the years. It is no wonder the themes and characters have remained a staple in American literature for the last 50 years. The courtroom scene is riveting, the racial commentary poignant, the perspective priceless. Everyone should read this at least once in their lives if only to savor the richness and depth of Harper Lee's brilliance."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book, by Harper Lee is a true classic. Every character, every scenario is perfectly written. It's touching and heartbreaking at times, but the book ends on a note of hope. Even secondary characters have an unique personality, from Calpurnia, to the Cunningham's. Atticus Finch is truly a great lawyer, fair and just-which is proven at the end, when he doesn't want his own son, Jem, to have unfair protection against the law. He doesn't quite care about others opinions, and is able to see the bad of the world but still believe in it all the same.This book represents the loss of innocence, shows racism, and depicts cruelty, all from a young, still innocent girl. This is truly a great book, and anyone who has not read it is missing out."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This was a birthday gift for my mother and it's become her favourite audio book. She leaves it playing as she works and never tires of it. An excellent gift."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book while recovering from surgery. I loved it immediatly. It's an amazing story and the main character, Scout Finch, is incredible. I even named my kitten after her :). For those of you skeptical about reading this book (some of the many reasons why I decided to read this book had to do with negative feedback about it), I hope this will clarify its contraversial content.The concept of rape in this story is necessary, given that it takes place in the south during times of racial injustice. Not many people see past the crime and ignore the purpose it serves in the story. The point of this story doesn't have much to do with rape, but the prejudice that comes with the accusation.Another strong point in the story is towards the end, Scout questions her teacher when she condemns Hitler for the Holocaust, but at the same time discriminates against African-Americans. Harper Lee, I believe, put that in there to point out the hypocrasy of racists.This is a must read and I'd recommend it to everyone. It immediatly became my favorite book and I hope you consider reading it too."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Her voices for the various characters and her southern accent are enchanting. She was a pleasure to listen to. The story is told by Scout, the daughter of Atticus, an attorney defending a black man accused of rape. The story illustrates the ugliness of racial inequalities in the South which hurts. But it also shows human goodness with a decent ending.DATA:Story length: 12.3 hours. Language: offensive racial slurs. Setting: Maycomb, Alabama, prior to 1960. Copyright: 1960. Genre: human relationships fiction and race relations."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book captivates the mind with its wonderful adventures and adorable characters. Seeing the world through the eyes of an eight year old may sound dumb, and not a great way to spend you time. On the contrary, the memories that you had as a chold growing up emerge from a long sleep and you start to remember your adventure. Remember the haunted mansion down the street? the old man who murdered his wife? Well, this story talks about those stories, and more. It talks about matters that even most adults don't approach in the modern world. The setting is in the depths of the Great Depression, and it takes place in little Maycomb County, Alabama. The story weaves in and out of race, caste systems, and everyday life alongside fun in an \\"in-depth\\" story. This book has much more depth than when first read. Many chapters that seem random aren't that strange for they all have a meaning. I personally loved this book. I read it at school and it brought so much fun while reading it. It also brought the thrill of watching a trial through the eyes of a child. We as the readers are made to think in this book, but not so much that it's hard. Because our lives have progressed so much we see that her world is very different from ours right now. But similarities are still there. A couple of chapters in this book represent how even though something looks like it has been uprooted from our world (ex: racism), to get it to go away, you have to dig it up from it's roots. One major theme in this story is Roots and History. It even has a little tale of puppy love! (Remember those first crushes?). I realize that I make it sound bad, but that is because in class we do tend to overthink everything. That's why if you're an intellectual reader or just someone who likes books or to pass time, no matter what genre you like, this book will appeal to you. Buy this book or borrow it from a library or a friend and read it, because it will touch your heart as a great book and warm your heart as a human being. The movie though... Well, that's another story."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I love this book! I read it once in middle school and decided to read it again after I saw the movie \\"Capote\\". I enjoyed it so much the second time I went out and bought it so I could read it a third, fourth, and fifth time.Harper Lee inspires me as I become engrossed in her story of Maycomb and its most prominent resident, Atticus Finch, and his family in a time when life was harder and people less accepting. With diversity and the mystery of Boo Radley weaved around the foundation of Atticus and his children Jem and Scout, it is no wonder this book has been named a classic and studied in English Literature.The lives of Jem and Scout are changed forever as they witness a case involving an African American man whom is wrongly accused of a crime and defended by Atticus. Additionally, they learn life lessons as Scout enters school and moves up in the ranks with Jem. Atticus calls upon his sister, Alexandra, when the case begins to take a toll on the family as the children are forced to deal with some people's unbending ways and negative views of Atticus's client, Tom Robinson. Then, there is the mysterious gifts that appear in the knot of the old tree infront of the Radley place. Will Jem, Scout, and their friend Dill ever be able to get Boo Radley to come out of his house?I highly recommend this book to all who have not yet read it and to those looking to revisit an old classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It was in 11th grade that I ran into this book in the school library and even back then I fell in love with it. But it was a week ago (4 years later), when I finished reading it for the second time, that I fully appreciated its brilliance.To my great joy, the author, Harper Lee is alive! In fact, she celebrated her 80th anniversary in April. So, besides planning to write to her to express my gratitude for her masterpiece, I intend to make her a belated birthday present. Now if I help you feel an urge to read To Kill a Mockingbird, moreover, if you really get round to reading it, I believe she'd be glad to have this present from you.Let me begin by mentioning that Harper Lee is said to consider her book as a simple love story. I don't know if she was serious really. If she wasn't joking, then what she meant by a love story was something quite different from the dictionary definition, because To Kill a Mockingbird is far from being a story about a romantic relationship. However, if we define a love story as a story about pure love and care for each other, a story about deep affection for our family, about concern for those we believe deserve our respect and trust, then it is the most touching and moving love story I have ever read.The plot covers just a few years, which, however, seem like a long time because during that time the two protagonists - Scout and her elder brother Jem - learn their crucial lessons about life. In this sense, the book could rightfully be defined as a bildungsroman. The story is told by Scout who looks back on her childhood with greater understanding than when she was little. In fact, judging by the way she relates those days, back then she only relied on her intuition to grasp what was happening and what she was being told. Actually, this was exactly what helped her see things more clearly. As a Mr. Raymond told her and her friend Dill one day, \`...you are children and you can understand it.'To cite Mr. Raymond again, the book is about \\"the simple hell people give other people - without even thinking...the hell white people give colored folks, without even stopping to think they're people, too.\\" But it is not just a story about racial segregation and severe discrimination. Scout tells us about the way her father and the cook Calpurnia bring them up. Thus, To Kill a Mockingbird could also be considered a handbook for raising a child. I myself reckon that it has already influenced the way I would treat a child of mine. And this is another reason why I am grateful to Harper Lee. The approach of Atticus (the children's father) to Scout and Jem is definitely one to be admired. Every other thing he says or does is worth quoting as an example to follow. One of the very first lessons he teaches Scout is one of empathy:\\"First of all,' he said, \\"if you can learn a simple trick, Scout, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view - \\"\\"Sir?\\"\\" - until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.\\"Ironically, this very first lesson plays a major role in her understanding of matters, events and controversy that would otherwise be above her comprehension. Ironically, I say, because very few people in the small town in Alabama where she lives were taught that same lesson.Despite all the bitterness in it, To Kill a Mockingbird is also a fun read, sometimes even hilarious. What mainly contributes to this effect is Scout's perspective of her family, the townsfolk, and everything she witnesses. Were these accounts not a child's ones, they would often sound as sarcastic remarks...for Scout's forthrightness.To conclude, I regard this novel as an unquestionable masterpiece. To be honest, I cannot wait to read it again. What is peculiar about it is the fact that as much as the plot involves the reader, and as poignant as the climax is, I don't think there is a real climax. The suspense and the emotional intensity built up from the very first page don't really leave us after the alleged climax, but even grow stronger. And what resonates with us is that \\"it is a sin to kill a mockingbird\\"."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I never read this book when I was young, but decided to read it when my children were assigned to read it (along with other classics like The Giver, Catcher in the Rye, etc.). What a great book. I have read accounts of real-life cases in the last century just like portrayed in the book, and all too often the same kind of frame-jobs are being done today.What a great analysis of a multitude of characters with very real motivations for the good and evil they do. I really like the book and think it belongs in the pantheon of literature for a well-rounded liberal education."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee most certainly deserves its place among the classics. It is a book that teaches the coexistence of good and evil of society with a very unpredictable story. The story starts out as simple as just three kids trying to get a mysterious neighbor by the name of Boo Radley out of his house. The story soon changes to the main characters trying to clear an innocent black man, Tom Robinson, who was framed for a crime and will be sentenced to death. At this point, the story with Boo Radley is almost completely ignored. You then wonder what the point of the beginning was. But soon after the outcome of the court trial of Tom Robinson, you then wonder where the story is really going. When you arrive at the ending, everything will all come together. This is one of those books that gives more than just one scenario but leaves you hanging before they can be concluded. The ending of the book then closes any open ends of the story and brings you to the lesson that the book is really trying to teach. A book's ending really determines how good the story is and To Kill a Mockingbird's ending is something you will never forget. I recommend this book to anyone regardless of their taste in books."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Few books can claim to be in the same league as this one (\\"The Great Gatsby\\" and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" comes to mind). It is a beautifully written story that through the eyes of child captures the stupidity of adult life, the dedication of man and ultimately the dignity of human beings. The girls naive questions, here longing for being allowed to do whatever she pleases and her fathers grand figure are so compellingly crafted that I was simply floored by the writers prose.We all know a Atticus, a Ewell and most importantly we all have bits and pieces left in our self that truly understands a child's bafflement over a complicated adult life. The parts within that never grooved up, that still becomes respectfully astonished with the life of our parents and the part that wants nothing but to play in the dusk of a warm summer night. This book reached in to my soul and touched a part of me that have been gone to long - from the time when summer meant playing, fishing and walking around in shear happiness knowing that life would always be like this, that my parents would never grow old and that I would live a happy life for ever. No other book has ever done that, it is simply amazing and to be read again and again. I would give it a thousand stars if I could."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The book is about Jem and Scout live with their father, Atticus, who is a lawyer. The book takes place in the segregated south in a little town. Atticus is asked to defend Tom Robinson, a black man, on charges of rape and assault.My teacher recommended To Kill a Mockingbird screenplay to me. I liked the cover because its country looking, and I like country. The book was interesting.I recommend this book for people who like books set in the country and who are interested in discussion about race. Also, people who like suspense will enjoy this book and some who know about court a little. I feel this way because it's what I thought. The ending was good, but there was a little sad part at the end. I was dissatisfied because something happened that shouldn't have."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The first time I read this book, at the age of twelve, I really connected to the narrator's view on the novel's plotline, although I realize that I didn't particularly appreciate all of the plotline. Now, after having read it several times, it is one of my favorite books that brings the civil rights movement in a different light than one learns about in history classes or other books. The separate point of view, through the eyes of a little girl (although the language would make you think otherwise), demonstrates how unnecessary many of these stereotypes and predjudices were at the time the book was written (or at the present day). Now, years later, the book is still an important one for poeple to read--the themes are universal, and it is simply good literature that is interesting and a wonderful book all around."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, written by Harper Lee, is an interesting novel of the coexistence of good and evil. The most important theme of To Kill a Mockingbird is the book's exploration of the nature of human beings, whether people are essentially good or essentially evil. The book focuses on the problem of racism between black and white people. They had to go to different schools, sit in different places and talk to certain people. The African-Americans didn't have the same freedoms as the other race.Scout Finch is the protagonist and narrator in the story. Her brother, Jem, and her are living in Maycomb County, Alabama with their widowed father, Atticus during the Great Depression. He is a lawyer. During the summer, the children meet Dill, a friend staying in Maycomb for the summer. They form a friendly bond during that summer. They acquire an interest in the neighboring household, the Radley place. There are always little trinkets left for the children in a hole in the tree on the Radley property, but the house is supposedly haunted. The children take the gifts anyways, mysteriously left by Mr. Arthur (Boo) Radley, brother of Nathan Radley. Atticus resents other's thoughts about Boo Radley and wants everyone to see what life is like through his eyes.Later in the book, Atticus agrees to defend Tom Robinson in a trial against him suggesting he has raped a white woman, Mayella Ewell. The story has a surprising ending nobody would think of. I liked this book personally because it explains how people treated each other back then. It explains the real evidence of human goodness. You should never judge a book by its cover. You should always treat others with respect. In the end, Scout learns that being prejudice will not help her stride for human goodness."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"'To Kill A Mockingbird' is simply the greatest book of all time. If you haven't read it already, you MUST! If you are ever going to read any one book in your life, let it be this.'To Kill' tells the story of growing up in a small southern town and loosing your innocence. The main characters, Atticus, Scout, and Jem are legendary and reading the book, you feel as if you know them. They remind you of people you know or at one time knew.What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? Not much. All I know is that everyone should read it sometime before they die. It's also one of the few books that you can read more than once without ever getting tired of it. So, make a trip to your local library, pick up a copy, and enjoy every minute of it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I think many people have missed the point of the book. The book is a classic coming of age story about two young siblings in the south. It's told from the point of view of Scout, a preteen girl. The different events in the book are relevant because they lead to Scout's maturity. She goes from an innocent child, to a maturing preteen. Example: In the begining of the novel, Scout and her brother Jem are obsessed with the idea of Boo Radley. They don't view him as a human being. He is this scary thing that they don't quite believe is real. They come up with ideas to get him to come out of the house. They even try to look through his windows to catch a glimpse of him. Later, when Boo saves Scout and Jem from Mr. Ewell, Scout feels ashamed of she and her brother's previous treatment of Boo Radley. She realizes that he's just another human being. He's nothing to be afraid. He deserves to be treated the same as everyone else. That moment was when Scout left her childhood behind. The rape trial is also another turning point in Scout's maturity. It's not about rape or racism. Those themes help to shape the person that Scout will become. I loved this book and I plan on buying it so I can read it whenever I feel like it. I've read some of the reviews here. I think it's sad that many people missed the point of the book. I also think that this book might not be for everyone. I think southerners will relate to the book better than anyone else. I found Scout and Jem's way of life to be very much like my own growing up. I think the book is a must read for everyone, but people need to open their minds and look deeper. Look past the rape and racism. The book is about so much more than that."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is filled with moral lessons, adventure and humor. The children's growth and maturity thoughout this story is true to life. Their relationships with each other, their father, neighbors and other relatives engage the reader and keep you wanting more whether those relationships are positive or negative. The characters and the descriptions of the neighborhood and town are vivid. When reading this book, one becomes linked with the characters as if those townfolk were one's own. It can't be put down until it is finished. And the finish is worth the wait."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is the best book I have ever been assigned to read. I have re-read it 5 times since it was required in my freshman year of high school. This isn't just a story about race or about growing up in the South, it's a chronicle of courage and justice and truth, from the eyes of a little girl. Please don't buy the Cliff's Notes... You may miss the chance to find the book you will claim as your favorite for years to come."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee is one of the best books I've ever read. Being in only eighth grade, I clearly remember the way I felt, and what I did during the summers when I,too, was as young as Scout. This book clearly portrays what a child would really do and think. It is believable in all ways (even though we would all like to believe that the racism was too extreame- it wasn't) and I really love that this story could have been the real life of a little girl. On top of the fact that it is realistic, it is also very well written and very gripping! I read this book for school and wasn't expecting to like it at all, but I loved it, partly because it is so incredibly well written, and partly because of the amazing emotions and thoughts that it stirs up in your mind. These issues being adressed by a child can be looked at and interpreted on a far deeper level. It can be read by anyone who enjoys any kind of book. It touches into many different genres and is loved by all kinds of people. It's a great book!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is definately a book you want to read. Although it was written long ago, the themes of the novel still have strong applications to the modern society. The issues are the same: race relations, family/single parent, education, customs/heritage, culture, legal system.Harper Lee's masterpiece gracefully tells the story of a young girl narrating her experiences growing up in the South. Reading the narrative allows for us to remember the kid in our own hearts, and the playfulness and innocence of such a childhood. Reading the book also puts a number of pressing social issues right into our faces, and subconsciously we find that we are influenced by the work of Harper Lee, in this respect.I have bought this book for many people, and strongly encouraged them to read it.

Reluctantly, I picked it up and began reading. Within minutes, I was watching young Jem, Scout, and Dill grow up, as everyone does, in 1930's Maycomb, Alabama.The author, Harper Lee, does an amazing job of portraying the characters exactly as they were meant to be; very few authors can make a reader admire with the utmost respect for a character as Harper Lee does with Atticus Finch, father to the narrator.If you are looking for a book that will keep you interested until the very end, this is definitely the one.

The characters were detailed and very realistic. Scout, the main character, presents the novel as an adult looking back, which helps the reader see exactly what a child would see, and learn exactly what a child would learn.

Not only was the book excellent but the movie was great. With the movie you can see and feel the emotions that the characters where going through.

That it's the perfect story told in a manner that is thoughtful, insightful and heartbreaking in its examinations of the lives of three children who live in this town and tale.Harper Lee has taken the times and places of her childhood and woven them into a tale that transcends both time and place. The lessons, foibles and fables of the story have, over time, come to symbolize the struggles of all people who are striving to make themselves better and are bravely facing fear and hatred.This is a book that will change the mindset of most thinking persons. If you do not come away from this book with some thought as to what is bravery and what is the cost of that bravery then you need to go back and reread this incredible book.I know that it changes my life and mind each time I read it.

It is a book about two children trying to grow up in an extremely racist town. At a young age their troubles are somewhat childish, but as they grow up they learn what real fear, courage, and prejudice is. First, people should read this book because it teaches a strong life lesson. It shows that everyone deserves to be treated the same no matter what they are. Second, people should read this book because everybody can relate to the events in it. Everybody has gone through growing up and leaning things that you never knew existed. Lastly, people should read this book because it keeps the readers attention the entire time. I will admit that the first twelve chapters are a little slow but one the reader gets further into the story it is almost like you cant put the book down. In conclusion, To Kill a Mockingbird takes place in a small town in the 1930's. Everybody should read this book for countless reasons. It will keep the readers attention the whole way through. :)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Who is Boo Radley? Why is Atticus defending a black man knowing that it is affecting his kids Jem and Scout? What does the title and cover have to do with the book? Who killed Bob Ewell?Some of the main characters include Jem, Scout, Atticus, Calpurnia, Aunt Alexandra and Tom Robinson. The story starts out with Jem(10) and his sister Scout at the age of 6. The kids live with their father Atticus in Maycomb county located in Southern Alabama. Charters 1-12 cover the last couple years of their childhood before they start getting treated like young adults. In the beginning chapters Jem and Scout spend most of their summers with a boy named Dill who is a great friend of theirs. One of their favorite things to do was to try to get a neighbor of theirs named Boo Radley to come out of his house. Later on when fire struck Miss Maudies house Boo Radley would sneak out with a blanket to put on Scout and Jem as they watch a friendly neighbors house go up in flames on a cold winter night. In the middle of the book Jem and Scout's father Atticus, who is a lawyer, goes to court to defend Tom Robinson who was black and was accused of rape.I think people should read this book because it is filled with myseries and always makes you think \\"is it a coincidence or did the Author mean it to be that way\\". One example of that in the book is the fact that Jem Scout and Atticus's last name is Finch. A finch is a small peaceful bird and the Finch's in the book are nice caring people. It also shows you exactly how poorly blacks were treated making it a good lesson on racism. The only reason why I would not reccomend this book is because it starts out slow and takes a while to read because of how small the print is.Overall, this book is filled with hidden mysteries that take the best of readers to catch on to.

Narrated by 6-8 year old Jean Louise Finch--who scorns the idea of becoming a lady--the story depicts a child's gradual awareness of racial tension and bigotry in the deep South. She and her older brother, Jem, experience the usual round of kids' fantasies and pranks, Us-against-Adults mentality in Part One, which serves as an extensive background for the dramatic and fatal confrontations in Part Two. With a visiting neighbor boy, Dill, the siblings are obsessed with luring out a reclusive man in a spooky house next door, Mr. Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.With deliberate casualness the author mentions an upcoming legal case whose Black defendant will be represented by Scout's quietly dignified father, Atticus. Over the ensuing months she becomes aware that the town and even her extended family are disgusted with the calm tenacity of this man of principle--who has sunk so low as to be proud to defend a mere Black against a White (trash) family. Scout comes to admire her 50-year-old father for more than his patience and his cool marksmanship under duress.She is amazed by his morality as both as a caring parent and as a trustworthy role model of a human being. Alone against the entire white community Atticus commands respect in the packed courtroom and in the court of public opinion. An enduring read for all ages."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is a book I just never read while growing up, and when my 15-year old son began reading it in school, his interest in it pulled me in. I checked it out of our local library but had to return it before finishing. That led me to do an Amazon search. Admittedly, I was disappointed I wasn't able to find it cheaper than I did, but it truly is a book worth having in our home library and is an excellent read. I enjoyed Harper Lee's style of writing, and the setting and plot were gripping and significant. The topics of the worth of a human being, freedom, and prejudice of various kinds, are substantially addressed in this great read, while maintaining a sense of enjoyable fiction. It is most likely for these reasons that it has become an American classic. If, like me, you are on the other side of high school and have yet to read To Kill a Mockingbird, I strongly recommend that you do. At some point in life, it is a MUST READ for everyone."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Usually, cildren never experience the horror of murder but in Scout & Jem Finch's case (in To Kill a Mockingbird) it's different. The author uses Scout's perspective perfectly, all through Scout's early years. This book tells how Scout's brother (Jem) breaks his arm. The author touches very hevily on racism and predjudeces. This book will make anyone grasping for more, while still wanting there to be no more.The Author of this book obviously wanted everyone to understand the fights Jem & Scout get into. The vocabulary is just above mediocre and (even though there are no pictures) you can invision everything. For ex: When Jem & Scout are cornered you can imagine every motion of their fight with a predjuduced man. (It's the same with Scout's school \\"troubles\\".)Lee wants everyone to fully understand about racism and how horrific it is. I mean just about everyone in Maycomb is a racist. Lots of the characters particularly Bob Ewell were racists (Bob Ewell showed it after the verduct of Tim Robinson's trial). It sickens you to read quotes in this book, such as: \\"it made one down and about two ore to go.\\"Even though this book is full of evil incidents, there is a hero. A simpleton by the name of Boo Radly. Sure he is reclusive and seems like a freak at first, but he soon saves Scout and Jem's lives thereby making him a modern day superhero. Even though he does this by killing Bob Ewell, he comes out as the glorious shining, hero in this dark and moving novel.All readers will love To Kill a Mockingbird. It goes healvily into the heart of Maycomb bringing out racism and predjuduces. Even though it touches on such a harsh subject, most readers will understand the points this writer is trying to make."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"A homegrown novel that tells the story of several children living with a single father in less than desirable conditions.

It is a great story of truth as told through a childs view of events happening in a small southern town during The Great Depression.

You cannot put this book down. This is definately a must-read book. Also see the video version of the book. They are both fantastic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I first read this book for an English class in high school and hated it. Luckily, I recently bought this hardcover edition and read it again. It's now one of my favorites. I'm sure there's plenty of other reviews that deal with the plot, but I'd like to emphasize the brilliant characters in this book.Atticus Finch has easily become one of my most favorite literary characters. Lee's brilliance with Finch is that while as the plot unfold you see what a truly great man he is, she shows her audience his flaws as well. This makes him a very complete and rounded character. Scout's also great - she's wise beyond her years, which makes reading a book that centers around such a young character enjoyable. Besides these two great characters, it also is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is probably one of the greatest books ever written. The novel is morally fantastic. The novel is about a family that lives in the south in a community that is dealing with a controversial racial issue. Scout and Jem are young kids that learn valuable lessons while they are growing up. They know that all people should be created equal. For instance, Scout ventures to a black church and does not think anything about it. Atticus Finch, Scout and Jem's father, represents a black man that has been charged with rape. Clearly, the black man is innocent, and Atticus Finch wants to do the right thing. In conclusion, To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful book that is full of great moral examples that people should follow. One of the highlights of the book is Atticus Finch saying, &quot;Before you say anything bad about someone, walk a mile in their shoes.&quot;"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is a Classic. There is really no other way to describe it. I decided to read this book for a Grade 9 Book Report and I loved it! The author gives great character personality and keeps them realistic. The plot is amazing: there is always something happening. Some people MIGHT find this book slightly boring at some parts, but overall, it's a really good story! To Kill A Mockingbird does bring up Racial Discrimination in the 19th and 20th Century, but shows this realistically. This is undoubtedly my absolute favourite book! I highly recommend it to anyone in for a Good Read! :)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I thought I would hate this book because most &quot;GOOD BOOKS&quot; are books that I hate. But after reading this for my Junior Honors English class, I found that I liked it a lot."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I laughed and cried on first reading Lee\`s mastre piece .This is the book I would refer to when asked to name the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird takes place in Maycomb Country. It is a small town where everyone knows each other and is fairly close. The book is told in first person from Scout Finch's point of view. Her, her brother Jem and her father Atticus Finch live in a house in Maycomb with their black servant Calpurina. Atticus, who is a lawyer, is hired to defend a black man in court who was accused for raping a white women. Although Atticus is uneasy about defending the man, he knows it is the right thing to do, although the whole town talks about him behind is back for years to come, calling him a n**** lover. Thefamily finds out what it is like, to stand up for what you believe in. This is somewhat hard for Scout and Jem because of their short tempers however they try their best to be thebetter person and look away when people call their father names. The book also shows Jem and Scout and how they grow up over the years with exciting tales, adventures andjourneys. Their memories and tales are irreplaceable. Most of this excitement is over the summer with their friend Dill, who comes to Maycomb every summer to stay with hisaunt. The three children go about the years, wondering about the mysteries of Boo Radley the Finch's neighbor, who hasn't been seen to anyone in the town in many years, rumorhas it he is dead. Together they encounter childhood adventures, which don't seem so dramatic when they grow up, however at the time were very important. The main focus in the book is on the loss of innocence and also bravery.This book is extremely well written, and has many strengths. One technique used in Harper Lee's writing that is extremely effective is symbolism. In fact, it is such a bigpart of Lee's writing that even the title of her book is the united symbol throughout the novel. To Kill a Mockingbird is a very meaningful phrase in the book. For example whenthey explain why you should never kill a mockingbird in the middle of the book,\\"Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't next in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\" The mockingbird represents innocence throughout the novel. Since the basic theme is the loss of innocence, the characters aresaying that you should never loose the innocence, kill an innocent bird. In the book so many things end up to be not as innocent, so different then they are thought to be in thebeginning. For example the town of Maycomb was such a sweet little innocent town. Everyone was friendly, it was the perfect life. However in the ending we realize that trulyMaycomb and the people who did live there were not so innocent, but in fact extremely racist. This entire part of the book that makes you wonder about what the title and the theme really do mean, is a great strength in the book.Another strength in To Kill a Mockingbird is the ending. So many different events occur in the book and the ending ties everything together. The ending is not happy,however it gives you a reassurance that everything is going to be all right and there are almost no unanswered questions. Even Scout who is still but a child has many of herquestions about life almost figured out, and has been throughout many experiences people her age might never be in. \\"As I made my way home I thought, Jem and I would get grown but there wasn't much else left for us to learn, except possibly algebra.\\"This book did not have many weaknesses at all. The beginning is a little slow moving however. For example some things are explained in detail that have no meaning tothe plot or story line. For example some of the scenes at school , and some of the scenes over their first summers with Dill. Other than that there are no weaknesses.Over all, I think this was one of the best novels I have ever read. Not only does it have a wonderful and in depth plot, but the characters in it seem like you could be therefriends. They are described with so much detail, that when you are done reading, you want to read more about what happens to them. For example does Scout ever become ladylike, and do more people in the town except Atticus for defending the Negro, Tom Robinson in court. After reading this novel you feel like you can do anything you put your heart to, and you can stand up for what you believed. This is so because every character does thissometime in the book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is, without a doubt, one of the best books I had to read in high school. EVERYONE should read this book!\\"Mockingbird\\" tells the story of a young tomboy, Scout, growing up in the South in the 1930s. It deals with important lessons about racism, tolerance, courage, and justice. Scout, representing the innocence of youth, has a much more accepting and egalitarian attitude that most of the other Southern whites in her community. She tries to learn how to get along with everyone in a world where the simple act of talking to an African-American can lead to the undesirable label, \\"n*gger lover.\\"My favorite quote is when Scout's father, Atticus, tells her: \\"I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway... you rarely win, but sometimes you do.\\"\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a very powerful book.

Racism is still an evil today, but it was even more severe in the thirties. This book was written in the sixties, published in 1967, when racism was not regarded as &quot;horrible&quot; and we were on the verge of abolishing segregation, and Harper Lee wrote of these issues before many others did."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I am currently reading &quot;To Kill aMockingbird&quot;.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Superlatives no longer mean much to this venerable classic, one of the best novels ever written. So I'm more interested in describing what makes the book work.Humour is one crucial factor. By never succumbing to the pretentious grandiosity that has plagued many a novelist since the form's rise to prominence in the Victoria era, To Kill a Mockingbird achieves an endearing relationship with its reader. Every character is vivid, with strengths and faults, and Lee achieves that difficult amalgam in first-person narratives presented as recollections: A mixture of an adult's rhetorical power and a child's keen, curious eye. The language is fresh and unburdened by the moralizing which frequently cripples prose narrative (especially books which deal with sensitive issues as this one does).Lee made a perfect choice in personalizing a socio-political issue. To Kill a Mockingbird is predominantly the coming-of-age story of Jem and Scout Finch, and the themes of racism, injustice, conservatism and the Depression are all the better served this way. Issues do not come alive except through the living, breathing experience of their participants and Scout Finch's particular take on the events of this book only makes those events gain in moral strength, not diminish.Boo Radley, Atticus Finch, Scout and Jem, Miss Maudie...the characters of this book have achieved an iconic status rare in modern literature. And it has achieved this not by making them Nietzschean uebermenschen, but by entering into their lives with fair, enthusiastic frankness. And to end off, this is one of only a handful of truly successful negotiations between the dramatic (eg. theatre, screenwriting) and the narrative (eg. prose narrative, filmmaking, folk storysongs) I can think of. Lee's dialogue is sharp enough, and immediate enough, that even if we pared this book down to just its dialogue and situations, we'd end up with a remarkably powerful play. As it stands now, it's a truly successful crossover, its dramatic situations and character interactions every bit as convincing as the engrossing power of its storytelling.I am all for challenging the canons of all artistic forms, but this one is about as close to perfect as I've seen a novel come, ranking right up there with the greatest of the greats. It has its weak chinks -- Atticus' misunderstanding of Heck Tate's point in the second-last chapter is befuddling, for example, but these are so minute that to dwell on them would be overkill. Thematically worthy to be called an American epic, this book never forgets the personal in light of the social. We should be grateful it was ever written."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is slow at parts, and is boring in the beginning. However, during around the late middle it really picks up. The trial shows a fantastic mix of character development and suspense which keeps you engaged for the rest of the book.

This book gives you an idea of what was happening, and what the views were of the time.-Kyle McEvoy, 8th grade Rooptop Alternative School."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"this is the best book i have ever read for school, and one of the best i've ever read for enjoyment"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I liked this book alot I thought it was really good, The beging was a little boaring but as you get to reading it, it starts to get really interesting!

It is worse at the beginning of chapters and loosens up some in the middle but is disappointing from such a fine actress. If the Roses Pritchard version comes out on CDs, I'd rather have it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This seems to be one of those books many schools are requiring kids to read. I have to admit, if you have to read a book for school, this books ain't bad. I mean would you rather read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (which I personally thought was a bore), or To Kill a Mockingbird (not nearly as bad)? If you get a choice between a list of books, I'd pick this one. I wouldn't watch the movie though. That music is just too much. Terrible music. Only two songs and the worst part- THEY STICK IN YOUR HEAD FOR DAYS!But back to the book, I guess it's actually pretty good. I like reading good quality literature and this definately makes the cut. It's probably not appropriate for younger children seeing as it deals with racism and rape but it doesn't go into much detail so its okay for middle school and up. I would probably even let a 5th grader read it or a mature 4th grader.Yeah, the book...um, i guess I probably would have read it even if it wasn't assigned cuz it's pretty good and doesn't take that long to read. It kinda depends on your style I guess."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In recent years I have begun reading what everyone calls &quot;The Classics&quot;. Books like War And Peace, Shakespeare and so on. So far, this is the only classic that I can't stand.The first time I said this to my mother (who is one of the biggest fans of this book I've ever seen) she was of the opinion that I needed to read the analysis of the book and then I'd understand the true meaning of it. Well, even after that I still don't think it's so crash hot.What I mean is that &quot;TKAM&quot; is sort of the &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; or &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; of 20th century literature. I can read it, read about 10 analyses of it and then read critiques of the analyses and - despite having my vocabulary enriched with many long words - I'm still none the wiser about what all the fuss is about. Sure I now understand a lot more about the book but it just doesn't seem to be worth all the racket that everyone makes (&quot;You're reading To Kill A Mockingbird? Lucky you! I LOVED that book&quot; and so on).So the book deals with racial prejudice in America's south early this century. So did Martin Luther King. So it deals with growing up in a 1-parent household. Big deal, I can name a good number of people who have done that as well.I guess my main point against &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; is that it really doesn't offer anything new in relation to the stuff it deals with. I don't know whether that was neccessarily Harper Lee's intention when she wrote it, but that's definitely the way it's come out now that I read it.Of course, the good thing about it being able to be interpreted in so many ways is that when you do an assignment on it you can. I had the &quot;luck&quot; to be told to do an oral as Atticus and then an essay comparing Atticus to Sir Thomas More in &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot;. I wouldn't be surprised if, had I done my oral in exactly the opposite way to that which I did, I would have got the same mark for it - if not higher for &quot;bringing a new perspective to the study&quot;.Don't get me wrong here - &quot;TKAM&quot; is a good book. Well written and so forth. The only problem is that it doesn't really leave you (r me at least) with a satisfied feeling after reading it.If you really want this book then go ahead and buy it. I personally would save my money - but that's just me."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is not very convincing, overlong, mellow, and inconsistent. The novel isn't direct towards the reader in terms of telling who it is for: adults or kids. The characters are overwhelming and the occasional flashbacks are not concrete. The novel didn't captivate myself from page #1 onto #284. Honestly, I don't see the big deal with this book or the movie with Gregory Peck. It had third rate acting and was told in a fairy tale form with the little girl as the narrator. And to just think that Peck beat out Peter O'Toole for Best Actor of 1962!

Harper Lee is a talented writer, and if you've seen the move and didn't like it then read the book because that is far more better. The book mentions many things that the movie does not. To Kill A Mockingbird is a book that adults young and old would enjoy. I had to read the book for school and when I thought that I would turn out to hate it was then that I turned out to love it.

I thought that it was going to be boring, yet what I found was completely the opposite. The time period that Lee sets her story is what makes this novel different. It is the early part of the 20th Century, a time where prejudice could influenced the fate of an individual in the U.S. courts. The ignorance of people concerning issues of race and class are clearly acknowledged. The simplicity of its diction as well as s narration from Scout's perspective create an atmosphere of childhood nostalgia.

My experience is that school actually demotivates people from wanting to read. How many of us can relate with the feelings of never wanting to read another book after high school.

In my High School English class, grades were given on the basis of how many books one read. If you read 8-10 you received an A. The problem was that after knowing one was going to get an A, all reading stopped. Reading is supposed to be done for the joy of it. I hear the word boring used a great deal when reviewing a book. I know so many kids who end up hating reading because they received a poor grade. The classics including To Kill a Mockingbird are challenging books. I would never use boring as an adjective to describe a book however."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Through the narration of young Scout, this is an easy read to uncovering hidden truths within the realms of the human condition. Lee's descriptions and style of writing touches the heart of the reader and allows him to come to terms with all his senses: you feel as though you too are on the search for Boo, you hear the silence in the court room, you can almost taste the flakes of snow melting in your mouth, you can hear the awful sound of the struggle between an evil man and a good boy... you realize what it means to hold the hand of someone you feared as a child but realize has loved you always. You realize what it means to be human. Exquisite!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book was very interesting, yet hard to follow at times. I didn't give it a higher score because it lost my interest a lot because there were too many dufferent characters and stories going on to remeber, so it was very hard to want to keep reading. Since I didn't enjoy reading it, it was hard to remeber all the important events. A plus in favor for the book was that it showed how life was back in the early 1900's. The situation in the book that stuck out the most was when Tom Robinson was killed for practically no reason. I couldn't believe that someone could just kill another person without a good reason. I think mostly adults to young adults would enjoy reading this book, because they can comprehend the discrimination that is mentioned. I highly do not suggest that younger children read it, because it would be hard for them to understand many points. Overall this book is very interesting, but I suggest you give you a good amount of time to read it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"We should spend time on doing something productive when we are young, and read those life thinkings when we are old enough to. So, I don't think that we should force all students to read this book, it should only be an option.But, it still a good book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I am halfway thru this book and it is a wonderful read (no news here). Bought a used book, arrived eventually, but serving its purpose."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee is the author of the book To Kill a Mockingbird. This book is a historical fiction about courage and prejudice. The book is about two kids named Jem and Scout who live in Maycomb, Alabama. Eventually a white man blames a white man for a very serious crime. I personally thought that the book was boring because they talked about stuff going on in the town and sometimes the world."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Is this really considered a classic? Though issue of race and prejudice is certainly of great importance, I don't see as though its been evoked in this book in some sort of revolutionary way. Tom Robinson's story is painful to hear, and the depth to which Maycomb is developed by the author is impressive, but this book is by no means a classic. The author's style is of no great note, and the plot, while carrying the reader through the duration of the book, is not of a &quot;classic&quot;, compelling nature. All in all, a solid book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"If you didn't read the back of the book you wouldn't know what it's main point was. Every book has it's problem. But this book didn't seem to have one. You know it's about a man who has to defend a Black man, Tom Robinson, for the accussation that he raped a white woman. But that just seems to be a part in the story.I mean, the story dragged on and then suddenly this trial pops up. And that goes on for the rest of the story. At the end it's like the trial hardly happened. I've never read a book like this. For example, The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy was trying to get home right? Well Scout, one of the main characters, just sat on the sidelines the whole story and told what happened. She had no dramamtic effect on the book.To like this book you have to have a particular taste for this odd book. I honestly don't see how it's such a great book. It's pointless, and useless. I'm sorry to say such things about such a classic book, but when I saw it I was expecting something more intresting. The book title hardly plays a role in the type of book it is. It is mentioned once in the book but only seems to relate to one small part, not the whole story.I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone I know. You just have to read it yourself to know what I mean."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This was an excellent book for my taste, it made you think about life but...We all know teens would dislike this book. What they want now is action, love, revenge, hate. Not a book that teaches you about life's meaning. Let's face it, nowadays kids do not like this kind of book, although I loved it, they want more modern books that could happen in a near future. They do not like classic or boring things, they want heart-breaking books that leave you wishing more and more. It's the same with everything; games clothes, TV series, music... People's likes change during history, everything changes. Here are some examples of books teens usually read: Divergent, The hunger games, Starters, The kill order, Unwind, Delirium and much more. I repeat, I loved this book, every grown up I know and read it, loved it. But ask your kids if they LOVED it or if they would have wanted something more new, modern.Make yourself the question: Do our kids like the same things as we did when we were their age?Think of it.Anonymous Reader"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Sorry but I honestly couldn't finish this book. I had to read it for my 11th grade English class, and it was utter torture to try and get through the first half of it. So I skipped about 15 chapters of this classic. It was boring, the characters felt flat, I didn't care for the whole plot. It just felt like it lacked basic structure to me. Maybe it was the fact that I was forced to read it. Who knows, but this book had me falling asleep, or just gazing off into space. I couldn't do it, so I would normally leave it opened while I read something more enjoyable. Maybe in the far future I'll pick it up again, and try it out...but hell, I don't think I can. It was such a horror to read, and I don't think I could even spend my money's worth on it.

The reason that I rated a book that blew me away a four was that the beggining was kind of slow. It wasn't boring, but it did take Harper Lee a while to get to the point of the story. It is a phenomenal book that anyone, and everyone, should read, don't let the slow beggining turn you away. It all comes together in the end. I thought that the way the relationships between the characters was explored was excellent. I really felt like I knew them, especially Atticus, and Scout, the protaganist. This shows racism and prejudice in its simplest, most hateful and truest form, and the way it turns nieghbors and friends so strongly against each other."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"one thing no one ever remembers to mention about this book: it's funny (if you have anything resembling a sense of humor, you will laugh out loud at least once, guaranteed...but be warned, you might just cry a little too...).There is much that one can learn in it's pages about ethics, the depression era south, parenting, respect, dignity, pride, and crafting a well written sentence (the subtler points of these tend to be universally lost on 14 year olds and high school english teachers alike).well worth the time and money!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The book To Kill a Mockingbird was an great book. However, there were parts of the book which nI did not agree with, and did not like. The book got off to a boring, slow start, but turned out to be an excellent book. The book is writted through this girl named Scout. She has a brother, Jem, and a best friend, Dill. The book starts out with the three of them trying to get Boo Radley out of his house. However, during the middle of the book they get involved in a trial, which leads to what happens in the end. This book has excellent suspence, and an excellent story line.

My favorite part of this book is the mystery about Boo Radly, thats what kept me wanting to find out who he really was. I recomand this book to everyone ages 11 and up. Its one of the greatest classics. Read it and find out."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I am not a reader, but right when I opened this book my freshman year of high school, it was wonderful. The adventures of Scout, Jem and Dill are amazing. Scout relates to a lot of girls who are &quot;Tom Boys&quot; like I used to be. The mysterious Boo Radley makes you want to continue reading, as he hides more and more things in the tree. The Ewell's were a horrible family... Dirty, and really rude people...

They are all so beleivable and you sympathize with them and feel their emotions...a sign of great writing. I think the thing I like most about this book is that it has a bit of subtle himor thrown in. My favorite line in this book, or any other , is when Scout says &quot; Pass the damn ham, please&quot; at the dinner table. Just an example of the depth of the characters. Atticus is one of the best father figures I have ever seen. My good friend is named Jean Louise and to this day I still call her Scout.

What made this book a gem for me was the way Harper Lee allows the reader to fill in the landscape. Atticus tousels the hair of a little girl before delivering bad news that will change her life forever; we are left to guess how it must remind him of telling his own daughter that mom will never return. He replies to his sister, &quot;I do the best I can with them (the kids)&quot;, leaving his grief unstated.In a time of public disgraces and eternal processing of emotion, Harper Lee's book is a reminder of a time of privacy, decorum, and the power of what is left unsaid."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It speaks atleast something for a book when over 1200 people think it is worth writing a reveiw for.I got my copy of &quot;To Kill A Mocking Bird&quot; when I was leaving home, to join a university in Australia. It was perhaps the only book my dad referred to, and all that he said of it was &quot;I liked it.&quot; I thought I should read it just to know what kind of books Papa liked. If you, like me, have been luck to know nothing more of the book, skip all the reveiws and get the book.Harper Lee has written a very beautiful book, one that will take your breath away. Never cliche, never boring, never sagging. Young Scout and her world is only incidentally in Alabama. It could be anywhere, anytime. With Atticus's teaching of &quot;step into his shoes and walk around in it&quot;, Scout takes her readers into her world. It has old dying ladies, missionary parties, hidden treasures, firing guns, friendly neighbours, haunted houses and all the yarn.

The first half of the book is centered around Scout, her brother Jem, and &quot;boyfriend&quot; Dill as they discover the secrets of Aurther &quot;Boo&quot; Radley. He hasn't left his house for about 30 years and the children suspect his father is keeping him inside. Scout eventually quits the game when she relizes tht maybe Boon wants to stay inside, away from everyone tormenting him.The second half of the novel is about Atticus, the father, still from Scouts view. He defending a black man who is accused of raping a white girl. Jem is sure Atticus is going to win, even after the black man says he &quot;felt sorry&quot; for a white women, indicating he was somehow better than her.The underlying message is about how people are the same and different, beyond just being black and white. Atticus emphisizes this point over and over again and he trys to teach his children principles in life."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is to me, one of the greatest books of all time. I give this book a five star. I think this book is about children's curiosity and harsh reality of racism. The book is narrated by a young girl named Jean Louise Finch, who is usually called Scout. She has an older brother named Jem Finch and a dad named Atticus Finch. In the first part of the story, Jem and Scout are curious about Boo Radley. Boo Radley is a very mysterious man and both Jem and Scout have never seen him before, but have heard things about him, mostly bad. The story then goes on to talk about Tom Robinson, a poor black man accused of raping Mayella Ewell. Atticus, who is a lawyer, will defend Tom Robinson throughout the book in any way he can, but fails. Tom is convicted for something he did not do, mainly because of his color. The trial will deeply affect Jem and Scout's lives forever; and they will also realize, at a young age, the cruelty that comes with racism.I would have to say that I get into and love reading books that deals with racial issues. I am bound to be touched in some way shape or form when I read books that involves racial conflicts or issues. I like books the deals with racial issues because for the most part, I know what one character is going through. As a minority, I have unfortunately experienced some racial conflicts/ issues that I would not think would happen this day in age. Unfortunately there are still people out there who aren't well educated enough to realize that everyone is different in their own ways, but should not be judge in any way shape of form. I honestly think that the only way to solve racial discrimination is through education."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"A true classic, this is one of the best books I have ever read in my life.

Only a truly invincible title can be excellent as a movie AND a novel."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Rarely am I facinated by court stories. They usually bore me and I can never follow them. But with this story, you got so familiar with all the characters that you can't help but get sucked into the story and pay cloes attention. This book made me nervous, made me scared, upset, most everything. It's one of the best classic books I've ever read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book never ceases to amaze me. I have read it countless times, always finding out new meanings or information.To Kill a Mockingbird is set in southern America during the Great Depression. At this time, many people in the South are strongly prejudiced against blacks. The narrator of this story is an eight-year-old girl by the name of Scout. She and her brother, Jem, are insistent on meeting their mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley.Another storyline in this book is the case against Tom Robinson. Tom Robinson, a Negro man, has been accused or raping a white girl named Mayella Ewell. Scout's father, Atticus, has been appointed as the lawyer for Tom. Atticus is a well-respected man, but soon people begin badmouthing about Atticus to Scout and saying that she and her family are \\"nigger-lovers.\\"One major symbol in the book is a mockingbird. One Christmas when Scout and her brother received guns as presents, their father told them that it was a sin for them to kill a mockingbird. Hence, the title of the book. There are many \\"mockingbirds\\" in this book, such as Scout, Tom Robinson, and Boo Radley. This phrase is very important.I highly recommend that anyone, any age, should read this book. It is a great classic about life in the South during the Great Depression."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The novel \\" To Kill a Mockingbird \\" by Harper Lee is about a girl called Scout. She grows up in this novel in the 1930\`s. Her father Atticus is a widowed lawyer and defends the Afrian American Tom Robinson. Scouts brother is called Jem. Their cook Calpurnia is a black women. She is like a mother for Scout. Scout and Jem are very modern educated. Atticus teaches them to treat everybody equally. He is a very important model for both.To my mind the first chapters are very boring and difficult to read, because Harper Lee tells too much about the children Scout, Jem and their friend Dill. Even the account of the citizens and their relationship could be shorter.Wighing the pros and cons one comes to the conclusion that this book informes the reader very well about the situation in America in the 1930\`s. It tells a lot about the society and the living at this time."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee is a novel I believe that every adult should read. The story is told through the eye of a little girl called Scout.She started the story by narrating the events that led to her brother's arm being broken.The events in the story took place in the small Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Depression. To Kill a Mockingbrid decribes a trial of black young man, Tom robinson who was falsely accused of raping Mayella Ewell, the daughter of a drunk and violent white farmer. Atticus was called to defended Tom Robinson and his children, Jem and Scout were caught up beyond their understanding because they were in the courtroom throughout the trial.Maycomb, a recially biased towm convited an innocent man, Tom Robinson for a crime he did not commit. Although it is set in the 1930's in Alabama, events like this or even worse still takes place in our modern world but thank goodness there are still few Atticuses who are true patriot of ethics and morality.To Kill a Mocking is a life changing novel and I recommend that everybody should read it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Alright, I'm only going to say this once. You better be listening because I'm not going to repeat myself. I have only one thing to say about this novel and it is this. Quite simply, this is the finest, greates, the best American novel ever written. The sad truth, it is Harper Lee's only. If one person is capable of such art and beauty, you want them to write every word in their head. Alas, no. But that's it, there is no greater American novel, and I will argue with anyone who dares to prove to me otherwise. It is the classic tale of growing and learning life. Facing tragedy and coming face to face with discovery. It is about innocence lost and innocence that stolen. It is about the indominable human spirit deep within us all. IT IS THE BEST AMERICAN NOVEL EVER WRITTEN!!!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"They say that \\"The Adventures of Huck Finn\\" is the classic American tale of racism. Huck Finn seems to be about how rare an island of innocence is in a world beset with wickedness.To Kill a Mockingbird seems to me to be a re-working of that same story but with a different underbelly. This novel believes that there is real goodness, it offers hope in the face of wickedness. You can stay in one place and watch what you thought was so evil evolve into something good. You yourself can find courage you didn't know you had. You might find that you are better than you realized.This book has true humanity in it's core.It's a beautiful story and it is finely crafted as well.The scene at the end with Scout and that person she'd never met but had known all along killed me."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee has written one of the most effective, entertaining and powerful novels in the last 60 years with \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\". The novel about the south that takes place during the depression. Lee takes an unusual yet stirring view, and that is thru the eyes of a young girl named Scout. A brief synopsis of the main theme is that Scout's father is Atticus Finch a lawyer in a small town in Alabama that has to defend a negro accused of raping a white woman. Whether the man did rape the woman is not the point due to the fact that white Southern society of the 1930's... have already judged him guilty.Atticus's arguments in the courtroom and his point of view is mesmorizing and the couragous stand he makes in defense of his client makes this a page turner. Yet again it is thru the eyes of a child who is starting to discover that the world isn't as nice as she once thought. The circumstances that happens to Scout in the novel are funny, sad, and one part is absolutely chilling. The other plots in the novel are effective as well as the supporting character's.I know that others have written... reviews on this novel and its theme of racial injustice. ...[M]y point of the review is to let readers know that this is an effective novel for young adults to read and discover a part of society that had extreme prejudice and another part of society that endured thru tremendous loss and hardship. This is quite a novel and is highly recommended to all young readers."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is one with both style and substance. The story itselfis compelling, but the writing is also great. This isn't a dumb-downed John Grisham-type popular novel, nor an overly pretentious John Updike &quot;literary&quot; story. The voice of Scout is perfect and it is very rare to see a child portrayed rightly. Unlike other books, the children are neither adults in small bodies nor treated as human larvae unable to understand the world. The things that Scout doesn't understand are the things about this world that don't make sense: racism and injustice. This is one of the handful of books that are close to perfection."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"When I read this the first time round I wasn't too entertained. The fact that it was for school made it even more of a drag. However, in preparation for the exam I knew that I had to re-read it if I wanted even the slimmest chance of passing - and I totally got it that time. This is a brilliantly written novel looking at racism in the deep south America around the 1930s. All the apparently average events are told in a light that makes them entertaining. There are so many hidden meanings, opinions and explanations (ex. when Scout describes Boo Radley it's not at all accurate because it's through a childs eyes - but that isn't made apparent) that you will need to read it a few times before you understand it all.There are a few things that I don't like about the book though:-Atticus Finch is representive of everything that is good and virtuous - which makes him totally unbelieveable. Do you know anyone who let some old woman treat his children like dirt coz she's ill?As there was a black-white division, Harper Lee rarely if ever mixed with black people in her childhood and this is apparent by her generalised descriptions of the black people compared to her detailed descriptions of other white people.However, those dislikes aside, this is a thoroughly enjoyable book. Not completely my thing, hence only 4 stars, but very good."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee didn't have to write another book after &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;; she'd already achieved perfection. This is my absolute favorite book of all time; have read it over and over again, read it aloud to my spouse, and own two beautifully bound, autographed copies of the book, plus the movie. Scout, Jem, Dill, Boo Radley, Tom, and above all, Atticus Finch, are beloved characters more real than reality. What's the book about? Love, respect, humanity. Racism, false pride, ignorance. The ultimate triumph of the human spirit. A little girl who befriends a tragically lonely neighbor. An ignorant girl who betrays her kind-hearted neighbor. This book is so many things and so beautifully composed I think it would've been a shame had Harper Lee actually written another."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, is a brilliant novel which traces the life of a young girl, her family and her friends, while, exploring the unfortunate racial bias of Maycomb County. Through her exposure to the prejudice, the injustice, hopelessness, courage and revenge, she matures to even the extent of an adult. This novel centers on the life of a young girl named Scout, her brother Jem and their friend Dill. Together, they learn to cope with and fight the prejudices of their small town. Throughout their adventure, they meet Boo Radley, a misinterpreted, kind man who has been locked up in his house for years as well as Tom Robinson, a black man unjustly convicted guilty for a crime he could have not committed. These children mature as they stand up to the bias and face reality. In Maycomb County, those who are prejudice make the lives of blacks as miserable as possible. Tom Robinson, who was always kind to the Ewells, was convicted of raping their daughter since he was black, although all evidence proved he was innocent. Likewise, others frequently bothered Calpurnia, a black maid of the Finches, even though she was considered a member, even a &quot;motherly figure,&quot; to the Finch family. Because someone is black or different in other ways, people usually jump to conclusions. The jury, when they saw Robinson, convicted him just because of the color of his skin. Furthermore, Boo Radley, because he was never seen out of his house, was rumored to be a &quot;monster&quot; even though he was a pleasant guy and even a lifesaver. When people jump to conclusions, strength and courage are often needed for them to withstand those conclusions. Jem and Scout's father, who was, until then, considered weak by his children, used his strength and courage to shoot a rabid animal therefore, bringing out his past of being one of the greatest gunmen of Maycomb. Scout, his son, also shows bravery by approaching some prejudice citizens and even convincing them to abort their plan to kill Robinson. Many of these people, through rumors, the color of their skin or life in general often feel hopeless. Robinson, after being convicted felt so unjustified and hopeless that he tried to escape prison and in conclusion, died. Dill, a friend of the Finch family, also felt hopeless when he was unwanted by his mother. Because of the prejudice, sometimes revenge feels like he only way out. Bob Ewell, because of his hatred for black, tried to frame Robinson, and although Tom was convicted Ewell tried to kill him. As revenge towards Ewell, Boo Radley stabbed and killed him. When subjected to these prejudices, maturing happens quicker. Jem, after seeing the injustice done to Tom Robinson, learns about the cruelty and unfairness of life, making him more mature then even some of the adults. Scout also matures as she stands up to a gang of adults to save the life of her father and the prisoner and convinces them to leave. To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the greatest and most well written novels that, after it has been read, makes the problems of prejudices seem closer to reality in such a way that anyone can enjoy, no matter how old."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In the late 1930s, the quiet town of Maycomb, Alabama awakens to a divisive trial that reveals fierce intolerance and tests the strength of a family. The novel's narrator is Scout, an earnest young tomboy and daughter of the town lawyer, who documents her childhood and how it has been irrevocably shaped by a court case her father was assigned one summer. Beyond the court case, however, we find several sub-plots that help shape the characters into who they are by the end of the story. One of those sub-plots being, Scout and her brother Jem's continued interest in their neighbor Boo(Arthur) Radley. Boo Radley was not just a neighbor to Scout and Jem, he was an enduring fascination, an unsolved mystery, and a hero. By examining the relationships between the children, Boo and the other characters, one gets a glimpse of life in a small southern town, with all of its intricacies."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To kill a mocking bird is a fantastic story about a little ordinary girl that lives in a small southern town with the name Jean-louise Finch. The book is like her diary and she tells us everything that is going on in her life. Jean -louise is also known as Scout and has an older brother called Jem that she spend most of the days with. Her father (also known as Atticus) is a successful lawyer that has a difficult time raising the children alone since his wife died after scout was born. Scout is an intelligent and clever girl that likes to learn and therefore knew the alphabet and how to read in an early age with the help of her House -made called Calpurnia. Scout is more of a boy because she hates skirts and dresses like the other girls at school always wear. She loves fighting and does many naughty things with her brother that Atticus and Calpurnia dislike like when Scout and Jem visit the huge, scary and dangerous house with the weird man living in it. The climax or the high point in the book is probably the trial (which includes Atticus and Mayella) that takes place near the end of the book but there are many incidents that happen before this that scout experience.The book is very well written because there is not a single moment in the book were nothing is happening. There are many exciting incidents with unexpected endings and you just cant put the book down because you are all the time curious of what is going to happen next to the little girl. The beginning was maybe a bit boring but when you pass the first two pages the excitement begins. I compared my life when I was as small as her to scout's life and it is quite similar because I was also like boy and always wanted to be like my brothers. This book has everything that a book should have: kindness, love, cruelty, excitement, humour, and frightening moments. I really enjoyed reading this book and I recommend it to everyone that likes to read because this is a book for all ages. The language in \\"To kill a mocking bird\\" is not too difficult so young children that are able to read can read it and enjoy it as much as a teenager and a grown up can."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"First read this one in High School as required reading for English, and with no regrets. Timeless classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I tried to read this book when I was 11, and, with the help of my mom reading the first page (to get me started) I went off and read the whole thing and really liked it. Then, the next year it was an assignment in school, so I read it again when I was about 13, and it was great again - I noticed things I hadn't noticed before. Now at 17, I plan on reading it yet another time and enjoying more subtle things I hadn't seen before, and understanding more complex concepts that had been too far away from my own life at 11 or 13. Anyone should read this book regardless of their age. All people at differnt stages in their life will interpret the message differently and relate to different charactors at different levels."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee writes a wondeful novel that shows us the very best and worst parts of life."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"We read this book in class. Whenever we stopped reading everyone would groan and ask if we could go on. The teachers would smile and say, 'No, but we'll continue reading tomorrow. And whatever you do, do not read ahead.' Some did not listen to the teachers and when we would take out our books they would smile as if listening to an inside joke. This amazing story was my favorite of all our class reads this year. Harper Lee did a wonderful job pulling two story lines together. No part of the story was jumbled or confused beyond repair. The two story lines ran smoothly across each other every now and then and all the 'seams' were 'invisible'. I doubt I will ever read such a spectacular book for a while."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I had an aunt that took care of the children of her brothers and sisters (meaning my cousins, my brothers and I). As a 8 year old child she had us watch the movie with Gregory Peck, it is in b/w.When I was in the 9th grade (a freshman), this book was a requirement, but I knew it already from years before. And I got an A where this book was concerned. It's a true classic with life lessons to learn and remember.Well my aunt died in January 2002 and I found the book and kept it as a momento (among other things) and I still remember watching the movie after all these years. My aunt influenced all of us kids more than she knew.Set in the small Southern town in Alabama, during the Depression, this book follows three years in the life of Scout Finch, her brother, Jem, and their father, Atticus--three years punctuated by the arrest and eventual trial of a young black man accused of raping a white woman. Though her story explores big themes, Ms. Lee chooses to tell it through the eyes of a child. The result is a tough and tender novel of race, class, justice, and the pain of growing up.Ms. Lee takes awhile getting to the point of her tale; we first meet the Finches the summer before Scout's first year at school. She, her brother, and Dill Harris, a boy who spends the summers with his aunt in Maycomb, while away the hours reenacting scenes from Dracula and coming up with ideas in how to get a glimpse of the boogyman down the street, Boo Radley. At first the circumstances surrounding the alleged rape of Mayella Ewell, the daughter of a drunk and violent white farmer, barely penetrate the children's consciousness. Then Atticus is called on to defend the accused, Tom Robinson, and soon Scout and Jem find themselves caught up in events beyond their understanding. During the trial, the town exhibits its ugly side, but Lee offers plenty of counterbalance as well in other things. By turns funny, wise, and heartbreaking, To Kill a Mockingbird is one classic that continues to speak to new generations, and deserves to be reread often by child and adults alike."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"\\"2 kill a mockinbird\\" is 1 of the Gr8ESt books i have EvER read!

I enjoyed reading this book so much that I was actually angry with my teacher when we ran out of time (we read it at the very end of the school year) and she merely skimmed over the last three chapters, which are the best parts of the book!

The ministry of education made a bad, bad choice of making not-so-intelligent average high school students to read this significant, profound, and well-praised bestseller in history (yes, it sells more than any other books in the world, perhaps only surpassed by the Bible.) It's way more than just another hackneyed civil rights book, it's more than an &quot;infantile&quot; (maybe the person who said this was infantile either slept all the way through his or her English classe&quot;S&quot; or didn't have any extra memory in his or her brain to process the fact that a child's point of view was deliberately used to illustrate the point.)plotline, it's indescribably brilliant and skillful in presentation.

We view things through the 8 to 11 year-old eyes of the young girl Scout Finch. After the death of their mother, Scout and her older brother Jem are raised by Atticus, their almost too perfect father. (He often reminded me of Adam Trask in Steinbeck's East of Eden). You could not ask for a better, more patient, and more understanding father than Atticus. As the town's defense lawyer he takes up the case of Tom Robinson, a Negro unjustly accused of raping a white woman.The resulting courtroom drama shakes the previously idyllic world of his two children, especially Scout. The children raise many legal and moral questions for Atticus, and he compells them to come to their own conclusions about the case.What is brilliant about the book is how these children have a precocious understanding of justice... their very innocence and unbiased judgement points out the true horror of racial prejudice. Sitting in the courtroom, they are able to clearly understand the TRUTH that seems to elude an entire jury of adults.Much more can be said in praise of this book, as there are many side-stories going on at the same time as this court case is proceeding. The timeless wonder of it all is how Harper Lee dovetails all of the other incidents to leave us with a sense of the ennobling nature of childhood. Sometimes children can look upon the effects of injustice and have their own sense of \\"justice\\" strengthened, rather than diminished. It takes great empathy and inner spirit to acheive this, but, To Kill A Mockingbird shows us that it is possible."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is truly one of the best novels ever written, period. Every single person in this country should be required to read it. And, no, the movie is not anywhere near as great as the book!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mocking Bird follows the life of a girl in a small rural town. Many things happen over the span of the book. There is a little of everything in this book including suspense, romance, death, and action. The story itself starts out slowly by explaining the background of the main characters and their town. New characters are introduced in most chapters until the middle of the book. As the new characters are introduced, their history and background information are also given.I liked how descriptive the author was while writing this story. I was able to easily visualize most of the characters and even the buildings. The personalities of each character is very livid and leaves an impression allowing you to remember who is who. Despite the many names and people involved, I was able to recall the events in general. This is because most events in the story are important as they each tell give the main characters more and more depth. Each event and character slowly builds up to the climax of the story subtly.The things I didn't like about this book is how the beginning is a bit confusing. The beginning of the story confused me as I didn't really know who the main character was until a few chapters later. Also, some characters I feel were important were never mentioned again after a couple of chapters. I myself like science fiction books but this book was able to keep my attention due because of it's amazing story. Overall it was a good book despite the fact this is not the usual genre of books I read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"My wife and I listened to the cassette on an auto trip to Oregon to visit with our grandsons. Although we had read the book before, the audio tapes made the miles fly by thanks to Sissy Spacek."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In her unique classic Harper Lee depicts the Southern Society of the 1930s through the eyes and words of Scout. Jean-Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch is a six-year old girl who hates school but loves to read. She is a tomboy who enjoys playing with her brother Jem and their friend Dill, while avoiding every lady-like behavior. Atticus, Jem's and Scout's father is an unusually moralistic lawyer who raises his children with modernity and devotion. It is only after the trial of the \\"mockingbird\\" that Scout and Jem come to realize the meaning behind Atticus' teachings. They transgress the innocence and simplicity of childhood and view the surrounding world and individuals with deeper realization and understanding. To Kill a Mockingbird explores virtue and vice as they coexist both on personal levels and in the larger social realm and as they relate to surrounding influences. Although a bit preachy (applying and imploring a plethora of unrealistic idealizations) Mockingbird remains a beautifully written novel entwining a powerful yet touching theme."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Having seen the excellent film adaptation, I felt the need to fill one of the many holes in my literary knowledge and read this classic book. I had trouble finding the time, so I compromised and listened to the unabridged audiobook narrated by Sissy Spacek (published by Caedmon). Her accent is perfect and her reading is excellent.The story is a marvelous coming-of-age tale: it has delicious, comfortable prose, delightful and funny vignettes of a young girl growing up in a Southern town in an age of change, and two powerful and engaging subplots. One deals with respect and kindness - that of Arthur Radley - and one deals with race relations and integrity (and at one point brought me to almost-tears). The character of Atticus Finch, the narrator's father, is a paragon of integrity just human enough to be real. The characters in this novel are wonderfully rich. If you haven't experienced To Kill a Mockingbird or if you'd like to experience a wonderful re-interpretation, I highly recommend this audiobook."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"We had to read this book before eigth grade and at first I was unwilling to read it. When I finally picked it up I read it in one day. It is a pretty thin book, and I don't know why people have trouble with it. Maybe it is the language. If you read enough fantasy and fantasy writing books you will start to understand more dialects of the english language, at least when written. My advice to anyone who is having difficulties with the language is to either take a break from the book and read it in bits(you have probably read too much at once and the words are going fuzzy and your brain is not comprehending things that would normally be simple). You could also try looking up the words that are hard online or reading a book that explains this one as there are many out there.Still this is definately a book to read and if you are like me a fairly easy read and a book you cannot and will not put down. My parents got a bit frustrated with me for this and my mom read the book just to find out what was so interesting that I would not come outside."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"As soon as I read the first page I felt like I was a part of the story. The narrator Scout makes you want to Jump right in. Harper Lee did a fantastic job with making sure the reader would not get bored or lose interest in the begging. Witch is a good thing because I am one of those readers who get bored easily. This is a book for kids who are mature enough to handle the racial comments and actions.This wonderful story takes place in 1935 in the fictional town Maycomb. Which is located in Alabama? The seasons vary so you get a good idea of what they do during each season which makes for some pretty interesting events. This is a very small town so everyone knows each other. There is nothing that goes on in the town that everyone doesn't know about.The main characters in this story are Scout who is a little girl who is very much a tomboy. But she becomes very much a lady by the end of the story. She is also the narrator of the story. There is Jem the big brother. He is very responsible and smart. He is the one who makes sure the two of them stay out of trouble. Then there is there father Atticus. He is on the smartest and nicest people in the book. He is a defense attorney. He gives the children a lot of freedom and treats them like adults. Then there is Boo, he is the man who lives down the street that never comes out because his family hides him from the world. They do this because he is mentally retarded. Next there is Mr. Ewell; he is like the low life of the town. He is considered white trash and is a drunken slob. Then finally there is Tom Robinson, who is African American. He was a very nice and extremely hard working. He is just trying to make enough money to support is family because at that point in time blacks were the lowest on the social scale.The plot of this story is a big court trail. This trail is being help because Mayella Ewell accused Tom of rapping her and beating her. Atticus comes to Tom's aid as his Attorney. While Tom is waiting to be tried and angry mob comes and tries to lynch Tom but the Kids come to his aid. Atticus puts on a great show in the court room it almost seem like Tom cant be guilty, but you will have the read the book if you want to see what happens.The theme of the story is to protect the innocent when you know they are right.In conclusion I have told you about what I thought of the book, where it took place, the main characters, the plot, and finally the theme. I hope with all of this information I have shared with you will help make up your mind whether you want to read it or not. So remember to never kill a mockingbird."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book was interesting and still one of the oldest yet greatest books that is still read today. It was a tragic, exciting, and adventurous book that keeps you grabbing your seat at every turn of the page.Harper Lee writes about how the life of a black man is like during this time as a little girl named Scout. She also talks about her adventures with her brother Jem, and her good friend Dill who all try to get a look at the town's most mysterious character Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.I recommend this book to those who are mature and those who like racism, adventure and have violent themes. I also recommend it to those who like tragedy in their books."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Lee Harper has really done a fine kob of witing this book, this book is so thrilling, sad, depressing, and sort of funny at the same time.

It's always going to be a classic and a fun book to read.To Kill a Mockingbird is about a girl named Scout Finch and her brother Jem. Through three years of their lives in Maycomb, Alabama. All Scout and Jem want to do is play games and have fun with their summer neighbor Dill. During the school year when Dill goes home to Mississippi Scout finds herself getting into a lot of trouble and trying to be a lady when all she wants to do is play with Dill, wear overalls, and beat-up her classmates.One fall her father, Atticus, is appointed to the defense of a black man, Tom Robinson, for the rape of a white girl, Mayella Ewell, they don't have a very good reputation in Maycomb country. Scout and Jem have to put up with all the ridicule from their classmates they realize Atticus is on Tom's side. With this all going on Mayella's father Mr.Ewell is on the brink of trying to do something that will make Atticus a very well tempered man pop.

Harper Lee goes into so much depth of childhood it is amazing. From the perspective of a 6 year old (in the beginning) and later as she grows up and matures. If you look closely, you can identify multiple allusions to the bible; for example, Atticus is a Christ figure. Everything he does is morally, ethically, and what-ever-else-you-could-think-of correct. I cannot claim responsibility for this finding, though. My excellent teacher brought it to my attention.

The second I read the last line of the book, I wanted to start reading all over again. The story stuck with me for weeks after. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's, To Kill a Mockingbird, is a book that I loved to read. Lee portrayed the literary device theme, very well. You should put yourself in other people's shoes so that you don't prejudge them explains what the theme of this is. Within theme, a major topic is where the central character and narrator of this book, Jean Louise Finch, also known as Scout changed from an immature girl in overalls, to a mature, young lady.Many characters affected this change, among those would be her older brother Jeremy Atticus Finch, better known as Jem. Scout looked up to Jem and followed in his footsteps. For example, when Jem and Dill Harris were planning to go to Boo Radly's house to place a note on the window Scout insisted that she tag along. Jem also tried to keep her safe like in the end when he tried to stop Bob Ewell from hurting her, even though it would only redirect the attack to him.Another character that affected Scout would be her Aunt Alexandre, a person that Scout did not favor much throughout the book. Her Aunt desperately attempted to turn Scout into a young lady. Alexandre always contradicted what Atticus said, and never agreed with his ways of raising children. when Aunt Alexandre had a party for her friends, and Scout tried to impress the women by being extremely polite. Normally, Scout would be wearing overalls and she would speak her mind rather than think of how she'd make other people feel if she was rude. Atticus wouldn't have minded that so much, but it would have driven her Aunt up the walls. Aurther &quot;Boo&quot; Radly is also another character with a great influence on Scout. He taught her to not judge people before you actually know them. Throughout the entire story, Scout and Jem would continuously try to get a glance at Boo. They harassed him on a near daily basis just to try and see him. Through all this, Boo left gifts for them in a hole in an old, dead tree, and in the end he saved their lives from Mr. Ewell. An example of how they harassed him was putting on plays that were supposed to be about him and the Radly family, but an example of his kindness was putting a blanket around Scout one night when she and Jem were watching Mrs. Maudie's house burn down.The final character that had a major influence on the life of Scout was Calpurnia, the Finch's cook. Calpurnia, a black, strong-willed woman taught Scout to not be prejudice by taking two white children (Scout and Jem) to her all black church. While Jem was going through his maturing stage, he often left Scout out because he didn't want her around. Whenever he did this Calpurnia was there for Scout, and open-heartedly invited her to help in the kitchen. This helped to make Scout feel wanted. The most significant symbol in the novel appears in the title - the mockingbird. It is a sin to kill a mockingbird because all they do is go about their own way singing and not making trouble for anyone. The mockingbird symbolizes how people try to mind their own business, but society won't let them. Dill Harris would be a symbol of the mockingbird, because he is a victim of society. Dill was repeatedly shipped from relative to relative because his mother didn't want him around. He ran away because he finally realized that he was unwanted by his own family.Boo Radly is also a symbol of the mockingbird because he locked himself up in his house and doesn't bother anyone, but society judges him with no reason. People would blame things on him and Jem and Scout would harass him, and all because he just goes about his own business.Tom Robinson, an innocent black man, is also a symbol of the mockingbird because he was judged by society when he was blamed for a crime that everyone knew he didn't commit. He was trying to be nice, and help Mayella Ewell whenever he was asked to, and for this she made him out to be guilty of a great crime, and even when Atticus proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that he was innocent, he was found guilty. A quote to support the theme of you should put yourself in other people's shoes so that you don't prejudge them is from Atticus Finch, &quot;You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.&quot; In the case of Tom Robinson, prejudice plays around the trial. In this trial Bob Ewell blamed Tom for the rape of his daughter Mayella. This trial was a trial of black against white. Prejudice was one of the largest problems of judging. Though judging is a huge problem then and now it will never be solved. This book is based on reality and therefore is interesting."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is possibly one of those books that you thought (as I did) you'd read because you saw the movie. Take no chances -- pick it up and read it now! This is truly an American masterpiece. If you've seen the movie, its plot is faithful to the book. But you need to experience the subtle dances Harper Lee displays in her writing -- how she interweaves social \\"conventions\\" with the emotions and reactions of children who don't understand \\"the rules\\" because their wonderful father, whom they had always taken for granted, never taught them how to be racists or snobs. The characters are so complete I felt I could reach out and touch them. The simple narrative that explains the title is truly beautiful and becomes a heart-piercing metaphor that has stayed with me.

My favorite part was the end when the last thing you think could possibly happen actually happens. This book is fiction but it sounds as though it could or really has happened. The story takes place in Alabama, 1932 during segregation. It is told by Scout, an eight year old girl who does not want to grow up. She has an older brother named Jem and every summer their friend Dill comes up and visits them. They play games and try and get their creepy neighbor who never comes out, to come out. I think if the story had been told by Jem it would be totally different and the points of view would be very different.

It tells people in this time how blacks were treated unreasonably and how you should treat everyone as and equal and work hard to get what you want to be a respected individual.

It is well written."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee wrote a fantastic book. She teaches you lessons about racial prejudice and social class from Scout, the main character's point of view. Scout, who in the beginning of the book is a six year old girl and by the end of the book is nine, lives in Maycomb County, a sleepy, little, southern Alabama town in the 1930's. There is a lot of social class division and racism, but Scout's father, Atticus uses it to teach Scout and her older brother Jem about justice and fairness. It drew me in and made me understand what happens sometimes in life. The main plot in the book centers around a trial, where Atticus defends a black man accused of raping a white girl. It made me stop and think about racism and how wrong it is. It's not a book that you just read, you have to ponder it. It's a very black and white book without any gray. There are good characters and evil characters. There's a recluse, a drunkard and a purely good lawyer. Many characters are innocent in ways, but then the other side of them is very different.Scout has an interesting story. As the events go on, Scout's brother gradually starts to grow up mentally, physically, and emotionally while she grows up much slower. The recluse comes out to save her and her brother from the drunken man who vowed to ruin their father's life and almost did, and she starts to understand that there is another side to Maycomb. Before the trial there was only a hint of the racism and social class, during and after the trial Scout begins to realize how different some people are from other people and that the town has divided into three groups: the blacks, the racists, and the non-racists. It always was that way, but she couldn't see it. So it is a lot about Scout growing up.I recommend this book for advanced young adults to read. It's a challenge to understand, but the lessons to be learned are important. So go ahead and picture yourself in a sleepy little southern Alabama in the 1930's town on a hot summer's day and imagine yourself as Scout playing with Jem in their fort..."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In this unforgettable story, a woman recounts a part of her childhood in a small Alabama town during the Depression. Her father, Atticus Finch, was the local lawyer, an upright and wise man, who raised her brother Jem, and herself, Scout. The summer before Scout started school, their idyllic lives were full of imagination and adventure; their games often concerned their reclusive neighbor \\"Boo\\" Radley, and how best to make him to \\"come out.\\" Scout began the first grade and found many things confusing, not the least of which was her teacher's admonition not to read any more with her beloved father. Summer came again, and with it, a controversial trial that would affect the children's lives forever: A black man was accused of raping a white woman and, despite pressure from racist townsfolk, Atticus was defending him.The straightforward and innocent rural dialogue absolutely deserves to be read aloud to be enjoyed and appreciated. I often found myself rereading passages again and again, just because they were worded so perfectly. The children's adventures were very easy to picture in my mind, and the narration had a truth about it that was simple, inspiring and touching. This tale of childhood innocence teaches lessons about tolerance and kindness, and paints one of the most remarkable characters in literature, the courageous and loving Atticus Finch. This is a novel to be savored and enjoyed over and over again. It is wonderful.Kona"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"when i was assighned to read this book 4 years ago as a freshman in high school, everybody told me i would hate it. all my friends and upperclassmen i knew said to expect the worst. and after i read the book is when i decided i needed to be hanging around smarter more intellectual friends. the only way you could hate this book is if you're a stubborn immature high school student that would rather skip class than give a rat's but about your english class. the people that hated it were the ones getting \\"F\\"s and didn't want to read anything other than the latest magazine or anime comic book. the story has so much to offer and i just wish all the young people (as if im so old) would open their hearts and minds to it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I just read this novel for the first time, and I wish I hadn't waited so long to have read it. I wish I hadn't lived so much of my life without it in my mind, informing how I look at others and what I think my place in the world is, because I think this book does change how one sees good and its role in the lives of those hurt by the cruelty of humanity.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the story of young Scout, who starts the book out remembering her life at the age of 6. Her brother, Jem, is 10, and their summer neighbor, Dill, is 7 (\\"I'm little but I'm old,\\" he says.) (Interestingly, the character of Dill is based on Truman Capote, whom Harper Lee knew as a child.) Their father, Atticus Finch is an attorney, and their mother, who died when Scout was 2, figures not at all in the story. The family has a black maid, Calpurnia. Various neighbors are also mentioned: Miss Rachel, Dill's aunt; Miss Maudie; Miss Stephanie; Mrs. Dubose; and, of course, the Radley family, in the spooky house the children had to pass on their way to school. The novel begins with Dill's first summer in Maycomb, the small Alabama town that is the setting for this novel. Dill, Jem and Scout fixate on getting \\"Boo\\" Radley to come out of his house. Boo is a mysterious man, about whom the neighbors trade stories and with whom the children like to scare themselves. Atticus takes a dim view of the children using Boo and his life for various entertainments and chides them whenever he finds them engaged in one of their attempts to catch a glimpse of him.The summer ends and Dill goes back to his family and the Finch children go to school, Scout for the first time. Her teacher discovers that Scout can read and tells her that her father's been teaching her all wrong and that she is not allowed to read at home any more with Atticus. Scout also gets in trouble the first day of school for standing up and explaining to the teacher why Walter Cunningham cannot accept a quarter from the teacher to go have lunch in town (he didn't bring lunch with him). Scout explains that Walter can't borrow a quarter because \\"he's a Cunningham.\\" When that is insufficient information for the teacher, Scout says, \\"The Cunninghams never took anything they can't pay back--no church baskets and no scrip stamps. They never took anything off of anybody, they get along on what they have. They don't have much, but they get along on it. ... You're shamin' him, Miss Caroline. Walter hasn't got a quarter at home to bring you, and you can't use any stovewood\\" (which is how they paid Atticus Finch for some legal work he had done for them). Miss Caroline smacks Scout's hand with a ruler; Scout tries to fight Walter in the schoolyard, and then Jem invites him home for lunch. Later Atticus promises Scout that even though she must attend school, he will still read with her every night. And so we get the tone of the father-daughter relationship, practical, loving, guidance and, more than anything, acceptance of Scout for who she is. Atticus also shows over the course of the novel the need to live up to the love his children have for him in his professional and personal life.Soon Atticus is engaged in a legal case that engenders criticism in the town. He has been appointed to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who was accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus's \\"mistake\\" is that he actually means to defend the man. Scout and Jem hear criticism from their friends, but Atticus instructs them never to fight over it with other children, to hold their heads up high. He tells Scout that he could never tell her to do anything again if he walked away from this responsibility. The children watch the trial and the outcome, and the reader sees that like Boo Radley, Tom Robinson is one of the people hurt by the cold world and the evil that exists in humanity. Atticus strives to help his children understand and not be brought low by such cruelty like the hermit Boo and the convicted Tom.Even with the verdict going his way, the father of the alleged rape victim, Mr. Ewell, vows to get revenge on Atticus for making him and his daughter look foolish on the witness stand.I won't go into the climax of the book, but wanted to note that what I love about it is the love that is shown by Atticus in his behavior toward his children, his client and the people he lives with in the town. Even when Ewell spits in his face, he maintains his dignity and seems to believe that Ewell needed to make the threat to carry on his life in Maycomb. Atticus is a kind of Christ figure of the Maycomb community. The children's neighbor Miss Maudie says nearly as much to their aunt, \\"Whether Maycomb knows it or not, we're paying the highest tribute we can pay a man. We trust him to do right. It's that simple.\\" -- this even while others are vilifying him for the work he did for Tom Robinson.As Scout grows, her capacity to to understand grows, too, and her fascination with Boo Radley changes into a kind of longing to meet this man, who never goes outside and has no friends. She wants to meet him and say \\"hey\\" to him and ask him how his day is. Her capability to love and be kind is growing, and she wants to share it.The ending of the book is the apotheosis of Scout's growing capability to live, understand and treat others with dignity, and we also see the ongoing example of Atticus to do right, along with other townspeople who want to protect the weakest and smallest among them. It is truly one of the most moving chapters I've read in my life. (I tear up just thinking about it!)The novel itself is charmingly written, the voice is of an older Scout who maintains her independence and zeal for life, but who understands more than the 6-year-old Scout did at the beginning of the narrative. The story flows smoothly, and the plot is engaging. If you haven't read this, you need to."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a wonderful book exploring issues of southern american life. It is shown through the perspective of the young girl, Scout and depicts the lives of her, her brother Jem and father Atticus over a three year period. Throughout this time we learn of the narrow minded community of Maycomb and the silent neighbour to the Finch's- Boo Radley who has been socially persecuted because fo his individuality. This book really comes down to stereotyping and the judgmental ways of small towns struggling to deal with the big issues. Scout has always been told that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird, as theyonly provide beautiful music, and do not attack. This motto is strongly applied throughout many storylines within this book. The most prominent being of the black man, Tom Robinson, who is trialled for raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell, the daughter of the local disorderly drunk. Atticus is called to represent Tom, and although a lost cause to set him free, tries to the best of his abilities and sticks up for what he believes in- even though being the is the sole person in the town that thinks so.The messages Harper Lee conveys throughout this trial and the story are fundamental issues that all must deal with throught the spiralling journey of life. As Atticus says to Scout- you can only come to understand a person when you climb inside their skin and walk around in their shoes. A poignant, masterful text that should be read by all."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Some people say that the impact of a book is never fully realised until some time after the reading. Nowhere is this truer than within Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird. I first read this book at University some years ago, and to be honest it had a relatively moderate effect on me. But in the years that have followed, the messages that are dictated have continued to make more sense to me, and have in many respects never left me. They repeatedly act as guiding philosophies to the way I try to live my life as an adult.The book tells the story of racial tensions in the 1930s in a small town in the American South. Although the 1930s were some seventy years following the abolition of slavery in America, at this time, in many respects whites still viewed blacks as ill educated, immoral and childlike. To add fuel to this fire, the 1930s were also the defining years of the great depression, a social climate that served to intensify racial tensions, as there was much competition for work.Within this intense social climate the novel dictates a profound insight into understanding racism, and also advises a means to remove this ignorance. It's philosophy simply dictates that racism is the result of fear of the unfamiliar, and that it is this fear that motivates people to categorize individuals as part of a negative group, as a means to control this fear. The novel then decrees that in order to remove prejudice people must have an understanding of others as individuals by attempting to understand their perspective as if living their lives. This would then eliminate fear and stereotyping and ultimately reverse the path that leads to racism.This philosophy is offered to the reader through the objective narrative voice of a child and the lessons she learns through her interaction with various characters within the narrative. Her father is her biggest influence, a white lawyer representing a falsely accused black man at trial, against the views of his peers in their town. As such, as she is lead to an understanding of the novels hypothesis for the elimination of prejudice, so are we the reader.As the novel was written in the 1950s at a time when Southern blacks were demanding more civil rights, such as the right to vote and the complete abolishment of segregation laws, the novel also had resonance in its year of publication. Perhaps Harper Lee saw this has an opportunity to educate the 1950s white community on issues of race and prejudice, at this critical political point.However, I believe the novel goes even further than this and makes points that can educate people from any background anywhere in the world. If people could see others points of view by standing in their shoes and seeing them as individuals instead of part of a larger group, then not only would prejudice cease, but human understanding and interaction as a whole would benefit.This is definitely one of those life-changing books that you will come back to time and time again in your life, always reading it from a new perspective."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Atticus Finch, the unforgettable protagonist of Harper Lee's masterpiece, To Kill A Mockingbird, provides the premise for the novel early on when he states to his daughter, Scout, \\"You never really know about another person until you walk around in his skin for a while and feel it. Then you start to see what life is like from his eyes.\\" Told in the first person, the book is narrated by eight-year-old Jean-Louse \\"Scout\\" Finch, a motherless tomboy, who encounters many adventures and learns several lessons in the rural town of Maycomb, Alabama during the Great Depression. With Scout's elder brother, Jem, by her side, she struggles to accept the racial and economic barriers which had, for too long, separated the townspeople of Maycomb. To Kill A Mockingbird is a love letter to a community steeped in hypocrisy and injustice; the novel suggests that the chains of the Old South would eventually change due, in part, to individuals such as Scout's sagacious and determined father, Atticus. When Scout's father, a local prominent attorney, agrees to defend a local Negro worker accused of raping a white woman, Scout begins to recognize the cancer that has all but choked Maycomb out of existence. As a result of the trial Scout loses her innocence and gains the wisdom that despite ancient grudges it is time for a change in Maycomb. Characterization is a vital ingredient to the success of To Kill a Mockingbird. Harper Lee breathes life into all of her characters; she provides them with not only an outward appearance that rings true, but with also a motivation to every action that is plausible because the author makes the reader walk in each character's shoes. The novel possesses as many memorable figures as any other novel in American history. In particular, Scout, who narrates the book, is transformed from a highly naive and impulsive little girl to a perceptive and sensitive individual by novel's end. Jem, Scout's brother, converts from boyhood to manhood and gains a new respect an understanding for his surroundings. Unlike his children, Atticus remains remarkably true to his character throughout Lee's memoir. His character is so unforgettable that he remains as the most conspicuous role model for both fathers and lawyers in American literature forty years after the publication of the book. Another memorable figure in the novel, Tom Robinson, is a hardworking, caring, and honest \\"Negro\\" who is falsely accused of raping a white woman. Tom symbolizes the plight of all African Americans at the time where prejudice and injustice were commonplace. Perhaps the most compelling figure in Lee's work is the mysterious phantom of the town, Arthur Radley. He remains inside his house down the street from the Finches', a recluse who is neither seen nor heard. Arthur, better known as \\"Boo\\", provides the basis for many rumors and stories that keep the gossips guessing in the small community. \\"Boo\\" is thus held responsible for many ills and faults of the town. The mystery of \\"Boo\\" dominates the imagination and nightmares of Scout and Jem. The characters of the novel contain weaknesses as well as strengths. Lee's novel possesses accurate points of view for the time period that adds to the incredible realism that is conveyed through each individual's personality. Harper Lee's descriptive style provides the reader with remarkable characters and remarkable settings. The attention Lee focuses on small details brings To Kill a Mockingbird to life. Most scenes are enhanced by strong dialogue; dialogue that is particularly evident in the riveting courtroom scene that stays with the reader long after he or she has put it down. An example of Harper Lee's vibrant prose can be found when she sets the scene for 1933 Maycomb: \\"Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer's day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men's stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after three-o'clock naps, and by nightfall were soft like teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.\\" The several themes communicated through Harper Lee's brilliant plausible characters tie the novel together creating a beautiful masterpiece. A classic that ten years from now you will be able to pick up again and enjoy even more the second or third time. I am thankful to Harper Lee for allowing me to imagine walking around in the shoes of her characters."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"When I was nine years old, there were &quot;rumors&quot; that African-Americans would be moving into our lily-white community (it was a suburb bordering on the city of Cleveland). The following year African-Americans did indeed begin moving in - and as a white child I observed abhorrent racism for several years. The white adults were so horrific, that I never again could &quot;trust&quot; their opinions. I never discussed this experience with anyone, and when I first read Harper Lee's book I was in my twenties, and read it non-stop. For the first time in my life, here was a child who &quot;voiced&quot; the essence of what I had felt when I was a child. Bravo to Harper Lee for her incredible creativity and fantastic writing.

It takes the reader through a captivating story of racial perception to the understanding and acceptance of racial tolerance in the small town of Maycomb. Not only does this book focus on various aspects of racism (seen through the eyes of Scout), it's a reflection of the times and the incomperable suppression of man's fight for equality and civil rights. The story is not just about Maycomb--it reflects both the racial crisis of yesterday and the prejudice that still exists. Written with emotion and a rare sense of true compassion, this book will astonish you on every page you read. This Pulitzar Prize winning author instills both humor and suspense in this unforgettable novel. Remarkable characters include Atticus, the defense attorney that defends Tom Robinson in a remarkable trial, Scout, and big brother Jem all will add to the brilliance of this great American novel."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I had to read this novel for my Advanced Placement English class. It was actually something which I loved. Incredible... Harper Lee's novel is a timeless telling of a battle with morality and ethics during the Depression. Major events include Scout and Jem's developments as human beings, with the senses of justice, morality, and self that are integral to the personal psyche; Tom Robinson's accusation, trial, and death, as well as experiences with and the aftermath of these events; and Bob Ewell's hell-bent campaign of revenge against discreditors, along with Atticus' eternally optimistic, comforting presence.SCOUTScout Finch begins her journey in To Kill A Mockingbird as a naive, childish, innocent 5-year-old who is dependent upon those who surround her: Jem, Atticus, and others. When we leave her, she has become more mature, contemplative, and significantly independent in mental areas. Although she still needs Atticus and Jem, Scout's realization of injustice and her ability to \\"climb into [a person's] skin and walk around in it\\" (30) effectively fulfills the moral ambition which Harper Lee had set for the character.JEMJeremy Finch begins the novel as much more mature than his younger sister. However, his journey is no less dramatic. Jem's major developments are in the areas of justice and morals. He was deeply immersed in the trial of Tom Robinson, whose verdict and human loss corrupted his new, inexperienced morals. Via Atticus and the good ol' time, the reader is confident that Jem's pysche will recover.ATTICUSScout and Jem are highly dependent upon their father, who is the basis upon which they are able to morally and mentally develop. Atticus himself, as the foundation, is unwavering. He does not develop so much as details are revealed about him via circumstances that develop the others. If Bob Ewell is the Devil in the novel, Atticus is the always-good Christ figure.LOSS OF INNOCENCEThe main theme, which is so deeply entwined in the novel that it is the source of the title, is the loss of innocence theme. In chapter 10, Atticus, the eternal voice of reason and conscience, tells Scout that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird. This is reaffirmed on several occasions. The theme involves a \\"mockingbird,\\" or a completely innocent, uncorrupted person, being somehow damaged and hurt by an evil force that casuses them to lose their joy. Mockingbirds in the novel include Dill, Scout (who is able to maintain her optimism), and Jem (who is perhaps not so lucky), as well as Tom Robinson. However, the greatest example of all is that of Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley, an energetic, enigmatic boy who was damaged psychologically by an abusive, neglectful father to the point of exile and withdrawal into himself.RACISMThere are many who consider To Kill A Mockingbird's discussion of racism to be taboo and thus have challenged the book. However, the trial of Tom Robinson, an event so central to the novel, is governed by Depression-era Southern prejudice, which includes use of the N-word to provide authenticity. THe message of the book is one of denouncing racism, and is thus integral to the development of anti-prejudice beliefs in the reader's psyche, not to mention for Jem and Scout.CRITIQUE OF ORTHODOX EDUCATIONHarper Lee shows her dislike for orthodox education in two main events. First, Miss Caroline's methods of teaching are shown to be ineffective and encourage Scout to not read until she's supposed to be able to. Atticus, who Lee has established as the voice of right, tells Scout to keep reading, which shows favor for individual development. The second event is the current events sequence, during which Lee claims the objectives of forced public speaking are useless. She is clearly in opposition to the apparent advantages of \\"being singled out [and made] more than ever anxious to return to the Group\\" (243) and the theory that the general populace is more important than one person. This may be part of the reason that To Kill A Mockingbird reflects the very individual developments of Scout and Jem.OPTIMISM VS. PESSIMISMThe novel itself is littered with negative, pessimistic events. The greatest of these is undoubtedly racism, and the townspeople's collective inability to identify and deal with their own prejudice. Countering these events are such things as a three-hour jury deliberation and protection of life by an unexpected hero. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This is certainly true of the novel: Boo Radley will kill them, Boo Radley saves their lives. Maycomb is racist, Scout and Jem are able to use that to develop their morals. However, there are no existences of Maycomb that are so completely different from each other than the existences of Bob Ewell and Atticus Finch. If Bob Ewell wears red horns, Atticus wears a halo, and it is his unceasing presence that comforts his children. Atticus protects justice, innocence, and goodness, and it is no coincidence that in the end it is Bob who is dead and Atticus who thrives. VERDICT: Optimism.PERSONAL OPINIONIt is quite rare that I enjoy examining and dissecting a novel when forced to. TO Kill A Mockingbird is one of those rare books. I enjoyed it as a novel, which has eternally been my main objective. I also very much liked reading into the various morals of the story and learning about the theories and philosophies that Lee had presented.As a novel, I found it to be controversial, stimulating, educational and well-written. While I admire Atticus for his parenting, sense of justice, morality, disregard for absolute propriety, and optimism without naivete, I found his character to be flawed but a little too Christlike. The same applies to Bob Ewell: nobody is that entirely evil, and for Lee to portray him as such was unrealistic. All in all, though, it was an interesting read.There has been much discussion about the use of the N-word, especially by people on this board, including one named D.Thill. While I understand the desire to protect young children from offensive language, perhaps parents such as this person should take into account the maturity it takes to read this novel and to comprehend the objectives behind the use of the word. It provides authenticity; for Lee to not include it would not be honoring her own artistic vision. It has nothing to do with a lack of vocabulary. Perhaps such an individual should review their own grammatical abilities and comprehension in order to then understand Lee's brilliance.The discussion over whether or not the morals of this novel are relevant nowadays ... it's dispicable. I am in an AP English class. Clearly, the Canadian AP board considers this novel to be important. Whether or not the Americans are too offended by a telling of their own sordid history remains to be seen. Not discredting Faulkner or other incredible authors, To Kill A Mockingbird deserves just as much.Children are not stupid; especially in a society such as today's, exposing them to a piece of classic literature that deals with the controversial events is perhaps the best thing that could be done. Perhaps people would rather children learn about these things from TV or movies, where the messages so clearly outlined in this novel may be distorted."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I wanted to know what condition the book was in, the price, and how long it took to ship."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The product was in great shape as promised and delivered within the expected time frame."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book was advertised as like new, some writing in it.It is in mediocre condition with writing throughout.

How disappointed I was to learn that Ms. Lee wrote one masterpiece and then no more. But she made me understand the makings of this man, Atticus Finch, who defends the poor and undefended -- a man who is as deeply committed a parent as I have ever seen. Atticus is a gentle soul, and a compassionate and tender father to his motherless children. He calmly explains to Scout, and by his deeds demonstrates to her, that an individual can't capitulate to the violence and ignorance that surrounds him or her because then that person becomes part of the problem and not part of the solution. I can't be really sure, since it has been so many years since my first reading of this remarkable book, but somewhere along the line, I decided to become an attorney and become a voice for the voiceless. I have a feeling Atticus Finch had a lot to do with my choice. I don't think it was by chance that, many years after my initial read of To Kill a Mockingbird, my son, at age thirteen, not exactly a &quot;hooked&quot; reader as I am, was assigned this book and fell in love with Scout and Atticus. He didn't complain about reading it and we discussed the content of the book, realizing that, thirty five years later, the story still had enormous meaning and relevance. And I found myself compelled to read the book again. It was more wonderful the second and third time around as it was when I was ten. I don't know how many books I have read in my life (probably hundreds and hundreds) but this little book still makes me feel and think and resolve to do just a little bit better."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Nothing does this book justice other than reading it and experiencing it for yourself. I cannot believe that I had not been introduced to this book sooner in life. If you must read this book for a class, like myself, an incoming law school student, please actually take the 12 hours to read it. Do not waste time with the movie, because it leaves out too many important details. It is very light reading, so you will have no problem with finishing it in a timely manner. Plus, you will never want to put it down."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Absolutely brilliant - the characterisation, the plot, and best of all, the symbolism. Excellent. I've read it four times in the space of a year."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I first read To Kill A Mockingbird in high school, sophomore year. I was required to. When I finished it, I turned back to the front and read it again. I am from the South, and I KNOW these people. This is us, whether we like it or not. A beautiful novel, and a great novel of childhood, with the likes of A Prayer For Owen Meany, and Stephen King's novella &quot;The Body.&quot; Sure, in many ways it is racist in its views, but THIS IS PRE WORLD WAR II SOUTHERN AMERICA! Like it or not, people actually thought like this. I've never understood those people who want to rewrite history for their own ends. It just proves that they're not paying attention. Atticus Finch is one of the great American characters of fiction, and the morality of this book shines through. The naysayers will fall into the past and be forgotten; this book never will. By the way, Boo Radley is not an outdated plot device. Boo Radley is Reginald Denny. Boo Radley is Oscar Schindler. Boo Radley is the lone man who stood in front of the tank in Tianammen Square. Boo Radley is, quite simply, us. The best of us."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read To Kill A Mockingbird for the first time in the sixth grade, and I've read it many times since then.

She had a very strong-will for her age, and matured alot by the end. Her father Atticus defended a black man-Tom Robinson during this period of racial hatred(the great depression).

This book will never get old as far as the main issues it addresses: rape, racism, and social standards. Harper Lee expresses them in the best way possible - in a child's point of view. A thrilling climax will leave you excited, then saddened as you turn the last page. It is an adult book in a child's words, which makes it easy reading for any age.

Literary Critics give the wrong vibe out to readers. The Critics make their words seem as if the book is about literature and long words. Don't get me wrong, the book has excellent literature but, it's more to the book than just literature, racism and the 1930s. They all fit into the story but the author wants us to dig a little dipper and really understand why the book To Kill a Mockingbird is a love story. And I wish Harper Lee would make a document stating why is this book a love story."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I'm sorry everyone. I don't see why this book is so fabeulos.

All the book consists of is a middle-class family in the south with a few weird neighbors. I mean come on. Who really cares about a little girl that goes around the neighborhood doing things like spying on her albino neighbor. If that makes a book a classic, shame on you. Atticus against all odds is always fair and never makes anyone mad. He deals with all disputes perfectly. A wee bit too good to be true. Don't you think?

This is a book which I have found is very difficult to relate to as a 15 year old. The content, while being captivating, has no relevance to me, as the characters are either under the age of 12, or over 50. I believe that most would disagree with this opinion, but any teenager wanting to read a book about injustice should read either Bryce Courtenay's JESSICA or Adeline Yen Mah's FALLING LEAVES.

Half the book dose not appeal to the readers eye, but on the other hand the other half of the book is completely different from the first half. This is a story that may have touched the hearts of some, but for the many that don't understand it. We agree with them because it doesn't make any sence to us. Two of the only good parts are when Tom gets convicted of a crime he didn't commit and when Mr. Ewell tries to kill Jem and Scout.

The first 15 chapters were all background. That might be a little too enduring. I personally think that the author shouldn't have spent half the book on background. But if you think about it, the story wouldn't have been as long without it. It was mostly fill-in. I think that the last 15 chapters were interesting and quality writing. So were the first 14, but the last had a good plot. I just wish the ending had had a little more conflict. It seemed to end awfully abruptly. But that was just the last half of chapter 31. The book is an American classic. And this is just my opinion."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee expertly weaves the theme of hurting the innocent in and out of the first person biography of a young girl's life as delicately as a spider making sure every weave is thick and catches its prey. This ordinary child begins to learn the way of life through the hypocritical, the prejudice, the courageous, the insecure, and the hateful, violent angry actions of the people from within her own household to the center of town. With but a father and a brother to aid and answer her many question, her dive deepens to the unspoken darkened depths of all human hearts."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Review of: To Kill A Mockingbird by: Harper LeeTo Kill A mockingbird was written in 1960 and published in 1980. It is a story about a 8 year old girl name Jean Louise Finch (scout) and her family growing up and living a southern county when black people were still often not created equal in the eyes of the white people who live there. The setting is Maycomb a county in Alabama. The story is narrated by scout and is based on the adventures of her, her brother Jem (Jeremy Finch), a friend of theirs from Mississippi who visits in the summer (Dill), and the children's father Atticus Finch. Scout doesn't remember her mother who died when scout was very young. She only hears of her Jem who remembers her a lot better because he is quite a bit older than she. Jem, Scout, and Dill have a infatuation with their neighbors the Radleys who are very shut in and are rarely ever seen at all outside. The kids are drawn to the house and at times dare each other to go touch it or something. At one point they go to investigate one time at night and end up running away while Jem losses his pants and goes back and finds them mysteriously sewn up and folded on the fence. It is not till the end of the book till the long lost Boo Radley is ever seen out of the house. In the beginning it shows the difference of schools back then when scout is told she isn't allowed to read or write any more at home. This is were you first get a look at the lower class Cummingham who try to be good and the hookworm infested Ewell who is ornery and only goes to school on the first day. Through the book you see read scouts troubles with the school she doesn't like. Atticus is a lawyer who gets involved in a very sticky rape case where he is chosen to defend a black man accused by a white man in a dominantly white town. This case plays the major role in the story and how it unfolds adding some very interesting plot twists and allowing a setup for a exciting conclusion. Another important part of the story is the social structure in the town there are a couple poor families in the town. It is interesting to see the difference of how one family is poor but respectable and trusted by the town and the other is controlled by a abusive father who has many kids and can't support them with his welfare check because he uses it on alcohol. This man is an Ewell and often causes a lot of trouble for the finches and the rest of the town. The story is also effected by scouts aunt or Atticus' sister. She is very well respected in the town when she comes to live with the Finches and help Atticus with the kids. She tries to change Atticus' ways of parenting and turn Jem into a gentlemen and scout into a lady. This story is quite unique and has quite a few very exciting parts and has a the ability to keep you reading. It is also very unpredictable and often surprises you. I wasn't sure if I was going to like this book much at all at first but once I got into it I did like it and the pages seemed to go quicker than I thought and I began to like it quite a bit. I liked the unique feisty character of scout and the usually calm and collective personality of Jem like his father. I liked how the author made the Ewells (at least the Bob Ewell) mean and nasty enough to make me forget how I might feel sorry for them and their misfortune and almost despise them and make me happy when things don't go their way. The author also uses the southern scene of prejudice to the plots advantage often making me feel sorry for the blacks and rooting for them at the trial. In all of this the author also was able to fit in many of the main characters physical traits such as Atticus getting older and start to slow down and become more fragile. You see that scout get bigger and is no longer easily able to sit in the lap of her father. Jem also gets older and starts to get into a moody stage and many new physicalcharacteristics appear. The author was able to have the story as real as can be and at the same time keep all the characters always unique and interesting. You have the town gossipers, the grouches, mean nasty type, kind, witty, shady, and the respected. The list goes on. This author in my eyes not only makes the book interesting with the troubles and happiness, but presents the info in a way that you think you know someone or what will happen and you are found wrong and surprised. This book would be a enjoyable for anyone old enough to understand situations and has experience reading. The reading is fairly quick and easy to understand in my opinion. A lot of the book is fun and entertaining while other small parts can be a little bit boring once in a while. Over all I would recommend this book for people who like to read. It is a good read for all grades 7 or above and for all adults."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The book is told from the point of view of an eight-year-old child who doesn't realize much about her society. It takes us into a world where discrimination is an everyday thing, and people are helpless to stop it. It's powerful in the way that the view is unbiased; the young girl telling the story is unaffected by the racism that controls most of the adults. The book really reflects upon the problems in our own neighborhoods that we neglect all the time. It's so commonplace that only when we see the story through the eyes of someone who is still innocent that we truly realize what society has become. It's a strong book that will leave a massive impact on the way we see our world."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"You know how on the back of books it always says how great the book is? No matter how good the book really is? Well, with To Kill A Mockingbird, there's hardly room for debate over the fact that the back tells the truth. The classic is still moving and riveting after all the years. The story of how a young child stood strong true to her morals through racism, critisicm, and cruelty is, however seemingly dated some of the material may be, still a darn good read and the ultimate page-turner (and quite a tear jerker). I just couldn't put it down! A definite must read for EVERYONE!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee is a book about two children - Jem and Scout Finch.

As Ms. Maudie (an adult friend of Jem and Scout, the narrator and her brother) says, &quot;It's a sin to kill a mockingbird - they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us....&quot; In my mind, this is pretty much the recurring theme in this book - the two main plots are about a black main on trial for rape; and a reclusive neighbor of Jem and Scout who has many vicious rumours circulating about him. I think that this book is fantastic - one of the best I've ever read. It's a really moving story, with a sweet ending - you should definitely read it and see for yourself!!!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is really great. It was a class assignmentso it really wasn't my choice to read it, but once I did I always would read ahead because it's so hard to put down. I really liked the point of view it is written from, a little innocent girl that can understand things. One of the major themes that I hope you see if you decide to read this book or have read it is loneliness. It's really something to ponder about so if you missed that theme, think about it!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book was exellent! I loved how the story started off with a few sub-plotes, and brought them all together to form an extraordinary, touching story that many people can relate to. I feel this story is also great becuase of the many lessons it teaches. I won't name them though, you can read it for yourself. The characters where great. I felt each one of them were interesting and unique in their own way. They all had something happen to them that showed courage, cowardliness, curiosity, wisdom, dishonesty, loyalty, awkwardness, and tenderness. Every character would appear a certain way at the beggining of the book, and as the end of the book approached, a new view of the character would be obtained. One that was never expected."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I just re-read this book after reading it way back in high school.

This summer, I am rereading it as I tutor a student from India who will read TKAM this fall in her high school English class. What an amazing book! Seeing it through the eyes of someone for whom the idioms and cultural references are new is great. I wish it would become available for Kindle so that she could immediately look up some of the great vocabulary that Harper Lee used. While that \\"great vocabulary\\" doesn't necessarily include the \\"n word,\\" that word is necessary to embody the racism and attitudes of the times -- also an interesting concept to try to explain to a foreign student.

Many of these old books new publications have been edited in newer publications and are not the exact words as originally written by the author."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Great characters and an amazingly real setting bolster this classic tale about racial prejudice and how neighbors look after neighbors amidst prejudice and hate. Everything about this is beautiful and memorable for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird--written during the peak of the civil rights movement, when hatred and fear penetrated the hearts of those who feared change and what that change meant (equality among the races, leading to the loss of white's current position of \\"superiority\\") often leading to riots and violent attacks--came at a much needed moment in American history and is well deserving of the Pulitzer prize awarded to it.Harper Lee crafts a novel that conveys ideas of compassion, equality for all, and the injustices of racial discrimination, while not becoming too preachy. She accomplishes this by telling the story from the eyes of an innocent young girl, unaware of the racial tensions around her. In fact, the first part of the story does not deal with Tom Robinson's case or racial issues at all, rather it's about a couple of kids playing together during the summer time, absorbed in the mystery of what has become of Boo Radley. Beginning the story this way allows the reader to become emotionally involved with Scout, and her uncorrupted view of mankind, before leaping into the crux of the novel. The African Americans in To Kill a Mockingbird have been criticized as lacking dimension and I don't disagree with this, however, Scout--being an unreliable narrator and a young white girl--would not have the perspective or the familiarity with black people to give them depth, so I believe Harper Lee could not have rendered them any other way.This book is more than a novel about race; Lee explores the evil in humanity (the use of religion as a way to spew hatred, the hypocrisy of people, peoples tendency to judge others on superficial terms, the failures of the education system), yet at the same time the book is full of love, compassion, and hope. To Kill a Mockingbird is a book about growing up and the lessons that come with it, that should be read by all children coming of age."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"***This review may contain spoilers***I have read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" (hereafter TKAM) twice in my life - as a high school senior, and, oddly enough, as a Suffolk Law School student for a course in Professional Responsibility and Legal Philosophy/Ethics. In this review, I will not dwell on TKAM's predominant themes of racial prejudice and social intolerance. Instead, I will focus upon attorney Atticus Finch's character and the climactic episode which reveals that, despite appearances, he is not a saint, but all too human. The following excerpt is actually copied (with edits) from an essay I submitted for the law course:\\"Atticus Finch, the near-mythic but unsung and ultimately human attorney in TKAM, seems to possess all the conventional virtues. He is a good lawyer, citizen, and parent. Atticus assumes Tom Robinson's case certainly not from a guarantee of fortune, fame, success or charity, but to keep setting a good example as a good lawyer, citizen, and parent. He is courageous. Most importantly, whether in his house, on the public streets, or in the courtroom, Atticus is the same morally and legally admirable man. However, he is not a missionary; nor a mercenary; nor a legal idealist. Atticus is just...Atticus.Above all, Atticus is an optimistic realist. He realizes that defending Tom Robinson was in one sense a futile gesture, but takes heart in the fact that this jury took longer than previous ones (would have) to convict Tom. Atticus (believes) that the law will ultimately obtain justice, albeit slowly and incrementally.However, after Bob Ewell's murder attempt on Scout and Jem and his subsequent death, arguably Atticus betrays his legal credo. Atticus is prepared to defend Jem against the murder (of Bob Ewell) based on self-defense, and perhaps on evidence that Boo Radley killed Ewell. (However), Sheriff Heck Tate slowly dissuades Atticus from his professional objective with assurances that he can \\"prove\\" Ewell killed himself accidentally. Perhaps, understandably, Atticus relents because parental instinct, compassion, and disillusionment over the court system similar to the one Tom Robinson faced make him reluctant to subject Jem and the reclusive Boo to such a legal ordeal. Despite this arguable professional lapse,...my choice for a legal (and certainly humane) paragon would inexorably be Atticus.\\""},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" by Harper Lee, is a truly amazing book. Informative and descriptive, Harper vividly makes the characters from Maycomb, Alabama, come alive. Scout, Jem, Atticus, and Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley are memorable. Harper's powerful and entertaining story of racism during the Great Depression has the right amount of suspense, drama, humor, and Southerness to it. At first I didn't understant the title, but now I understand why it is called \\"To Kill A Mockingbird.\\" Tom Robinson symbolizes the mockingbird and Bob Ewell is the racist who kills a man so pure, so innocent, that Jem weeps at the verdict. Bob Ewell and Mayella's false accusation of Tom Robinson results in a chain reaction ending with Tom Robinson's death. But the jury is also responsible for his death. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" shows coming-of-age, innocence, and above all things love."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The only reasons I gave this two stars is I like Atticus and Boo.

Their father is a lawyer of Maycomb, Alabama, who is defending a black man who is accused of committing a crime.It turnes out that the father is really on his side though.To Kill A Mockingbird is is a piece of history that deals with racesim and childhood innocence.I would give this book a good rating."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is a good story, and importantly, told through the eyes of a young uncorrupted mind - which in itself is a literary effort not to be trifled with.However, I reduced a couple of stars for purposes of relativity ...

Most of the book relates charming, but not particularly unusual, adventures of a little girl, her older brother and a neighbor boy who comes to visit every summer. Most of these adventures are slight and unresolved. Scout brings a poor classmate home for lunch, and he shocks her by pouring molasses over all his food, whereupon the colored mail reprimands Scout for being a bad host. Scout and her brother are given BB rifles for Christmas, and while they are excited to receive them, they don't seem to do much with them. The main point to the airguns is that they give their father the opportunity to say that they shouldn't shoot mockingbirds. Scout chafes when her aunt moves in and tries to force her to wear pink dresses and be ladylike. Scout's brother loses his temper and destroys all the camellias in the yard of the ancient neighborhood scold, and his punishment is to read to the old lady every afternoon until she dies.The main plot thread concerns the recluse down the street, Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley. Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill conceive assorted methods to tease Boo out of the house, but they never succeed. At the end of the book, Boo seems to save their lives by rescuing Scout and Jem from a murderous ne'er-do-well.In the middle of the book there are a few rather sensationalistic chapters involving a rape accusation made by the ne'er-do-well and his daughter against a crippled young negro man who lives nearby. This gives Scout and Jem's father the opportunity to act noble and plead the case of this pathetic fellow in the courtroom. However, it is never clear whether there really was a rape attempt. Upon first reading it, I thought the poor-white girl's father had beaten the girl up and perhaps had sex with her, then tried to conceal it by blaming it on the crippled negro. Another reading is that the girl had lusted after the negro, and got caught embracing him. In either case, there was no need to make an accusation of rape: the girl was not pregnant; even if she had been, the child would not be mixed-race; and as the poor-white girl was socially isolated she did not stand to lose status by having been caught with the negro. The accusation of criminal assault, then, lacks coherence. Its only purpose within the structure of the narrative is to provide a reason why the ne'er-do-well would attempt to kill Scout and her brother.However, this sensationalism does add a cheap gravitas to the novel, which otherwise would be little more than a string of loosely connected episodes about growing up in the small-town South. It appears this episode was added to the book for precisely this purpose. It certainly does not reflect any real-life event in Harper Lee's own childhood. Significantly, the rape case was made central to the movie version, and most synopses of the novel emphasize this episode out of all proportion to its actual weight within the book. The episode really speaks to Northern biases about the Deep South in the 1950s, rather than tell us anything about Alabama life in the 30s."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS OF ALL TIMES MY HUSBAND CHIEF JAMES MAPLES PLAYED THE SHERIFF IN THE PLAY FOR THIRTY SOME PERFORMANCES AND I WENT TO ONE OR TWO PRACTICES AND I MUST SAY IT WAS ALL WORTH THE WHILE.

The thing is, I've read the book, and we watched the film in class, but I still don't understand it!I gave it 3 stars because I didn't understand what the author was trying to mean, with what she says. I also don't get some of the stuff they say in the book, cuz the way they speak in Alabama is weird.My favourite character in the book is Scout, cuz she's the main one and she was cute in the movie. I also like Atticus, Scout and Jem's father. Aunt Alexandra is really annoying, and I have no idea why she's even in the book.The part about the court case was interesting (but more so in the movie), and the funniest part was when Scout had to dress up in the ham costume.I would have rated this higher if I'd understood it better.

This is not an original story nor is it very deep. Atticus Finch is a good character but the story made a better vehicle for Gregory Peck than it does a serious novel.This is one of those books (like Catcher in the Rye) whose enduring popularity has always been a puzzle to me. A simple story, simply told. So what? We don't learn anything from it. And if one wants the real southern experience, stick with Faulkner or Flannery O'Conner - or even Harry Crews.

Through the eye of Scout Finch, the young narrator, Harper Lee described the situation of Maycomb and its people, especially the ones closest to Scout, her father Atticus, and brother Jem.Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white girl, is being defended by Atticus who is a lawyer. Tom Robinson symbolizes one of the mockingbirds of the story, an innocense looked down upon because of his race. Boo Radley, a metally retarded neighbor is constantly pestered by Scout and her brother because of their childish curiousity. They did not understand, however, that they were treating Boo with disrespect because of his differences.The story goes on to describe the prejudice and racism that lives on depsite the bold kindness of the protagonist, Atticus Finch. Atticus told Scout that it is inside the court &quot;All men are created equal.&quot; But outside on the street, people are not equal because of their differences. To Kill a Mockingbird symbolizes the attack on innocense because of their differences. You don't kill a mockingbird, because it does no sin."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I first read To Kill a Mockingbird for a school assignment. When I was finished I sighed in depression because I'd just finished one of the best literary pieces I'd ever read. It takes place in a sleepy southern town during the 1930's. It is told throught the eyes of a young Scout Finch living with her older brother Jem Finch, father Atticus who is a respected lawyer, and Black House Keeper and friend Calpurnia. Also popping up every summer is the bright eyed Charlse Baker Harris also known as Dill who gets the idea to try to make the Mysterious neighbor Boo Radley come out. When a local family the Ewells accuses Tom Robinson a black man of the beating and rape of a young woman Atticus is appointed to be Tom's defense.The book opens up the simpler times of America, but also the hardships it had to go through. It kept me interested every on every word. It makes you smile and find yourself nodding with the simplicity of the childhood issues and complexity the two go through. This book is an amazing achievement in the literary world, and shows of the morality and harshness the world can behold. It is a compelling novel and a view to the way people work."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is about a young girl, who is named Jean-Louise, nicknamed Scout, that grows up in a small, dilapidated town where racial prejudice and hatred are in the extreme. The setting revolves around Maycomb, a sluggish-moving town where snow seems a mere fantasy. Maycomb presents seemingly uninhabited mansions and two colliding worlds of races that create an air of suspense and integrity. Maycomb is the perfect setting where the characters get entwined into the rushing whirlpool of schemes and intrigues. Scout, her big brother Jem, and their close friend Dill, encounter the wrath of Mrs. Dubose, become mystified by the eccentricity of the Radley Place, and witness the injustice of racial discrimination. To Kill A Mockingbird provides a picture of man's inhumanity to man and the effect it has upon the innocence of mind. The main character, Scout, values frankness and openness. On the playground, she would never walk away from a fight. Scout maintains a high-spirited independence, but she represents a dynamic character. Being a young child, Scout is as gullible as a dandelion in the wind. She turns whatever way others are thinking and is easily guided. Scout radiates the image of being a tomboy from the manner of expressing herself to the overalls that she wears under her dress. Characterization is developed indirectly by characters' qualities by showing their personality and the way they carry themselves during troubles. One of my favorite characters is Boo Radley, whom all the children try to persuade to come out of his house. Boo Radley represents our darkest fears. Maycomb radiates with injustice and the sufferings of the less appreciated race. These evils tear everyone apart so that they want to hide in hopes that the problems will diminish. Boo Radley symbolizes that the Maycomb society knows about the racial injustice against Negroes, but is too afraid of change to fix their beliefs.The author's style in To Kill A Mockingbird is conversational and simple. The word choice enables you to leave the world of high literacy and reach a place where actions are not expressed in high, intricate words, but in commonplace English. Plain words give a feeling of real heart-to-heart situations while words that are sophisticated resemble an idea that is multifaceted and so complex that knowing the true meaning would be a presumption. To Kill A Mockingbird is a thoroughly woven tale without too much simplicity; a replica of the ways of life."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Please don't let the fact that this book won the Pulitzer Prize and was required reading in your high school freshman English class keep you from reading it. Not only does it encompass some universal human values of compassion and integrity, but it's a great story all to itself, and fun to read. It's told from the point of view of a little girl who likes to run around in overalls, throw batons into the air, make up plays with her brother, and crawl into her daddy's arms at the end of a long stressful day. It's a great read. Really. Try it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee wrote there a delicate and sensitive novel on the coming of age of two children in the South (Alabama) in the mid 1930s, that is to say during the Great Depression. The central issue of the book is the progressive discovery of the outside world by two - or three - young children, a girl and one or two boys. This discovery has to do with the ugliness of some people in our society, the prejudiced white people, the openly lazy white social cases who live on welfare, the miscarriage of justice against a black man who is condemned on the sole testimony of two white people by an all white male jury, the planned and failed lynching of the black man the day before his trial, etc. But it is also the discovery of the neighbors and that the people you see, or don't see, everyday are not necessarily what they seem to be, like this crippled woman who is fighting successfully her morphine addiction and conquers it just before dying, so that she can die clean. But it all centers on one neighbor that leads the life of a recluse and that fascinates the children who want to attract him outside to see him. They will eventually succeed twice, the first time totally unawares of it, and the second time just in time for him to save the life of the two children in the hands and under the knife of a white reject of society. This initiation to society goes along with the desire to make these children fit for southern gentility, for them to be a gentlemen and a lady, even if those ladies and gentlemen are not exactly pure and clean, unprejudiced and open-minded, in fact quite the reverse. But it is by integrating this society that you may make it change little by little because most of them want change but do not have the courage to advocate it, though they will support those who willl stand for a reasonable and progressive change. The book is so touching and full of feeling, that it probably is the masterpiece of a life time, and a time-enduring one.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is the story of a family in 1930's Maycomb, Alabama. The father, Atticus Finch, is a lawyer who does the best he can for his two children, Jeremy (Jem) and Jean Louise (Scout). The story is told in retrospect by Scout and spans about three years of her young life.This book has several themes and each person who reads it will come away finding their own personal meaning in the story.For me it is the poignancy with which the author shows us how Scout watches Atticus, her nanny Calpurnia, and the other people around her to learn what is -Grace, compassion, courage, decency, tolerance, forgiveness, dignity, honor, and ultimately love.I think Harper Lee was right when she said she always considered her book to be a simple love story."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I am currently reading To Kill a Mockingbird in my 8th grade English class.

At first, I thought it would be like most books we're expected to read in high school...boring, old tomes, etc. But I got so into the book, and I absolutely fell in love with it during the first chapter. It is a classic novel that takes us through four years when Jem and Scout, the main characters and the children in the book go from Innocence to Experience. They grow up in the book, and I think that everybody should read it. I'm still reading it in school, and watching the movie, and I love it so much, now I'm here, buying it. So, read this book. It's wonderful."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee has conquered the hearts of millions of young readers around the world. Touching controversial issues such as racism in a so-called democratic society this novel has become one piece that many people regardless of age group, can relate to. To Kill A Mockingbird deals with the theme of racism in a prejudice society. The novels' main conflict is trial against a black man for allegedly raping Mayella Ewell, s lonely white girl from the suburbs of Maycomb. The dilemma of the book is to prove whether or not a fair trial can take place in the South. The novel is narrated through the eyes of Scout, a seven year old tomboy who is unknown to the prejudice society she is part of. Her father, Atticus Finch is a well-respected lawyer. Aside, from the theme of prejudice, in this highly acclaimed novel, the author creates a mysterious character that is the center of distraction for the vast majority of Maycomb citizens; Boo Radley. Both Scout and her brother Jem become fascinated about this mysterious person and refuse to give up until they discover his true identity, and because of this they end up getting into a series of problems. Regardless of age groups, this novel touches people in a personal level that anyone can feel reflected on. At some points of the novel the reading is so intense that it truly is necessary to put the book down. As a 16 year old reader I would recommend this book because it truly is an extremely influential novel touching on themes that even today are hard to touch on."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's novel is undoubtedly my favorite book of all time. I don't know one single person who has not liked it. I have read it about three times and I feel like Scout, Jem, Atticus, Dill, and even Boo Radley, the mysterious loner of the story, are people I have known and loved always. This book is certainly one of the best American novels ever written, and certainly the greatest American book of the twentieth century. Not reading this book is a tragedy. The character development and the emotional current of the book will penetrate your heart and mark you forever. I know you will never, ever forget the powerful message of the book if you allow yourself to be attached to what, in my opinion, are the most well-developed, strong collection of souls in an incredibly touching story that takes place in the American South. Read it, fall in love with it, read it again, and fall in love even more.

This book brings to surface, the idea of how unfair and cruel we as a society can be, and how this racism and bigotry can affect so many, in ways we cannot imagine.

Flying through it in order to get a 10th grade English paper done, I missed alot. A few summers later I was unemployed and found myself reading it again out of boredom. That boredom didn't last. In the years since I have reread the story three or four times; once even staying up all night to do it. The power of the story lies in the words for me. The simple descriptions of complicated actions from the perspective of a small girl have incredible power. The final line of the novel regarding the fact that Atticus would be there when Jem &quot;waked in the morning&quot; exemplifies this by simply showing the love this man has for his son with out relying on overt emotionalism. In its' simplicity it avoids sensationalism and therfor comes across stronger and clearer. Yet in my rereadings, I have always found a new level of understanding for the words and actions, growing to love the novel more each time. I even dated someone whose nickname was Boo Radley. My only regret is that as I searched for more work by Ms Lee, I was told by a bookstore owner that she opted not to write on this level again.

It had a tremendous impact on me. I was terrified of the tree where Scout &amp; Jem received their gifts. I was terrified of the house where Boo lived. I was afraid of the useless arm of Tom Robinson and the mean, drunken father of May Ella. I had led a very sheltered life in a small town.When I was old enough, I read the book. I am firmly convinced that through Miss Lee's accounting (coupled with my belief in God and Christ who died for all), I was able to look at others with unprejudiced eyes. I learned that people can be good or bad no matter what their station in life, no matter what color, or no matter what financial or physical level. Tom Robinson was a good man even though he was in a minority race, was poor, and was handicapped. I learned to be kind to others not as fortunate as myself. I see a lot of Scout in myself. I looked upon everyone as my equal and often put my foot in my mouth just as she did with the Jimson (Was that the name? - It escapes me) boy. I also learned to try not to be afraid of that with which I was not familiar.My sons are growing up now. I had them to watch the movie when they were younger. Now, I am encouraging them to read the book. My son was to read it his sophomore year at high school. He read the Cliffs Notes! He just doesn't have time or the love to read books. He did love the movie though, and has watched it again. I am trying to instill them with unprejudiced eyes. So far, so good."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"...well, not really.

You'll never read about another lawyer like Atticus Finch, that's for sure.TKAM is foisted on high schoolers for a good reason: It's great and every American should read it at some point. But it's a book that every American should read outside the classroom, too."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is definitely one of my all time favorite books. It teaches everyone a great lesson about being prejudice to other people of a different race. It shows that even kids like Scout and Jem are aware of these issues and can be bigger people about the issue than some adults. They also face other hardships in their life other than prejudice. Scout is always being pressured into being lady like and not to play with the boys and what they do. That is not what Scout is like though, she likes she be with her brother and his friend and do what he wants do to. She doesn't like to be with other girls have tea parties. She is one very unique girl. I can relate to her in this way, because nobody wants to be girly all the time. Sometimes you have to be different from other people. Nobody wants to sit up straight all the time and be nice and pretty. Being different isn't bad all the time. Both Jem and Scout have to deal with having no mother and living with only their father and their caretaker. They are very different characters but that is what makes them so interesting. This book has a clear lesson, that we should treat every person with the same amount of respect. We shouldn't treat people of a different race differently. They are the same on the inside as everybody else. I think if you're looking for a good book to read this would be the one to choose."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I enjoyed reading To Kill A Mockingbird. Not only was this novel immediately interesting, but it taught important lessons about life. One of those lessons, was overcoming racism. Throughout the novel Tom Robinson is the obvious example of racism, but less obvious, is the treatmeant of Boo Radley. Boo is not treated poorly because of his skin color, but because he is considered an &quot;outkast&quot;. Throughout the novel Scout has to learn to recognize racism, and to realize that society's views of people are not always correct. A quote that shows Scout being taught this is found in Chapter 3 on page 33, when Atticus states &quot;You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.&quot;Another major roll in this novel was the developing innocence of the children. Throughout the novel we are viewing Scout's morals developing into a more &quot;grown-up&quot; point of view. At first, Scout plays games with her brother Jem and neighbor Dill, mocking the Radleys. However, as the novel progresses, she starts to think of Boo Radley as a human being, instead of a form of entertainment.Another roll in this novel was played by scoical standings. The importance of social standings constantlt understand the ignorance of the townspeople. I believe that the quote said by Atticus in Chapter 10 page 109, &quot;Remember, it's a sin to kill a mockingbird,&quot; shows that Atticus wants his children to understand that people should be given their privacy, and not discussed throughout the town because of their short comings.Other than the lessons in this book, another great aspect of it is the setting. The town is introduced in Chapter 1 on page 2, as &quot;An old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it.&quot; I believe that this quote was the perfect way to describe Maycomb. It shows that at first, the town is innocent, like Scout, but also foreshadows that the town, and Scout will develope into a more comlex exisctence. Anoher important part of this book was the characters. The characters were well developed and were very complex. I felt like the Finches were a real life family, one that I could truly understand, and one that over the course of the novel I actually grew to care about.If you enjoyed reading To Kill A Mockingbird, then I would recommend the book I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, by Maya Angelou. The plot about racism is similar and the styles of writing are equally intriguing."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I'm currently in Middle shool and for one of my school's literary projects I was assighned to read To Kill a Mockingbird and let me just say I loved it. I could read the book, a chaper, a page even and find new meaning in it every time. It's like a window into the past."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is a story about two juveniles that face trouble that is at work all around the U.S. racism. Jem and Scout Finch are in a position where their farther must defend an African American by the name of Tom Robinson. Tom had been accused of raping a white girl. As Harper Lee expresses the strong prejudice in the 1930's.The story takes place in the southern part of the U.S.A. in a county called Maycomb. There Jem and Scout and their friend, Dill, play. Though Dill only stays for the summer with a lady named Miss Rachael. Miss Rachael along with Miss Maudie, Miss Stephanie Crawford, and others of wisdom all live in the oldest neighborhood in Maycomb . Lee describes the wisdom of the neighbor. \\"Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood ain't it? Been Here Longer than the town\\"(Lee 103).The Finch family has been put under a lot of pressure over Atticus's job defending Tom in court. The family even seems to turn on them. Though Scout acts in the wrong way towards this pressure. \\"Francis [Scout's cousin] looked at me carefully, concluded that I had been sufficiently subdued, and crooned softly, \\"Nigger-lover...\\" This time I had split my knuckle to the bone on his front teeth\\" (Lee 96). Lee describes Scout punishing her cousin for calling her farther names.The most peculiar part of this book is the way Jem, Dill, and, Scout treat there neighbor, Mr. Arthur Radley as if he is a scary and crazy man. They later found out he was quit fond of them and watched and helped them more than they knew he had. He wasn't evil just shy. \\"Mister Arthur, bend your arm down here, like that. That's right, sir.\\" I slipped my hand into the crook of his arm. He had to stoop a little to accommodate me, but if Miss Stephanie was watching from her upstairs window, she would see Arthur Radley escorting me down the sidewalk as any gentleman would do\\"(Lee 320).I highly recommend this book to all readers. There are several lessons in this book that will help you in life. I also am impressed by how the narrator is a young girl instead of a middle-aged person. That is just the coolest way to write, through the child's eyes. So please, do read this book you wont regret it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mocking Bird is my favourite book. I think that it deserves 6 stars!When Jem and Scout Finch find a small boy hidden in the cabbage patch, named Dill, they make good friends with him. But, Dill leads them into trouble, and as his thirst for knowledge increases, he leads Jem and Scout into danger.But this is not the only danger the children should have to encounter. Powered by rage, when Atticus Finch, Jem and Scout's father, accepts to laywer a black man, a drunken fool flys into a rage and attacks the childrenThis book almost made me cry when I read it, but it made me laugh, too. It will always be one of my all time favourites, so if you're thinking of buying a book, this is my top reccomendation."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is a review of the movie version of this book which, except for a little confusion about who killed whom at the end (Boo or not), is fairly faithful to the spirit of the book. The main points apply here as well.This film is an excellent black and white adaptation of Harper Lee's book of the same name. The acting, particularly by Gregory Peck (and a cameo by a young Robert Duval as Boo Radley), brings out all the pathos, bathos and grit of small town Southern life in the 1930's. The story itself is an unusual combination, narrated by Peck's film daughter (and presumably Lee herself), of a stage of the coming of age story that we are fairly familiar with and the question of race and sex in the Deep South (and not only there) with which we were (at the time of the film's debut in 1962) only vaguely familiar. That dramatic tension, muted as it was by the cinematic and social conventions of the time, nevertheless made a strong statement about the underlying tensions of this society at a time when the Southern black civil rights struggle movement was coming in focus in the national consciousness.The name Atticus Finch (Peck's role) as the liberal (for that southern locale) lawyer committed to the rule of law had a certain currency in the 1960's as a symbol for those southern whites who saw that Jim Crow had to go. Here Finch is the appointed lawyer for a black man accused of raping a white women of low origin- the classic \`white trash' depicted in many a film and novel. Finch earnestly, no, passionately in his understated manner, attempts to defend this man, a brave act in itself under the circumstances.Needless to say an all white jury of that black man's \`peers' nevertheless convicts him out of hand. In the end the black man tries to escape and is killed in the process. In an earlier scenario Finch is pressed into guard duty at the jailhouse in order to head off a posse of \`white trash' elements who are bend on doing \`justice' their way- hanging him from a lynching tree. On a mere false accusation of a white woman this black man is doomed whichever way he turns. Sound familiar?The other part of the story concerns the reactions by Finch's motherless son and tomboyish daughter to the realities of social life, Southern style. That part is in some ways, particularly when the children watch the trial from the \\"Negro\\" balcony section of the courtroom, the least successful of the film. What is entirely believable and gives some relief from the travesty that is unfolding are the pranks, pitfalls and antics of the kids. The tensions between brother and sister, the protective role of the older brother, the attempt by the sister to assert her own identity, the sense of adventure and mystery of what lies beyond the immediate household that is the hallmark of youth all get a work out here. But in the end it is the quiet dignity of solid old Atticus and the bewildered dignity of a doomed black man that hold this whole thing together. Bravo Peck. Kudos to Harper Lee."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book several years ago and lost my copy along the way.

My thanks to both women!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is the story about a little girl (Scout) whose father is defending a black man against a rape charge from a white man and his daughter. It shows what it might be like for a 1st or 2nd grade girl to put up with prejudice from everyone. Such as when one of her classmates calls Scouts father a negreo lover, or when her neighbor, Mrs. Dubose, calls out racial comments about her dad defending a black man every time Scout walks by her house.I think this book was good but did not live up to reputation. Many people have read it and most of them say its like the best book ever. I didn't think so. The literature was good and it had great character development but it wasn't the most intriguing. I think the parts with Dill and Jem trying to make Boo Radley come out were pretty boring and they should have had cool and scary things happen after every attempt to make him come out instead of just at the end when Jem looses his pants and the shot gun is fired."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird was a reading assignement for my grandson's 9th grade English class. We listened to the audio book together then were able to discuss the story together. It was such an enjoyable way to experience this wonderful book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"After looking at many of the reviews for this book (not nearly all 1600+ however!) I hesitated to write because I mostly agree with many of the characterizations and high praise for \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" and praise for Harper Lee. I had to think about what I could possibly add to the mix - and I hope this review isn't too repetitious.I just finished re-reading the novel a few days ago (after nearly 40 years!) and am still feeling an emotionally charged afterglow. It is a combination of warm regard for the characters and a somewhat homesick yearning to return to the roots of the book - Maycomb, AL, and know the people better.As I thought about what might be affecting me so strongly it occurred to me that Harper Lee, I think, may have written a novel with character archetypes so strong and compelling that a person is wrapped up in it as if the story is their own. And not only that. Although the book has a great plot, story line, drama, suspense, mystery, social conscience, etc. It is really only about one thing. Love. It is written with love and it illustrates love in a world where those illustrations are like oases in a hot, dry desert.The character of Atticus Finch, for example, is an exemplary model of a loving father, neighbor, friend and shows this quality not only in the way he treats others, but even in the way he thinks about others. Yet, he also exhibits unquestionable strength and courage.I take away from this novel (and hope others will too) a model of behavior that I would like to emulate - or at least to aspire to.So, if you have a chance, drink this refreshing story and quench that thirst for knowledge of what it means to love. It is here."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is an exceptional story, one of the highest quality and Sissy Spacek was the perfect choice to narrate. I recommend this book to young and old alike, but would not recommend it for young children."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is an ugly example of injustice where a black man in a segregated Alabama is falsely accused of attacking a white woman. While the racial divide was a profound theme in the novel, the dedication of the lawyer was memorable and has set the mark for many looking for their Addicus Finch when faced with a legal dilemma. Harper Lee, like her good friend Capote, is a provocative author rendering the organic sides of human nature both in tragedy and justice. It is no wonder really why this book has been around for over thirty years. Still today the readers of tomorrow would find it a compelling book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"One of thee best, no explaination needed, this is a good gift for anyone or for a young adult of about 12+"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Unlike many others, I was not introduced to this book through my high school required reading curriculum. This book came highly recommended by a friend of mine, and looking down my Goodreads friends list, everyone has rated it 5 stars. And now I know why.At first, I wasn't enjoying it. I found it hard to get into. I couldn't relate to the culture (temporally or geographically), and was having a bit of difficulty translating the \\"Southern\\" dialect. But, I soon overcame those obstacles, and then I couldn't put it down.This entire story is told through the eyes of a child, and I think that's part of what makes it so captivating. This is a child who is raised by a single father and an older brother, and she begins the story in innocence, climbing trees and playing in the mud and catching bugs. Over the course of about a year, she starts school, and her father (a lawyer) takes a case to defend a black man who is falsely accused of raping a white woman. The other white people in her little town, even though they are \\"reasonable folks,\\" do not approve, and she and her family are subjected to the insults, alienation, and threats that accompany racism.Sometimes, we don't realize how ridiculous something truly is until we see it through innocent eyes. The children witness the entire case from start to finish, and are traumatized by the behavior of the people around them. These are people they have known all of their lives -- why are they suddenly losing their minds over skin color?One of the most moving parts of the story, to me, is when the little girl's teacher is talking about Hitler's persecution of the Jews... and she readily makes the connection to the white people's persecution of the black people. It is in moments like these that children are forced to grow up and see the world for what it is.Even though this story is rather bittersweet, it is beautifully told. It is a story of class warfare, social injustice, and being called upon to do the right thing, even when it seems like the whole world is against you."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I absolutely love this classic book. I believe it is one that everyone should read at least a dozen times! I read it first in high school and it didn't occur to me then how truly amazing this story is. Scout is fun and so easy to love! If was a child in their town during this time, I would have wanted to be her best friend!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is used symbolically at two times in the book. The first time we find out \\"it is a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\" This is part of the culture that existed in this small, depression era southern town. Many people lived by truisms, many of which were not good. The second time it is used, it is too close to the end to mention.Atticus, the town lawyer, is understanding to the truisms, but lives by his own code, one that is far more honorable than we can imagine. The story is told in first person by Scout, the daughter of Atticus. Like the popular movie, \\"Christmas Story\\" the narration, although done by a child, it is not child-like.We grow up together with Scout and her older brother Jem over a period of three years. We get to know their neighbors. While the characters are memorable, they are nowhere near the quirky level of modern day characters. Except, for Atticus, the characters are very realistic. Atticus is exceeding patient and understanding. At one point he tells his children it is wrong to \\"hate Hitler.\\" He accepts people as they are with all their faults, even those who threaten him. Gandhi could have taken lessons from him.While the book centers around Scout and Jem, it runs with a semi-subplot as two life events occupy their young lives. The first is their fascination with a shut-in neighbor, Boo Radley. They take to wild speculation about him and have a desire just to see the legendary man. The second event is the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of rape by a white woman. Atticus defends him to the dismay and even hatred of many of the town folks.Race relations is part of the story. Much of the hard hitting aspects of the injustices are overshadowed by the rest of the story. There is frequent \\"N\\" word use that is both derogatory and non- derogatory , as it was in that era.The book has its message as it compares Hitler to America, when it states: \\"Over here we don't believe in persecuting anybody. Persecution comes from people who are prejudice.\\" While clearly the book has a race relations theme, I couldn't help by think about the current class warfare being waged when I hear Scout define democracy in her father's words: \\"Equal rights for all. Special privileges for none.\\"In some ways it was a prequel to \\"The Help,\\" but not hardly the tear-jerker. An easy read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Having seen the incredible film To Kill a Mocking Bird twice, it appeared as if there could be nothing more that can be derived from the book. But reading the book is a reminder that films may not do full justice to a book. There are many examples; for instance, The Motorcycle Diaries, which show how a book is adapted partly to fit a 300 page book in 2 hours, and partly to get the maximum approval from cinemagoers. This is no way devalues the film, but it reminds us that there may be much more in the book that may not reach cinemagoers.The main story in the book is well known but not being aware of American names, it was interesting to learn that the author is female. But beyond that minor point, the book is not very long compared to modern fiction where authors seem to be competing to make a book as long as possible), but very precisely written, and is very captivating. The language used in the book reminds a British reader in particular of the geographical and time context of the story. Each scene is beautifully described and the pictures remain in the reader's mind for a long time.It is not simple tale of a white lawyer trying to apply justice to a black defendant wrongly accused of a crime. Justifications of the treatment of black people by the white community is accompanied by the questions many whites were asking about the treatment of blacks. At the same time, the humane behaviour of black people is very astutely portrayed.There are many other aspects of life that come out very clearly in the book : sibling relationships, friendship, the innocence of youth and many others. Anyone who has not read the book has missed out on a great deal. Anyone who reads the book will find it leaves a very strong lasting impression on them"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is a must for all people who love books and the power of the imagination.

Rather than having a distinct story-line it's a portrait of all sorts of characters some more important than others.The main characters are Scout - a smart nine-year-old girl - and Jem her intelligent and courageous twelve-year-old brother. The lawyer Atticus is their father. They live in a house together with Calpurnia the perfect nanny and she's like a mother for the two children (Their own mother died several years ago ).Tom, a young black man, has to stand trial for assault on a white girl. The court has appointed Atticus to defend the accused. It will have rather severe consequences.The title of my review - The things that happen to people we never know - is from a conversation between Scout and a neighbor. We will fully understand the others, says Atticus, when we put ourselves in the shoes of the others. He says this because as a lawyer he wants to understand the reason why some people commit a crime.There is another important character though we met him only a few times. His name is Boo Radley who lives like a recluse in his own house. He's the most mysterious person I ever met in a work of fictionThe novel has a rather tragic and peculiar ending.One of the best-loved classics of all time \\"To Kill A Mocking Bird\\" has earned many distinctions since his first publication in 1960.

The ideas presented are therefore mostly 'hidden', and so noticing their presence is a task in itself. I had to read it about three or four times (how many I cannot exactly remember) before realising that I had been absorbing so much (how much is for me to know and you to read and find out).Like many other reviewers of this book, I first read it in school, so I thought, if the education people placed it on reading lists it must be a good book, either in content or presentation. This one, as I found, was good at both. If one ignores what I wrote above about a difficult read, he/she would understand why Scout is the protagonist. Lee's use of her (Scout's) innocence (and that of Jem and Dill) was highly appropriate, they were yet to be affected by the ugly side of life (or as I like to put it, still existing in the realm of 'It's a small world after all'). As they grow up and undergo certain experiences (if I told which I would spoil your read) they start to realise the prejudice and discrimination that exists in this world. There is more on hypocrism, education, and human nature but I don't think it is appropriate to turn this review into a novel, so I shall stop here.Some general knowledge of certain things may help in the enjoyment of this book. It would also be interesting to do some research into some names and motifs in the book (like I had to for school) as this would reveal some interesting reasons why Lee chose them. Knowing these reasons would add to one's comprehension of this book.Definitely worth re-reading and re-re-reading."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Well, this book is so fascinating, I love it.

Such experiences would ofcourse be congruous to that person's capabilities but creativity during such time be it expressed in a book, a painting or even a poem, soars heights of genius which are beyond ordinary human limitations. In my opinion, Harper Lee's novel \\"To Kill A Mocking Bird\\" is a product of such divine creativity. It's very genius in style, setting and plot make it an isolated achievement on the part of the Author who has not been able match this with any of her other works . The kaleidoscope of characters offered by the novel, set in a remote southern town of Maycomb County, holds the reader spellbound, while he marvels at the style with which the author prevents the sombre theme from clouding the general mood of the story. The lighthearted adventures of Jem and Scout have left such vivid impressions on my mind that I almost get the feeling of having been in Maycomb as the novel progresses.

Somehow I had avoided reading it until it was highly recommended by my book club.Once I started I couldn't put it down. I finished in about a week. The style is similar to Huck Finn, but with a female protagonist.Scout is growing up in the South, when blacks aren't really slaves anymore but are still segregated. Some people, like her father, consider blacks as human and equal. Others still view them as separate and unequal.Since Scout's mother died, her father allows her to figure out life in her own way--traipsing around in overalls, instead of dresses, with her brother Jem. Aunt Alexandra wants to teach Scout to be a lady, but to do so goes against Scout's dad's philosophy of life.In some ways, Harper Lee expresses some rather forward thinking. However some parents may not want their children reading about rape, though I think it was dealt with tactfully."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Deep in the heart of Alabama in 1935, a white man's word stood against a black man's word. It's not hard to see that this unwritten rule, a byproduct of segregation, opens the door for any ignorant psychopath to take advantage of those who cannot defend themselves. Indeed, a whole underclass of white trash made use of this situation in one way of another. It is a bit ironic that in 1935 the Supreme Court building opened with the inscription in stone of \\"Equal Justice under Law\\". At least, a strong current of idealism was being kept alive, and was not totally lost in the law so that it could not be reclaimed. A few people in a place like Monroeville, Alabama, had the courage to resist convention. But the status quo was so fiercely upheld, and emotions of a drunken mob so hard to control.As other reviewers have pointed out, the strength of this book comes from the point of view of a child, the narrator, who doesn't have an established adult position to defend, and has a father who instills in her a sense of equal justice. She and her brother try and come to terms with their world. In the course of their education -thanks to what they learn more at home than at school - they meet many quirky characters in the town, and learn about some of their secrets and their unexpected courage and good will.It is clear that this novel closely parallels Harper Lee's actual childhood in a number of ways. For one thing, she was a close friend of Truman Capote, who is the model of Dill Harris. Together they attended legal proceedings at the county courthouse where her father as a lawyer apparently had a very similar role as Atticus Finch in the book. Truman Capote also verified that some of the events actually happened."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this in high school and loved this book; however, I bought this for my wife because of the quality of the binding and the rough style cuts of the page. While those are minor details to the book itself, it is a book that is amazing and continues to be enjoyable to read year after year! I'll look forward to reading it with my kids when they are old enough to appreciate it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I wanted to re-read on this the 50th anniversary of Harper Lee's best seller. It is amazing to consider the context of the book and what was happening in our country at that very time."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is an amazing novel. It's set in Maycomb County, Alabama, and is the story of Jean Louise \\"Scout\\", who is seven years old at the beginning of the story. Her brother Jem is a few years older than her and her father Atticus is a lawyer. To Kill a Mockingbird is the story of Scout's adventures, also of a pivotal trial between Tom Robinson, a black man, and the Ewells, a \\"white trash\\" family. Atticus is defending Tom Robinson, causing much controversy, and much taunting for his children. Also that year, Jem and Scout begin a long fascination with the mysterious Boo Radley, who is supposedly crazy, and is shut up in the house.To Kill a Mockingbird is definitely one of my favorite novels. The subject matter is really gripping and I love the writing. Scout narrates in an amazing voice; very compelling. Much like Margaret Mitchell, Harper Lee is a Southern writer, and only wrote one novel (though she is still alive). I wish she wrote more.One of my favorite sequences is probably the trial. Atticus is so brilliant; he builds up a big case for Tom Robinson, and yet racial prejudice prevails, despite the fact that there was no concrete evidence that Tom committed the crime. It's really sad, but one of the most riveting parts of the novel. Even if, like me, you knew what was going to happen, you still couldn't put the book down. And for Scout and particularly Jem, who are so sure that Tom will be acquitted, it's a huge blow.I love the characters as well; Scout is inquisitive and fearless, and I like Atticus a lot too. To Kill a Mockingbird is an amazing American classic, and I would highly recommend it. I love everything about this novel, from the setting, to the subject matter, to the characters, to the writing.My blog is located at novareviews.blogspot.com.

It's a good gift for someone who has already read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and loved it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"My opinion on this book is really good. To me this book has alot of meaning with the racial actions, and the rude comments some of the characters in this book make. For an example when Bob Ewell says that atticus is a black person lover. It is like a real life story how it was in th old days. It shows how people stick together like Jem and Scout. Like when Scout always would try to kind of take care of Jem always wanted him to do safe things without the risk of getting cought in a bad stunt he tried to pull. Now if it was up to me I would want Harper Lee to write another book because she has a great imagination and creativity. That is my review on the fantastic book called To Kill A Mockingbird"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The story takes place in the south of the United States, before civil rights were the same regardless of the color of people's skin. This society is examined through the eyes of a young girl whose father is a lawyer who defends a black man who has been accused of rape. Deep thoughts, slow plot. Maybe the movie has more action."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"i had to read this book in class and i thought it was really good book exceptt he authour in my opinion put in a lot of unneccasry detail that didnt really add to the story, however it had a really good plot and there were many parts that had a lot of suspense and i just couldnt help reading ahead of everyone in my class!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"For a book like this to have been written when it was, about and in the place it was, by a person of that timew and place, is nothing less than courageous. Harper Lee's beautiful story of redemption, love and humanity pre-cursors the works of Martin Luther King, and can be called one of the early, great influences that inspired the long-denied civil rights of African-Americans. Fantastic. As a writer, I am in awe of this kind of work, and acknowledge that I can read it, I can admire it, but I can never duplicate it.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;STWRITES@AOL.COM"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In this book to kill a mockingbird by Harper Lee is a very good book. It is very good literature that all students should read. It symbolizes racism and to kill a mockingbird is a sin. A mockingbird is a bird that does nothing wrong. It sings nice songs to people to enjoy. It doesnt eat your garden or anything bad it is just a bird that is for your enjoyment.In this book Tom Robinson is a black man who is accused of raping a nineteen year old girl Mayella Ewell. This book is told by Jean Louise Finch A.K.A Scout. Her brother Jem and friend Dill run around together in the summer and try to get Boo Radley out of his house. Atticus is her dad and he is defending Tom Robinson.There are two parts of this book. In the first part the auther explains the different characters, what they do and how they act. It gives you some backgroung about the boo kand it helped me a lot. I like how she did it because when the book started getting good i could follow along very easily. This book doesnt start getting good until the end but it is like when you read it you keep wanting to so you can find out what happens next.I think this book is very good because it tells you a lot and the auther did a good job writing it. It was easy to follow along so it was more fun to read. I would recommend it to any buddy to read but more for the people that like history because it takes place in the 30's and it tells you what is going on then. I think it is a very good book.(But the movie isnt very good.)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This beautiful story has it all if you love GOODNESS, TRUTH AND BEAUTY. I will not repeat what has been said here hundreds of times but only offer my humble opinion on one thing.Atticus cared more about TRUTH and JUSTICE than he did about the opinions of neighbors and the world. If you would like to read a non-fiction that could have been written by Atticus, please consider HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD. It was written by a lawyer who, like Atticus, cares more about Truth than money and popularity."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is powerful and compelling...Lee's story is classical fiction at its best...very powerful message..My only gripe is u can tell the ending about 40 pages before you actually read it and u know the fate of the trial probably before u read the book.If u havent read this book i highly suggest it...and if ur still in school i would suggest reading it for fun before u have to do assignments on it and it ruins it for u."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I see that this book hasn't been rated since 2002, man I hope someone will read this rating. I thought the book to be interesting and thoughful. Maybe I missed something in the reading but It wasn't as grand as it was hyped up to be it was just an okay book. The movie version was better."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee published a book about racism seen from a child\`s view.The story takes place in a southern state of the USA in the 1930's.The novel is about a man called Atticus Finch, a lawyer, who lives in a small town and who is considered to be well off.He lives there with his daughter called Scout, his son Jem and their cook Calpurnia, who is black.Atticus doesn't see any place for prejudice of any kind.He is called to defend the black man Tom Robinson who is accused of raping a white girl.He knew this case would be difficult to win and could totally change his life.The story seems to focus on the representation of the mockingbird as a symbol of innocence.Atticus was portrayed as a man who thought compassion and honesty to his children.He brings himself and his children into a dangerous situation by defending a black man, but he is convinced that it is very important to show the residents of Maycomb that Tom is innocent and that they are stupid not to believe him.To my mind This novel is really worth reading because this theme is present everyime."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I originally read this book in high school and picked it up again about a decade later. It's as good today as it was the first time, and I'm sure this holds true for the date it was published. Well done Harper Lee."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"A reading experience for any age groupA classic to be reread and rereadThis book is brilliantly written. It is a classic read not just because of the storyline but the excellent writing, the wonderful readability. Lee gives so much social background and so much personal background by weaving it deftly into the plot. There is never that sense of blah-blah-blah pages that often annoy in current narratives (that strike me as author's notes that force the characterisation on the reader rather than it being gained by osmosis).This is an encompassing experience : such a vivid portrait of the times, of childhood, of growing up, of bigotry ... of so many, many things. It is a slow, warm, endearingly evocative insight into the world of the Scout, Jem and Atticus. I was sad to leave them at the end!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This beautiful story is ultimately about looking beneath the surface, past skin color and differences in socioeconomic status or station to what defines goodness and what defines evil. Casting aside the shallow boundaries dictated by time and place, Atticus Finch unknowingly passes onto his children a thirst for the truth. Atticus, so needlessly worried about not being enough of a parent since their mother died and providing what Jem and Scout need most, instills in them a boundless curiosity for life and all its inhabitants.Told from the perspective of Scout an extremely astute and precocious child of 6, her daily adventures along with her brother and their close friend, Dill are interwoven into the story of a pivotal court case. Atticus is assigned to defend a black man falsely accused of beating and raping a white woman. The responsibility of upholding the law and offering this man a fair trial along with substantial evidence to indict becomes a monumental challenge as the citizens of a Southern Alabama town in the 1930's are emotionally forced to put aside their masks and reveal their true selves. Just about every human archetype is represented and all are disseminated by Scout who learns the most valued of life's lessons and comes to realize just how remarkable a man her father truly is. What Scout has not yet fully realized is that she is every bit as remarkable and is truly Atticus's daughter.The Mockingbird reference is poetically tied to one of the story's main characters however could easily be applicable to several of them. Scout as well as Jem and Dill exist as strong voices of reason unaffected by social mores and society's expectations. We see this especially in Scout who with childlike innocence and an intelligence that belies her years elicits a call so strong that whether rising to the occasion or falling deeper into a hole, not one can fail to react.Simply told, this is the story that defined winning a case by a belief and the willingness to stand up for what is right, no matter the cost. To Kill A Mockingbird is an unrivaled literary masterpiece."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I think this may be the best book of the 20th century, at least written in the English language. I know many will disagree, but how can you not put it in the top 10? My good friend Perry, who passed away last year, used to tell me to read Mockingbird every 10 years or so. As we age there is something new between those same old pages. He was right. Read it as a child in school, again in your twenties, then your thirties, and on. Lee tells an adult story through the eyes of a child and with every passing decade the story deepens."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"\\"I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.\\"A society in which courage is still identified with a man/woman with a weapon in hand, above thought by Atticus/ Lee is a definite way, not a fragile hope for peace. The book not only touches upon the problem of racism Americnas were dealing with at that point of time, but also touches upon the fundamental values of a man. And that is why i feel the book has been acclaimed globally.The book is as much about how a society should acknowledge existence and dignity of all its people as much it is about probing what are fundamental human values a person should pursue. The values of Atticus are so fundamental for humans that the book would continue to exist on the shelves of book stores (online or otherwise) because the values would continue to exist. Well, i do not want to insinuate French revolution here, but the simple words which can be chosen for the values the book brings forth are: freedom, justice, equality, fraternity, and compassion.Thanks and regards,PravinOnce upon a time in the land of Jasmine Revolution and some short stories"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I get asked all the time which book is my favorite of all. When you've read as many books as I have, that should be a hard question to answer. But, it isn't. Because no book even comes close to this one. This one is my favorite, each and every time I read it. And, every time I read it I see some new gem that sparkles like a literary diamond.The story is set in 1930's Alabama and the setting and characters are portrayed with razor-sharp clarity. It doesn't depict the South; it is Southernness. The story centers around a young girl named Scout, her brother Jem and their father Atticus (whom I am madly in love with). Atticus is the town's defense attorney and has been tasked with defending a black man accused of raping a local white girl. Atticus is bound to do his duty he does it the best he can, certain the young black father is innocent.This book shows the very worst and best of every human emotion-love, hate, ignorance, oppression, bigotry, hope, despair-all without apology. After the roller coaster emotional ride, it finally leaves the reader feeling like a bandage was just ripped from the heart.Read it again and again. And, just when you think it has no more lessons to teach you; read it one more time."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"After over 2000 other reviews there is probably little new that I can add, except to say this book is one of the great thought experiments of modern American fiction. The entire process is set to show the barbarity of the Jim Crow system, and it succeeds. All students in school should be made to read it.The writing of the novel is brought into further relief by the acting of Gregory Peck in the movie of the same title.The reason for the four star rating instead of five is the characters of Aunt Alexandra and Miss Maudie. To me they blend together too much. But the book does bring out varied levels of the human condition. I first read the book in the eighth grade. I now teach it to freshmen in high school. A great piece of fiction."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I'll never forget reading this 6 years ago- mostly because I remember reading it in the hospital waiting room and cafeteria while my granny was on her death bed. Summer had gone great that year, but then all of a sudden, out of the blue, my granny fell ill with Patriotic Cancer and was dead less than a week later- it shocked us all but mostly, it shocked me. She had been one of my best friends. Anyway, I had had no idea that we were supposed to read this for our summer reading- my Mom just happened to look on the school website and then thrusted the book into my hands with the words : \\"Your summer's up. Start reading. Now.\\" - in a sense, not those exact words.I remember looking at the cover (not this same exact cover, but the one w/the picture of Scout) and reading the title and reading the back cover and thinking, \\"I am NOT going to be reading this. I refuse. I dont care about how you can kill a Mockingbird.\\" Oy, how wrong and naive and stupid I was, not realizing that that wasn't at all the plot point.After re-reading it many times, I can understand why it's a Classic of American Literature- and my favorite book. It's incredible and Harper Lee has such a way of making you feel like you're right there in the story, experiencing it. That's how I felt from the first word to the last word, all the way though-out. Major props to her. And that's how I'll still feel if I happen to pick up the book tomorrow (which I probably will, I re-read it as many times as I can).To me, when I read this, each and every time, I dont just read it. I experience it, I experience the bond between Scout and Jem. I simply LOVED Calpurnia, and the bond that Scout and Jem have with thier father Atticus made me jealous, wishing I had been that close to my father growing up (I was, and am, very close to my Daddy but not like that). I loved how Harper Lee has such a way of writing that I really felt like I was right there in Maycomb, and still do to this very day.Bottom line, you haven't read it, you must- at least one time, to experience this Masterpiece of a story, of a southern town with unforgettable characters, which deserves every single ounce of Praise that it's recieved for years on end and will recieve on end, for years to come, I'm sure.5/5 Stars. Come on, could you really expect anything less?"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"As a mother who screens everything her 13-year-old daughter reads, I've shared with said daughter many, many newspaper articles that involve stories of persecution and discrimination based on everything under the sun: too light, too dark; tattoos, no tattoos; blond hair, ginger hair; short hair, Mohawk hair; too tall, too short; too fat, too thin - who really knows why people like or dislike someone on sight or through rumour?Of course, it is what they choose to do with their feelings that concerns most \\"normal\\" people - but there is no reading material, no newspaper article that conveys the harm a mob mentality can do as adequately as a good book. Todd Strasser's \\"The Wave\\" (previously reviewed) and Lee Harper's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" are two titles I cannot recommend enough to help generate discussion.For kids growing up in the 21st century, the 1930s and even 1960s are much, much further away than they were when we were growing up. What's changed since then, as far as blind prejudice and \\"following the crowd\\"? Sadly, (here's where the newspaper articles come in) very little. Apparently, people just don't learn.So, with this 50th Anniversary edition of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", I request the book to be released on Kindle as well (\\"The Wave\\" will only be available on Kindle in January 2013.) - and as soon as possible. Will more people read this classic because it's available on Kindle? Maybe if they think no one will see them reading it and judge them for it, they will. Said daughter's review follows:\\" 'To Kill A Mockingbird' by Harper Lee is one of the best classics I have ever read - and I am proud to say that I have read quite a few.\\"The book begins when Scout Finch, aged six, and her old brother, Jem, aged ten, are playing in the summer of 1930. They live in the old, weary town of Maycomb, in Alabama, with the usual sorts of people who live in old, weary towns: the gossips, the religious folk, the old ladies who will bake you cakes and the old ladies who will yell at you whenever they see you - and then they have people like Scout and Jem's father, Atticus, and people like the Ewells.\\"Atticus, is a lawyer, and in Scout's (and my) opinion, the best one in the whole of Alabama.\\"The Ewells, on the other hand, are as bad as pigs in mud - the father drinks, the kids only turn up for three days of schooling during their whole entire lives, and they all cuss as bad as sailors.\\"But, for now, none of that really matters to Scout and Jem. They have other things, *important* things to worry about. Like their mysterious neighbor, and making sure the other kids know their place, and how their crazy old aunt wants to turn Scout into a lady.\\"Then, one day, one of the Ewells, nineteen-year-old Mayella, claims that a black man raped her - and Atticus is chosen to be the man's defendant.\\"Soon, Maycomb, Alabama, is in chaos - the man *is* innocent, everyone knows that, but with people being, well, *people*, sometimes the unfairness of life just has to get a little more unfair.\\"Even if it means the killing of an innocent man.\\"When I first saw this book in my local bookstore, I must have been about the same age as Scout, and I thought that people must be crazy to write a whole book about a *bird*. Now, reading it at the age Jem is at the end of the book, I realize, of course, that the book isn't about a mockingbird.\\"Yet, in a way, it is.\\"Sometimes birds get shot to set food on the table, or for fun, and sometimes men get convicted and shot to keep the peace, and to mollify another man's hurt pride. And either way, the result is the same: the unfair, unjust loss of life.\\"Of course, you argue, humans beings have *evolved*. We fought the Civil War, and World War 2, and all those other wars. Everyone is now as equal as they can possibly be, and everything's all good. But is it? Have we *really* changed at all? Do we stiffen when we see someone of a different race come walking towards us? When we read articles in the news, do we immediately think the person in the pictures is the bad person, convicted before his trial?\\"And almost everyday, I see in newspapers stories - stories about people being killed or wounded because of their skin tone.\\"Their race.\\"Their religion.\\"Because they are gay or lesbian, or like to wear skirts or clown outfits when it isn't Halloween.\\"Because they don't fit our idea of *normal*.\\"So you know what?\\"I believe that every single person on Planet Earth should read this book.

Except for that I am a Christian, not a Baptist.Unlike many of the other books I've read, everything in the book is possible or can take place.In short, this book is good, but not so good."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The book, To Kill a Mockingbird, really made me feel lucky that I was born in the time I was. Back then in the 1930s, blacks were treated badly just for the color of their skin. Nobody cared about them. As for the whites, some found it hard to live that kind of lifestyle, just like the main characters, Jem and Scout, two siblings living at this time. They live in the town of Maycomb, Alabama. The town seems very boring and desolate. It also seems like they are stuck in a bubble, not able to get out of the town.The book is narrated by a young girl named Scout who lives during the time when blacks and whites were segregated. Her father is a lawyer and he is often made fun of because he defends black people. Later in the book, he has to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who is charged for the crime of rape of a poor white girl, Mayella Ewell.Atticus is the father of Jem and Scout. He raises him with their cook, Calpurnia. Atticus teaches Scout everything. He tells her, \\"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.\\" She remembers this especially in the end of the book. Atticus says a lot of important things such as \\"There's a lot of ugly things in this world, son. I wish I could keep 'em all away from you. That's never possible.\\" He really cares about his children and he wants them to grow up right.One summer, Jem and Scout meet their next door neighbor's nephew, Dill, who comes over every summer. They become amused with the house down the street, the Radley's. They want to see the son who is believed to have stabbed his father with scissors, Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley. They have a silent relationship with Boo because of the presents Boo gives them in the knothole of a tree near the Radley house. The presents that he gave them included chewed up gum and figures that looked like them. It was really odd.When I finished the book and took time to understand the meaning of why it is a sin to kill a mockingbird it all came to me and I liked the book. The book very harsh with racial discrimination, but it is really funny that the children of Maycomb County care more about the blacks than the adults. There are some fun and interesting parts besides the harsh comments, but mainly it focuses on how the past really was. I am still very happy to have been born in the time that I was. You must read this book because it will make you understand the past a little bit better and you will learn from the mistakes people back then made."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"So in the midst of reading some \\"previously missed classics\\" - The Great Gatsby and Catcher in the Rye amongst them - how nice to find one that genuinely deserves the title.

At least, that's what I think..."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book teaches everyone a timeless lesson. It also teaches a lesson in friendship and excepting people the way they are. This book is set in the 1930's in a small town called Maycomb. The whole book seems to be centered around making the town recluse Boo Radley come out of his house, but don't let this cover up the real reason behind the book. When Scout's dad ,Atticus (a lawyer), defends a negroe in court against a white man the town deals with one of the neverending problems in this world: prejudice. Not only do the towns people start being mean to Scout and her family but Scout's older brother Jem starts to grow older and has no time for his little sister. Scout begins to have a difficulty understanding everything that goes on. This book is a timeless classic and is a wonderful read for teens and adults alike."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee wrote long before the days of civil disobedience and is therefore a prophet to our times.

This book is a timeless classic back from the 1950's. This is a great growing up story about two children and their adventures. These little challenges that they are faced with become even harder when there are no grown ups around except their African American maid. Around dinner time their father Atticus Finch will arrive. Atticus portrayed as a kind sensitive lawyer who is very good with kids, but to the main characters he is an old man who has no exciting hobbies except reading. Scout Finch, Jem Finch and their friend Dill are three young children around the ages of ten and twelve years old who really love to be outside and love to play games. By far their most favorite game is to try and get a creepy old man, Boo Radley come out of his house. These games last a long while and they lead up to the hearing of a black man who is accused of raping a white woman. Back during the 1950's that was a serous offence.

It's hard to take single book and spend several weeks on it and drag out very niggly detail ad nausum. So I understand why all these high school students rate it so poorly. But recently I picked up my kids copy and re-read it. And lo and behold its full of life treasures. Treat your neighbors with respect and dignity. Color of your skin doesn't equate to your worth. On the otherhand the black folks described in this book are all hard working but poor good people, except for one slightly obnoxious person that the kids meet in church. Note though the story is told from the perspective of a young white middle class kid who would not have had much contact except through the help and so the characterizations all fit true to form.So read it for what it is, and when it was written and don't judge it by what you know now. In '61 life was still pretty segregated in the South and so this was a very radical book.For modern readers, Atticus role as a parent was decades ahead of its time. In the 00's you'll find fathers with this outlook but in the 60's it was very rare. One can explain this from the stoies perspective because Atticus wife's death forced him to change.Anyway I like this book a lot. It's right up there with Faulkner's Light in the Forest."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee has written one of the finest books to ever be printed. Mixing heartbreaking emotions with current issues of the time this book surpasses most others. The prose given to Atticus Finch could not be better. He is the everyman's hero who shines with simple wisdom and a good heart. Every person should strive to possess the dignity protrayed in the character of Finch. Lee also captures perfectly the innocence and wonder of children in her novel. Scout is the little girl who were all were at one time and wish that we could still be. I am honored that I was able to live in a time when a person could write such a magnificent book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"and I have read a lot of books. The writing in this book is so delicious I could just bite off a chunk of the pages! Scout is insightful looking back on her life as the daughter of a man willing to stand up against everything and still not necessarily win. This book makes you a stronger person if you read it and realize that sometimes doing what's difficult is the best even if you get absolutely nothing from it. Read this book and read it over and over all the years of your life."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"&quot;You can shoot all the Bluebirds you want, but remember, it's a sin to kill a MockingBird&quot; This is the most important phrase in the book. It explains the title and the main moral and lesson of the book. This novel is about a lawyer, Atticus Finch, who is to defend a black man accused of raping a white girl in the 1930's. The story is told by Scout, Atticus's daughter. She tells of the trials her and her brother Jem have to go through as this case goes on. As the trial winds down, Tom Robinson, the black man, is found guilty of a crime everyone knew he didn't commit. The quote relates to Tom. This book is a great addition to anyone's library. This novel will leave a mark on your soul! While I'm at it, let me mention two other lesser-known but worthy Amazon picks that I enjoyed: WILL@epicqwest.com by Tom Grimes, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez -- two lively, fun novels that were an interesting change of pace for me. :o)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is a novel based on the childhood of a young girl. Bob Ewell, Boo Radley, Tom Robinson and Scout were all main characters. Bob Ewell is a mean, racist man who accuses Tom of raping his daughter. Boo Radley is a retarded, crazy person, so the children fear him. Tom Robinson is a black man who is trying to survive in the town with racism problems. Scout is the young girl who tells the story of what happens in her town. Bob has problems with Tom, so he said that he saw Tom rape his daughter. Scout has problems with Boo because she wanted to be friends and he didn't. My favorite character is Scout, because she wanted to know who Boo Radley really is, and she was determined to find out.If I could relate to a character in the story, it would be Atticus. Atticus is a man who took up the challenge of a new type of legal case. He, a white man, is willing to defend a black man. Atticus took the challenge because if he doesn't than he couldn't hold up his head in town, and he couldn't hold his morals and principals. He felt that Tom Robinson was innocent, and he knew that Tom wasn't going to be found innocent by the people. I am also taking up a challenge to become a U.S. Marine. I want to challenge myself to this because it will be a good thing for me. I want to be able to learn leadership, self-reliance, new skills, honesty and loyalty.I like the book. My favorite part is when the Ewell kids sat on the black side of the court, because they wanted to hear the decision of the judge. They knew Tom was innocent. At that point the town was convinced that Tom Robinson was not guilty of the crime. My least favorite part is when Mr. Nathan Radley fills the tree hole with cement. He did it because he doesn't like little kids to be playing with his property. Jem and Scout were mad that he covered the hole because they left a chain, a knife and a watch there. Mr. Nathan Radley was just being mean person toward kids that get near his property. In this story, I would change the way Boo Radley is. He didn't deserve to be like this. He was a good boy but had problems with his head. He was lost in his own little world and his parents just made his life worst.I would recommend this book to others, because it's good for people to read. It's very interesting with lots of detail about life in the old South. People will re-think about life back in the day after they read this book. Everyone will like this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, is a book that most American students will have to read. And for good reason; Lee writes in such a way that there are no lies and only truths. She writes from the perspective of an eight year old girl, who is, if nothing else, a tomboy. She describes the most subtle extremes that only children would see that way. It is the perfect story of a family in the south, where prejudice is the story of the peoples' lives. The book doesn't hint where the plot is going or what it is, it just happens. This book is great, and I suggest all students should read it if they already haven't."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book describes 1930fs America. The scene is Alabama. Main characters are Atticus, Jem and Scout. This book is about Jem and Scoutfs growth through some events like their father, Atticus, worked for a black man and relationship between Scout, Jem and Boo Radley who stayed for many years inside in his house. I strongly recommend this book. Because this book has deep thought about prejudice and discrimination to black people at that time. In this book, white people in the city considered black people to be criminals. The scariest thing is that they didnft aware that they discriminate. Against these problems, Atticus fought proudly. It changed people around him. He has really good, fair personality. After reading this book, you will wish that I had a father like Atticus Because I thought so."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I first read this book at about 11 because I had heard it was a good one. I hated it. However, about 2 years later, I had to read it for a school project and I absoulty LOVED it! This is a wonderful, bittersweet novel about growing up in the South around the 50's and having to choose between reputation and jusitce. I highly reccomend this book to anyone and everyone, however, wait till you're at least 12 to fully enjoy this wonderful story for what it really is."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Wow! This book was great. I am not much of a reader and I have a really hard time concentrating on reading something when I am not interested in it. This book was very interesting and caught my attention the first time I picked it up. The character that interested me the most was the little girl Scout who was also telling the story. Scout was a normal 8 year old girl who was very much a tom boy. She loved playing with her older brother Jem and could very much hold her own. They lived with their father Atticus Finch who was a trial lawyer. Atticus Finch gets an offer on day to defend a african american man who was accused of raping a white woman. As much talk is going around the small town, Atticus is still able to set a great example for his children and beliving in what is right. There was alot of hate in the town and everyone wondered why he was defending this colered man. Nobody wanted to believe him. Atticus believed that the man was entitled to a fair trial and the whole town was very angry with him. As he stood his ground his children were there watching all of this and realized that nobody should be treated different just because of their skin color or anything different from anybody else. Atticus taught his children that you should not be ashamed for helping others and not letting other intemadate you. Overall I thought this book was great and it brings to reality what is true in this world."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book for a school assighnment. At first I thought that this book was quite boring but as the story line continued the plot developed a great climax. As I read more into the book I had an urge to read on. The main charachters in this book are: Jem, Scout and Atticus, The minor characters are: Dill, Boo Radley,and the Ewells. What I liked about this book was that it had other stories that were also happening which prevented us from getting bored.This book lets us see how kids in the past coped with prejudice. This book definetely deserves 5 stars because it stands out from all the other books that have been written."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I chose this book knowing already it was a classic novel of our time. So I decided to experience this book myself, and right away I fell in love with it. Every moment was excellently described, down to the last detail. The character depictions drew me in as I could relate to the way Jem and Scout acted. The events that occurred were interesting and Harper Lee writes the novel with such imagery, it is easy to imagine everything going on. The book is easy to understand, though it contains lots of symbolism, including the title itself To Kill A Mockingbird. The book definitely deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The book is by Harper Lee and is called To Kill a Mockingbird. The book is a great book that is set in the 1930s around segregation times. The book is the life of, and narrated by Jean Louise. In the book she is mainly known as Scout. The book tells about growing up in the segregated 1930s, the book shows hownlife back then was a struggle for everyone. The book tells life isn't fair. I really liked the book because the book teaches morals, but is also suspenceful, suprizing, sad, and exciting. I like the book becaus eits the kind of book you can't put down once you start reading.This book is inspirational and you will get something out of it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I rated To Kill a Mockingbird with four stars because I really liked it. It was a hard, long read, but I enjoyed it a lot because I love to read the classics - they are great books. I consider it a classic because it was complicated, but conveyed a great meaning. It was really hard to put down. Even though it was a little slow, it was hard to stop as the plot thickened. I definitely could relate to Scout (the protagonist). She was strong-willed and curious, similar to me. I, personally, was shocked on how some characters could be so prejudiced. This book shows how someone can influence peoples' opinions just by acting out. It also shows how discriminatory people can be."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"TKaM is not the finest piece of prose -- though it does have some terrific (sometimes humorous, sometimes heartbreaking) stretches. Nor is it the most compelling story. But it is a story well told, well voiced (by its very young narrator), and well paced. Above all, it is a story whose themes -- addressed to the best and the worst in human nature -- endure, themes that (one alternately hopes and is greatly saddened to think) will endure forever. For this reason, in spite of its quaint anachronistic feel, TKaM is a novel for the ages, and a particularly important read for children. I had the special pleasure of listening to TKaM narrated by Sissy Spacek, the perfect voice for Scout."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"\\"This case is as simple as black and white.\\"(Lee 203). This quote is about racism which is one of the themes in Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. This book is set in the 1960's South where racism was very common and widely accepted by the white communtiy.This book is about a young girl, named Scout, who lived in the South in the 1960's. Her father, Atticus, was a lawyer representing a black man, Tom Robinson, who supposedly raped a girl. Scout had to learn to deal with the hardships of how the kids at school teased her, and how the whole town turned against her family.The emotional impact the book had on me was immense. Reading it was a huge reminder of how the world was, and what have overcome since then. People in this book were starting to hate Scout's family because her father was representing a black man. It shows how terrible the world can be sometimes, and what can happen if we let our fears overcome us.To Kill a Mockingbird was a great book. I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I think I was suppsoed to read this book in High School and I either didn't or i watched the movie instead. Either way, I am glad I finally did. This book is one of the best ever written. It makes me sad to think that so many people have not and will not read it. Harper Lee was ahead of her time in so many ways. Buy this book. Read it now. Go!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book was simply wonderful and a must read.I was amazed at the presentation of the story and the way Harper Lee draws you in. The narrator is an 8 year old girl named Scout who is both innocent about the world and its social norms; while at the same time curious enough to be engaged and question \\"why does it have to be this way?\\" It is from Scout's perspective that you are able to see the silliness and real injustice that we (adults) create by continually abiding by these destructive social norms that we consider \\"the way it has to be\\".On the surface, many readers will read this book and say that it is about \\"race relations\\". But upon taking a deeper examination into the book, you will find that \\"race\\" is just the example used in order to convey an even bigger message on the importance of being both open minded and aware of oneself and the world around you. Harper Lee, through the innocent eyes of Scout, challenges us to think outside the box, to accept people for who they are, to be open-minded, to challenge social norms and to start thinking for oneself.I have rarely identified with or have been more inspired by a fictional character as I have with Atticus. He embodies every characteristic I wish to have from having compassion and love for everyone (even when it is undeserved), to his ability to critically think through issues, to his capacity of fairness, open-mindedness, and knack for remaining calm and peaceful in times of hostility and high stress. What an amazing character.To Kill a Mockingbird is not just revolutionary in its day for implying that blacks should be equal to whites; but is revolutionary even now because the underlying themes and messages it states still need heard and practiced today. This book will impact you and challenge you, and should make you a better person."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Scout Finch is a girl that wants to be just like her father, even though the rest of the world wants to see her as a young lady. She worries that when she's away, Calpurnia, her cook and friend, will not have anything to do. She is also very protective of her family, especially her father Atticus.In the story Scout faces trouble in school because of what her father is doing to help set things right for someone considered less than a real person. The small southern town of Maycomb is about to get a huge wake up call. As Atticus helps defends Tom Robinson in court, Scout and Jem, her older brother, learn what is really happening. But this novel is more than just a book about southern small town history. It is also a classic story about a young girl beginning to understand the good and the bad in the world around her. Any reader interested in American history or a wonderful classic novel will cherish this book.Harper Lee was born on April 28, 1926 in Monroeville, Alabama. Lee attended Huntingdon College 1944-45, studied law at the University of Alabama 1945-49, and studied one year at Oxford University. In 1959 Harper was asked by Truman Capote to accompany him to Kansas to do research for his book, In Cold Blood. On May 29, 1961 the Alabama Legislature passed a resolution to congratulate Miss Lee on her success. In June of 1966, Harper Lee was one of two persons named by President Johnson to the National Council of Arts.In June of 1957 Lee completed the first draft of To Kill A Mockingbird. In 1959 To Kill A Mockingbird was complete and printed. In 1961 Lee had two articles published: Love--In Other Words in Vogue, and Christmas To Me in McCall's. When Children Discover America was published in 1965."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I first read Mockingbird when it was a new release, and read it again this past week. It's lost none of its magic.Actually I can say its influence extended far beyond what I'd originally thought, and has found its way onto the pages of my own book, Bridges by L.P. Sloan. While as a writer I have some disdain for comparisons, I make an exception when my book is compared to Harper Lee's. Mockingbird is a masterpiece of simple words and simple humanity, and it humbles me. The richness in its descriptions of the character's day-to-day lives achieves a depth and portrays an affection rarely found."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee has touched a nerve in American culture, a nerve that runs through our society even today. The characters she brings to life are memorable, and it's hard not to look back on them with affection.Still, if you're considering this book for an Advanced Placement English class or in preparation for one in the future, you should be aware that while the debate over whether this book is great literature continues, the AP Board has come down on the side of those who say it isn't. If you're looking for writing from the American South that is AP-worthy, I strongly recommend Flannery O'Connor or William Faulkner. Also worth a try is Eudora Welty."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is deep, and it touches on sensitive themes many authors write about; but none are nearly as effective in execution as Lee. An edition to do this book justice is the current trade paperback edition, the one by HarperCollins. The particular edition is printed on creamy, acid-free paper and has a wonderful illustrated cover that would make any library proud. Enjoy this fantastic read!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I am 15 years old, and I just read this story about a week ago for my tenth grade english class. Most of the kids didn't like the story and they didn't catch all of the wonderful lessons and morals that came along with it. They didn't understand that this book could teach you a lot about life. It taught me a bundle. I realized all of the racist remarks that go on at school everyday, and I learned that courage is definatly not an action that doesn't involve brains. Please, read this book with an open mind and experience the new outlooks on life that even a 7 year old girl and see. If she can do it, you can!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I don't use those words much to describe a book, but book deserves it with the utmost regard. Based in the small southern town of Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's, it chroniciles the life of Scout Finch, a mischevies little girl with a heart of gold. Her brother Jem, is a tough boy who looks after Scout with all his heart. They meet a young boy who blends in well with them named Dill.Based around the rape trial of a black man, Tom Robinson, it drives through emotions that you wouldn't even believed that you had. One of the greatest scenes in literature is when Atticus, Jem and Scouts father, shoots the wandering dog, left me breathless.If you have a love for anything, read this book, it is really great."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"\\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" is a tale of the life of a young girl and her brother. It is told from the first person point of view of Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch. She tells of what she and her brother Jeremy \\"Jem\\" Finch experience during the early 1900's when prejudice against African Americans, as well as other groups, is a common occurrence.Scout and Jem are the children of a single father Atticus Finch. Atticus is a lawyer and believes in being completely honest to everyone about everything especially his children. Even though Jem does not go to his father for advice and guidance as much as Scout does, most of his actions however; are actions that his father would approve of especially as he gets older. I sometimes thought of him as a of father figure type for Scout, especially while their father was in court defending a black man who was on trial for the rape of a white woman. As a reader I could see one very strong similarity between Jem and his father. They can both be very stubborn and they both stand up for what they believe in.Scout tells us how she learns about justice, racism, compassion, trust and love. Scout learns about justice, racism, and how sometimes the wrong person gets punished for a crime just because of their race when she, her brother and their friend Dill witness the trial of Tom Robinson. She learns to be compassionate of \\"Boo\\" Radley's feelings and decides that she will befriend the recluse and act as if they had always known each other. She learns to trust the good judgment of her elders (especially her aunt Alexandria) and comes to love each of them because they have been there to provide her with clear answers to everything that happens in their neighborhood.By telling a story like this from the point of view of an innocent child, Harper Lee truly captures the readers attention and I think that is what makes this novel so great.I highly recommend this book. Once I started reading it I didn't want to put it down."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book for my 8th grade english class, and after i finished it, i could not stop thanking my teacher for making us read it. it truly gave me a different perspective on everything-people, places, things, and even ideas. my entire view of life changed, and i learned to appreciate things so much more. anyone can relate to it. ANYONE. if you havent read this, i seriously recommend it. it most certainly will not disappoint you."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Fortunately, fifteen years (or more) ago, I read this book on my own before my English teacher required it... this is not a book that needs to be analysed and charted. It is one that needs to be absorbed, and felt. It does NOT deserve to be one of those books students hate merely because it's required reading.The characters are as real as books get, the small town one that you might live in now, or your grandparents might have lived in decades ago. The issues - from racism, sibling relationships, and just plain growing up - touch your soul. And it's just plain fun to read.It's a bit of American culture that should be cherished... passed on as the valuable art it is - but to tear it apart with attempts to read into symbolism, or to over analyze it... that nearly denies Harper Lee the respect she deserves for writing it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I've read tons of books but somehow this one escaped me and I didn't read it until a few months ago. I read it for a book club and my first thought was, \\"oh great, a classic... it'll be dry and tedious and I'll feel like I'm in highschool lit class again.\\" How wrong I was! To Kill a Mockingbird is a fascinating book that takes place in the south in the middle of the 20th century when racial issues are being brought to the forefront. The characters are likeable, the town charming and the message not one to miss. Pick this book up and read it even if you don't like to read classics."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"If you want a book with conflict and suspenseful situatios then To Kill a Mockingbird is the book for you. There is mostly racial conflict and childhood problems that Scout and her brother encounter.I think the author is trying to show you how couragous Scout and other characters are throughout the book. I love a book with diversity in a character and Scout is very diverse. She can be caring and amazingly brave all at once. She shows bravery when she dares to run up to the Radley house and touch it even after hearing all the stories about Boo Radley. The suspense is at its greatest point when Scou gets stuck under the fence at the Radley house when her and her brother sneak to the house one evening. The shows the suspense and excitement that the book has.Throughout the book there are many different conflicts. One of the major conflicts is between an innocent black man falsely accused for rape of a white woman. He goes to trial and the jury is completely white, the judge is white, and Scout is the only oone that believes in him. Also there is a conflict with Boo and the neighborhood kids, including Scout. They're afraid of him because of all the rumors heard but none of them ore ture. Boo turns out to be nice.In conclusion, I liked the book. I would recomned this novel to anyone because there are other aspects of the book besides good conflict and great suspense that help it fit my defintition of good literature. To Kill a Mockingbird is a great book with diverse characters, an outstanding plot, and a controversal steeing.

I absolutely loved it....and to think I would have never read it unless I was forced to in school. This is what makes us so happy to have English classes that force us to read books that we think we won't like. =) &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a beautiful piece of literature, but you have to allow yourself to get into it. Like most other books, you have to get through the humdrum of the beginning in order to get into it. This novel follows the escapades of 12-year-old Jem and his little sister Scout in the 1930's. What they experience in a short period of time will change their lives forever. There isn't much to say about this novel. It's heartrending, touching, and thoroughly engaging, and the writing is among the best I've ever seen in one novel. Harper Lee deserves all the recognition she receives for this moving account on living life and growing up. I definitely recommend that you buy this novel, but the only way you can come to love it so much is if you are patient with Harper Lee's deep writing style and if you allow yourself to feel the human emotions of the characters.

It's well-written, engrossing, poignant, and takes on a lot of the big issues from growing up to racism to fear and ignorance. It is at once complex in its themes yet simple to understand. As a result, it doesn't have that sense of deep untertone and vast implications one often associates with great literature. I respect Harper Lee's achievement in writing a true and important classic. At the same time, I often find myself drawn to more challenging works.

What I liked about this book was the dialogue. It made it feel like you were actually there having a conversation with the characters. I also liked the plot of the story. It was how a black man was convicted for something that no one could prove he did. What I disliked was the detail that the author went into. It good to go into detail, but not so much were the reader has trouble understanding. I found it hard to find out what characters he was talking about sometimes.

This book accurately explores the racial issues that were rampant at the time that the novel was set and that the book was written in 1960. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and Universal Pictures adapted it into the movie we all know and love the following year. Harper Lee herself gave the movie the go-ahead and was well-pleased when it was released in December, 1962. Though this is more a review about the movie, I relate better to the film because it condensed the novel very effectively. Not since \\"Gone With The Wind\\" (also turned into a classic motion picture in 1939, winning 10 well-earned Oscars) and \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" (I don't know of any existing film version, but if somebody does think of it, for the love of God, do it well), has a novel come out of the South and recieved world-wide acclaim. The book is rated PG for thematic elements and some racial dialogue, including some language. The film is Not Rated."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Atticus Finch is a lawyer in a racially divided Alabama town in the 1930s.

At thistime she is encountering the issue of racism which is throughout the entire town. The town is out to get Tom Robinson, a black man who is charged with rape. She and herbrother Jem are upset with the guilty verdict and feel that his trust in the goodness and rationality of humanity has been betrayed.What I like about the book was that it represented and shows how racism is a strong emotion, which is still around today.What I didn't like was reading about the interpretation and views of the townspeople and how they viewed and perceived Tom Robinson."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It is told form the perspective of a young lady daughter of a lawyer in the south around 1930. He is called to defend a black man who is accused of raping a white young lady. The fact that someone was black meant that the courts at that time would inevitably find them guilty of the crime, which would mean that the trial would be a joke.

The book takes place many moons ago in the southern states. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat with scene such as Shootings, Rape, and Segregation. The characters are young and full of ambhition, and very misgevious.Once you pick up this book you wont be able to put it down."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Have you ever read a book you just couldn't put down? Well, if you haven't already don't miss your chance. Imagine racial problems in a small southern town while a young girl learns that people stick together and help each other. To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee is a sensational book that describes a young southern girl growing up while her town is filled with racial problems. If you like adventure or just love reading a great fiction story you will enjoy this book. Would you risk being seen just to watch your father defend a man in court? This situation and many more are the adventures in this story.In this book Scout Finch and her brother Jem go through many adventures while having trouble growing up. While Scout is getting grief about being a young lady from her relatives Jem is drawing farther apart from her while he grows older. During these troubles Scout's father (who is a lawyer) is defending a man accused of committing a serious crime.The book is told with great word choice and language. All throughout the book the story is told with unique southern accents. Such accents are \\"No, suh\\" or \\"Lemme outa here. \\" There is some profanity that occurs in parts of the book but the language helps you connect to the characters emotions. Also the author uses great descriptive words that help you visualize what is happening in your head.Harper Lee wrote To Kill A Mockingbird in a way that makes the reader feel the same emotions as the character does. For example when Scout was teased she became mad and angry at characters and so did I. In other words when a character feels emotions such as sad, angry, or happy you will feel them too. In addition to feeling emotions the reader will feel they are in the situation the characters are going through also.The reason I enjoyed this book so much is because I felt emotion, which is important to me when I read a book. When I read this book I was really touched with emotion. I became angry at times when I read about all the racial problems this small southern town had. I recommend To Kill A Mockingbird to all readers especially ones who like reading about adventure.So now take action and go to your school library, local library, or your local bookstore and get To Kill A Mockingbird. I highly advise you to read this book because it tells a great story that is very enjoyable. To Kill A Mockingbird gets my two thumbs up. This is a book you won't be able to put down!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Only growing up in the south would enable Harper Lee to capture the vicious sweetness that pervails there. Not only to capture it but then be able to transfer that on to the reader. You can smell the sweetness of the talcum through the sticky of the hot summer days. Sickly sweet. The church group women are vicious in their sweetness. Ardently praying for the savages in Africa while embracing the savage mores of the south. And in the midst of all of this she tells one of the greatest coming of age stories ever written. Fabulous. One I read every summer."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"when you first get to kill a mocking bird you say what a dumb book this is. but when you start reading it you want to go on and on until you get to the end of the book. this book grabs your attention in the second chapter and never lest your mind go. so if you think to kill a mocking bird is boring think again."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The book was perhaps the greatest I've ever read. The way that it showed you how prejudice is never going to be the way out of your problems. I liked how the main charcater Scout, at the end finds out that rasism is never going to be the way out of your problems. I also like how it showed you how things are back in the 60's and gives you an idea of how it would be if you lived in that time. The way that they put out the plot line was great, I will definetlly recommend this book to a friend."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To kill a Mockingbird is a book based on the time period of the 1930's. It tells the truth behind the walls of lies. The characters are perfect for a child's view of racism, growing up, and the ways of life. The book is set in Maycomb, Alabama in the poor area for the whites. In this town blacks are treatd fairly by some and unrighteously by others who feel they have a overbearing superiority . White women had meetings in which they gossiped about blacks. The town in my opinion is too close and they tend to know people all to well. They pass so much judgement that some tell lies that are not intended to benefit them just so they can be left alone. In my closing statement I say, &quot; This book is a great depiction of the unjustful ways of the 1930's.&quot;- Jasmine Meriwether"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is the perfect description of how the white people living in the south treated the blacks in the 1930's. In school we learn about the slaves and the Civil War, and what goes on in that time period of American History. However we are not really exposed to the time period that follows, the fact is that we still treated blacks badly. Within the contents of this book about a little girl growing up in a very judgemental town we not only learn about how the blacks were treated but we also learn how judge some one. Which we really can't do until we walk around in their shoes.When one takes the time to sit down and think about what is going on the fact that not a lot has changed since then. We make up stories about something or someone that we don't know, or are afraid of like Boo Radley. Then we frown down apon those who we think are unclean in our society like the Eweles. Then there are the people who we judge too qickly because of their unfasionalble clothes or the color of their skin like the Tom Robinson's of the world. When we decide to look closer we see that most of the Tom Robinsons of the world are just trying to get along like everyone else. People like Boo Radley are also trying to get by, but remain in the shadows, like the kid in the back of the class who doesn't say anything for the fear that everyone will laugh at him. Then the Eweles who we think to be unclean, but there is always the idea that we raise the standards all the time to what is fit in society. Then there is the dissaproval of a black man and a white woman back then, do we not today frown apon the realtionships of lesbians and gay people?In To Kill a Mockingbird it takes a little girl to get us to realize this. She is only 6, shouldn't these societal conflicts be appearant to all. Esepcially the older ones who tend to be the cause of these confilcts. I ask of all who read this review, To Kill a Mockingbird is a great book on its' own, but what makes it better is that there is so much more beyond it that can help us in all days of life."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It was in a small town in the South, in 1930's. The story is full of interesting, lovable characters. The narrator is Scout a bright, bold, young girl who lived with her older brother Jem and their lawyer father, Atticus.Respectable Atticus was a gentleman who raised the two children with the help from Calpurina, the day cook. Against some of the prevalent social senses, he taught them the principles and values he lived by.With Dill around during the summer, things were more interesting. They had the hermit neighbor who remained the mysterious subject of the children's acts of curiosity. Their interaction with other neighbors like Ms Maudie and Mrs Dubose was always capped with lessons to learn.And there was a case of a black man Atticus defended against the charge of raping a white girl. Atticus' integrity and the people's classic prejudices were demonstrated in events related to the case.The storyline and language are awesome. Narrations by children are always interesting in the way curiosity, frankness, and innocence do. And the book is full with values we adults could always relearn. No wonder it is such a classic!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To kill a Mockingbird is a simple small town story. It is about a lawyer who is helping a man who is getting charged with rape. The story is narrated by six year old Scout. It shows the reader of the prejudices of a small southern town in the 30's. I recomend this book to everyone who wants to see how African American's were treated in this small southern town."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"When I read this book I was really surprised. Not too many books we read in school are actually books I like, but this one was different. The way Harper Lee portrayed it all through the eyes of six-year-old Scout made it different too. The innocence and understanding of a child through times when the black and white were still not equal helps you really get into this book, especially when one black man is being tried for rape against the white trash of the town and inevitably loses. Even after Atticus puts up the best opposing fight ever. After the trial a the hate is turned on to Atticus. But when someone goes after his kids, something has to be done. Before it gets out of hand. What happens? Read to find out."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The Story being told in the eyes of Scout Finch. Always talking about her brother Jem being couragous and brave. They were two kids 7 and 12 and they loved each other and just follow each other around and did some pretty crazy things. All in all, a Great book that will be usefull for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is an amazing piece of literature that should be read by everyone between the ages of 13 and 50. Even though the main characters are two children, the plot is intriguing and absorbing. The characters are very developed, and the events range from the children's childlike endeavors to a realistic trial involving an accusation of rape. The title also comes into the book a few times, with the mentioning of mockingbirds signifying important events, and the question of which of the characters have mockingbird personalities. As it says in the book, it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because it simply plays music for people to enjoy, and does not do any harm."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"If your dad were a lawyer, would you like it if he were defending a black man in the 1930s? Well I would, if it was right. In the book to Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, a family living in Macomb County finds out what it takes to stay strong and do what is right. With their friends, family, and school on their minds, Scout and Jem Finch help their father, Atticus, defend Tom Robinson, being accused of raping one of the Ewells. In addition, with their aunt in town and a black house cleaner, Calphurina, things cannot get any worse.Order in the court! My favorite part in the book is when Atticus and Tom Robinson are in the court. I learned all that has happened the night Tom was accused. Well, Tom Robinson was in the woods near the Ewel's house. Tom was at the Ewell's house supposedly raping someone's wife. The court is very offensive because Tom is a black man. The funniest part of the chapter is when Atticus keeps on asking the same exact thing. It is amusing to me because I love hearing people being asked the same thing. I did not think Scout understood it that much; after all, she is only eight. This is the funniest chapter.The other chapter I like is when Jem's friend Dill comes into town. He runs away because he says his step dad is being very mean to him. He does not like it so he runs away. This chapter is also very funny because Scout finds Dill under her bed and she thinks he is a mouse. Jem hits Dill in the head with a broom! It made me laugh so hard. Atticus talked to Dill's mother and she said he could stay with them for a week so she can work things out.In conclusion, the book To Kill a Mockingbird is a funny, dramatic, and touching book. I know you will love it as much as I do. Come join me in this wonderful book. It will teach you something about yourself.

Theirs sadness and happiness, racism and equality, immaturity and maturity, injustice and redemption.Atticus is a man we could all love and look up to a grounded just and fair man he sees beyond race and finds the goodness in people. His cook Calpurnia Is honest good black lady who you just gotta love in this story, she works for a nice family who are about to go through some obstacles and testing times.A lot of the story is told through a young girl and is enjoyable to see things from a young perspective for example this excerpt...\\"There was a man Dill had heard of who had a boat that he rowed across to a foggy island where all these babies were; you could order one-- \\"That's a lie. Aunty said God drops \`em down the chimney. At least that's what I think she said.\\" For once, Aunty's diction had not been too clear.The characters in the story face racism but a lot is put straight for example.....\\"You know the truth, and the truth is this: some Negroes lie, some Negroes are immoral, some Negro men are not to be trusted around women--black or white. But this is a truth that applies to the human race and to no particular race of men.\\"\\"Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy.

It was the winner of the 1961 Pulitzer Prize and considered an American classic. I was very worried it would disappoint.This is one novel that didn't disappoint. I was gripped from beginning to end. I knew of the great honorable character of Atticus Finch who defended a black man despite all opposition from his neighbors in a southern Alabama town.The book is so much more than that. It is told through the eyes his daughter (nicknamed Scout) and her narration is perfect. Lee is able to very accurately depict the innocent lens of a child while remaining coherent and eloquent. Even without the trial and even without the great character of Atticus Finch, this is a wonderful tale of childhood.Even the character of Atticus is appropriately flawed. He is a single parent who has trouble raising his children. He doubts that he's doing the best for him. His basic goodness shines through but it's never cliched.I read this in two sittings and enjoyed every moment. This novel deserves all the rich praise that it has been given.I give a most enthusiastic recommendation to this classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it was uncomplicated, a real easy read.

I don't rate many books as five stars and after thinking about what my criteria would be, I'm left with this: Did I hate to see the end of the book and would I read it again (which I seldom do). The answer to both questions is a resounding yes.Thank you Harper Lee for this treasure and thank you to the makers of the movie \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" for their faithful adapatation of the book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In the fictional small town of Maycomb, Alabama, Jean Louise Finch (Scout) lives with her older brother Jem and their father Atticus Finch. An African-American housekeeper cares for Scout and Jem, after their mother has died. One summer a boy named Dill comes to visit his Aunt, while Dill is in Makem him, Scout and Jem try to get a look at their mysterious neighbor Boo Radley (A grown man who hasn't left his parents house in years). Atticus Finch defends a young African-American man after being accused of raping a white woman (Mayella Violet Ewell). After Atticus Finch starts defending Tom is when the Finch family is the object of racial slurs and insults. After the court hearing Tom is accused of the crime by the jury even after Atticus has proved his innocent. This book was written when racism was big; an African-American man couldn't do anything without getting accused of something. And when they were accused they would be marked as guilty even if they were innocent. Author Harper Lee was born in Monroeville, Alabama in 1926. To Kill a Mockingbird was published in 1960.The main characters of To Kill a Mockingbird are Scout, Jem, Atticus Finch, Calpurnia, Dill and Boo Radley. The story is told in Scout's point of view, the story takes place from the time Scout is aged 6 to 9, but she tells the story as an adult. Scout is a tomboy who would rather solve problems with her fists than with her head. Scout's older brother Jem who ages from 10 to 13 during the story. He is Scout's protector and one of her best friends. As part of reaching young adulthood, Jem deals with many difficult issues throughout the story. Maycomb attorney and state legislative representative Atticus Finch who is assigned to represent Tom Robinson. A widower, Atticus is a single parent to two children, Jem and Scout. Calpurnia is the Finch's African-American housekeeper. She grew up at Finch's Landing and moved with Atticus to Maycomb. She is the closest thing to a mother that Scout and Jem have. One of the few Negroes in town who can read and write, she teaches Scout to write. Dill is Jem and Scout's neighborhood friend. Living in Mississippi, Dill spends every summer with his aunt. Boo Radley is the mysterious neighbor who tips the children's interest. They've never seen him and make a game of trying to get him to come outside.Scout Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer and the three acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill and the other two kids (Jem and Scout) become fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without going outside. Scout goes to school for the first time that fall and hates it. She and Jem find gifts left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their game, urging the children to try to see life from another person's perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill's last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the act of escaping. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor's house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Scout's shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Boo did it, Jem tells Atticus about the mended pants and the presents. Atticus agrees to defend a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Atticus's decision, Jem and Scout are the objects of abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch's Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches' African-American cook, takes them to the local black church.Don't judge someone just by the color of their skin but of their character. That's what this book is trying to teach all the people who read it. Tom Robinson was judged by his skin when sent him to prison and ended up in the death of him. All of that could have been avoided if everyone didn't judge people by the first look. If you want to judge someone, get to know them for who they are not what they look like. \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\" is the famous saying that describes what this book is trying to teach.The book was very good, because it teaches people about racism and why no one likes it. Racism is bad nowadays but in 1960 an African-American man or woman couldn't go anywhere without being discriminated against, which is wrong. If you white, brown, tan, or even purple you shouldn't be discriminated against, skin is not what you need to look at. It's the person's character that's important once you know that you can judge them for what they are."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The central character in the novel was a black man who was accused of murder, due to prejudice and a rush to judgment. Anyhow, this reminds me of the OJ trial. Everyone times this book in with the \\"Catcher and Rye.\\" I guess the two novels are connected because the main character gets in trouble with the authority and remains the protagonist. Everyone was rooting for Boo to get free and to be exonerated. There is a good American sentiment about the teenage rebel and the criminal that is not really bad after all. I enjoyed reading this book because the lawyer and his children shed light on a subject that actually had more influence on American perception of crime and criminals than actual real court cases would have had."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book in high school years ago....

A great read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is a book set in a bygone era, where girls had to wear skirts to school (it's almost hard to believe that it was required at one time!) and things were very different - cars were not as common, no internet or tv, etc. It's also a time where segregation and racism were seen as the norm, especially in the trial and persecution of a innocent black man accused of a crime by a white man who was the one who actually committed the crime. There's a lot of unfairness in this book, but it's an eye-opener and reminds us that there was once a time where such unfairness was acceptable. A very good read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"On the fiftieth anniversary of this book I wanted to reread Harper Lee's marvelous novel! It has not disappointed!

It was just amazing!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I like how the book talked about relationships between different races, particularly blacks and whites, as well as social classes and educational issues. The book gave good historical information about the way things used to be bacl in the day by putting the story into a real life situation in a book. Every facet of the racial factors discussed in the book produced a good moral to learn from. The author did a fantastic job of developing the characters to portray how people really acted during that time period. I would recommend this book to teenagers who want a good book to read and also for those who are doing book reports because it's a timely book with so many issues in society about diversity that also has lots of revelant information about racism."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The book, To Kill a Mockingbird was an easy and very enjoyable book to read. It was not complicated, although it had an intricate and deep meaning. It was also a book that you could read for hours, because it is very hard to tear yourself away from. It was fun and enjoyable but also a point to get across. The most memorable moment in the book, and my favorite, is when the main character, Scout, realizes the truth about a character she has had a false opinion of for a long time. She comes to the conclusion that this character is really just there to help and care for her, when for a long time she thought he was a danger to her. It is a heartwarming part and teaches everyone to take a closer look at those around them. All in all, this book is a good teacher and a fun book to read. I would recommend it to anyone. TKAM was a book that I would recommend for any age group. Although it is a fairly easy read, I think any adult who hasn't read this book is missing out.

This book should be red by all audiences because it is great and understandable from anyone's perspective."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The book To Kill a Mockingbird was very well written about Pre-judgments. Pre-judgements are still very common in the world today.This book was very easy to read and was very understandable. I also liked the book because it showed very many real life situations. What really stuck out to me was the relationships that Atticus built with the black people. They trusted Atticus in every way possible. Back then it was looked down upon to be friends with black people, let alone defend them in a courtroom. Not very many people believed it was right to be friends with black people. Atticus, Jem, and Scout, didn't care what people said. They did what was right in their hearts and that's all that matters.I think everyone should read and enjoy this book at least once in their lifetime. It will open and expand your mind about racism and pre-judgements."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I would give the book 3.5 to 4 stars because it was truly fantastic book that I enjoyed, and it dealt with real life issues in history, but some cahpters do however drag on. I liked the book because of the real life examples in history, it was about three kids growing up and that brought back memories. It showed good examples of prejudice and point of view changes. I would recomend this book to all ages, but there are some chapters that may be offensive to some dealing with race, and social ranking. Overall it was a good book about growing up, and I recomend anyone to read it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This novel was an excellent eye opener for me. It helped me realize how people judge others so harshly. I had never realized how unfair some issues are just because of someone's skin color or because they may be different. I recommend this book, being the eye opener that it was, to any high school student looking for a book to really catch there attention and to get them thinking. In this novel the one thing that stuck out to me is how people were so judgmental about everything that happened. Everyone in the whole town is judgmental about everyone and thing that happened. For one, this book can teach you things about the history of blacks and there struggle through rough times in the south. The details of hatred in this book are so visible it really makes you see what people were treated like back then. The way these people are treated, makes you realize how lucky you are. Second, this opens your eyes to the world of parenting through Atticus. It helps you see how difficult it is to raise kids being a single parent. Atticus does a great job letting the kids realize for themselves the facts of life. Finally, I enjoyed this book because it was not too complex. Some people enjoy books that make you think and have very complex plots. Don't get me wrong this book makes you think but it is a little more up front about the plot. It tells you how it is and stills makes a huge impact."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"As a High School student most books I've had to read for English are very boring.

It is a wonderful book that can bring back many fond memories. Full of innocence and suspense, a winning combination. Taking place over a 1 1/2 year period of time, this story tells of the mysterious neightbors, social injustices, and of small town life. Scout looks back at her childhood growing up with her father Atticus, brother Jem, nanny Calpurnia, and a plethora of other characters that add to the plot. One of the many pleasures of this book is how each one of the characters is presented in a believable manner. Atticus, a single father, balances work and trying to raise his two young children, Scout and Jem a brother and sister duo, who lurk around the mysterious Radley home to see what is inside. Tom Robinson, an African American accused of a crime he did not commit simply because of his race. These characters were presented in a way that the reader can relate and imagine. The only problem with this book was that the ending was a little abrupt. Even though the main plot is solved throught the book, the book leaves the reader wondering about the rest of everyone's lives. If there was an extra chapter or an epilogue, the story would be finished completely. Since there wasn't, the story lacked a certain ingredient that would make it a little better. The book was a window into the world of a young girl, her struggles and the struggles of all of the people around her as she grows up. Strongly recommended for teens but great for all ages. An eye-opening look at life and the variety of things that happen to a group of small town people. A superior example of American literature."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic coming-of-age novel. Harper Lee takes her readers on a three-year journey from the perspective of a young girl growing up in the South. The story takes place during the Great Depression of the 1930&#146;s in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama. The novel centers around Scout, the narrator, her brother Jem, and their father Atticus. The book focuses mainly on the racial relationships of this time, but explores other areas as well.Scout and Jem (9 and 13 respectively by book&#146;s end) become wise and Scout matures significantly over these three years. Atticus has a lot to do with this. He teaches his children to treat everyone equally by trying to &#147;consider things from another&#146;s point-of-view.&#148; The maturity of both children as well as their bravery shines through during the trial scene in which Atticus is appointed to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. Scout and Jem suffer emotional heartache throughout the trial. However, they stand up for what they believe &#150; all people should be treated fairly no matter what color they are, and that &#147;there&#146;s only one kind of folks.&#148;One of the other areas Lee covers in her novel is the pressure put on young women in the South to act as perfect ladies. This is especially hard for Scout who prefers to be a tomboy.Finally, the book takes a look at how cruel society can be and how easily we can dehumanize another person. Boo Radley, an important character in this novel is viewed as an outcast in Maycomb. The children of the town are both frightened and intrigued by this man. In their minds, they assume him to be a monster. However, Scout learns otherwise when she finally sees him for who he is.To Kill A Mockingbird is a timeless classic. Although racial relationships are somewhat better today, Lee does an excellent job of describing the hardships of staying true to beliefs while trying to grow up at the same time."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It's inarguable that this is a terrific book. It tells the tale of just how evil racism can be, and shows the best (Atticus Finch) and worst men can be. I also think it's interesting that Truman Capote was the model for the character Dill, since Capote and Lee were childhood friends."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The story is about a girl, Scout, growing up in a very small town. Her father takes a case that will change their family's whole life. It is witty and deep, all at once.It is the absolute best book in the world. The way Harper Lee narrates this book in a growing girl's point of view is fantastic. You'll never be able to put the book down!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is definitely the best novel I have ever read. I did a book report on it last year and expected it to be like any other book I had read that year, but I was in for a surprise. I found every page to have a deeper meaning, than it appeared, that clued the reader in on how one should live life, or what the \\"real world\\" is really like. This is a book that everyone can benefit from reading. The values and emotions exposed in this book are too great to tell about. One must read this book to understand the depth of its greatness. This is terrific book for book reports, but also an excellent choice for personal enjoyment as well. If you have not read this book then you are truly missing out."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I had to read To Kill a Mockingbird for school, but I quickly found myself caught up in it. I got so involved in it that I finished it within a week that our class started it, well ahead of schedule. I was surprised how connected I felt to some of the characters by the end of the book, specifically Atticus and Scout. The symbolism of the mockingbird is first mentioned early in the book, chapter 10, but it wasn't until the very end that the full force of it hit me. Scout's wisdom when she said \\"Well it'd be sort of like shootin' a mockingbird, wouldn't it?\\" impressed me with how much she had matured throughout the book, along with the last chapter.Altogether I thought that this really was a book that made me think differently after I read it. Atticus's wisdom throughout the book made me think quite a lot and I think I'll view the mockingbirds of our society a little differently from now on."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"A grown Jean Louise (Scout) Finch narrates the tale of her youth in Maycomb, Alabama, wherein her father Atticus defends a black man against a completely spurious rape charge cooked up by a poor white drunkard and his daughter. No, the issues are far from comfortable. The racism is stark, but the heroism is stolid. Through Scouts eyes we see a world of many colors and textures, but one must read the book to appreciate even a few of them.More than four decades since it was first published, Harper Lees book is more than just a tale of courage in the face of racial bigotry in the mid-twentieth century rural South, it is more than a tale of a girls love for her father, it is more than a novel. Without hyperbole, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is truly an American treasure. If you have never taken or been given the opportunity to read this book even if you dont read that many novels you owe it to yourself to transcend all the politics and attain the better understanding of humanity that Harper Lee can help you discover. After all, she has helped so many millions of schoolchildren do just that in the past two or three generations. Neither does she do it with the preachy tone I found myself falling into for this review! Whatever your age or color, enjoy!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. That's hard to say because I've read a lot of books. I never imagined I would enjoy a book we were assigned to read in school. I literally almost cried during some of the book. Right now we are supposed to be on chapter 17. I finished it - twice. This is a beautifully written book. The way the author can put all of this together in one little girl's mind is remarkable. Like the book says &quot;It's a sin to kill a mockingbird.&quot;"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"An 8-year-old tomboyish girl named Scout, living in Maycomb county, is exposed to issues in life such as class, justice, and race, learning valuable life lessons from each event as seen from her perspective. Along with the life lessons come the nature of a child. The sense of wonder and and her ornery behavior is also shown in the boook. What sets this book apart from others that I've read is the author's decision to write in the perspective of a child. Most books that I've read are told from an older person's perspective. The effect created by doing this is more adventure and details, since a kid is adventurous and has a creative mind. The author did a good job of not losing the the main idea of the book with the different events going on and even though the perspective was told thorough the child's eyes. I can identify my own life at a young age with the life of Scout. Since she was a young child, not everything was always told to her. It was covered with a blanket in hopes that she wouldn't discover what was going on. She always wanted to be in on the action knowing all that she could. Me as a child was the same way, and still am today. A curious, independent, wondering child would best describe Scout and me. Always wanting to be in the center, &quot;I pushed my way through dark smelly bodies and burst into the circle of ligh. H-ey, Atticus!&quot;. (154) This is a quote of when Scout, Jem, and Dill snuck out of the house at ten o'clock at night to see where there father/uncle was going. When they found him surrounded by a big crowd of people outside the jail protecting the person he was defending in court, the kids went right through them standing next to Atticus. This shows the sense of wonder, ornery nature, and the courage the kids had in the book. This book is a book that I believe everyone should read in their lifetime. Since it deals with the main issue of racisim and prejudice. Everyone will come across this once in their lifetime and is something that everyone can relate to. The life lessons that Scout learned can also be taught by the book to the reader. I feel that this book is for everyone that is capable of reading and able to comprehend the issues revealed."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book sends a strong message about bigotry and racial prejudice and hatred that was experienced in the south by a small family. It portrays the truth about then and sadly, even now. But not only does the book have a moral but it allows us to enjoy the childhood of Jed and Scout. Although often confusing and sometimes disturbing...I highly recommend this book...and I am a tough critic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is a marvelous story, but the reader Roses Prichard, ruins it for the listener.

Scout is my little heroine and I'd love to have a daughter like her. Atticus, Calpurnia, Miss Maudie are examples of good kind hearted people and a reminder that there are still plenty of good people out there. On the other hand, people like the Ewells, Stephanie Crawford are what I call the majority. Classic examples of ignorance and hatred based on nothing but old and ridiculous believes that being a certain color or race makes you superior. This is a book that should be required reading in high school."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this years ago, many years ago in high school.

I needed that book for school.Good condition and price. Amazon is amazing. I got excited when it came in the mail. Haha"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Somehow, as many times as I have seen the wonderful film made from Harper Lee's novel, I never got around to reading the book itself until now. How could I have waited so long? But reading it was one of those odd experiences that made me glad I did wait, just so that I could have the great joy that comes with a first reading of a masterpiece. Indeed, one of the reasons the film is so good is because the filmmakers had such strong material to work with (though it is not hard to think of films that have made a hash out of excellent originals). This book is wonderful, and the film's fidelity to the book (language, story, feeling) only makes me appreciate the film more than I already did. But forget the film; this is a book to be savored for its own sake. There is not a misstep from beginning to end. It's so powerful it actually brought tears to my eyes in places. Lee's straightforward telling of an overtly simple story effectively lays bare both the innocence of a Southern childhood and the deep prejudices of the South in which that childhood was lived. It's Lee's own innocence, her own childhood, and her own South in many ways, since the story, while not necessarily autobiographical, mirrors her childhood in many ways. There is much in the novel that transcends the specifics of the plot itself. One of its most powerful messages, delivered repeatedly by the wise and tolerant lawyer-father Atticus Finch, is that you must stand in another person's shoes for a while before you judge that person (and then you just might find that you can't judge them at all). Contained in the consoling words from Atticus to Jem in the aftermath of the trial that is the centerpiece of the plot is one of the most generous indictments of injustice you will ever read. (\\"Those are twelve reasonable men in everyday life, Tom's jury, but you saw something come between them and reason. . . . There's something in our world that makes men lose their heads--they couldn't be fair if they tried.\\") And that's what this book is: generous. This does not mean that it is tolerant of prejudice, hatred, cowardice, and narrow-mindedness. But it is generous toward human beings with all of their weaknesses and foibles, as well as all their nobility and goodness. If you've never read this book, do so immediately. If you have read it, you know that it is one to read again."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is probaly up in my top 3 favorite books. Awesome book.

Buying this book was a great way to celebrate Harper Lee's book of 50 years."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this in high school, it was the best book I had ever read. I read it again to my daughter when she was 11 and once again loved it. There was so much more to it than I remembered. It is such a stunning masterpiece on so many levels, this is one book worth reading again and again. My daughter and I have put it on our \\"books you must read in your lifetime\\" list (just four books long at this point).This is a powerful book and one that will stay with you a good long time."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I had a bad upbringing, as far as reading went. Most of my teachers let me read whatever they wanted, and the few that assigned anything to me took the path of the-most-boring-is-best. I therefore was made to read \\"1984\\", which was over my 14-year-old head, and \\"Silas Marner\\", which the whole class thought was boring and badly written. In the last few years I've been slowly catching up with those classics I should have read when I was younger. I tried Scott Fitzgerald (and decided after \\"The Great Gatsby\\"--which I liked--not to venture any further), \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" which I expected to hate and liked anyway, \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" which had me rolling in the aisles, and even Jane Austen, who I enjoyed a great deal more than I expected. Now I turn to \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". It's one of those books that everyone but me has apparently read. So I guess it's time I caught up with everyone else.Janet Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch is a little girl, during the events of the story. I got the impression that the author was imagining Scout as a slightly older girl, writing this story down for posterity. She has an older brother, and the two of them live with their father, a lawyer, in a small town in Alabama. Their mother's dead. In the summer, a cousin named Dill visits them and the three of them play together. Supposedly, Dill is based on Harper Lee's real childhood friend, Truman Capote, but that's neither here nor there. They are the typical rural children of the era, playing in the street, and spreading rumors and innuendo about their neighbors. At the end of the block there's a strange family with a reclusive son who's in his thirties, but never leaves the house or says anything to anyone, named Boo Radley.Scout knows her father's a lawyer, and has knowledge of a few things with regards to laws, but she's never really experienced a trial or anything. A third of the way into the book, when you're wondering if it's ever going to really have a plot, kids start to call Scout's father a n----r-lover. Ms. Lee doesn't bother with the hyphens. It turns out that what they're referring to is the fact that Scout's dad, whose name is Atticus Finch, has been assigned to defend a local black man who has been accused of raping a white woman. In Alabama in the 1930's, this is a capitol offense, and he'll surely be executed if he's convicted.So of course there's the obligatory lynch mob (one of the strongest scenes in the book) where Atticus faces down the less-than-brilliant citizens of the town, followed by the courtroom scene that's rather short, given that the trial of course only takes one day. I won't give away the ending, but the author confronts the obvious issues of racism and class in the 1930's south with a great deal more subtlety and nuance than I expected, and the ending, if a bit surprising, is also very satisfying.I do have one negative thing to say about this book: it killed the career of what could have been a great novelist. At least that's my opinion. Most any author wants to think the book they're working on is better than the last one they wrote, and this thing won pretty much every award it could, short of the Nobel Prize for literature. It's one of the best-loved books of the last century. It's my belief that this success was a double-edged sword: on the one hand the acclaim was probably pretty heady, but on the other hand, how do you top something as successful as this? It's almost inevitable that a second book wouldn't win another Pulitzer. Anything less would be a step down.Nevertheless, this is a wonderful book, truly great, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Even in this day and age, this book provides a tremendous opportunity to teach the age-old message of \\"do the right thing\\" and \\"do unto others\\"! Even kids of the current generation ar emoved by this story. Young and old alike will find it a valuable read ( including better_bargains.com who made purchasing this book a nightmare)."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"If you are like me and remember the movie more than the book, or if you read the book long ago, you may not realize how much of the book focuses on Atticus as a parent. He is a great role model as a father, always looking ahead to how what his children do now will shape them in the future. I'm sure this was read as \\"permissiveness\\" at the time, but the wisdom is apparent if you pay attention.The story of Boo frames the story, his continued, protected innocence as Scout and Jem are ushered out of their own innocence by Atticus and by the events of the story.A great book -- deserves all the praise it has gotten."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Recently I discovered a serious gap in my fiction collection, one of the important novels of the last century. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" did indeed live up to its reputation as an outstanding American novel, not afraid to take on an important social issue and showthe nature of the prejudice that had (and still has) infected our country.

I'm 45! So I wanted to so what the big deal was. Normally I wouldn't read this type of book. To me in short it was good. Not fantastic or anything and I probably wouldn't read it again.

Lee takes a small 1930's Alabama town and introduces it to a problem that is very real in todays world. Through the eyes of a young girl, we see how this town deals with racism and the conflicts it brings about. The book tells of how a family's lives are affected by doing what they know is right. Atticus, the towns defense attorney, is chosen to defend Tom, a black man who is falsely accused of raping a white girl. Some of the white folks in town don't agree with Atticus' decision. To Kill a Mockingbird teaches us about values and conscience. How it effects our everyday life and other people. We see how racism effects peoples decisions, in this case, convicting an innocent man. This is a funny, yet thought-provoking story. I really enjoyed reading this."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is much more than an average book. It provokes deep thoughts usually packed away in the deep recesses of your brain. It explores a small Southern town through the eyes of a young girl, something more authors should consider when writin. Because she is so innocent, you get to see how much of a difference the world is when you are a child. You don't know about addicition or racism or corruption, subjects Harper Lee tackles with ease. However, when said subjects are thrust upon you, sometimes it takes a loving father to beak it down to your level. This role is played by Atticus Finch. He is about as wonderful of a character as you can get, with his stern but caring attitude. This book should be commended for its details, never overlooking anything, and its character development. To Kill A Mockingbird is a must-have for anyone."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"like ralph ellison and j.d. salinger, harper lee is known for one book, but what a book! ...the best southern slice of life story you'll ever read...how many other girls have as much wisdom and vision as Scout or are as precocious? ...all of the characters are memorable...when i have kids, i would like to name a daughter after a writer or a book character...scout would be a good choice...of course, atticus' courtroom speech rivals the lawyer's speech in richard wright's &quot;native son&quot; for sheer power and beauty...i have yet to see the film version of &quot;mockingbird. &quot; i hear it's good also... i remember taking this one to work, reading it during breaks and whenever i could steal a moment :-)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"How many people when asked to name their favorite book of all time can pare it down to one? I can, easily. This fine, fine novel is, in fact, degraded by referring to it as a &quot;great book.&quot; It is no less than one of the greatest works of art of the 20th century. To read it is a life changing experience. Considering that I first read it 25 years ago and am now singing its praises via a media that was not yet invented at that time is a testament to this fact. I will not labor to offer a synopsis of the book as these are already offered in abundance. Let me just say that with each subsequent perusal of this book, I am equally delighted and saddened that I am not discovering it for the first time."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee has written something pure magical. Yet every sentence is so natural and naive. When reading To Kill a Mockingbird I just asked myself, &quot;How can someone, having written no other story or novel in her entire life, write something this catching and beautiful?&quot; This is one of the novels I cant put into words what I think of. It's just unbelievable. Father Atticus is a father that you wouldn't believe coulde exist, even in fiction. I dont think anyone can critize this novel, and still those who does, I dont know what crazy motive they have for it. It's simply something that you read and what you've read never escapes you again. And still you read it over and over again, thoroughout your life!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The book To Kill A Mockingbird is a good book! The plot was just about two kids and what happened one summer. I liked the book because Harper Lee did a good job at describing the charaters. My favorite character in the book was Jean Luise Finch (Scout). She did not act like a little girl, she acted like a boy throughout the whole book. Jem was an okay character but he got boring because he grew up and his sister grew up but she still acted like a boy. I recommend this book to everybody because it will hold your attention throughout the whole book. Nothing in the book is worth disliking!!!! To me the book did not have a lesson but to other people it might."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Scout is a vivacios, smart tomboy in a small southern town. There are many subplots in To Kill A Mockingbird, that is one of the reasons it is my absolute favourite book ever. This book makes you feel like you want to be a kid again. Maycomb, the small southern town that Scout and her brother and father live in is divided with racism. The family not racist, and the children learned it from their father, Atticus. Atticus takes on a trial near the end of the book. It is involving a white trash woman who claims that a black man raped her. The case is inevitable-the white woman will win, although the evidence clearly states that this man did not rape her. At the end of the trial(I won't tell you which side wins...) I bawled like a baby. You will feel connected to this book somehow. I have read it 3 times in 4 years."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It's amazing how a book that is this short manages to hit on so many different topics. Set in Alabama in the 1930's, the inequality and bigotry of their small town is seen through the eyes of Scout and Jem Finch children of the town lawyer Atticus Finch. This is a book that every parent needs to read, and have their children read. It brings you back to not only the innocence of childhood, but it will make you remember the moment that you yourself, lost that innocense of your childhood. Told in local dialect it also gives you a glimpse into the charming Southern life that they were leading."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I have read this book twice, first in 8th grade in middle-school, and again last year, when I was a sophmore in high school. I admit that the first time I read it I was a little biased. I didn't understand the meaning of many words, didn't like the vulger language, and found it to be tedious. But after two years I read this book again and now I can forgive myself for my misunderstanding. I was older and more eduacted, so I understood the language better. And I was very quickly captivated by the images of the children. To see young children in their activities, slang conversations, and wild imaginations made the story comical, adoreable, and fun. The book broadens its descriptions and paints a picture of the whole town. Rich details are given of social status, law, eduaction, community, and relations in the town. The time period is the Great Depression and the setting is Alabama, which is a perfect setting indeed! The poverty of the land and pride of the south is so well percieved. Every major and minor character has importance and a well drawn characterization. This book goes into great depth in human nature and behavior. We see the tenderness and kind loving qualities of many people, but then in some people we see aggresion, slothfulness, and extreme prejudice. There are many prejudices in the whole story, which relate to racism, but also judging others by stereotypes. If there was ever such a book that gave the most powerful message on prejudice, this is the book, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. Mockingbirds bring such beauty and joy to the world through their songs and wouldn't it be so harsh to kill one? As a satire on society, a messeage on life, and vision of human beings alike, &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;, is a beautiful story of humor, happiness, sadness, and all emotions. This a must read!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This timeless masterpiece bursts beyond the confines of the printed page, and even beyond the substance of its story. It leaves one breathless with the wonderment of the world seen through a child's eyes, magnified by the adult's realization of what it all means. Harper Lee's sole work (to my knowledge), is in my opinion equal to Huckleberry Finn as the greatest American writing ever."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee has created an deep, provocative novel in To Kill A Mockingbird. She explores various themes in the book through the eyes of a young child, Scout Finch, and in doing so provides often humourous insight. That, along with Harper Lee's masterful use of symbolism and careful storyline structure, easily sets TKAMB apart from ordinary novels. Harper Lee's talent in accurately and disinterestingly exploring the Alabamian society and the prevalent racism of the 1920's shines. This book is highly recommended for those who wish to gain a wider view of aspects of society which still plague us today, such as racial discrimination, racism, prejudice, etc. There may still be hope today."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"My mother first handed me this book when I was thirteen years old, and one day I was bored enough to give it a try, and I am so glad I did.

I give it a perfect 10!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is one of the most popular books of the 20th century: it is in the top three. And with good reason, it is an excellent story, but it is a bit slow-paced. This book describes the trials and tribulations of a young Southern girl and her family during the middle of the century. It is told from the point of view of Jean Finch, whose father Atticus is representing a black man in a rape case. She is threatened and called names, just to name a few, but she never loses hope. It is one of those books that everybody can take something out of, it is an inspiring and invigorating book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I thought this was a pretty good book.

The novel, chock full of human insight, doesn't opt for lies or platitudes. But some schools teach this work as a profound statement on race in the USA. While this may be true, the father's representation of a falsely accused black man despite threats from the white community, while admirable, isn't the key. The key to understanding race in the USA lies in the fact that the author does not imagine in detail the lives of that black man and his family, the real tragedy, the real and profundly distrubing story that this book only mentions in passing. The child narrator loves her father for his principles, but does not begin the fathom the situation of the black man's family. By all means read this book, because it shows that even many decent and well meaning whites do not really understand the lives of American blacks.

I laughed out loud at times, and was touched by the children's relationships with each other and with mysterious neighbor &quot;Boo.&quot;The lessons they all learn during those southern summers -- some very difficult ones -- are tempered by being told through the eyes of a child.

Get-it!, love-it!, and give it to your friends!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In 1957, Harper Lee took her manuscript entitled, Atticus, a story about a southern lawyer who defends an innocent black man accused of rape, to various New York publishers only to be met with rejection after rejection.Three years later after many rewrites, the book retitled, Too Kill a Mockingbird was published to wide acclaim. One of the endearing elements in this work is the marvelous description of a small town in the 1930s during the depression and its people who are viewed through a magnifying glass. Throughout the book, there is a consciousness of how one behaved in a small town back then and the way one behaved was central to who one was.In short, the story is pure truth and the impact of the raw language used as in the case of the \\"N\\" word which was an acceptable way of speaking in those days might give offense to today's readers.The story is told through the eyes of a child, nicknamed Scout who serves as narrator but as an adult looking back. Scout is a girl and a tomboy who speaks with her fists and is curious about the world around her. Her father named Atticus Finch, whom she addresses by his first name, is a soft spoken very dignified attorney who has earned the respect of the town not only by his reputation but also for being kindhearted when he accepts payment from clients in kind as he understands they cannot afford to pay him in cash.The story's structure centers on the town courthouse where Atticus defends Tom Robinson, a black work hand who has been accused of rape by the daughter of his employer. The story is both dramatic and powerful when one considers the courage is took to write what is was like to be in a black person's skin from the point of view of a white person. And the fact that it was published at the beginning of the civil rights movement. There is an understanding of the nature of the harshness of humankind exemplified through legalized segregation which is an amplification of the south in the 1930s without being judgmental about it. We know the injustice that is being created against Tom Robinson as there is no proof that he committed a crime but only the prejudices of the townsfolk that formulate the opinion that he is guilty and seal his fate.There are many characters is this classic story. One in particular is Boo Radley, Scout's next door neighbor whom she has never seen and through invented tales by her friends and neighbors she comes to view Boo as a menacing phantom capable of murder. It is the spreading of rumors about people and the harm it can cause that is also expressed in the story, which unfolds dramatically and brilliantly with Tom Robinson, Atticus, Scout and Boo interwoven.Charles Blanchardauthor of Mourning Doves After The Fire"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is a novel that I have read countless times over the years and it never fails to connect with me on some level with every reading. That is no small feat for a book to accomplish. To speak to people the world over, for over 50 years, means that there is something very universal in this text.We are all the mockingbirds of the title, and anyone who has reached the age of majority knows the feelings that the loss of innocence, and the harsh light of reality can create in a person. Harper Lee wrote a novel that captured the essence of that most universal of experiences, and I for one am moved by it every time.I won't rehash plot points, but I will give you some reasons why you should read, and then reread, this text.The first reason is for the beautiful depiction of imaginative childhood. The narrator, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill embody most of the traits of childhood, and their creative games, and thought processes are a joy to behold. The voice of Scout (the narrator) is a pitch perfect recreation of childhood and childish impulses.Another reason is a pretty simple one actually. The character of Atticus Finch is one of the noblest literary creations ever written. I want to be like him, and there are not many characters in literature I can, or would, say that about. The fact that being like Atticus is possible makes him even more endearing to me. He is someone who is noble in every sense of the word, and serves as an inspiration for so many reasons. He is a good father, a decent and empathetic man, and a person who tries to see the good in almost anything. The fact that there are so few Atticus Finches in real life makes him seem all the more desirable to me. It is very obvious as you read this text that Ms. Lee loves this character.There are numerous other reasons why this is a stellar work of genius, not least of which is the wonderful plotting of the novel, the excellent and fleshed out supporting characters (these people are real to me) and the message that Lee find numerous ways to reiterate throughout the book.Ms. Lee has created a pastoral version of the Depression era south, and even though there is vicious bigotry and hatred depicted in the novel, Ms. Lee (through her characters) does not give up on them, or us. We and the world can be better. We just need to remind ourselves to walk in other people's shoes once in a while."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I am not going to bother reviewing this book. Just read the first page and you are hooked up through the last line. Then you simply savor Harper Lee's beautiful and tragic prose.But why, WHY can I not have this on my Kindle? Third party issue I suppose. Hope Amazon gets it worked out. This is very disappointing..."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"A most thought provoking and relevent theme, given the conflict between ethnic groups and countries around the world today.I love the way the author has woven different ideas and life issues throughout the story, as seen through the innocent eyes of a child, and combined them together to show the reactions of ordinary people to extraordinary events. A must for all young students and should be required reading for all politicians and world leaders around the world. My thanks to Amazon for their prompt and reliable service- I am able to enjoy this book, which was delivered a week before Christmas, through the long, hot summer holidays here in Australia. Keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"What is there to say about this book that hasn't already been said? I mean, it's one of the most critically acclaimed novels of the last fifty years, and is considered a classic of American literature. It's required reading in nearly every high school in America - and at the same time it's a regular guest on the American Library Association's \\"Most Banned Books\\" list.A lot of minds, many better than mine, have turned their thoughts to this book, and have no doubt picked every last shred of meaning, metaphor and symbolism from it. So what's left for me to say about it? Sure, I can talk about how it's a classic coming-of-age tale, about how Scout Finch, a young girl living in a small, insular town in Alabama, saw her world shaped and changed by the goodness and integrity of her father, Atticus. We can look at the family dynamics of the story - a family without a mother, save for the surrogate matriarch roles played first by the maid, Calpurnia, and then by Aunt Alexandria, Atticus' sister. We can analyze how the power in that family structure changes and shifts, and ultimately rests in Atticus' capable hands.Or we can look at the elements of symbolism in the book - the mad dog, foreshadowing the vicious Bob Ewell, whose hatred for Atticus costs him his life. Or the title, as we wonder throughout the book, \\"Who is the mockingbird?\\" Is it a person, even, or could it be something as intangible as Innocence? Of course we find out, in the end - it's the shut-in neighbor, Boo Radley, who must be protected as a mockingbird would be.And who is Boo, anyway? What does he mean to the America of the 1930s, in which the book was set? Or the 1960s, in which it was published? Or the Aughts, in which I'm reading it? Is he a metaphor for America at that time, too consumed by its troubles to venture out, yet willing to protect those it holds dear, an intentional foreshadowing of the Great War that lays only six years in the future? Or is he the ghostly antithesis of Atticus Finch, a man who does the right thing only once in his life, rather than every day?It's also a defense of the American legal system. The trial of Tom Robinson is hopelessly unwinnable, but Atticus knows that it is something to be marveled at that Tom even gets a chance. A thin chance, yes, but in so many other times and places, Tom would have just been killed right on the scene of his alleged crime, and no one would have done anything about it. But in America, the courts are the great levelers. Even a black man, who in that time and that place was a citizen only on sufferance, can still have his day in court. He had very little chance, but with a lawyer like Atticus, who believes wholeheartedly in the purity of Law, he had a better chance than most. \\"Our courts have their faults,\\" he says, \\"as does any human institution, but in this country our courts are the great levellers, and in our courts all men are created equal.\\" Without this system, however, even a man of Atticus' talents and integrity wouldn't have been able to help Tom Robinson.I guarantee - someone, somewhere has thought about all of these things, and has probably written more about them than I ever could. And with more passion and skill. So I'll just write about what the book made me think, and hope I can put that into words that sound good to all of you.I want to be Atticus Finch when I grow up.As much as the book may be narrated by Scout, and Boo Radley haunts it like an unquiet ghost, the story is about Atticus - a good man in a small town who tries to do everything he can to make his part of the world a better place.The central event of this book, which echoes from first page to last, is a trial in which Atticus has to do an impossible thing - defend a black man from charges of raping a white woman. By taking this case, Atticus knowingly risks his reputation, his safety and his life, as well as those of his family. It's hard for us here, in an age when the United States has a black President, to truly understand just how racially broken the country used to be. Not that everything is hunky-dory now - anyone who claims that the election of President Obama somehow solved the problem to race in America has a lot of re-thinking to do. But it was so much worse back then.Atticus Finch is a man with an unshakable moral compass, who knows the difference between right and wrong and how to make sure he does the right thing. He knows that he is a role model not only for his children, but for the people of his town - in several parts of the book, he's likened to a savior.\\"We are so rarely called on to be Christians,\\" says Miss Maudie, a rather progressive neighbor of the Finch's, \\"but when we are, we've got men like Atticus to go for us.\\" He exhorts his children to spend time in another's skin, to really look at the world from their perspective, in order to understand why they do what they do. He values intellect and reason over emotion and fighting, but is not afraid to take action when it's absolutely necessary. He bears an immense responsibility on his shoulders, not only for the people of his town - black and white - but for his family, that he may raise his children to be good people as well.Probably my favorite Atticus moment in the book comes in chapter eleven, with the redemption of Mrs. Dubose. A cantankerous old woman living down the street, Mrs. Dubose is a terror to Scout and her brother Jem. She eventually provokes Jem into a fury, whereupon he destroys her camellias, the punishment for which is that Jem must go to her home and read to her for a month. He does, as he's Atticus' son and therefore keeps his promises, but it's not a pleasant duty. She drifts of into nearly comatose states by the end of their reading sessions, which last longer and longer as what Jem believes must be further punishment for his crime.It is only later, after Mrs. Dubose dies, that Atticus reveals the real reason Jem was sent to go read to her - so he could help her overcome a crippling morphine addiction before she died. She wanted to die free of her burden, and Atticus wanted his son to see what it means to truly be brave. It was important that Jem understand, before the trial got into full swing, that, \\"It's when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.\\" Mrs. Dubose won, thanks to Atticus, and his son learned what it means to be brave.The only real criticism I can think of with regards to Atticus Finch is that he's too good. It's hard to find a flaw in the man, other than his nearly unbending insistence on doing the right thing, even if it should put his family in danger. He's kind of like Superman in that regard - his greatest flaw is his unwillingness to compromise on what is right, even if it hurts those close to him.Of all the flaws one could have, though, that's not too bad.I am reminded that one of the greatest questions of philosophy is \\"Why should we do good?\\" Atticus knows why. Because it's the only thing he can do and still live with himself. He doesn't need to justify what he does to anyone else. He doesn't need to convince anyone that he's doing what is right. He only needs to convince himself. As long has he can look his children in the eyes, he knows that what he's doing is right, and that's all he requires. And perhaps he is an idealist, yes. But he's an idealist who lives up to his ideals, who lives through those ideals every day. He knows that what he does won't necessarily going to change his little town, much less the world, but he does it anyway. Because that's what living a good and honest life means, and that's what I learned from Atticus Finch.What surprises me, honestly, is that this is the only book Harper Lee's written. It's so rich, so gripping, just so damn good that it's hard to believe she never had another story she wanted to tell. Her entry in Wikipedia says that she's written some essays and started a few novels, but never finished them, which saddens me. But then, perhaps some writers have countless stories in them - some of them great, some of them not - and others just have one. And in Lee's case, it was a humdinger.If you're going into high school and you're reading this - you will be required to read this book at some point. I know how irritating it is to be forced to read a book, and I know that anything an adult tells you is good must automatically suck. Nevertheless, I'm going to ask you to trust me on this one and give it a fair shake. There's a lot to learn from this book, and it'll stick with you for years.If you haven't read this one since high school - read it again. It's far better than you remember.--------------------------------------------------------\\"The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.\\"- Atticus Finch, To Kill a Mockingbird--------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life.To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)Harper Lee (Up Close)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"With all the superfluous materials filling bookshelves accross the world, its great to see a work like this celebrated. Timeless classics are called that for a reason, and this one is at the top of my list. This is the only book Harper Lee wrote, as if she collected all her talent and wisdom and poured it into one novel. Telling the story from a little girls point of view, albeit a prodigy of a girl, was a stroke of genious. Reading this book is an enriching experience, not just an entertaining passage of time. If a person had only 5 choices of literature to read, this would have to be one of them. (Add to this The Bible, something from Shakespeare, and 4th and 5th place are tied by a dozen other books:)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is in response to the readers that did not like the quality of the hardcover book. They seemed to feel that a 50th anniversary deserved a slicker presentation.However for me, the book is perfect (story and paper quality). As soon as I opened the box, I felt that I was 9 years old and staring at the bookcase that divided ourliving room from the kitchen. I often spent time searching the bulging shelves for a book to keep me company on the long, hot days in Austin, Texas. I spot a newaddition on the bottom shelf. It's not very impressive in contrast with the picture books of travel and natural wonders that I use as my guide to adventure.The book is small and the colors on the dust jacket are drab. The pages are thick, dull and pulpy; like so many novels were printed on in the 1950's an 1960's.There are absolutely no pictures or photographs in the whole book. This alone usually would have doomed the book. Yet, the Texas weather compels me to find a literarycompanion. Outside no breeze stirs. The air is heavy with moisture. A soft patter of rain falls for several days. The sky is a funny color and there is surelya hurricane somewhere in the Gulf. For three days, I enter the world of Jim and Scout.

Atticus Finch is the father and he is an attorney in the small southern town of Maycomb, Alabama. Atticus has two children; a son named Jeremy age 10 who is nicknamed Jem and a daughter age six named Jean Louise who is called Scout. Jem and Scout's mother died when Scout was only two years old. They have a housekeeper and cook named Calpurnia. The story is narrated by Scout. It tells of their life in Maycomb and about the summer they meet a boy next door staying with his aunt. This boy is 7 years old and is named Dill. The children quickly become friends and spend most of their time together playing. There is an obsession with the children of a nearby neighbor named Boo Radley. Legend said that Boo had done bad things as a child and had stabbed his father in the leg with a pair of scissors at one point. Many people have never seen Boo, including Jem, Scout and Dill. They spent time thinking about how they can get Boo to come out of his house.A big portion of the book tells about a trial that is going on in town of a very kind African American man named Tom Robinson who is charged with beating and raping Mayella Ewell. Atticus is appointed Tom's attorney. Mayella Ewell comes from a very poor uneducated white family in town. This book takes place in the 1940's when there was much racial tension in the south. Many people in town felt that Tom Robinson was guilty before he was even tried for the crime.I enjoyed this story very much. It was interesting that it was narrated by a child. Jem and Scout were obviously very close to their father. They greatly admired him and respected him as did most people in the small community of Maycomb. This story keeps your interest with the trial and also things that happen to the Finch children. I highly recommend this book as it is easy to read and understand."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I liked the book because it dealt with racism.

To me, this book shows the problems that prejudice and hatred causes as well as the effects these problems have on children. The most touching part of the story was when Scout and Dill cried about what they had seen. As they watched the verdict, it showed them how unfair the justice system was at this time in history.

Of all of these, Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is the one that I would save if the house was on fire. This is THE book that reminds me why books are written--not merely to tell an entertaining story, but to encourage the reader to see the world through the eyes of someone else. The story is probably the best teacher of the ugliness of racisim--in a very quiet and yet powerful way. The real power of the story for me, however, is the bond that I feel with Scout each time I read the book. Like Scout, I too equate reading and breathing, and believe that the school system should have held more than several years of boredom. I cannot praise this book enough. If there was an Atticus Finch/Boo Radley fan club, I would hope to be the president (or at least the club historian.) Please read this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It is easy to see why \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" has become a classic and a winner of the Pulitzer Prize. After editorial reviews and 1535 readers' reviews, it is not necesaary to repeat an in-depth outline of the story for the 1536th time to get the message across - \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a one of a kind treasure.The characters and plot are among the best developed in literary history. Set in the Depression Era, the plot revolves around the alleged rape of a white girl, Mayella Ewell. The story brings with it racial issues, tension, heartbreak and a search for justice. My favourite characters were Boo Radley, the town bogeyman, Tom Robinson, the accused, and of course, the hero in this story, Atticus, a man of honour and dignity who is not afraid to stand up for what he believes is right.If by chance you are one of those who have not read this book, take the opportunity to do so. It ranks at the top of all-time classics, along with \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\""},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It's been said so many times that Harper Lee only wrote one book, but I can't imagine what you'd do if you wrote a masterpiece like this for your first book. How would you follow it up?There is just so much about this book that is good, I want to leave it to the reader to just open it up and get through that first chapter. Then you'll be hooked on reading forever."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD explores the injustice of racism in the small, sleepy town of Maycomb, Alabama. Lee's novel is narrated through the eyes of 8 year-old wise-beyond-her-years Scout Finch, a keen and extraordinarily observant child.The horizons of TO KILL... don't end at the explorations and explanations of racism in the South. Other themes include growing up and emotions involved, how people avoid what they do not understand, and friendships - how they evolve and blossom. One of Scout's close friends is dimunitive Dill, a \\"Beautiful Child\\" contest winner (a.k.a. Charles Baker Harris) who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt over the summers. Compelled by mere curiosity, together, he and Scout plot to lure hermit and town bogeyman Boo Radley out into the open. Peculiar myths and legends surround his very existence, courtesy of the gossip mongers of Maycomb.Lee demonstrates the true ugliness of racism. Racism, we see, is what causes a small Southern town to do a complete turn around. Scout, with the innocent heart of a child, balances out the misunderstandings. Atticus Finch, Scout's father, who is always known as \\"Atticus,\\" is chosen to represent a black man who supposedly raped Mayella Ewell, a white farmer's daughter. This is truly what opens the reader's eyes to the evils of the town. Despite this, Scout Finch still adamantly believes that people are essentially good overall, \\"once you get to see them.\\" Obviously, this isn't all true - Scout is mind-blowingly bright yet still exhibits realistic childlike qualities, her naivete being one of them.Atticus can truly be regarded for his extreme heroism. Despite a cruel and uncaring town, he stood up for what he believed in, what he knew in his heart was right. He's possesses great wisdom, a heart of gold, great understanding, and considerable kindness. He treats his children, Jem and Scout, like they are mature adults. This is probably one of the main reasons why Scout is so keenly and constantly aware of her surroundings, as well as a reason for her innate intellect.One of the best plot twists in TO KILL... involves a newfound hero that neither Jem and Scout, nor the reader, could have ever predicted would be so brazen and courageous. Boo Radley is one of the novel's pivotal characters, yet he doesn't appear all that much in the story. When Scout and company first discuss him and his myths, they speak of him as if he's some kind of hideous monster. In reality, he is as kind and caring as Atticus and has just as much hero potential, which finally rises to the surface towards the end of the novel for the reader (and Harper's characters) to see.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is laced with humor, yet it finds a comfortable balance between being both comedic and serious in the subject matter Harper chose to tackle. It also manages to be sentimental and heartbreaking, yet never even comes close to being borderline mushy and overly sappy. It's an inspirational tale regarded by generation after generation as a classic - a tale of respect for all human life in a society in which incessant misunderstandings are present within its people. Look at the world we live in today. Consider the mindset of various individuals and groups. I ask you, what person can't relate to this enlightening, eye-opening book?"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The world of the 1930's southern culture is revealed to us in To Kill a Mockingbird, as seen through the eyes of a young girl named Jean Louis Finch, known as Scout. This book tells the story about Scout and her brother Jem learning lessons about compassion and fairness. Prejudice is the main theme of this book. Atticus Finch, the father of Scout, the story's narrator, is a lawyer assigned to defend a black man falsely accused of rape. Atticus is a tolerant man who has raised his children to do their best to consider all points of view. Over the span of three years, Scout, gives us a first-hand view of how the townspeople in Maycomb, Alabama behave toward people of different races and classes in the town. Scout's experiences with the people of Maycomb teach her to consider their points of view in addition to her own. At her young age she begins to understand the daily life of many of Maycomb's residents backgrounds better than most of the adults. When she confronts Mr. Cunningham and the other men at the jail, she is able to reach them by showing their connections to each other. Scout tells the story in her own words, but her analysis of the people and their actions are with the point of view of an adult. She understands what the sheriff is doing when he declares that Bob Ewell has fallen on his own knife, and she also realizes that Boo has been their unseen friend and protector throughout, and should be treated respectfully. Harper Lee does a good job portraying prejudices in the post depression South. It is a novel worth reading again and again."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"What can be said about a book that covers so many bases? To Kill a Mockingbird is the tale of two children, Jem and Scout growing up in a rural Georgia town. Their father, Atticus Finch, is a kind, just socially responsible man who takes on a case in which a black man is accused of raping a poor white girl. Since the book is set in the south in the 1930's, the defending of a black man against a white woman is unheard of, but Atticus takes the case pro bono because of every man's unalienable rights, and because of the fact that his defendant is not guilty, a fact which is hushed up and covered over by bigotry and hate in this small southern town. The novel makes a stand on basic human rights while covering so much other territory. The antics of Jem and Scout perfectly capture what it is like to be a child during the summer, despite the fact that these summers take place in the charged atmosphere of a racist southern town where both Jem and Scout are forced to do some growing up. The mysterious character of Boo Radley points out once again that a person's appearance and reputation mean nothing when it comes to their character. There is so much packed into this one little novel that it the one-hundredth reading would still be a fresh as the first. Every scene, from Scout's first day at school to the night outside the city jail where a lynch mob threatens Atticus and his client are drawn with amazing skill and beauty. This book is an American treasure and Atticus Finch is one of the greatest characters ever to appear in literature. The only real question this book leaves you with is why didn't Harper Lee ever take up his pen to create another novel?"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In my Junior English class this year I was forced to read this Pulitzer Prize - winning novel. First, what was the PP committee thinking? Yes it was 1961, yes it was the Civil Rights Movement, yes a lot of people used WAY too much pot, but none of those arguments can explain why this obvious, saccharine mockery of a novel won anything, including publication rights. I kept thinking that &quot;it has to get better&quot;, but it DOESN'T! The characters are flat and cariacatured - everyone does exactly what a Disney-style movie would like them to do. Because of this, there is no real definition to the characters and you can't care about them - believe me, I tried - under threat of death by English teacher. Also the symbolism is blatant beyond belief. She actually tells you directly what the symbols are and what they mean - defeating the whole purpose. As bad as the first 28 or so chapters are, they are no comparison with the last 3. I have seen and read many bad endings, but this made me throw the book across the room in anger. If you've ever watched any of the ... movies or most any other kids movie (see the unending series of sports animal ones), you will have a rough idea of the sappiness and predictability of this conclusion. For a high school kid, I consider myself pretty well read, and this novel hits a new low in any genre. Kids, if your teacher pushes this on you, just remember what they taught you in DARE - &quot;Just Say No&quot;! If you (any age) are considering this book, consider yourself warned - I couldn't be paid to read even one chapter again. But if you REALLY like those dopey kids' movies your 3-year-old watches, this is the book for you. Immerse yourself in the sugar of it all."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Now I'm not one of those negative people that go around bashing everything just for the pleasure of making everyone else miserable, so please do not make that assumption. I was made to read this book for and English class and I absolutely hated it! I'm not rascist at all, so don't make that assumption either. The whole time I was reading this I kept thinking how much this whole thing sounds like it was written by a 5th grader! Not just when the kids were speaking either. The writing style overall just seemed very juvenile to me. This &quot;great American classic&quot; just seemed to be replaying the old boring rascism vs. humanity theme that we've all seen time and time and time again. But this time it just has an even dumber ending! Everyone says how &quot;deep&quot; this novel is and how much thought it takes to really know and love the story. When actually, there are only a few tiny little moments when you have to know on your own what's really going on and decide for yourself. The plot goes absolutely nowhere! Yes a few things change, but by the end of the story, basiclly the same thing is happening that was happening when the story first begins! This novel was BORING! Not because I don't understand it, but because it has a lack of any real depth to it at all.

I have read other books Anna Karenina of my own accord and loved them, and I am not criticizing this book because of bitterness of being forced to. I actually had not heard much about To Kill a Mockingbird before I read it, due to the fact that I tend to read nineteenth century literature, and I started this book with a fairly open mind. As cliche as this story is, I thought that the plot had great potential for making a powerful book, but Harper Lee's approach to writing it seemed a mismatch. The powerful theme served merely as a backdrop to a far less interesting story. There are points at which one can fairly hear the plot wheezing as it is being choked by Lee's attempts at cuteness and nostalgia. The descriptive passages were rather crude, and at times the language became practically unintelligable. Am I the only person who despises dialect? There are two things I thought of that can affect the way people criticize this book. One of these is fear of disliking a book at the risk of being labeled a Philistine. The other of these is which books are read immediately before reading a book. The latter affected me in particular, as I was reading Madame Bovary alongside this book. The lack of any elegance and refinement, which is so abundant in Madame Bovary, made the primitive style of the writing even more displeasing."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is lacking creativity of chacters and of imagination of plot.Harper Lee has written a 281 page documentory of nothing.

It is is an American classic simply because America felt the need to call a book about itself a classic, and this happened along, blindly, stupidly, to be that book. From a technical standpoint, there's nothing wrong--Lee writes coherently, and although her book shifts topic suddenly, without cause or warning, she tends to stay on topic. There are so many American writers that came shortly before Lee or were actually contemporaries of her that do not get recognition despite their far superior work. Henry Miller offered a REAL view of America, ugliness and all, and it wasn't what Americans were looking for, to the point that they banned his writing. Someone should ban Lee's book because we tell our students that this is an ideal of literature whereas it is really just a regular old novel, like anything else the paperback racks had to offer at the time. There was nothing great here. I could write a novel that had notecard characters--even the narrator seemed a little hollow, and Boo Radley was just deus ex machina with a clever, sleepy-southern-town name--and no one would care.

All living beings have the same value, all life is inherently unique. The author posits that the mockingbird does no harm, but the insects it eats would say otherwise. The mockingbird is just as base, just as feral as a tiger.The novel. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is certainly a regional tale and yet it is entirely transposed and made unique. The fundamental flaw of the work is patriarch, Atticus Finch. Behold the savior of the down trodden race, raise him high and everlasting, let his name be known across the dark land.The land is dark because Atticus overshadows it, his skills as a lawyer of more import than the man he defends.

If Boo actually was the killer it should have been clearer to the reader instead of making the reader play a guessing game."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"If you think that the title and the star rating don't go well together, keep on reading...To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel set in Alabama during the late 1930s. The novel has a first-person narrator who is a girl named Scout. The novel has two parts: Part 1 and Part 2.In Part 1, Scout describes her ancestors, family at the time of the novel's setting, neighbors, early years in school, interactions with neighbors, and experiences with her brother Jem and her father Atticus.In Part 2, a black man is accused of a serious crime and declared guilty by a white jury even though there did not appear to be any sound evidence that he was guilty. Atticus was the defendant's defense lawyer. I will not say what happens after this in case you want the climax to be a surprise.Now, let's compare the two sections. Atticus denounces racism in both sections, and there are examples of racism in both sections. However, most of the characters mentioned in Part 1 do not have any involvement in the trial that I mentioned earlier, which I think is a key element of not only Part 2, but the entire novel. In Part 1, there was one particular character that got a few too many pages focused on her.. especially when taken into consideration that she died before Part 2 (the \\"important part\\").Here is another problem: The novel is told from a child's perspective. Indeed, I did noticed well-presented character development in Scout's personality, but it's all about Scout. Everybody else is static. It is true that children have limited perception of adults, so the static presentation of the adult characters is definately realistic. However, this is not a \\"children's book;\\" there clearly are mature subject matters. The target audience would have to be teenagers or adults. With that in mind, the static presentation of adults does not correspond with the target audience.Nontheless, my views of this novel are in a minority category. This book is a classic, and I can understand why. The author has an impressive understanding of the time and place in which this book is set. However, that does not mean that the book is a good NOVEL! A detailed setting is enough for expository text, but a NOVEL must take advantage of the elements of FICTION. When I said elements of FICTION, I meant a detailed, consistent plot, well-rounded characters, a broad range of perspectives, variation (but connections) in subject matter (all of which relates to the ENTIRE PLOT), a lot of characters that influence the outcome of the plot in their own, unique way, and so forth. To Kill a Mockingbird does not take advantage of the elements that NOVELS have to offer, and NOVELS can offer more than just a detailed setting. For this reason, I am going to give this novel a one star rating.I also want to comment on the offensive language (mostly rude racial slurs). Yes, yes, I know, the language was realistic, and I am not trying to say that it makes the book innapropriate to read. However, realism does not eliminate the ability to offend people. Whether or not the language is a problem for you is not my decision to make, but just take this paragraph as a caution.Now, as for the title of this review, the book did enhance my imagination. It inspired me to imagine... criticims."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It was the worst book I have ever read.

What else could she do after this?"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee. This classic book is about a little Southern girl Scout and her experiences growing up in the 1930's. It begins with a set up of things to come,such as Scout's experiences and the people she observes. Her guardians, her quiet, lovable lawyer father Atticus, and her Negro cook Cal help Scout and her tough,yet caring brother Jem through these experiences in Maycomb County, Alabama. Scout, Jem and their curious friend Dill make up plays about their reclusive and mysterious next door neighbor Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radley. He is the cause of scare and mystery and their lives. This sets up the ending, as does the racism of the town, shown by the neighborhood gossip, the piggish lazy Mr. Ewell, Scout's strict Aunt and the tyrant down the street Old Mrs. Dubose. The children learn many things about the town in which they live from their neighbor, sweet, tough Miss Maudie. One thing they learn is that they should never kill a mockingbird because those birds are just there to make people happy and they never do anything wrong at all. In the second half the children learn more about their father's trial defending a Negro being tried for rape. This man Tom Robinson is going against the lowlife Mr. Ewell who says Tom raped his daughter. The citizens are against Tom for the most part except for a handful. In the courtroom Atticus makes his case so strong that Scout, Jem, and Dill(who are watching)think that he cannot lose. However it is a white man's word against a black man's... The rest you have to read for yourself because from the trial it grows into such an exciting climax, and ends so meaningfully, pretaining to why you should never kill a mockingbird. Definitely think about this quote reading the book, it helps your understanding a lot. I found I couldn't put it down. The beginning goes slow but it forshadows things to come. You think how unfair and unpleasant life can be sometimes and these children learn this at a very young age. It made me want to change thingsso it couldn't happen anymore, and it made me very angry at such unfairness, such as in the lives of African-Americans, like the innocent Tom Robinson. The ending was so perfectly lead to and meaningful that I had to go back and read it again(and again)! I recommend the book for people 14 and up because I feel you should be old and smart enough to grasp the conflicts and the complex plot. However this book is timeless and everyone above 14 should read it at least once in a lifetime. This can teach you about life and growing up better than anything you will ever read so pick it up...soon."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I thought that this book overall, was a good one. I found several things that i didn't like though. The first was that I thought it had a slow beginning. I found it hard to get into. Harper Lee explained each of the characters and made a setting, but it was boring. Second was I felt it could have been shorter, but was dragged out a little. You knew what was going to happen, or the outcome of a situation, but you had to wait several pages. And last, I didn't understand Dill really fit into the story. I thought he was a wasted character. I don't mean that I didn't like the little love story between him and Jean Louise, but it wasn't of major importance. I also realized how he brought about the intrest in Boo Radley, but that could have been done without him. There were many good things though. For example, the racial hatred was true to the time and the area. I felt it was portrayed VERY well, even the children could see the racism. For example, Jem states, &quot;...but around here once you have a drop of Negro blood, that makes you all black.&quot; I also liked how the story was told through the little girl's perspective. She had good insight, but left things for you, the reader, to figure out. She told things in an innocent way and made you think and look at things from other people's perspective. For instance, Atticus says, &quot;You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view.&quot; Third I enjoyed how the story tied the two tales of Boo Radley and Tom Robinson together. While I was reading, I noticed how they left Boo out of the story line for a while. I wondered why, but at the end, making him the hero really made a great ending! Finally, I liked how it showed that there are good and bad people of every race. Mr. Ewell had wanted fame, but Atticus knew better, and put him to shame. Mr. Ewell took revenge by hurting Jem and Scout, but in the end he hurt himself the most. The supposed &quot;bad&quot; African American man, Tom Robinson, was not guilty in my eyes, but had to pay. He was only trying to help, and ended up getting &quot;shot down!&quot; The world can be twisted at times. This book was written for people of all ages and from every background. It sends so many great messages from stand up for yourself, to seeing other peoples' point of view before making an opinion, to noticing what's on the inside not just on the outside. People can be so cruel sometimes and not even realize it. I feel that this book should be read and respected by all."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I think that the book To Kill A Mockingbird was a very well-written, and exciting book. I must admit though, that at the beginning of the story, I found it hard to pay attention to the plot. The first few chapters explain the main characters and their backgrounds so the story is slow at the beginning. You will begin to get into the book a few chapters later. That is when the pace of the book picks up and new characters, places, and events get brought into the story. Part Two is very exciting. The story really begins to heat up and get interesting. Once you start to read, you can't put the book down. I found the book to be very interesting. As a matter of fact, it is one of the best books I have ever read! To Kill A Mockingbird is told from the point of view of Scout Finch, a young girl growing up in the town of Maycomb with her older brother Jem and her father Atticus. Atticus is a lawyer who defended Negroes, which caused some events to arise throughout the story. This story shows how they all grow together and how the people of Maycomb live and grow together as well. The Finch's encounter many hardships, the Tom Robinson case being the biggest of all, but with ecah other they are able to overcome anythng thrown at them. This story shows the true value of the meaning of a strong, loving and caring family. It is no wonder that To Kill A Mockingbird is known as a timeless classic. The author, Harper Lee, shows her skill of writing by taking a simple family like the Finch's, and an ordinary town like Maycomb, and turning them into an unforgettable masterpiece. Harper Lee takes realistic facts about the relationships between black people and white people and it illustrates it through the characters in the story by using her talent of writing and explanation. To wrap things up, I believe that if you love to sit down and read a good book, To Kill A Mockingbird is the book for you. I do suggest though that if you intend on reading this book, that you are in the age area of fourteen and older, for this book can be complicated in many areas due to the elaborate plot. I can honestly say that I am not big into reading books, but To Kill A Mockingbird is like no other book I have ever read. I recommend it greatly.

At the begining of this book I thought that I wasn't going to like it but once it got to the trial of Tom Robinson, I found it very interesting. I agree with what everyone said in the book about Atticus being the only person that could give question that Tom Robinson wasn't guilty. I thought that Atticus was definately an excellent father and almost just as good as a mother to Jem and Scout. I feel like this book really explained what was going on during this time, especially when Aunt Alexandra had all the women over there house for there church meeting. I do not know how Scout sat there listening to everyone disgracing the person her father was representing. My favorite character in the book was Dill. I thought that he was so adorable and there was something mysterious in him that I liked. In a brief summary this is what the book was about. Jean Louise Finch is the narrator of the story and she is describing the events of her childhood before she was 10. She lived in her house with her father Atticus, her brother Jeremy Atticus Finch, and there black maid Calpurnia. When the story starts it is summertime and they meet there childhood friend that comes down every summer, Dill. The children all summer are fascinated by Arthur (Boo) Radley by the end of the book they meet him and become frinds with him. Next, Scout started school and there was problems in the begining but then she started liking it. Next in the story we meet Atticus's family and another summer comes and goes with Dill. Then the trial came and all of Maycomb County was there. Mr. Ewell (the lowest family, under blacks, and he was white, in Maycomb Coutny) accused Tom Robinson(he was black) of raping his daughter Mayells. Atticus was appointed lawyer and he put up a good fight for Tom, but since he was black he was proven guilty. During this time Scout and Jem were getting made fun of by kids at school and even their own cousins. Tom Robinson was sent to jail, Atticus thought they had a chance but Tom couldn't take the stress anymore, he tried esaping jail and he got shot 17 times. During the trial Aunt Alexandra had came down to take care of Jem and Scout and to teach Scout how to become a proper girl and not a tomboy. The end of the story is my favorite and you will have to read it to see why I think it is, and when you do I think you would agree. The only complaint I have to say about the end of the story is that I thought that the book should have had a little more closure to it. I like closure to stories.

At first, he started slow, introducing characters and telling stories about their past. When he got going, however, the book got very interesting. There was a trial involving a black man with one of the main characters as his lawyer. Of course, it was not a good thing at this time for a white man to be defending a black man in a trial. The trial becomes very exciting and brought the book to a great ending. As for the title, Atticus, the person who defended the man in the trial, told his children that you shouldn't kill a mockingbird because all they do is sing and provide entertainment for people. This quote tied in to the trial very well and made the book very effective. In conclusion, I do not reccomend this book for anybody under the age of fourteen."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The book &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; was mainly about two kids named Jem and Scout. It's about the adventures that they have and what they went through. Their father was a lawyer. Peope in Jem and Scout's town accused a black man named Mr.Ewell of raping a little white girl. Jem and Scout don't think that he did it but the people in the town did. Their father defended Mr.Ewell. This book teaches about how some people can be so prejudice against inncocent people just because of their race.

As she is coming of age she deals with things like being lady, racial issues, and hate crimes. Although the last two usually come hand and hand. The book is mostly about Scout growing up and that there is a trial that is judge by the jury more by race the evidence. Scout her brother Jem separately deal with the outcome of the trial.I was surprised at how much I did enjoy this. Years ago it was assigned to our English class and I hate reading for school.

I don't see how anyone could not recommend this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I am sure others have said it more eloquently than I can hope to accomplish, but when I love a book this much I can not help but try to say why. Everyone loves different books for different reasons, and I loved this one because of the way it places you in a child's mind. A child who's mind is being stretched by the things going on around her, a mind that is struggling to make sense of the world. How on earth does Harper Lee capture us with a story about a lazy small town? How does she fascinate us with the everyday? I think that the voice that tells her story is the magic key. Scout doesn't have any prejudices yet; she is being molded by those around her. She argues with them and puzzles about them and finally makes up her mind about them. She carefully watches all that is happening, and though she only discerns half of it, the older reader can pick up on all the rest. Sometimes, though, Scout is the wiser. She reaches straight through to ways of seeing things we would have never found, and says things we never would have dared to say, because we understand all the implications, but she does not.I was reluctant to read this book, I must admit. I mean, the title doesn't sound all that appealing, even if you know it isn't really about killing mockingbirds. In fact, I think that made it even worse, because then I asked, \\"Well then, what is it about?\\" and the back of the book (I have the Warner Books edition) didn't tell me much, and all my Mom said was, \\"It's about prejudices in the south.\\" Well, I felt I had already read enough about that, but the more books I read with that all-encompassing description, the more I find that there is more to that topic than I ever imagined. We are a very diverse people, on this planet, and we all seem to have a different way of looking at things, a different way of saying things, a different community of thought that shapes us. For another thing, this book is about more than one kind of prejudice, so even if, after that, you still feel that you have read plenty of material on black discrimination, that's still no excuse to not read this book. History books tell you the story from the point of politicians. This tells you the story from the point of the people who lived during that time in their own small town, only distantly affected by those all-important matters. It tells you what people thought back then, which is every bit as important, I believe, as the events themselves.I can understand the vague descriptions on the book covers. I'm not sure that I could do better. I also understand why everyone says you should read it, and I heartily agree with them. You really should not miss out on this one. I don't think you need a big study guide to accompany it; if the author thought it needed that, she would have written one herself. Just sit down in a comfortable spot and read it. That's what Lee intended. That's how you'll enjoy it the most. When you're done, see if your view of things hasn't changed just a little bit. Maybe you'll smile every time you see a mockingbird. Maybe you'll stop and think every time too. That's what I do. I hope you do too."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This was a required reading when I was in school.

This book is required reading in so many high schools that reviewing seems redundant.Yeah, it's as good as good gets. An influence to artists of many generations."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The story \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\" is basically a story about the way of life in a time of suspicion, hatred, poverty, and ignorance. It's about the effect of racism has on a small town from a child's point of view. The town is called Maycomb with \\"grass that grows as tall as a person, roads of dirt, and children with none, sometimes or disgusting eating habits.\\" The main characters are Atticus, Boo Radly, Scout, Jim and Dill. I liked Boo Radly. He stayed hidden for many years. I don't know if he really did, what the town said he did; that he stabbed his father in the leg with scissors and then pulled it out. Boo placed wax dolls and food in the hollow tree and in exchange received candy from Scout, Jem, and Dill. Atticus the father of the children heads into a major problem as a lawyer defending Tom Robinson who is accused of assault and rape on a town woman. The children had many difficulties dealing with Ms. Doubtly's craziness from drug use. Seeing their dad being ridiculed by the town as he was trying to achieve justice for Tom Robinson also made their lives more complex.The characters I could relate to were Atticus, Scout, Boo Radly, and Dill. Boo Radly reminded me of events in my life when I was not wanted in places like school and church, Where Boo was stuck in a hole, I felt I was stuck somewhere as well. Just as Atticus stands up for human rights and believes in himself, I stand up for my rights as well as the rights of my friends. Dill is a character that has a wild imagination just like I find myself having a wide variety of ideas.My favorite part of the book is when Boo Radly saved Scout and Jem from Bob Edwell. As well, I thoroughly enjoyed the part where Bob Edwell is twisted crimes were exposed and he was killed accidentally.For the educational and symbolic idealism the book deserves a medal. The book exposes and illustrates hard reality in a time when people were racist. My least favorite part of the book was when Tom Robinson was killed because he was killed by hate. It was as if he was going to die anyway whether a public execution or not. From a student's point of view, I would change the use of the n word so readers don't have to see it.I would recommend this book to as an insight and perspective on history. The type of person who would like this book would be a person who enjoys reading history, a suspenseful novel, or a person who likes to read about problems in the past."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is a timeless classic. It shows how brutal people can be given their surroundings. When three children experience the depths of prejudice, they realize how cruel and closed minded people can be. A great read.The reason I didn't give this book a fifth star was because of the poor ending. It was too ... unreal and the final pages didn't show the depths of the story and didn't give a very nice closure. I could predict the last chapter from the very beginning.Overall, pretty good. Lots of symbolism and depth."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This was a magnificent book told from the viewpoint of the little girl of a white family.

I recommend this title to anyone."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, is truly a classic book in the history of American literature, and will always be a favorite book of mine. The book tells the story of Jean-Louise (known as Scout) Finch, a young girl who learns very valuable lessons beginning at the tender age of six. Most of her time is spent with her older brother Jem and Dill, a boy about Scouts age who visits every summer.As the book begins, the reader discovers that Atticus Finch, the father of Scout, is an attorney who is about to tengo with an extremely controversial case. Tom Robinson, an African American who had respect for anyone and everyone, was accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a poor white girl who also happens to be the daughter of Bob Ewell, a low life racist who was out to get any negro he could. Although all evidence is circumstantial, and although Mr. Atticus Finch did such a good job representing Tom that we could all be sure he was innocent, Mr. Robinson was found guilty of rape. While in jail, Tom makes a fatal mistake and attempts to escape from prison. As he tries to climb the fence, Tom is shot seventeen times and his life was put to end.Even though the case was a major part of the story, many other adventures occur during the course of the book. To find out what these other adventures are, your just going to have to read it for yourself!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I wanted to read thsi book because it is said to be in top 100 best books.

Many people, including myself, are required to read this book in high school. I normally HATED all of the books that were required. I went in with this attitude when first reading the book, but I actually found it interesting. It introduces racism from that time period, through the eyes of a child. Because it was a little easier to read than most required books, I really enjoyed it. I even read this book a second time in the same year, which I never do, especially with required books. I came from a conservative home and this book brought to light some of the issues that even occur today with racism, just not as harsh. I believe the harshness of the book opens many people's eyes to what occurred during that time period. If I ever have the time to, I would read this book again and again."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I so enjoyed reading this. I had never read it and I am so glad that I read it now, as a parent. I am finding that parenthood helps me to drink deeply fine literature and read things with more appreciation.

It has been over twenty years since I had read Harper Lee's classic and only novel. The small, Alabama town of Maycomb is in the grips of the Great Depression. Jim Crow is alive and well doing its worse by oppressing African-Americans. The story is seen through the eyes of tomboy Scout Finch. It highlights her growth from a six-to-nine-year-old girl. Ms. Lee created a protagonist who still had a child's innocence about the world around her. She isn't just confused about the illogical nature of prejudice but also by many of the social norms of small town America. Scout's dad, the now iconic Atticus Finch, is a poor, 50ish, intelligent lawyer of reason and high morals struggling to raise his daughter and their 13-year-old son Jem. He fortunately has the help of an intelligent black maid named Calpurnia. The climax of the story finds Atticus defending Tom Robinson, an African-American accused of assaulting a white woman.Ms. Lee, who was born in Alabama, clearly expresses her disdain for many of the South's cultural mores. The story not only shows the actual manner in which blacks were treated, but ridicules the Southern obsession with family lineage and how your place in society is based purely on which hoo hoo you popped out of during birth. The story has some wonderfully colorful and highly believable characters. It harkens back to a tougher, simpler time and how most of these folks tried to live god-fearing, decent lives, but don't have the intelligence or courage to treat blacks as human beings; let alone equals. The N-word is appropriately used quite frequently in the book due to the nature of the times and location of the novel.Ms. Lee's book is a well-written story that deserves its wide readership. It is also still very relevant in 2012. It would've been inconceivable to 1930 Southerners that less than eighty years later an African-American would be elected President of the United States. The reelection of President Obama just occurred two days ago and some of the very vulgar stereotypes expressed about him (especially on such mediums as Twitter) shows racism is still very much alive and well throughout America. Prejudice manifests itself in many ways. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" humanizes the destructive nature that prejudice causes to the victims, perpetrators and bystanders. A great, sometimes funny, suspenseful work of art that challenges readers to look at themselves in the mirror."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"If you only read one book this year, read this one. It's a timeless classic about doing what is right, vs doing what is easy. Each time I read it I find something new. Atticus Finch is a true hero. Wish this was available for Kindles - my paperback copy is held together with a rubber band."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This audio version of To Kill a Mockingbird featuring Sissy Spacek reading this classic is a must have. Especially if you drive often, or have a long commute to and from work. Sissy's southern roots give life to this story of a young six-year-old girl living in 1932 small town in Alabama. This was simply how it was back in those days. Even if you have read the book, I recommend getting this audio version; it's a whole deferent view of this classic masterpiece"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I never had to read this book in high school, which I now think is unfortunate. I've been meaning to read it for years but never got around to it. Well, now I have and I'm glad I did. The story is beautifully told in an odd, rambling style I found interesting. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. Little Scout's adventures with her brother and their friend Dill are charming and child-like, and as the story progresses, she learns a lot about life--sometimes too much. I think everyone should read this and learn right along with her."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was assigned this book in a Political Science class (yes political science) and assigned to write a paper on the social change that occurs from the verdict. While I was supposed to read it in high school, I maybe read the first chapter and used Sparknotes the rest of the way. However, I am truly thankful that my professor assigned this book again because I absolutely loved it. The story, symbolism, and literary devices are all there and it is truly captivating. I can't say that I've ever been so hooked to a book considering I read it faster than most books. I think the older you get, the better the book gets and despite it taking place around the depression era, the story is still a good one and a significant reminder of our past. I will say, I think it does no justice to the book to have high school students read it because like Atticus might say, they are too young to understand."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I may be the only American under 60 who graduated from high school without having read Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" I'd heard about it, of course; I knew there were characters named Atticus Finch and Scout (a girl), and that there was a trial involving racism. Unlike so many other classics I haven't yet read, however, this one was never \\"spoiled\\" for me, so when I sat down earlier this week to patch up the gap in my reading, I was coming to it as nearly fresh as possible, with only the vaguest idea what I had to look forward to.As the novel opens, the narrator, Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, professes to tell the reader how her older brother Jem came to break his arm at the elbow years before. It's a long story, and by the time the unfortunate young man suffers his injury over 250 pages later, not only Jem's arm but the complacency of a small Southern town will be shattered. The first quarter of the novel offers little hint of the drama that is to unfold; the plucky and precocious Scout, growing up in the early 1930s in Maycomb, Alabama, seems to have only the typical concerns of childhood to ruffle her otherwise tranquil existence: well-meaning but clueless teachers, her brother's occasional bouts of pubescent moodiness, neighbors and relatives who scoff at her tomboyish ways. Scout enjoys reading with her lawyer father, Atticus; spending time in the kitchen with her family's black cook, Calpurnia; and visiting Miss Maudie, an amiable neighbor. She, Jem, and their friend Dill, who comes to Maycomb every summer to stay with his aunt, enjoy acting out stories from their favorite books and attempting to coax their enigmatic, reclusive neighbor Boo Radley out of his house. Everything changes, however, when Atticus is assigned to defend Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman, and accepts this assignment with diligence and zeal. Suddenly Atticus becomes an icon of his town's hopes and a target for its hatreds - and inevitably, his family gets caught up in the mounting storm.\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is simply wonderful, in every way a novel can be. Scout is a lovable character, whose equal parts innocence and precocity make her the perfect narrator for a story a more mature character might have been too world-weary to tell with such honesty. Atticus is one of the greatest heroes in fiction, yet there is nothing effortless about his integrity, and he never comes across as self-righteous or too good to be true. This novel is ethical and wise without ever becoming preachy, suspenseful and dramatic without ever becoming sensational, humorous without becoming silly, realistic without becoming cynical, uplifting without the slightest hint of sentimentality. In a day when \\"moral ambiguity\\" in literature so often means the absence of any real concept of good or evil, and \\"social justice\\" too often means seeing the world in (sometimes literal) shades of black and white, it's refreshing to see how neatly Lee escapes both pitfalls, populating her novel with characters not merely lovable in spite of their flaws, but basically good at heart, or at least striving for decency, while living in and partaking of a poisonous social order they've simply never thought to question.Books like this are precious and rare. If you've somehow managed, like me, to make it into adulthood without ever reading it, do yourself a favor and pick it up now. And if you're still in school, don't wait for it to show up on some mandatory reading list. Read it, as I did, the way it was meant to be read - for the pure, pure pleasure of it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I know you probably already read this point at some point in your either distant or not-so-distant past, depending on how long you have been out of high school. So did I (I'm in the distant past category). I liked it then, I loved it now.Beautifully crafted, this book celebrates doing the right thing even when it is not the popular thing. Fighting a losing battle for a worthy cause. And parenting through example.To Kill a Mockingbird tells the tale of a white lawyer defending a black man accused of raping a white woman in 1935. But before Atticus Finch can defend Tom Robinson, he must first protect him from a public lynching in this Southern Alabama town, where the most crooked white man is still perceived as more credible than the most honest black man. But can Atticus protect Robinson from legal injustice? And what price will his two young children pay when he tries?Told from the viewpoint of Atticus's eight year old-daughter, Scout, this book leaves lasting impressions on topics of racism, justice, and parenting.As I re-read To Kill a Mockingbird this time, I found myself wondering if this celebrated novel would even get published in today's cut-throat publishing world, where readers are looking for some serious conflict and mayhem by the end of the first chapter. Instead, Harper Lee takes the time to introduce the characters and setting, making the Maycomb, Alabama come alive with all of the players typical of a small town. I grew up in such a town so I recognized the trueness of them.Like many books, this book was difficult to put down. Unlike any other book, it made me want to be a better parent . . . and a better person."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I'm in the middle of this classic right now. I see why it is a classic. Its tale of racial segregation is one to stand in one's mind for a lifetime. I am getting a feel for what this novel is about. Wish there was another. I guess you can't duplicate a classic. Harper Lee's only work of publication but still upon reading is a masterpiece that should never be banned but taught to people why the content is wrong. Why certain terms for people were used. Never this book taken off the shelves via censorship and there rules that in some ways make points that set good standards. Some rules are bad. This book deserves not the out of print treatment nor edited cencorship. Morals of this story should be taught to people. Bad morals should have explanations as to why. This novel lives on in a glory need not disturbed by the senseless ones. This classic book will always stand the test of time. Mockingbird o' mockingbird live on forever."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"How I missed this book in school is a mystery. Now, having read it, I proclaim Mockingbird as one of my favorites, ever. I found the story so moving and important, that I will insist my homeschooled son read Mockingbird, this summer."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"What I love so much about this book is that Harper Lee presents it as a story you might hear your grandmother tell. She accomplishes this with such skillfull and poetic use of language, powerful character development, and the right blend of sadness and joy to satisfy the reader in the end.The title itself shows Lee's skill with words. The comparison of more than one character in the book to a mockingbird is touching. This is made poignant when you read Atticus' explanation of the title phrase and the echo of it by his daughter, &quot;Scout&quot;, at the end of the book. Ms. Lee powerfully draws the line of good and evil with her vivid descriptions of the characters in Maycomb. And, just like life, there is not a purely sugary sweet happy ending. However, the ending is richly satisfying and moving.I was never assigned to read this book in high school or college, but I am so glad that I got around to it. Incidentally, the movie is just as good, with an excellent (oscar-winning, I believe) screenplay adaptation."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Anyone who hasn't read this classic novel should read it. Harper Lee tells a wonderful story, through through the memories of a child, passing important lessons on to the reader about growing up, overcoming fears and prejudices, trusting others, fairness and justice. The story is told with wit, charm and grace. It addresses the problem of racism in a way that exposes its evil and ugliness while also illuminating and nurturing the dignity possessed by all human beings. If you've only seen the classic movie (starring Gregory Peck) you know much of the story, but you've missed quite a lot in the telling. The movie can only be fully appreciated by those who have first come to know and love its characters through having read the book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It's quite pitiful that so many people don't see the beauty and Southern grace that is infiltrated all through this book. I've never been in Alabama, but I've had enough contact with Southern types of people and this is a very accurate portrayal: time moves slowly, everyone takes it easy...I watched this movie earlier this year and was completely taken by it. But I'm not reviewing the movie. The book was just as good. Every time I put it down I just wanted to pick it up and go on reading.It was, contrary to several reviewers' statements, very easy to follow. Yes, it can be a bit scattered at times, but much of its charm lies in the child's narration, surprisingly mature at times and yet all the same naive. It flows along slowly but never once drags. And I like the dialect. Of course we all knows Southern folk have awful grammar, but I don't rightly think that ought to matter. If you ever lived around folks who talks like this, you'll realise how very authentic it is. Adds a touch, like.Overall I felt this was a very moving story. I must say that every time I read Atticus' words I just heard Gregory Peck saying them. The way Scout describes her father's voice matches Gregory's so perfectly...I'm already reading this a second time, and I hardly ever read books again just after finishing them. Let that be my recommendation after my wandering review."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is very, very good.Thats all i can say.heh heh."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is mainly about the trial of a black man for raping a white woman -- an offense not taken lightly in 1930s Alabama. And while a rape trial is very serious topic, Harper Lee chooses to write the book from the point of view of an eight-year-old girl. She takes her time getting around to the trial, writing at length about the exploits of Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill. There are lots of laughs -- particularly the night the three of them went to see Boo Radley's house, and Jem ripped his pants so badly he had to return home without them.There are also lots of tearful moments, especially after Tom Robinson got convicted and after he died. He hadn't raped the girl and everyone in town knew it, but essentially he was condemned from the moment after Mayella screamed. The ending, however, is sort of a happy one in spite of what happened to Tom.Yet, not all people in town are racist rednecks. Harper Lee does not go into stereotype. Plenty of white people supported Tom Robinson, Atticus most of all. I met a woman who named her son after Atticus Finch, and after reading the book I can see why. He was my favorite character in the book because of his high-mindedness and fair sense of justice.All in all a terrific piece of work, one that will make its readers think differently after they're done."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"As many other high school students, I had to read &#65533; To Kill a Mockingbird&#65533;, by Harper Lee in my English class. I did not want to read this book one bit. It looked like the most boring book in the world, but as many people say &#65533;you can&#65533;t judge a book by its cover&#65533;. This book turned out to be one of my most favorite books ever. If anyone has read it, they know what I&#65533;m talking about.The book tells a story in the eyes of a child named Scout. She is brought up in the small community of Maycomb. She has many adventures with her brother, Jem. They, like all other children have a wide imagination. They let their minds wonder with their neighbors. They believe things about their neighbors that aren&#65533;t really true. One major issue brought up is Boo Radley. He is presented as a shy, unsociable individual who never comes out of his house, except for at night. Everyone finds him to be scary, even though they don&#65533;t really know him. Throughout the storyline, they find out who the real Boo Radley is. He turns out to be one of Scout&#65533;s best friends.Scout thinks her father, Atticus, is not exciting and just a regular guy. She changes her mind when he shoots the county&#65533;s mad dog with one shot. He becomes a hero, and later Scout learns that his nickname had always been &#65533;single shot&#65533;. She finally looks up to her father and respects who he is.Scout learns many lessons throughout the book. The main idea is that she shouldn&#65533;t kill a mockingbird ever. Her father, Atticus, told her it&#65533;s the worst sin anyone could commit. Mockingbirds are innocent creatures that only play beautiful music. She realizes what her father was talking about when an African-American man is sent to trial for a crime he didn&#65533;t commit. He was accused of raping an American girl, and Atticus is chosen to defend him. He does everything he can to prove the innocence of this man, but no one will agree with him. The innocence of a man is taken and he is sentenced to death. He represents the mockingbird that was killed. The county had committed the worst sin ever.I would recommend this book to anyone. It has a great moral and I learned a lot from it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The very good writing offers you a good insight into the wee town of Maycomb,in the deep south of the thirties.

It was a wonderful book and I would reccomend it to anyone"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Read this book and see the movie! It's too bad Harper Lee went into seclusion after she wrote this book . Dill was based on her friend, Truman Capote, I believe. Look for Robert Duvall in the movie--might have been his first movie.

It taught me how cruel some people can be just because of race, creed, or anything that makes you different. It shows that these things can over-power the justice system and convict someone as innocent as you and me. The man, Tom Johnson, WAS like a mockingbird. He never bothered people, he simply helped them. The thanks he got from the girl he helped was being sentenced guilty of raping the her and in the end he was killed.

Her reactions and facial expressions kind of put YOU in the story and then when you ask her questions she's secrative about it and wont tell you it's all creepy. One day I couldn't stand it any longer I didn't sleep at all. I just stayed up and finished the book. it was FABULOUS. I was on top of the world. Thinking all day, daydreaming, putting myself in Scout's position or Jem's or Boo's or Miss Maudie's- I was everyone. It was also great to have been &quot;let in &quot; on my teachers secret-the end and I never tell secrets so that was fun and. (once everyone finished the book she showed us the movie, it was touching but the book changes your life with a MUCH deeper meaning) I found a deeper meaning to my almost 14 years. I knew that who I was and what I stand for should be known. I liked finally knowing the story but then... Mrs. Sewell told us that &quot;the trial&quot; (read the book to find out...) never happened TO Harper Lee - even though it really did happen. Then what was the purpose? how much really happened? the anger could be there, but the situations??????? I was confused. But Harper must have really met Boo and talked extensively or else why would she live the way she does? (if this is Harper reading this then I am a great fan or yours, yet still confused and I wish you'd email me, I wouldn't tell anyone, secreta are always honored...) if Dill was Truman Capote then what happened and Jem died? what about the older sister, she wasn't in the story.... This book is deep, but it keeps you hanging. WHAT HAPPENED? it is THE BEST book I've ever read and the unit my teacher did was pretty cool.The characters are so deep that they make you think more than any other book that I've ever read.

His name is David and we mainly see each other over the summer. My favorite part is when she has the whole ordeal with Francis.

It is a fictional story based on the childhood of a child from the 1930's. It's written by Harper Lee. The story has a lot of verying events happen. It ranges from child's play to a terrible trial, to a subtle yet questioning ending. The major theme to the book is courage. This is shown a number of times and ways. It is mostly shown through the characters and their actions. It was surprisingly a great book. The begining's kind of slow, but after that it's a wonderful book. If you're looking for a good book to read then this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The subject of To Kill A Mockingbird is courage. There is a young girl, Scout, telling the story. The setting is in Maycomb county in 1935, so you can guess that this book might be about racism. This in a fictional book, that feels like you're actually in the story. Harper Lee writes so well that you feel like you have to respond to what the characters are saying. It is mostly about how much courage one man has, and how he handles people treating people treating other people different because of their skin color. This is Harper Lee's first novel. To Kill A Mockingbird is a memorable book. You will definitely change your view on how some people act in the south. I personally liked the book. The issue of racism is not resolved after the book ends, but today it is mostly resolved. Scout tells the story like she sees it. She states her opinion openly with anyone. When you read this book, focus on how many lessons there are in To Kill A Mockingbird."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee created an incredible literary masterpiece by examining race relations , hypocrisy and class structure in the old south through the eyes of a child narrator. In a remarkable tale that uses small town Alabama and the various characters that inhabit it she is able to introduce different points of view by using the youthful narrator Scout as a filter through which the reader perceives these people and their attitudes.In additon to the obvious attributes of this amazing book, I would add that it can be read by people of any age group with enjoyment and profit. My kids are assigned this in 7th grade and I reread it so we could discuss it and found myself totally absorbed in the story.This is on my list of the top 5 American novels. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In my opinion, To Kill A Mockingbird is the best book ever written. I can't understand why so many teachers, libraries, and parents are trying to ban this book? This book is pure poetry, Harper Lee's writing reminds me of Shakespeare.Anyway, this book takes place in 1930s Alabama. Scout and her brother Jim are being raised by their widowed father, Atticus who is the town lawyer. So far the children's life revolves around their shy neighboor, Boo Bradley who stays in his house, and never comes out. They don't know that their daddy is defending a young black man for raping a poor, white girl until Scout overhears a rumor at school.Towards the end of the book, Scout and Jim (and their friend Dill), run off and sneak into a courthouse to hear the verdict of their daddy's trial.I can't really say anything else because of spoilers, but let me just end with saying Scout gets her wish, at the very end of the book the shy neighboor finally comes out of hiding. I can't really say why, you'll just have to read the book yourself.\`\`Katrina"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The reason why I choose this book was because it was very interesting. It's the only book that I enjoyed reading. I read this book last year in English clas, and it's one of my favorite books so far. his book keeps you interested from the start till it ends. The ending was exciting thrilling. It's one of those books that when you start reading it, you don't want to stop until you finish.This book takes place in Maycomb, Alabama in 1932 during the depression. It's about a girl named Scout and her brother Jem. They live with their dad Atticus. Atticus is a lawyer who is raising his two kids because he's wife passed away when scout was two. Atticus is a lawyer for a black innocent men being accused of a crime they did't commit. Tom Robinson is one of the main characters in this book, he's being accused of raping a young women, but really her dad was the one who beat her because he say her with Tom Robinson trying to kiss him. Even though there was strong evidence that proved he didn't do it, there was no chance for him because it was an all white jury. In the end the jury convicted Tom Robinson and senteced him to life. When it was time to put him away he dcided to run for it. As he was running to get away a police officer shot him in the bak and killed him. Atticus never won a case and they were all innocent, but he was the only one who could keep a jury in the deliberation room for that long, which was a tiny step closer to endind racism in the court when it came to innocent people.

It's a perfect example of how a book can do things that a movie, even a good one, can't. It uses beatiful writing and an interesting and heart-warming story to confront some very hard issues. This book is definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Like many great work of literature, this one packs a lot into its opening passages. It begins, \\"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow.... When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident.\\" Right off the bat we are made aware that we are about to read of past events monumental enough to make the participants dwell on them decades later. There is the suggestion that there's more than meets the eye in what's about to unfold, so you'd better pay attention. And, there's the hint of violence in the mentioning of the broken arm. Was it really an accident? We'll have to read to find out.Often it is said that TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is told through the eyes of a child. This is not strictly true. The narrator of the novel is the now-grown daughter of Atticus Finch, nicknamed \\"Scout\\" in her youth, recalling events from her childhood, albeit in extended passages evoking the point of view of her childhood. This seemingly simple device is a sophisticated one that allows the author a lot of freedom and power to tell the story. The younger Scout's disarming innocence serves as a vehicle for a more direct description of people and events -- after all, a child sees and hears well enough, but she doesn't understand -- allowing Lee to show rather than merely tell about people and events. And, when it suits the author, the adult Scout can address the reader more directly. This slight of hand with the point of view is, I believe, instrumental in creating a novel where the characters seem to come to life and leap off the pages. It's always a delight when writing so technically well-thought-out remains so easy to read. Small wonder that adults should love the book so much and urge middle school students to read it. It is an approachable masterpiece.Some readers may complain that the novel takes its time getting around to what is considered its pivotal element, the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. I cannot see how Lee could have possibly told her story otherwise. We start with the children, who make up their own games and stories and more or less invent their own world as much as possible. Then the adult world gradually intrudes on Scout, her brother Jem, and their peculiar friend Dill Harris. Without being immersed in the children's Eden first, we cannot really understand the point of view of the narrator, who is telling the tale of her loss of innocence. Much is made of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD as an indictment of racism. Certainly an awareness of and sensitivity to racial injustice informs the novel throughout, but I think it is really a tale of paradise lost, which happens to be told in the setting of racial conflict. This is the source I think of the novel's melancholy universality, for regardless whether you grew up in Alabama or in Zimbabwe, there comes a time in your life when you realize that the world isn't a very nice place, but there are still some things worth fighting for, and it's often surprising and inspiring just who the real heroes turn out to be."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"How can you pass this book, by any stretch of the immagination? This books gives history a whole new definition. It was required reading for me in my Freshman Year. Usually, I would detest an book I was made to read in school, and this was my mindset as I began into the book. I thought, since it is a classic, it would be painstaking and difficult to understand and to read. I was wrong. By the time I was finished with each chapter, I found myself wondering what wou;d happen next. How could these awful things be similair to true historical events? It wasn't fair, and it really forsed me to think and use my head.

You will fly through it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird written by Harper Lee and published by J. B. Lippincott is a southern drama novel that has captured many peoples hearts over the past 50 years. Scout Finch, a trouble making tomboy, narrates the story. She tells about her childhood with her Brother, Jem Finch, and the many negative influences during that time period. The story didn't have a very strong main plot, rather many different sub plots. These include the story of Boo Radley, a man who is judged to be insane and never leaves his house, and also their father, Atticus', court case of Tom Robinson, who is a black man accused of raping a young white girl.To Kill A Mockingbird has many themes. One of these being the truth about social class. Social class is not always a good thing. It prevents many people from getting jobs, education, food, housing and more. Social class can be determined by race, age, sex, sexual orientation, and the simple factor of where you came from. In To Kill A Mockingbird Lee demonstrates the racism that took place in the 1930's that lead to Tom Robinson being accused of rape. \\"There's something in our world that makes men lose their heads- they couldn't be fair if they tried. In our courts, when it's a white man's word against a black man's word, the white always wins. They're ugly, but these are the facts of life\\" (Lee 252). Atticus gives this speech to Jem and Scout in attempt to show them how much racism is not only in their town, but in their world. He says this trying to tell them that he most likely will not win the court case for Robinsion since in theory a white man always wins against a black man, despite how ridiculous the story the opposing side is preaching.It also shows what isolation and loneliness can do to a person. It can often lead to depression, antisocial behavior, poor decision making, increase in stress levels, and other such things. If the loneliness has gone so far that you isolate yourself in your house, then people will think strangely of you. The novel shows several rumors against Boo Radley, such as the rumor that he peeks through peoples windows at night (Lee 9). This and other rumors cause Boo Radley to not come out of his house, which, of course, leads to more rumors about him. This is witnessed to be a cycle of rumors towards Radley which of course results in Radley isolating himself in his house which causes the cycle to repeat.The novel shows the transitions that children go through from being innocent and unknowing to experiencing evil in the world and becoming adults. Everyone goes through these changes at some point during their childhood and this novel states it well. Scout was completely child like and unknowing at the beginning of the book until she experienced the evils of the world such as racism during Tom Robinson's case.I found this book to be interesting due to the themes it demonstrates. The idea of transitioning from a child to adult, the demonstration of racism, and the effects of isolation and lonliness was fairly interesting and extremely true. Although this book is fiction there were some key elements that made it almost seem realistic such as the themes I listed. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a book that is simple at one glance but once you dig deeper there is much more. Harper Lee did a wonderful job at creating this novel and the themes in it.Once I finished the book I took time to think through all of the thought that the author put into it. It wasn't a novel like Harry Potter, exciting and adventurous, but it did have a lot of hidden meaning. There were times I would get bored of it, but there were key elements that seemed to catch my interest again. I am glad that I picked up this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee was an absolutely wonderful book. Set in the 1930s, it is written from the point of view of a young girl, the daughter of defense lawyer Atticus Finch. As his daughter, she is exposed to the case of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of beating and sexually assaulting a white girl. Atticus is determined to defend this man, though it goes against everything that most of the people in their little town in Alabama believe. To Kill a Mockingbird tells the story of this girl's upbringing in the small town, and the moral crisis that shook it to its very core. The themes of this book - for there are more than one theme - are diverse and complex. The easiest to find is the theme of growing up and understanding the \`grown up' world. As the children see the case unfold, and hear the verdict, they face the realities of the 1930s. The deeper message, however, is told in part by the title - it is a sin to kill a mockingbird. One character explained this perfectly when she said, \\"Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy...that's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\" Throughout the book, there are metaphorical mockingbirds, Tom Robinson being the most obvious. These people have brought nothing but goodness to the world, yet are persecuted, or \\"killed\\" by the society they are trapped within. To Kill a Mockingbird shows how it sometimes takes an innocent child to make the world see the crimson sins that stain its darkest parts. This heart-touching book is filled with amusement, adventures, and - above all - a message of compassion and morality."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was driving home from New Orleans, beginning to get very sleepy, stopped at a chain bookstore close to the interstate and found this little treasure. If there is such a thing as \\"the perfect reader\\" Sissy Spacek certainly qualifies. It is perfection!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee is a terrific book for many reasons such as, an engaging plot, complex themes, and developed characters. Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch lives in Maycomb County, Alabama with her older brother, Jem, and her father, Atticus. Their family is laid-back which leaves Scout and Jem to entertain themselves with innocent games. However, their lives change dramatically one summer, when father is assigned to defend a black man in a controversial case. Suddenly, Scout is verbally and physically attacked by many kids at school, and contrary to her tomboy personality, her father tells her she cannot fight back. While Jem and Scout start out the book believing that their town and neighbors are all good and kind people, they are transformed by the injustice and racism displayed the their father's case.Atticus's case, involving the unfair accusation of black man - Tom Robinson, sparks the idea of lost innocence in the novel. The children's innocent perspectives on the world around them are corrupted by the harsh ideas they are exposed to in their town. Although Scout's innocence was saved by her outspoken and tomboy personality it is also the aspect of her personality that gets her in the most trouble at home. On the other hand, Jem is traumatized by the injustices thrown onto Tom Robinson - the black man unfairly accused of rape even though his calm demeanor is praised by his family. Scout's experience with school is another way the theme of lost innocence is shown in To Kill a Mockingbird. Her teachers can't or choose not to understand her, which only increases her stubbornness, but she does understand their teaching, she is only more taken aback by the cruelty in her world. Each time the children are exposed to injustice and ignorance, more of their child-like innocence is taken from them and they are forced to grow up faster. This theme is one of the main reasons this book captures my attention. This theme displays the delicacy of children's minds, and how easily they can be molded, as well show the horrible effects of racism on everyone - not only the victim.I loved this book for reasons beyond just the plot, and would recommend this book to anyone who has read and enjoyed Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry by Mildred D. Taylor, or Let the Circle Be Unbroken. All three of these books share a similar plot line and Scout is similar to the main characters in both of these books. This book is also a great example of a classic, so anyone who is interested in the classics should try reading this book. To Kill a Mockingbird is the perfect coming of age story - because it shows the benefits and the cons of growing up. In addition, this book is easily readable because of the engaging plot, but there are also other layers of the book deeper than just the plot. I loved reading To Kill a Mockingbird, and I know that people even years from now will enjoy reading the story of Scout Finch."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"One of the great classics. The movie version is extremely good but nothing beats reading a classic novel with prfound substance, written beautifully. Who wouldn't love Scout and her innocence to see things as they are and speak of it...nor her father Atticus...a tower of strength and moral courage in a time of great and open prejudice toward our fellow man. The humor is warm. The seriousness of predjudice is unsettling and real. The outcome though sad for Tom and his family, is tender and sweet for Bo. Read the book and be transformed back in time...when rolling about in an old rubber tire brought more simple fun than the overwhelming complexities of today's all absorbing electronic entertainment that our children are drawn into. Simple and less really is best."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Got the book on with speed and efficiency. Good quality with the money well worth it. Nothing much to really ask for!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, is a novel about race, class, and coming of age in 1930's Alabama. The novel's protagonist is a young girl named Scout who lives with her father, a lawyer named Atticus, and her older brother, named Jem. The beginning of the novel depicts an entire culture through the lens of a single year narrated by Scout. Scout spends the summer playing with her brother and her friend Dill, a short, smart, stubborn boy who leads the children into an investigation of the town's biggest mystery: the Radleys. The Radleys are Scout's reclusive neighbors, and according to the legend surrounding them, their son Arthur Radley, known as \\"Boo,\\" has been locked up in their house for many years after stabbing his father in the leg. In the first part of the book the children try everything they can to lure Boo out of the Radley's home. Later in the book, Scout's father agrees to defend a black man accused of raping a young white woman. The case causes a controversy in the town and Scout is heckled in school for being the daughter of a man unusual enough to take on the role of defending an African-American. Despite Atticus's strong showing in court the jury's racism leads them to reach a guilty verdict. The novel ends with Scout finally understanding her father's advice to \\"always put yourself in somebody else's skin and walk around in it\\" before judging a situation.The novel's main strength is the way it convincingly conjures the life of a small southern town. As a reader you feel like you're part of the community. For example, during the court case you feel proud of Atticus, as if he were your own father. When Atticus, in his closing argument, tells the jury that the case is \\"as simple as black and white,\\" you feel the force and moral clarity of his perspective. On the other hand, the novel's ending is frustrating. As a reader you would like the author to leave the ending as more of a mystery. Instead Lee wraps up all the loose ends in a rushed and unsatisfying way. We are told that Scout never sees Arthur again with no explanation. It would have been more satisfying if Lee had either left the story open-ended or had gone on for another fifty pages detailing each character's future. Overall I give this book nine-stars out of ten.By Alba"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I ordered this for my daughter because they are reading this in school.

I think I've been steeped in To Kill A Mockingbird my entire life.The novel is about the lawyer Atticus's struggle in the South to defend a black man who is charged with the rape of a white girl, and who is presumed guilty until proven innocent due to his race. The narrative is told from the perspectives of Atticus' two young children, Scout and Jem. The trial scenes in the novel are some of the most powerful scenes you will ever read, and the novel really is a wonder--particularly for the time in which Harper Lee was writing.To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the most engaging, interesting, thought-provoking novels in American history, uses some of the most stunning examples of imagery I have ever seen, and one of the most well-sustained plots I have ever read. There is never a dull moment in the novel, and just when one is afraid that the novel will peter off into an anticlimactic finale, Lee brings the novel to an extraordinarily satisfying ending. I challenge anybody to read To Kill A Mockingbird and not come away wanting to tell everyone you know about it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the most famous novels to have ever been written. It is a fiction story told from the perspective of young Scout Finch, the daughter of Maycomb, Alabama's lawyer, Atticus Finch. The novel is set in the deep South in the 1930's, during the country's Great Depression. The essence of the book deals with Atticus' struggles in defending a black man accused of raping a white woman and the repercussions that Scout and Jem deal with. Boo Hadley, the town recluse, and the children form a friendship and all become involved in the trial as well.

It is about these two kids named Jem and Scout whose lives are greatly affected by racism in their town. It all starts when their father Atticus who is a lawyer goes to defend a black man in court accused of rape.One reason why I recommend this book is because it has a lot of mysteries and secrets that make you think \\"is that a coincidence or did the author mean for that to be that way\\". An example would be how Jem, Scout and Atticus's last name is Finch when a finch is a peaceful little bird. It makes you wonder whether the author just came up with that or whether it is supposed to tie in with the mockingbird theme. Another reason why I recommend this book is because it shows you what times were like back then with racism and how the blacks were treated. From reading this you learn that if you were black all it took to get thrown in jail or killed was a white persons lie. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it started out slow and was a long read due to the number of pages and the small print.Overall this book causes you to read to understand the mysteries that it held within its pages. It also teaches you a good lesson on hoe America was with racism and how poorly blacks were treated."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I bought the 1st edition, 1st printing of Harper Perennial Modern Classics' \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" that was signed by Harper Lee. At first, I thought I had maybe been scammed because the book was in such good condition, but it was the real thing! I gave it to my sister for her 22nd birthday (it's her favorite book and she's never owned a copy) and the look on her face when she saw that signature was utter disbelief! she actually started shaking she was so amazed! I think it actually trumped the new car my folks gave her! Thank you, Keene Books, for a priceless reaction that I will NEVER forget, and at such a reasonable cost!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Fifty years after its initial publication in 1960, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" has proven it deserves its place in anyone's list of the finest American classic literature ever written.Written a scant three years before Martin Luther King awed the world with his magnificent \\"I have a dream\\" speech, Harper Lee also stunned the world with a poignant story centered on the unconscionable treatment accorded to the black man in USA's Deep South.Tom Robinson, a productive, quietly proud and well-spoken black man who by today's standards might even be called an \\"Uncle Tom\\", is also cautiously subservient, withdrawn and all too aware of his underwhelming place in the society of Maycomb, Georgia, a sleepy white town in the heartland of America's confederate South.Tom stands accused of the rape of Mayall Ewell, the 19 year old daughter of a boorish ne'er-do-well white trash family that, to the best recollection of everyone in the town, has never put in a day's work in its collective life. Jeremy Atticus Finch is a gentlemanly white lawyer who, despite the virulent hatred his own community is directing at him, has decided to hold firm to his own convictions about the equality of all men before God and to accept his assignment to the responsibility for Tom's defense at his capital trial for the rape of a white woman - a trial that is expected to be little more than a formality with scant necessity for reference to facts and truth.\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is not a legal thriller, although it certainly could have been. Rather, it is a story about human behaviour - kindness and cruelty; bigotry, hatred and prejudice versus acceptance and friendship; humour and pathos in the presence of sadness and dejection. Told from the point of view of Atticus Finch's children, Scout and her older brother Jem, we are witness to their father's poignant heart-warming attempts to teach his children to become the kind of citizens that, fifty years later, are sadly still the exception rather than the rule.There can be few people (like me) left who haven't had the privilege of either reading \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" or seeing the movie, but if you are among that small number, do yourself a favour. Read it sooner than later.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"If you haven't read this book yet, stop whatever it is that you're doing, go immediately to a book store, and pick this up. To Kill a Mockingbird is among the best books I've ever read.For those that haven't read this, or haven't seen the film version with Gregory Peck, which is also outstanding, To Kill a Mockingbird is about the Finch family. Atticus Finch is a lawyer and widower in a small Alabama town during the Great Depression. He has two children: Jem, an 11-year old boy, and Scout, an 8-year old girl. Their lives are turned upside down when Atticus is appointed to represent Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. The story is told from Scout's perspective.While the story is framed around social and racial issues in the South, it's really about much more than that: primarily, it's a story about growing up. The Robinson case makes the transitions that Jem and Scout go through much more dramatic, but they experience the same kind of wonder and confusion that all of us experience as we move from childhood to young adulthood.Atticus is exactly the kind of person we aspire to be: honest, caring, understanding, moral, and unflappable. You sort of get the impression of Atticus as the last righteous man. Atticus lives his philosophy: \\"The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience\\" (p. 120). In short, Atticus is the emodiment of human dignity--not just for himself, but for others too. If you aren't moved by his closing argument in the Robinson trial, you may be in a coma.I thought it was odd, and somewhat revealing hearing the kids, especially Scout, describe their father: \\"Atticus was feeble: he was nearly fifty. When Jem and I asked him why he was so old, he said he got started late, which we felt reflected upon his abilities and manliness....Our father didn't do anything. He worked in an office, not in a drugstore. Atticus didn't drive a dump truck for the county, he was not the sheriff, he did not farm, work in a garage, or do anything that could possibly arouse the admiration of anyone.\\" Ouch. But this is Scout with a child's perspective; her growing maturity changes the way both she and Jem see their father.Harper Lee never wrote another novel; she grew up with and remained a close friend of Truman Capote's until his death. Harper Lee and Gregory Peck also remained close friends until his demise; Peck's grandson was named Harper in her honor.To Kill a Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Prize for a reason: it's a masterpiece. Its warmth, compassion, comedy, and tragedy are rendered with such humanity that it honestly blew me away. I can't recommend it enough. Read it today."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"OK, everyone under the sun has reviewed To Kill A Mockingbird; why do I feel like reviewing it?I just re-read this after reading it once when I was in middle school, many moons ago (I'm in my 40s).

It's amazing how compelling and universal a tale that Lee spun with just a pretty simple, basic, and down-to-earth set of small town characters. As noted, I read this when I was in middle school and I remember enjoying it more than almost any other assigned book I had read. I'm amazed at how great it is, from the perspective of a mature adult with diverse life experiences, much travel, and my own children.

I just read this book for a summer reading project and it captured my interest. The book starts out fairly slow but speeds up in a couple of chapters. When it gets going it will be hard to put this book down. The father, Atticus Finch, is a man who is shrouded in mystery. In every few chapters you found out a new strange secret about him. His children, Scout and Jem, are no less interesting. They constantly explore the small town they live in and encounter many adventures such as making many attempts to discover who lives in a rundown and abandoned house that is rumored to contain a crazy man.I particularly appreciated the plot of the story. It was constantly changing as you uncovered mysteries and horrifying truths. The book never disappointed.In addition to entertaining a wide variety of readers this book is filled with many morales.

Harper Lee's talent for writing has created a wonderful story, told through the innocent eyes of young Scout Finch.

It's definitely one of the best modern novels that have been written! For those of you that haven't the slightest clue what this book is about...TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a story of growing up, the childhood of Scout and Jem Finch in a small town in Alabama in the 1930's. Their father, Atticus, is a respectable lawyer, given the job of defending Tom Robinson, a black man who is accused of raping a white woman. It's a very dark theme that inhabits this innocent world of youthfulness, but that is part of the plot: to describe the loss of innocence and the maturing of the children in their views and actions in the face of various social issues such as prejudice and class distinction. While being told from a child's point of view runs really deep and you'll be surprised by how intelligent Scout and Jem are. The title, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is explained on pg. 90 of the book, declaring the sin of murdering the helpless and innocent. The story is told in a flashback, by Scout, who recounts the events between her 5 and 9 years of age, the events leading up to her brother Jem's broken arm....Now don't think this book is totally dreary and hateful - most of the characters (like Scout, Jem, and Dill) are really pleasant and incredibly entertaining. The story takes on the real life approach but it is most relevant and I truly agree that this book is a must-read for everyone."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I rate this book a 5-star-plus!

I think that everybody should read this book because it really gives you something to think about!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It's funny to me how I learned about the book &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird.&quot; I was new the new kid in school. All those there before me seemed to be talking about this book. They read it the year before and talked fondly of it. I don't know how, but it always seemed to come up every now and then in different classes. I never heard of it until then. In fact, for the longest time, I didn't even understand what they were calling it. They said the name so fast that for the longest time I thought they were saying Tequila Mockingbird. Then, one day I realized that it wasn't Tequila, but TO KILL A. I am glad I found out the correct name. But, now I know why it made such an impression on them, which is what caused me to even think twice about and even remember the book. Luckily less than a year ago, I saw the book in an advertisement, so I bought the book. It was fantastic. First, I loved how the book was told from the perspective of a little girl. I continually found myself chuckling at some of the reasoning of the young story teller, just as my own 7 year old cousin might make me laugh with the things that she says and does. Beyond this aspect of the book, was of course the story itself. It truely reminds us that morals like honesty, standing up for what's right, treating all people with respect, and that we never know a man until we walk in his shoes are things that are important in life today, just as they were back then. A book like &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; is a classic because it touches on issues that span all lifetimes. In short, I found the reading to be easy, the twists of the plot to be intriguing, the capers of the children to be funny and endearing, the speeches of their father to be inspiring, and most of all their relationship with Boo Radley (their painfully shy neighbor) to be touching!!! A must read for every person in America!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I believe it was Mark Twain who said &quot;A classic is a book that everybody talks about, but nobody reads.&quot; And while I mostly stick with newer material, occasionally I like to acquaint myself with a &quot;classic&quot; to see what all the fuss is about. This book is certainly a masterpiece and deserves to be called a &quot;classic&quot; in every sense of the word.Harper Lee's method of describing predjudice and injustice in a small southern town, through the eyes of a little girl, is a highly effective and moving technique. The fact that Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill can see through the hypocrisy of the adults around them, and the social system in which they live, is very telling and holds a true lesson for us all. These kids can clearly see that an innocent black man is being railroaded for a crime he didn't commit, and are appalled and heartbroken by the system that convicts him anyway.I understand that this book has often been banned for not being &quot;politically correct&quot; in the modern world. Yes, it does contain the N-word and other epithets, even from the mouths of the well-meaning lead characters (who are simply a product of their society anyway). Since I'm not a member of an oppressed group, I can't tell people they shouldn't be offended by these terms. But what we have here is an accurate potrayal of life in a small southern town in 1935, and that's just the way things were back then. Even if the past was painful and ignorant, by covering it up you're trying to pretend it never happened, and that's no way to deal with it. Also, those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it. The theme of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is not that this kind of behavior is right, but that it's wrong. And that's why we should be reading this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is a one of the great American stories that was made into an equally great American movie.The book is set in Maycomb, Alabama, in the 1930s. Atticus Finch, a lawyer and a father, defends a black man, Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping a poor white girl, Mayella Ewell. The narrative is in the voice of Jean Louise (Scout) Finch, Atticus&#65533; daughter, who with her brother, Jem, and friend, Dill, endure the underlying outrage of the community when Mr. Finch&#65533;s vigorously defends Tom Robinson.In the meantime, a great mystery is solved, the mystery of Boo Radley, a &quot;malevolent phantom&quot; who lives in a ramshackle house just down the street from the Finches. Boo was never seen, but &quot;people said he existed . . . people said he went out at night when the moon was down, and peeped in windows . . . when people&#65533;s azaleas froze in a cold snap, it was because he had breathed on them . . . a baseball hit into the Radley yard was a lost ball and no questions asked.&quot;There&#65533;s not much more that I can add to the hundreds of other Amazon reviews about this Pulitzer prize-winning book, but a few bits of &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; trivia may be interesting to those who are fans of the book and movie.. The character of &quot;Dill&quot; &#65533; the imaginative boy who was Jem and Scout&#65533;s best friend and neighbor &#65533; is modeled after author Harper Lee&#65533;s best childhood friend. (Dill&#65533;s character is developed in much more detail in the book.) The friend&#65533;s name was Truman Capote, a boy who grew up to be one of America&#65533;s finest authors. Perhaps the friendship was forged because both children marched to a different drummer. Truman was effeminate and didn&#65533;t fit in with other boys. Harper was a feisty tomboy who didn&#65533;t fit in with other girls. This friendship, developed in Monroeville, AL (Maycomb in the book) and which continued into adulthood, gives rise to one of the more interesting controversies in literature. Four decades later, Harper Lee has never penned another novel, just a few articles and essays. The style in many of the passages in To Kill a Mockingbird is very similar to that of Truman Capote. Did Harper Lee write this novel? Or is it the work of Truman Capote? Ms. Lee has been quoted as saying that she &quot;finds writing difficult.&quot; But it is documented that she locked herself away in a flat in New York City for more than a year to write To Kill a Mockingbird. It is very likely that her story is expressed with the advice and help of her good friend. And what&#65533;s wrong with that? Harper Lee is still living in 2001 and remains an intensely private person.. Understandably, the book includes scenes and story lines that were not included in the movie. Scout&#65533;s aunt, Miss Alexandra, who desperately wants Scout to behave like a young lady, plays a key role in the book after she moves in with the family. She is non-existent in the movie. Neighbor Miss Maudie&#65533;s house burns down in the book&#65533;s story line &#65533; in the movie she is best remembered for the line of dialogue, &quot;There are some men in this world who were born to do our unpleasant jobs for us. Your father&#65533;s one of them.&quot;So, which is better - the book or the movie?The answer is neither. They&#65533;re both masterpieces that complement and compliment each other beautifully.Every once in a very long while - in literature and filmmaking - a story comes along with a power of its own that seems to draw from an unworldly creative force. The result is a work of grace, beauty, insight and inspiration. Such is the case with To Kill A Mockingbird.On film or the printed page, it&#65533;s an American treasure."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is a book that everyone should read!

I have read it several times (at least 10) since I was a teen-ager, but never had to read it for school, so I was anxious to discuss the story with others.Every time I read \\"Mockingbird\\" I learn something new about the characters - why they said and did certain things. Some of our book club discussion focused on Atticus as a parent. He is really not a great parent in the book. Important events in Scout's life (first day of school, Halloween pageant) are not attended by Atticus. The movie portrays him as a much better man.\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" should be required reading for every American. It is hilarious, shocking, suspenseful and thought provoking."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book started rather slow for me. A lot of background. All the conversations amongst the kids was not necessary for me. I like how Scout tells the whole story, it really reads from a kids point of view. That was really creative. I think HarperLee was taking a stance on racial inequalities of this country. Readers would only listen to her speaking through a child. If Atticus had told the story, America wouldn't have been able to stomach how ugly life really is. Atticus is the strongest character in the book to me. This book was deep. I did enjoy it. If you haven't read it you've missed out."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mocking BirdTo Kill A Mocking Bird the books author is Harper Lee. The genre of To Kill A Mocking Bird is historical fiction. The style of the book is set in the south in the 1930?s and the author uses all the slang that was being used during this time period. As the reader, you experience the1930?s through one of the main characters, Scout. The setting of the book is a small town in Alabama. The book gives the reader an idea of what small town life was like when a controversial event occurs. The courtroom scenes in the book take the reader through the climax of the story. During this portion of the story, you start to understand the whole book , all of the characters and their roles.The main characters of the book are Scout, Jem, Atticus, Dill, Calpurnia and Aunt Alexandria. Jem and Scout meet Dill early on in the book, they work together to get Boo Radley out of the house. Scout starts school and she gets into a fight with some of the boys because her father Atticus is involved in a big case, he is defending a black man. Atticus was called to an emergency board meeting to make budget cuts. Jem and Scout went with Calpurnia to her church and when they came back, their Aunt Alexandria was on their doorstep.Their aunt brings a lot of change into the lives of Jem and Scout. During this summer, Jem and Dill started to exclude Scout form their presence. Scout spends more time with Miss. Maudie. One day Jem, Dill, and Scout decide to go and try to peak in the Radely house. Jem and Scout get into more trouble when Miss. Dobuse starts to talk about their father.I think the author did a great job with making the story interesting by foreshadowing. Like when Atticus says it is a sin to kill a mockingbird. I would recommend this to others because there is a lot to be learned from this book. I think that more mature people would like this book because of the content of the book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I have been reading some of the so-called 'American Classics' and this is one of the few that is actually a great story. Harper Lee did a great job of developing the main characters and tying in different sub-plots into the main plot. It was also interesting to read about the southern culture in the 1930's. The author did a great job painting a picture in the minds of ther readers. And, of course, there was a positive message about race coming from Atticus and his two children."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee\`s novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a good one.

Equality and honesty are very important for Atticus and he teaches his children to live according to his principles.At the beginning of the novel the author tells too much about Scout, Jem and her friend Dill who bother the mystery man next door. The author also write too much about the citizens in Maycomb, especially about Scout neighbours.The society has many prejudices against blacks and the great injustice is shown during the trial of Tom Robinson.All in all it is an interesting book because the reader is well informed about the situation in the Southern States of America in the 1930s and the society and their way of life at that time."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT THE BOOK BEFORE READING IT&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; - the title of this book well-known and spread over nearly the whole world sounds unspectacular, perhaps even not very sympathic because including the two words &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;Mockingbird&quot;, what, when having this words connected in that way, sounds as if the book was about killing some birds. That, of course, isn't the most-liked topic of many readers.And even if you knew what the book was about, you wouldn't just buy or read it. We all know the theme the book deals with is an old theme. A theme that has been covered in many books before, in many films before: The book covers a dark - litterally dark -chapter of American history: The fight Black aainst White. Nothing new, in so far.REALITYYou might think so. But: Reality runs another way. The book is only great. I don't really know to describe why, but you can surely call it &quot;history alive !!!&quot; It's not an ordinary history-book as you can get them on each corner, in different layouts and written by different authors, but with the same content again and again and again and....This book is a story-telling book, but besides it informates. Not many authors get this contrasts together, Harper Jane Lee does. My problem is that I don't know why. Perhaps there are this great characters of Scout and the family, this Atticus-Finch-character, a character we would like to find in some of our politicians sometimes. But there can't be only the characters making this book so great.Maybe there is this town of Maycomb: Harper Lee creates a whole town with all it's problems and advantages, with houses and many citizens that, even if they only appear for a short time, are described so detailled that they seem to live.READ IT!At all, I just can say the book made me angry. It didn't make me angry because it was bad, it was very good, but during reading it, I had to change my mind - and I don't like being forced to cange my mind. At the beginning I thought &quot;Oh no, again a book about blacks and whites&quot; but it is more than that, it's nearly, oh, nonsense, it IS a perfect book.

An absolutely must"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The novel &quot;TO Kill a Mockingbird&quot; by Harper Lee is a drama that takes place in a southern state of the USA, Alabama, in the 1930's. The protagonist and also the narrator is a young girl named Scout. Her brother Jem also belongs to the round characters because he plays an important role throughout the story and he is the one Scout starts to talk about at the beginning of the novel.The two children develop during the story. They learn about the coexistence of good and evil, justice and injustice. They have to experience that not all principles Atticuc has taught them as acceptance and tolerance is followed by all people in town.Living according to Atticus's advice &quot;putting oneself in one's shoes&quot; Scout and jem discover that sometimes you have to change your opinion about a person when you get to know this person, for example the fact that Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radley is not the dangerous monster but a man who rescues two children.In my view it was an intersting and detailed written novel. Especially the chapters where Atticus defends the innocent black man Tom Robinson are very exiting. I think it is good to tell teh story by a first-person narrator because you learn about the feelings and emotions. Another aspect of this is that you can also see the changes in the narrotor's behaviour because he is part of the story."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The siblings Jean Louise, called Scout, and Jem Finch grow up in the south states of America during the 30\`s in a society with blacks and poor families.

During their father\`s case they become older and they begin to understand a lot of things. Jem and Scout learn many things and behaviours from their father but the most important thing they learn is that you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.The book &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; shows racism in the southern states of America. Through Scout\`s eyes and her point of view the reader gets to know how the society was during the 30\`s. This book is really worth reading."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"One of the most outsatanding novels of the 20th century. The story is that of the Finch family-Atticus and his children Scout and Jem. The narrator is the precoscious Scout, a six year old tomboy and the hero is Atticus, a lawyer who teaches his children the right way to live in the face of intense presure from friends and family. Atticus answers every question that his chilren ask him directly and courageously. He not only talks the talk but he lives up to his children's expectations through his actions.Set in the Deep South of the 1930's, the book touches on a large set of issues including closemindedness and racial prejudice. Since Ms. Lee was a Southerner who never ventured far from her roots,it captures the true essence of the South and not some 'corn pone' version of it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I waited a long time to read this book b ecause I thought it would be way overmy head, but suprisingly it was really easy to understand. It's a great book, though its not that long, you know all the characters very deeply. I think the most amazing scene is when after the verdict is read, Atticus walks out of the courtroom and all the people in the balcony stand up to solute him. It seems like such a powerfull statement. Read this book if you haven't because it is one that is truly great."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book describes 1930fs America. The scene is Alabama. Main characters are Atticus, Jem and Scout. This book is about Jem and Scoutfs growth through some events like their father, Atticus, worked for a black man and relationship between Scout, Jem and Boo Radley who stayed for many years inside in his house. I strongly recommend this book. Because this book has deep thought about prejudice and discrimination to black people at that time. In this book, white people in the city considered black people to be criminals. The scariest thing is that they didnft aware that they discriminate. Against these problems, Atticus fought proudly. It changed people around him. He has really good, fair personality. After reading this book, you will wish that I had a father like Atticus Because I thought so."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee told a great story with this book about the way things were in the 30's. Racism, poverty, and peer pressure were all expressed very well in the story, and it accurately depicts the struggles of standing up for an unpopular cause.

The story takes place in the Deep South and is told through the innocent eyes of an eight-year-old girl called Scout. Her father is a lawyer who is verbally harassed by an entire town because he decided to defend an innocent black man accused of raping a white young woman. To kill a Mockingbird moved me to both laughter and tears as I read how Scout learns about life from watching her own father stand up and fight for what is right, exposing and challenging an entire town in it's unfairness and ignorance. Harper Lee, the author, is luminous. It is no wonder that this book shook the standards of our nation for the time it was written. I give it my highest admiration because of its deep significance, yet it was written in such simple language and storytelling."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; takes place in Maycomb, Alabama in the early 1930's. The setting plays a major key role in the development of the story. Maycomb, Alabama is a small town with obvious class and racial segregation. The majority of the townspeople are very prejudiced and closed-minded, but one exception to this trend is Atticus Finch. He is a white, middle-class lawyer who defends a black man, Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping a white woman. The trial causes a great controversy among the townspeople and reveals the true opinions and values of the citizens of Maycomb, Alabama.Lee uses the characters in his book to convey different views on the topic of discrimination. Specifically, he uses Finch's children, Jem and Scout, to show an innocent and naive perspective on the topic. The children have a hard time understanding why a man is being persecuted because he is of a different race. Jem and Scout's thoughts continue to play a significant role throughout the book to represent the idealistic views. Mayella Ewell, the woman who accuses Tom Robinson of raping her, is used by Lee to show the white race's common view of the black race during the 1930's. Ewell is willing to have a man put to death just to save her reputation. Her act of indiscretion points out the views of how black men were rarely viewed as human beings and certainly were not treated as if they were human beings.In my opinion, Lee does a wonderful job in expressing his views through the use of his diverse characters. The language that he uses in his book really makes the words jump off the page. Also, the lessons learned in this book are applicable to everyday life. He brings you along for a most influential ride filled with love, hate, anger, and such starvation for wanting to know what is going to happen next in the story, that you just cannot put the book down. After reading this book, I appreciated the struggles of the black race more than ever, and I really respect all they had to go through."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Atticus Finch, Boo Radley, Maycomb - names that resonate even before reading the book. I can't believe that it's taken me so long to get around to reading this - it truly is a classic that deserves to be read, that's enjoyable and is still an easy read.&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; takes place in the deep South during the depression. Told from the viewpoint of Scout Finch, a young tomboy growing up in Maycomb, Alabama, we get an account of her early life full of strange characters such as the enigmatic Boo Radley, woven with a classic courtroom drama equal to any that Grisham or Turow have produced.Harper Lee has breathed such life and vitality into every character in this tale. Jem and Scout, the son and daughter of Atticus Finch a local lawyer and state senator, represent the liberal town viewpoint, the growing awareness of racial inequality and the touchpoint for the tensions of country versus town that appear even within the school. Aunt Alexandra gives us an insight into the southern hostess, gentile yet savage, forward thinking when it comes to Africa highlighting the racial inequalities they take for granted in their own town.This book was written at the beginning of the highly charged atmosphere of the late 50s, early 60s. Racial inequality was being challenged in the courts, in the schools and on the streets. The combination of this intensity combined with the drama set in 1930s makes this one of the true classics of American life in the South. It is an interesting read whatever your background and I highly recommend reading it sooner rather than later!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I especially like this book because it kills off a lot of stereotypes. For example, it proves that girls who live in the South aren't always 'delicate' and 'fragile' like most people think they are. Scout, the main character in this book, gets a shotgun for Christmas and wears boy's clothes while most girls her age get jewelry, makeup and frilly dresses. Also, Atticus, her father, is the first positive white male character who lives in the South. As you read this book you will find a number of plots, but especially it's about how Scout sees her father handle a case when a black man is accused of raping a white woman in the 1930's even when he's innocent. This is a great book; especially if you want to learn about life in the South in the 1930's."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Through the innocent eyes of an 8 year-old child, Scout Finch and her older brother Jem are faced with the racism of society as their father, Atticus, defends a black man accused of rape.

The heroic figure, Atticus Finch, teaches his children the ways of the world and instills the values that are needed to become accepting and responsible adults. Through some comedy and truth, the story conveys messages to the reader about life, racism and human emotion.

Writing it through a child's eyes is an ingenius way to tell this tale. The characters are incredibly real and heartfelt. The entire story is gripping, and I can never put the book down.

I think you will too!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"After watching the AFI's \\"Heros & Villians In movies\\" countdown, and seeing Atticus Finch beat out all movie heros, I had to read this again.

She can really tell a story! While the \\"ways\\" of the townsfolk is to totally cast out other races and look down on them, Atticus and his bright children have open arms and open minds. This especially happens when Atticus, a defense attorney, is standing up for Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman.While there is much sadness throughout, the novel as a whole is just so brightly written. Narrated by our little friend, Scout and seen all through her eyes, we get to know her and her family and about justice.I was sucked in to the world of Scout's, and was utterly blown away by all that took place. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a true classic.

It is yet the best book I have ever read. Harper Lee is a wonderful author! This book made me want to keep turning the page, and never put the book down. Atticus never once gave up on that case. Even though it ruined his reputation he kept at it. It showed me that sometimes you may be rediculed for something, but keep at it. Fighting for what you believe in is the theme of this book in my opinion. When Scout and Jim found the items in the tree it showed them that someone cared. I recommend this book for anyone who is up for a great classic book. It isn't too long of a book, and it leaves you amazed. It puts a thought into your head that I cannot describe. It shows that we all face humility at some points in our lives, but to face those points with courage and bravery. Look life in the face."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I don't want to restate the other reviews, because they really got the points down pat.all i want to say is that there is a reason this book is a classic. theres a reason this book is taught in English classes nationwide.

It is a story that anyone, people of all ages, can enjoy. It was also an inspirational story about the bravery of children and one man's desire to defend a man who has almost no hope.The story is about a family, whose father is a lawyer, defending a black man accused of raping a white woman. It is told by the daughter, Scout. Scout and her brother, Jem, are very close because they are both very curious kids. They get all their information on what's going on with the trial by snooping around and talking to gossips from town. Basically the story is about what the family goes through because of the trial, considering that back then most people automatically believed the white girl. The town was not very supportive of Atticus 'choosing' to defend a black man. The Finch family goes through a great deal of pain and strife because of this.Because of reading this book, I feel more enlightened on the black/white issues of days gone by. The book gives great detail to the innerworkings of the minds of white people back then. The characters were very well-developed, the plot was definitely realistic, making the story very believable because chances are, something like that has happened.I would definitely recommend this book to reader's of all ages. It provides great knowledge of the unfair ways that white people used to treat black people, and still do to an extent.

I love this book because I am able to visualize the setting. I can read it for a long time and not want to put it down. I definately recommend it. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, is a phenomenal book. It is an American Classic and a great book for the 1960's. The story takes place through the eyes of a little girl named Scout. Scout has a very loyal older brother named Jem. The story is about life in the 1960's in the south and how a black man named Tom Robinson and other blacks were treated. Loyal and trusting, Scout and Jem are very close and help each other through a lot. A very exciting part in To Kill a Mockingbird is when Jem and his friend run through their supposed crazy neighbor's house to catch a glimpse of the man while Scout followed them. Then there is a shotgun shot and the group run for their lives escaping death. To Kill a Mockingbird is a very interesting and fulfilling novel and I highly recommend it for all kids above the age of eleven."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The thing that you carry with yourself in the book is the innocense with which the entire story is narrated. Scout Finch, a eight year old girl narrates her experience of joy, sadness, grudges, racism and above all courage. Atticus Finch, her father and a lawyer is up trying to save a black man from being wrongly accused of rape of a white woman.As the events happen, one feels the ugly side of human beings. The narration from the eyes of a child adds to the questions that are being silently asked in the book. There were lots of plots in the book, being Jill Harris, scout's friend, Boo Radly and the child's obession to drag Boo out of his house.The interaction of Jem, scouts brother and scout herself deserves a lot of credit for the overall outcome of the book. This is one book nobody should miss. If you haven't read it, you has certainly missed something."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"As if anyone needs to be told how brilliant this story is. I just had to put a word of honour in.With a brilliantly dramatic, funny and at times creepy plot, Harper Lee gave the world one of the most fantastic books ever written.And its no wonder that with over 30, 000, 000 million copies of this book sold worldwide that she never wrote another novel!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This 1960's classic, taking place in the Southern town of Maycomb, tells the story of three children as they grow ever stronger as they overcome many obstacles- including racism, moral values, life without a mother, and a court trial against Tom Robinson- a black man accused of raping and beating Mayella Ewell, the daughter of Bob Ewell- and his attorney Atticus Finch- the father of two of the characters, Jem and Jean-Louis (Scout) Finch. Jem and Scout must learn to deal with the harsh disapproval the town and the rest of their family has with their father. Their best friend Dill Harris, who lives in Mobile, joins the Finch's in the summer. The three friends make up to play outside, to make the summer days pass in a pleasant manner. But when summer's over, it's back to school where Jem gets along fine, but Scout struggles to get along with the other students who make fun of her father and her teacher, Miss Stephanie Crawford. Fires, gunshots, threats, lies, and a dramatic court case cause uproars in the town, and the three friends grow closer everyday.When I read this book, I couldn't bear to put it down, and was often dying to pick it up again when I had the chance. If you would like to hear a story about growing up, human dignity, virtue and wisdom, compassion and cruelty, love and hatred, wit and misery, lose yourself within the pages of this award-winning best seller!The New York Times: \\"Marvelous...

She lives in Alabama with her 13-year-old brother, Jem, and her father, Atticus. Jem and Scout spend their summers playing with their friend, Dill, and trying to be brave enough to get Boo Radley, their odd neighbor, to come out of his house - they have never even seen the man. The following fall, Atticus, who is a lawyer, takes on a case defending a black man, Tom Robinson, accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell. During everything taking place before the trial, Atticus tries to teach his children about true courage and not to judge anyone else until they've walked a day in the other person's shoes.I would give To Kill a Mockingbird an 8 out of 10 because although it is an easy book to read and is pretty short, it's packed full of characters that, although they are basically good people at heart, are constantly being challenged to show their goodness to their neighbors, whether they be black or white. This story challenges the reader to rethink prejudices and judgments that adults so easily pass on others and instead view everyone with the innocent eyes of a child."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To kill a mocking bird BY Harper LeeBY Muireann CostiganThis exciting story is set in Maycomb, Alabama in the mid 1930's.

This trial is about a black man being accused of raping a white woman.I thought the characters in this book were brilliant. Scout was an eight-year-old girl.

He also wanted to be a lawyer like his father. Atticus was their father and he was a lawyer defending Tom Robinson, as he was being accused of raping Mayella Ewell.

One in particular is racism and is extremely common in today'sSociety.I can safely say I found no faults with this book. It was absolutely fantastic. I definitely advise you to read it!

The symbols and underlying themes are told through the innocence of the young child, Scout. This brings an interesting point of view to the story because she does not understand the stereotypes that exist in her small town. She also doesn't realize that complications that her dad, a lawyer faces. Social standings and relationships between family, friends, and neighbors are explored in this story. The book starts at the end of the story, and there is a flashback through all of Scout's adventures. This book is an exciting collection of events in Scout 's life that together reflect on society as a whole. This social commentary by Harper Lee, shows how a young girl who hasn 't been subjected to the prejudicial views of society is able to judge character better than wise adults that have been through many experiences.

Her father was a lawyer for a negroe who was convicted of rape on a white woman. Atticus gets called a lot of names that his children don't like, but they learn to understand that they need to just ignore it. I really liked this book because it teaches about life.

Scout, a main character and the narrator imposed innoncence in this story. Even today, this book is said to be one of the greatest in American literature. Overall, I enjoyed the book and its plot, in many ways, it showed a different perspective of life. As the book progressed, Jem and Scout matured and stopped playing most of the games they used to play on Boo Radley's house. Instead, of Tom Robinson losing his life, I wished he could have lived, but this would have changed the whole story. Near the end, the climax of the book was at its highest, when Jem and Scout were walking home from a school paegent. Fortunately, the main protagonist characters are not killed in the end of the story. Throughout the book, it carries the theme that all causes are worth a positive fight. Ultimately, this book should be read by people of all ages."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird is a timeless classic, the brightest, most realistic story of children growing up that could ever be told.

The book does drag a bit at some parts, mainly the beginning, but the overall concept and emotion that stays with the reader upon the conclusion of the novel, far overshadows any down point in the book. We watch as both children and adults, grow through the pages, their knowledge, but most of all, their feelings towards Tom Robinson and his family; it transcends and develops into a love far untouched in any other novel of its kind.

Atticus, the towns defense attorney, is chosen to defend Tom, a black man who is falsely accused of raping a white girl. Some of the white folks in town don't agree with Atticus' decision.

Simply put, I can't think of a better book that has been written in English (or any other language, for that matter). I have taught it for years to my sophomores, and I love teaching it every time. Harper Lee's narration and dialogue are so wonderfully simple and child-like, while dealing with some very serious and heady topics: racism, hatred, and bigotry. She manages to make Scout, who is nine at the beginning of the novel, sound like a nine-year-old--not an easy task. Many authors who have children as narrators fall into the trap of having them sound too young and immature or too adult and sophistocated. Scout sounds like a whiny, impulsive, little brat at times and then makes the most profound and insightful statements at others--as most intelligent children do. . . . This, I believe, is Harper Lee's greatest accomplishment in this novel. Yes, she deals wonderfully with the Nazi movements in Europe, the local racism in Maycomb, and the private prejudices against Boo Radley. However, those issues have been tackled before and since. Never have they been tackled with a narrator such as Scout, however. She brings a naivete, child-like innocence, and humor to the novel and its larger, darker, deeper topics and themes.Harper Lee deserves so much credit for not trying to outdo herself by writing more books of a similar nature or even, God forbid, a sequel. She said all that needed to be said and stopped talking. Other authors might want to take a lesson from Ms. Lee. In short, no American student should be allowed to receive a high school diploma without having read TKM and writing a pretty darned good essay over it. I'd settle for them just reading it, though. . . . ."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"to kill a mockingbird is a very good book. although it is long it is way worth reading.hope you enjoy the book as much as i did"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"to kill a mockingbird is a very good book. although it is long it is way worth reading.hope you enjoy the book as much as i did"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is simple, yet complex.

For instance, Jem and Scout thought their father, Atticus, was boring and unlike other fathers until with a single shot he killed a &quot;mad dog&quot;. Lee's vivid and clear description of the events made you simply want more. The story that began with simple childhood couriosity quickly changed to the evils of racial discrimination and prejudices.

One day, a case comes into town about a black raping a white girl, and the father, Atticus, is assigned to the trial. The whole town is shaken up by this case since the old talk of the town was a confined neighbor by the name of Boo. The racism issue comes into play during the trial. The part that shows how wrong the racism is, is that a little girl, free of any past experiences or any hatred, is amongh the few that realize the extreme wrongness that is taking place. This book can be taken on at the least two levels. The higher level is much more extreme in the overall moral being displayed.

It describes the adventures and every day's life in their neighborhood. Atticus Finch educates his children, Scout (Jean Louise) and Jem, in a spirit of freedom and justice, but has also an eye on individual opinions of other people, although they might differ from his own ones. The tension between these two points, justice and the prejudices of most of the people around the Finch family, reaches its climax when Atticus takes responsibility for an probably innocent man in a murder trial. The man's only fault is that his skin has the wrong color.The court scenes are written brilliantly, but &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is far more than one of the typical court thrillers. The detailed description of the life of Atticus, his kids, and their neighbors makes the best deal of the book. In spite of the precise narration, the book never gets boring but is written somewhat in the view of childish curiosity.The well-known movie based on the novel is in good agreement with the book and also rather close to the text.

It shows what \\"tolerance\\" actually means and what \\"innocence\\" is. God, I wish I had read this before!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Jean Louise (Scout) Finch is the feistiest girl in Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's. She's six years old and doesn't care to be a lady. She wants to wear pants all her life and mess around with her older brother Jem and their friend, Dill, who visits every summer. To Kill a Mockingbird spans over a couple years of Scout's life, during which she becomes engaged to Dill, attempts to befriend a reclusive neighbor - and, most importantly, witnesses a trial during which a young black man is accused of raping a poor young white girl. These events are seen from the young, questioning eyes of a little girl who wants to understand. It is heart-breaking, eye-opening, and a book that everyone should take the time to devour._______________________________________________My thoughts -This is my first time reading To Kill a Mockingbird (people have looked at me, shocked, for saying that), and not only can I say that I've read it, but I can also say that I loved it.I was quite moved by this story. Moved to laughter, moved to sorrow, moved to anger, moved to love. I was inspired by this little girl Jean Louise who saw the world so innocently. I wanted to be like her. I want to be like her. She was precious to read about.Character notes -Scout Finch has a sarcasm that's hard to miss. It adds life to the story and made me laugh. She's one smart little seven-year-old. She understands most things - and when she doesn't she asks questions. Questions that made me think. Questions that seven-year-olds now would never think to ask. Scout is also a deep thinker, pondering the world in that innocent light that she views everything.She loves her family. She has a heart for her brother...wants to do everything to be like him. When he starts to grow up, she doesn't understand it, but she tries her hardest. Because she loves him.And she loves her father, too. Oh boy, their relationship tugged at my heart more than anything else in this story. Atticus Finch is older, has no wife, and would be lonely but for his lovely children. Scout and Jem mean everything him, and he means everything to them, even when they would like to say otherwise. Atticus very easily became my favorite character - for his bravery, his selflessness, his humility, and his desire to do what is right...at all costs.Story notes -This story is well told from the first word to the last. It weaves in family troubles, characters being built, the culture in the south in that time of history, the town's trials and triumphs, strange neighbors, unlikely friends... All of this is seen through the eyes of an observant six/seven/eight year old, and I can't imagine it any other way. It was the perfect touch for the story's progression.Speaking of the progression...it was slow. But not in an \\"I'm bored, please get me out of here\\" way, but in a languid, beautiful, floating way. It was a current, slow and constant, and it pulled me along until we reached the shore, where I sat, watching the tide drifting away, knowing that I would never forget that experience.When I first started reading this book, I expected it to be mainly about the rape trial. While I was at first confused that it wasn't, I couldn't stay confused for long. The depth and intense character development in the rest of the story led up to the trial and its outcome - and even events after the trial.One word I'd use to sum up this novel (final thoughts) -Eager. Because while the whole town is languid, underneath the surface a passion is stirring - and it is seen in Atticus and his bravery; Miss Maudie and her garden; Jem and his desire to be like his father; Tom Robinson and his innocent friendship with the poor white girl; and little Scout, who cannot get enough of her world, and who won't let it fly by without having a word or two with it. This really is one exceptional story."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is a novel that I have read countless times over the years and it never fails to connect with me on some level with every reading. That is no small feat for a book to accomplish. To speak to people the world over, for over 50 years, means that there is something very universal in this text.We are all the mockingbirds of the title, and anyone who has reached the age of majority knows the feelings that the loss of innocence, and the harsh light of reality can create in a person. Harper Lee wrote a novel that captured the essence of that most universal of experiences, and I for one am moved by it every time.I won't rehash plot points, but I will give you some reasons why you should read, and then reread, this text.The first reason is for the beautiful depiction of imaginative childhood. The narrator, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill embody most of the traits of childhood, and their creative games, and thought processes are a joy to behold. The voice of Scout (the narrator) is a pitch perfect recreation of childhood and childish impulses.Another reason is a pretty simple one actually. The character of Atticus Finch is one of the noblest literary creations ever written. I want to be like him, and there are not many characters in literature I can, or would, say that about. The fact that being like Atticus is possible makes him even more endearing to me. He is someone who is noble in every sense of the word, and serves as an inspiration for so many reasons. He is a good father, a decent and empathetic man, and a person who tries to see the good in almost anything. The fact that there are so few Atticus Finches in real life makes him seem all the more desirable to me. It is very obvious as you read this text that Ms. Lee loves this character.There are numerous other reasons why this is a stellar work of genius, not least of which is the wonderful plotting of the novel, the excellent and fleshed out supporting characters (these people are real to me) and the message that Lee find numerous ways to reiterate throughout the book.Ms. Lee has created a pastoral version of the Depression era south, and even though there is vicious bigotry and hatred depicted in the novel, Ms. Lee (through her characters) does not give up on them, or us. We and the world can be better. We just need to remind ourselves to walk in other people's shoes once in a while."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"this book was perfect for my daughers english class. she could totaly understand the reading of this era. perfect for the expectations the teacher had. would highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I purchased To Kill A Mocking Bird for my grandson for an assignment at his high school.

But I had forgotten the exact story and the fabulous way Harper Lee approached the incidents in this typical Alabama town. Ms. Harper's writing style is just so welcoming, so easy that you feel a part of Scout's family as soon as she begins to talk.We should all make a point to read this every couple of years to remind ourselves of how far we have come in the issue of prejudice - and how far we have left to go. We should also read this again and again just to expose ourselves to the quality of storytelling of this book which is found so seldom in today's literature.An excellent book!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Most of the people who gave this book one star said they were being forced to read it for some sort of school assignment.

It is easy to read without being boring and I enjoyed all of it. And yes, I too am reading this for a school assignment, and in my opinion it is one of the best books I've ever read in school. My friends also agree. I highly recommend To Kill a Mockingbird."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I have read the book before and love it! I don't really like the CD version though. The reader's fake southern accent makes it very hard to understand. I don't know why they didn't use a southerner to do the reading. When the reader pronounced \\"pecan\\"\\"pee can\\" rather that the \\"pa cahn\\" it made everything else less believable . I had to relisten to the first CD three times to get it. It's a \\"duh\\" thing but when a book is written about the south use \\"real\\" southerners for the audio book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It's hard to say glowing things about &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; that haven't already been said. Atticus is such a beloved character that people name their dogs after him. And I would have to concur that Atticus is one of my favorite characters in literature. Father to Jem and Scout and an upstanding, conscientious lawyer in a small, racist Southern town, Atticus proves throughout the novel how important it is to stand up for what is right. Jem and Scout take heed. I also adore the movie, and Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack is a must have."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book shortly after it was was first published. I was a teenager and liked it well enough, but it made no great impression upon me. I was more moved by the film it inspired. Thirty years later I reread the book and was amazed at how much I missed, what a wonderfully subtle, understated, humorous, and hardbreakingly humane book this is! Even more astonishing to me was my retrospective realization that this book was decades ahead of its time. Its treatments of class, race, gender, sexual abuse of children, and religious hypocrisy embody a level of sophistication that, I suspect, those who lionized the book upon its publication did not fully understand. The film based upon the novel, for all its merit, fails in many respects to take seriously Lee's incisive treatment of these subjects -- indeed, it trivialized much of it. Harper Lee writes like a dream. She wastes almost no effort. Her desciptions of the town of Maycomb, Alabama (the fictitious location of the novel's plots and subplots), its folk and folklore are always engaging and well constructed. More important, they lay bare the hidden, ugly realities of history and class-structure that shape the life of the town. Like Mark Twain at his best, Harper Lee refuses to let her painful recognition of human ugliness in all its forms turn into bitterness. It is always tempered by her humor and humanity. True, she refuses to accept injustice and cruelty, especially those codified into the fabric of social life. Still, the wonder of this novel is the even more important refusal it embodies: the refusal to hate those whose blindness contributes to and perpetuates those forms of injustice and cruelty. Lee's decision to employ the innocent perspective of a bright, fiesty, motherless young girl helps to keep the novel's tone from being strident and accusatory. The author, in her wisdom, prefers to gently awaken her reader to a deeper appreciation of the difficulties and importance of acting decently in an imperfect world."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is a brilliant novel, portraying the intricacies of Southern life during the early 1900s. The plotline, consisting of the experiences of a eight-year-old girl, Scout, and her family, seems so simple, yet Harper Lee creates a much deeper understanding of love and hate.Describing the events from the viewpoint of a young girl made the story much more fascinating because adults and even teenagers forget how innocent and pure a child's mind is. Although fictional, this story was so realistic and honest in Southern ways, and I realized that that's how life really was back then: harsh and unforgiving. This book really made me laugh out loud, sense friendship and hatred, but most of all, stop and reflect. Because of this novel, I feel a great deal of appreciation for our world today."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"When my mother first recommended Harper Lee?s To Kill a Mockingbird to me, I was quite reluctant to read it. I had tried once before, but I was impatient with it, and the story seemed slow. All the plot consists of is a girl and her brother in a slow-moving southern town. Boring, I thought to myself.Interestingly, now that I have actually focused on the book, it is one of the most thought-provoking books that I have read. It is not about incredible quest and danger, sorcery and knights, or massive wars. In fact, it is a story about young girl?s small ventures, which in perspective are great adventures and challenges. Jean-Louise Finch, better known as Scout, narrates the story with interesting and colorful intricacy. she tells her many tales with a viewpoint that cannot be replicated by an adult. Attempting to catch a glimpse of the infamous maniac, Boo Radely, with her brother Jem and summertime cohort Dill becomes a great mission with twisted plans. Consulting her all-knowing father Atticus turns into conferring with a great wise man. All this woven into her attempts to understand the stubbornness and prejudice of the adult world makes for a wonderfully deep story.All through the book, what at first seems like a slow plot evolves into a simple yet intriguing plot that will keep you reading. Though probably not a book for those who don?t read a lot, specifically kids, it definitely will catch the eyes and trigger the mind of most avid readers. A great book, strongly recommended."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird chronicles the lives of Scout,Jem,Atticus, Dill, and the residents of Maycomb, Alabama. The year is 1935, and trouble is brewing. Atticus Finch, Scout and Jem's father, must defend a black man for the rape of a white girl. Scout and Jem have confidence in their father, but it takes an unforgettable night in Maycomb for them to realize how dangerous a thing their father is doing.Great book.

I have read this book for school twice, and both times I absolutely loved it. I wish that people could have been treated better back in the 30's, especially African Americans. It's hard for me to say which character was my favorite in the book because I liked all of them. I think that Harper Lee did a good job with Robert Ewell, the drunkard and the accuser of Tom Robinson. There is a lot of symbolism in the book. There is even symbolism in the title itself. The main characters are the Finches; Tom Robinson is accused of raping Mayella Ewell, the daughter of Bob Ewell. Atticus Finch, a respected lawyer in town, is asked by the sherriff to defend Tom in the trial.

This is a story that takes place on the brink of tumultuous social change and a great racial rift during the 1960's. Told from the viewpoint of a woman recalling her years from the age of 6 through 9, the dialog of the children in this story can be quite comical. Scout, the main character telling her story, has a father, an attorney who ends up defending a wrongly accused black man. Scout and her brother Jem learn quite a bit during that time. What stuck in my mind was the sadness as I relived those kinds of memories. I would have been around Scout's age during that time. The injustices made me cry back then; it did the same for the children in this story. As taken from the book, after the verdict's decision came back as guilty and Jem asks his father how they could do that, his father replies with, \\"I don't know, but they did it. They've done it before and they did it tonight and they'll do it again and when they do - seems that only children weep.\\" What an excellent book. I loved it!

Read for my book club.Now I want to see the film again!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a panoramic novel; it's about all the different kinds of people that inhabit the \\"Old South\\". The protagonist is Scout Finch, the motherless tomboy, daughter of a small-town lawyer. Their neighbors are all independently wealthy spinsters, except for a man named Radley, who lives with his mentally-ill brother Arthur (known as \\"Boo\\") who we never see. Then there are the \\"poor\\" people of the South; an honest dirt farmer named Cunnigham, and a notoriously filthy cracker named Ewell. Early in the story, Atticus Finch informs his daughter that the Cunninghams are poor, but repectable. The Ewells, however, have disgusting habits, and he warns her to stay away from them.In some ways, To Kill a Mockngbird is a cautionary tale. Scout learns that friends, family, and neighbors can't always be trusted, and you can't \\"judge the book by the cover\\" when dealing with the people close to you. Take for instance the Cunninghams; the father may be \\"honest and respectable\\", yet he keeps his son out of school to work on the farm. Though Bill Cunningham believes in hard work, he doesn't believe in education, and his son will most likely end up illiterate. Another flaw of the Cunninghams is that they are easily swayed by conservative (and racist) whites who try to lynch a prisoner. Scout foils the lynching, but I won't reveal how.If you're not American, but you want to understand who we are and how we got this way, then you need this book. If you're looking to become a US citizen, read this book. If you're studying American habits, this book will reveal everything."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I won't comment or analyze the book itself, as countless others over the years have already said everything there is to say. But I will say that this is an excellent audio edition. Sissy Spacek narrates the book in a slow Southern drawl that enhances the story line and the characters. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I had read this book many years ago and thorougly enjoyed re-reading it. The same applies to my husband. Mrs. Lee has a wonderful was of deliniating characters and describing social conditions in the South in the 30s."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Although the contents of the book from a literary standpoint is superb, the reading by Sissy Spacek is average compared to other books on CDs I heard before. While she is reading from one character to another, her voice and accent does not change. It's like you are listening to the same person with a heavy southern drawl. It's rather confusing at times and difficult to listen to throughout the hold novel. I must say, Mrs. Spacek accent of \\"Scout\\" was excellent."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"My daughter needed to read this book for school as a summer project. It was convenient and quick to order it from Amazon."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is one of those books that almost every single student was assigned to read in high school whether it be a real high school or one of those fictional high schools we all see in movies and television. Woefully, I was not one of those students. And since I was (and still am) a proud nerd and bookworm, I was really looking forward to reading this as soon as I entered high school. I was so disheartened when I wasn't assigned this book or Shakespeare or Catcher in the Rye; you know, all of those books that are supposed to be a staple of your academic high school life. So, I have tried to rectify that and thought To Kill a Mockingbird would be a great way to do so. And I was not disappointed.I'm also weary of reading classics because I always think that they'll be difficult to read and I won't get through it (like Pride and Prejudice and Rebecca. Seriously, I've tried three times to read these two and can never get past a certain point every time). Or worse I'll get through it and realize that I loathed it. Which would then lead to all of those inevitable looks my fellow readers would give me when I say I HATED To Kill a Mockinbird. It just wouldn't be pretty. So, I put this book off for years. There was no reason for me to worry because To Kill a Mockinbird was surprisingly readable. I thought that it would take me like fifty pages to get into it, but from the first page, I was already entranced in Scout's world like it was my own. Getting into a book so deeply is what I love most about the magic of reading and that was really emphasized in this book.The characters were all extremely real and I loved Scout, Jem, Dill, Atticus, Calpurnia, etc. Even the Ewells, who you aren't really supposed to like, were all layered and just leapt off the page. The whole situation: the race tensions, Tom Robinson's trial, Atticus' struggle to remain noble, were all the things that contributed to make this book not only amazing, but page-turning. So much that I literally had to force myself to stop a couple of times and savor the beautiful writing.While many say it's a shame that Harper Lee never published anything again, I personally think that there was no way she would've ever topped the success that To Kill a Mockingbird garnered. Maybe to Lee, it seemed like this was the only story she needed to tell and she told it beautifully. To Kill a Mockingbird has become my favorite read of the year so far (tied with I Capture the Castle) and I know that this is a story that I'm going to re-read over and over again and pick up something new every time. This was definitely an amazing and enchanting novel."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's book is perhaphs one of the most moving, touching nd genuinley charming tales in literature. The central themes, prejudice, honor and bravery, could come off as moralistic or dry in the hands of someless skilled, but Lee delivers with pure warmth. The grave trial of Tom Robinson (falsely charged with rape by the a family that is the epitome of 'white trash') is balanced with the voice and humorous insights of Scout, the novel's nine-year-old narrator: for all of the import of the trial and the town's divisveness on the race issue, we have Scout's insights, when watching Calpurnia cook, that \\"there may be some skill in being a girl after all.\\" Each character is brilliantly brought to life, from the graceful Miss Maudie to the enigmatic Boo Radley,but perhapps none more than Atticus Finch. Perhaps the most honorable character in literature, Atticus (an attorney) takes the unwinnable task of defending Tom Robinson because if he did not, \\"he would not able to look his children in the eye.\\" Atticus does what is right regardless of personal sacrrifice. This wisdom and heart is immedialtey evident in Jem and Scout, who, almost insincitvely carry themselves with the same honor and sense of right.But what makes this book great is not just the bravery in the face of hate or the dignity of the Finchs. What makes the book memorable is the charm and humor: the games the children played to coax Boo Radley out of his home; the children's keen observations of the adults around them; and the puppy love tale of Scout and Dill. With each page the characters and the setting come alive and cannot help but evoke a smile. This is a book to read again and again, revisiting just how wonderful it is."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It's easy to see why \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is considered a classic novel and why it had such an impact when it was published in 1960. The primary injustice that it invokes still stings today. We know that the past really was as bad as portrayed in the book, and we also know that things are still far from fair for people of all races, religions, sexual identities, etc. Seeing the unjust conviction of Tom Robinson through the eyes of two children (Jem and Scout) makes it cut even deeper.The book does a wonderful job of evoking an era and a lifestyle that just doesn't exist any more. Times truly were slower during the Great Depression, especially outside of the major cities. People didn't scurry around in the way they do now, as they used their energy simply to get by day-to-day and week-to-week. A school pageant was a major event. Church was not optional or just a quick detour before your Sunday activities.Where the book falters -- at least in the eyes of a modern adult reader -- is that it's not subtle. Atticus, the father of the narrator, is perfect. He's smart, caring, and calm. He treats Negroes with dignity. He's brave when it matters, and he has a clear-eyed way of cutting through the hypocrisy of people in his town. Jem is the All-American boy, always getting into lovable scrapes, and always getting away with it. Scout (the narrator) is a tomboy with the perfect cutting response or the irresistably cut and innocent remark. Calpurnia is the smart Negro cook and housekeeper who knows just how to discipline the kids enough. The bad guys, such as the Ewells, have no redeeming features, except for Maybella, whose only redeeming feature is that she is lonely. In other words, the details in the lives of the characters don't ring true, even though the over-arching story does.It's not surprising that the book is assigned to middle schoolers today. Anyone older than about 14 would feel the falsity in the all-good or all-bad of the characters. Even the attempts to show that an \\"bad\\" person really isn't (such as the guy who pretends to be a drunk) are done in such an obvious manner that they simply aren't believable. Of course, I didn't grow up in a small, isolated southern town .... so maybe I don't know what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I've read that Harper Lee never wrote another novel, as she believed she had no where to go but down. After reading the book I understood what she was thinking. As I read the book I took notes. I wanted to remember all the great phrases and powerful descriptions she used. Harper Lee had a terrific southern vocabulary.This is a book written 50 years ago about racial injustice. It was written 50 years ago, but the story takes place during the Great Depression. It is a critique of American justice and southern culture. The story line is that a black man is falsely accused of raping a white girl. Everyone knows he'll be convicted because he is black and the jury will be all white.Atticus Finch is the lawyer the judge appoints to defend the accused. Knowing the man is innocent Atticus Finch works for to justice at great personal cost. \\"But before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a persons conscience.\\" This is great wisdom for when we face opposition in life.The attitude and life philosophy of Atticus Finch gives hope to the reader for the world we live in. (I recently have read Lord of the Flies, Catcher in the Rye and Fahrenheit 451, these books take hope away from the reader, they left me with a feeling of despair. They are very pessimistic stories.) \\"Simply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is no reason for us not to try to win.\\" and \\"No matter how bitter things get, they're still our friends and this is still our home.\\" are two quotes to remember from \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" as we too live in a world where injustice must be fought. Hate the injustice,don't hate the people.A neighbor describes Atticus to his daughter, \\"I simply want to tell you that there are some men in this world who were born to do our unpleasant jobs for us. Your father's one of them.\\"One of the most powerful moments in the film adaptation of the book takes place in the court house when Reverend Sykes, the minister of the First Purchase Church tells Scout, \\"Miss Jean Louise, stand up.

Harper Lee does a beautiful job portraying the impact society has on children. In this case she examines the social impact of racism. There have been many novels about the dynamics of race in America. However, few if any meet the \\"gold standard\\" of 'Mockingbird'. This book has endured because the ramifications of racism are complex, disturbing, and seemingly perpetual.- Cathy Clay author of Agatta"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life.To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"One of the few books I know where the movie lives up to the book and the book lives up to the movie.

She gave Scout, Jem, Atticus, and Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley, a great description, great story, and awesome major plot points. She added the right amount of suspense, drama, humor, and southerness and it came to be a wonderful jolly book. Now I can understand why it is called \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" because it was almost like Tom Robinson was the Mockingbird and Bob Ewell was a careless, mischevious person who just killed a person so pure, so innocent, and get away with it, but only have something bad happen to you in return. Since it was Bob Ewells fault that when he accused Tom Robinson, the result from the chain reaction was that it ended with Tom Robinson gettin shot and Bob Ewell getting killed by his own hand. But, like Atticus said \\"You can shoot all the Bluejays you want, but it is a sin to kill a Mockingbird.\\""},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is, in my humble opinion, the greatest book. I love the story, the writing style, the characters, and the message. Growing up in rural Georgia, this book had a familiar feeling for me and a big impact on my life. My mother read it to me before I was old enough to read it myself. I read it again at school. I read it again from time to time because I enjoy it so. The message is an important one and valid for any reader. The characters are realistic and familiar, like people you may have known in your own life. A good, good book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This edition with the original cover can be an heirloom to pass to future generations. Even though it's required reading in school, I've read it four times and find new meaning each time. It speaks to the children in us all with the imaginative play and fears we can recollect as we read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"i just love the way in which lee glorifies a humanist spirit by filtering the story through scout. the innocent commitment to equality is really only attainable in this way, and this message is the strongest in the book. there is an obvious value to reading this, which is why students still read it today."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"When I think about what makes a wonderful human being, I immediately say Atticus Finch. This extraordinary 50th anniversary edition is a treasure to read again and again. All the characters portrayed are so alive and special.And the depiction of the South was true to the time. Harper Lee is a marvelous writer who cares about her characters and her place in history."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic, inspirational story that changes in meaning every time you read it. The story is told from the perspective of \\"Scout\\". She is a young tomboy that lives with her dad, Atticus Finch, and her older brother, Jem. Atticus is a lawer that was just assigned one of the most important case of his life. He is to defend a Black man who was accused of beating and raping a white girl, in a time of racial prejudice. Another important component is a mysterious neighbor that never leaves his house, known as Boo Radley.I really enjoyed the book though at times it was a little upsetting. It was not like a lot of books where you can tell what is going to happen at the end of the book before it actually happens. Harper Lee keeps it interesting by throwing unexpected events in the story that keep you guessing till the very end."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This powerful novel examines racial injustice in the Deep South during the 1930's Great Depression. The narrator is young Scout Finch, a six-year-old white girl who lives with her brother Jem and attorney father Atticus. They live a fairly normal small-town Alabama life of school, playmates, and fearful fascination with a reclusive neighbor. Things heat up when Atticus is assigned to defend a black man named Tom Robinson who is accused of raping a young white woman. A man of principle, Atticus takes the job despite angry reactions from neighbors and potential danger. As the trial unfolds in the segregated courtroom (blacks in the balcony), it becomes clear that Robinson is innocent. Equally clear is that the alleged victim (a friendless young white woman) made a pass at Robinson, her roughneck father saw it, beat his daughter in a rage, and then pressed false charges against Robinson. Thus the story examines taboo subjects of interracial sex and white womanhood, plus social isolation, family violence, even drug addition. Remember this book arrived in 1960, when certain subjects went undiscussed and the still-segregated South had poll tests and openly racist lawmakers. As one might expect, Robinson stands little chance with the all-white jury, but hope may exist via appeal. The story thus continues in riveting fashion, with varying plot lines and climaxes.Author Harper Lee (born 1926) based her story on childhood events and neighbors from her native Monroeville, Alabama. To her surprise the book became a bestseller and was soon adapted into the powerful 1962 film. And the book still inspires censorship and controversy a half century later. Some say it portrays blacks as unrealistically timid, others say it's unfair to white southerners or wrong to use rape for controversy. Ever more reason to read it. I recall us liking it in high school English. Ms. Lee never has published another novel, but this one has sold over 30 million copies in several languages."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"What can be said about this book that has not been said before.It is, without a doubt, one of the best novels ever written by an American author.This ranks with all the masterpieces ever written."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories.

Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events.

To Kill a Mockingbird has become, in 21st century America, one of those books that kids all read when they're in their early teens; it gets discussed either as literature or as social commentary or as a coming-of-age story (and without a doubt it stands brilliantly as all three!), and then everybody just moves on. After all, a lot has happened since this book was first published in the first half of the 20th century, and our problems with race in this country have moved on.Haven't they? Well, reading Stockton's excellent first novel, set in Jackson, Missippi in the early 1960's (the time of my own childhood), caused me to think yet again about the perpetual and on-going issues of race, class, education, poverty, life expectations, and all the other tightly interwoven issues that we continue to grapple with even now, with The United States' first African-American president in the White House. The public struggles, as well as whatever issues we find in our most private examination of our own preconceptions of each other, are very much still with us, even as we have worked to correct so many of the most blatant wrongs. The issues may present themselves wearing different guises, but they are far from being resolved; these questions are at the very core of the American psyche.Read both To Kill a Mockingbird and The Help, and give yourself a little time to think when you do so. I think that these two books are a natural combination - maybe Amazon should sell them as one of their \\"Better Together\\" deals!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Sissy Spacek takes one of the great American southern novels, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD by Harper Lee to an even more sublime level by perfectly becoming the narrator of the novel, Scout Finch. Scout is only eight years old and the Great Depression is ongoing in Maycomb, Alabama. Her father, Atticus, is a pivotal man in their town as he is the fairest lawyer in town. Spacek does all the voices of these remarkable characters and they come even more alive for us. The Finches are fortunate in this town as they are making it through the Depression in genteel if not affluent fashion. The town is made of people like the Finches; and then what would be known today as poor white trash; and finally the blacks who still have decades to wait for racial equality to appear. However, small town America provides certain basics in the 1930s. No one starves or is homeless yet vivid inequalities exist. Also, disabilities are kept in your own home, shuttered up so that other people can't see your differences. Boo Radley is one of these different, disabled people and Scout is fascinated by him as the Radleys live on her street. Boo will come to intersect with a terrible legal injustice which occurs in the town, a rape trial with a black man as the defendant and a poor white trash girl as the accuser. Atticus Finch is the black man's lawyer. But this novel is about so much more than a trial. Lee and Spacek nail the universal frailties and strengths of all of us as human beings in her novel. Those haven't changed one iota between the Great Depression and present day. I enjoyed the movie and the novel when I was a kid and I did not revisit the work until recently as this audiobook. It was a wonderful way to experience it all again in a new medium. If anyone who resists reading needs to learn this book for school, this audio version could be the perfect solution."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Due to a class project in literacy workshop, we had to read the book To Kill A Mockingbird, by Harper Lee. At first, I thought that it was going to be a dull, annoying book. But, after reading the first chapter, this book taught me a lot about racism. It taught me how harsh it was back then, and how it affected many lives. Harper Lee did an excellent job showing how racism had an affect on every character's life. Also, instead of showing us only the main character's point of view on topics, it showed me every character's point of view, which helped me understand the plot. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone because it teaches a valuable lesson on friendship, racism, and trust."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In this book you observe a southern family grow up in a racist community in Alabama during the great depression. The family consists of father, Atticus Finch, who is a lawyer with high moral standards (not a racist). A sister/daughter, Louise Scout Finch a.k.a Scout, and a brother/son, Jem. In this book the family suffers hate from some people in the community and love from others because Atticus is lawyering for a black man wrongly accused of rape. Mean while Jem and Scout are trying to catch a glimpse of Boo Radley, a boy rumored to have stabbed his father.I thought this book was one of the greatest books of all time. Not only does this book have great morals (Mainly from Atticus, Jem, Scout, and Boo Radley. Many of the other people have bad racist morals) but it has a wonderfully descriptive, lengthy, and interesting plot. I would give this book two thumbs up, 10 out of 10, and five stars all at once. My favorite part of the book was the act of symbolism. By this I mean that a mockingbird symbolizes Boo Radley and Tom Robinson (the black man accused of rape). I believe it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because it has not done anything to deserve death and that people need to learn to treat things that they don't understand with love and respect"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Sissy Spacek is the perfect narrator for this novel! This is the most expensive audiobook I've ever purchased and it was well worth it. My son is 13 and when it came time for him to read this classic American literature, we decided listen to it together in the car during our daily commute. We both enjoyed it immensely. Spacek's narration added a rich dimension to this terrific novel for me, as one familiar with the book, and for my son, who was new to it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"One of the best books I've read.

It's about a little girl growing up in a harsh world and dealing with many deaths, drama, and racism.My Opinion ;; For being a fictional book it had a very real feeling to me and I love those kind's of books because it doesn't make it seem so obvious that it's fictional. Most people don't like books that don't seem real because it makes it seem like it could never happen in real life. I liked the dialog that the author used because it made the book seem not so boring. If she would've used no dialog then it would've made the book really boring and it wouldn't have got the readers attention. The book was very intense because you never really knew what was going to happen next, it's like it left you guessing after each chapter, so not only was it intense, but it was also unpredictable too. I liked how even though they had all this drama, betrayal, racism, and hate they also added in some mystery which usually gets the readers attention more easily because it hooks them and when your hooked you really don't want to stop reading which is what I did, I got hooked and didn't really want to stop reading the book because I wanted to know what was going to happen next and when I found out they left me with another cliff hanger so I had to keep reading more and more, and it just kept going on and on untill the end.

Each charactor used courage in their own different way."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The book I just finished reading was \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", by Harper Lee. This book is a fictional story, but when I read it, it all felt so real. There were many themes in this story.

Throughout this book, courage was shown. This book was a pretty good book. It will and can teach the readers many important things.

The book, by Harper Lee, tells us about an 8-year-old girl, Scout Finch, and her life starting from the summer before her first year at school. She and her brother, Jem Finch and their friend, Dill Harris, have many fun adventures, like trying to talk to the mysterious Boo Radley, or rolling around in a tire. The central theme of the book is courage, and it is shown in the more serious second part of the book, when their father, Atticus Finch, must defend a black man in a rape trial to a racist town and an all-white courtroom. In this part, more intense issues that are addressed include racism and equal rights. If you read this book, you can definitely tell what parts show the family's courage in trying to deal with their father's trial."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Scout is a young girl living in Alabama.

That was a part of why I love the this book so much, Ive been reading cr*p for most of my school days. Most of the books are poorly written and have plots that are so saddening its no wonder that so many kids are anti reading. The favorite topics for these books is usually slavery/civil rights or WW2. They all fail to send thier intended message becouse the reader wants to forget them as so as possible, but not Mockingbird. THIS BOOK IS AS ENJOYABLE AS IT IS POWERFUL.

I highly reccomend this book for the younger people because it includes action, and not just boring facts like some other books.

I'm always amazed and curious how one person can capture the myriad of people of both sexes, young and old and of different races and accents.

This story took place a while ago but you can still see how it relates to our world today in the way that the houses and buildings are scary or fascinating.A man named Tom Robinson is convicted of a horrible crime. This one accusation will stir the entire city. In a trial with a black man and a white man, the white man will always win at this time because of how out of proportion racism is.\\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" has many fascinating characters like Dill, Jem and Scout. Scout plays an important part in the story as she shows these things through her eyes as a seven-year-old girl. Jem is Scouts older brother and she always has looked up to him. And Dill, the boy that comes at summer, comes to visit with his friends.The biggest theme in this story is racism. The kids don't even realize this is happening.

This is probably one of the most important metaphorical statementsin all of American literature. Set in the deep south, To Kill a Mockingbird is the story of a young southern bell, by the name of Scout, sorting out the 3 most important years of her young life. Written in the first-person point of view, She tells the tale of her family fighting against tradition and going against strict racial morals in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama. She delivers the message of how for one period in time, she was apart of something different; being able to fight the will of the masses, and moving out of her comfort zone to be able to act on real moral truth, honesty, and courage.The 3 instances in which mocking birds are mentioned in the book, it is too emphasize on the killing of true heroes who stand for the morals that we all strive to act on. Every character in this novel has a very important role in the book, and i learned a lesson from them all. The story is full of suspense , drama, and laughter, and it all ends in a gut-wrenching conclusion that was made for hollywoodI would personally recommend this book, if for nothing else, at least for another one to add to the classics.

Being accused of rapeing a white woman puts Tom in a predicament that no man wants to be in.Jean Louise or Scout, as she is called by her brother Jem, is the main character and the one telling the the story.

It's unfortunate that Harper Lee only wrote one book, as I'm sure she could have regaled us with many such portraits of unfamiliar faces and mores from long ago. Ms. Lee must have been thrilled to have her book come to life upon the big screen, especially with such superb acting by legendary thespian, Gregory Peck.

Harper Lee does this very well, displaying how a small, rural town thought to be the perfect symbol of purity and excellence can, in a matter of days, turn into the epitome of a scum-filled town consisting of hypocrites. Now, although she writes a very good novel, the some of the characters she uses to do this are not great representations of her almost perfect novel. Mr. Bob Ewell is one example that ruins the believability and the ability to enjoy the novel. But, Lee's great story, main characters and timeless message prove this book to be one of the greats of the Twentieth Century.The novel To Kill A Mockingbird is thought of as one of the best modern novels about racism and purity. Harper Lee certainly holds the problems of the society during the Nineteen Thirties and the Great Depression up to the metaphoric light and exposes the deep-seeded racism. In her novel, Harper Lee describes her focus town, Maycomb, Alabama, as \\"... an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop . . . [s]omehow it was hotter then . . . bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men's stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o'clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum. . . . There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County. But it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people: Maycomb County had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself.\\" In this description, she shows the slow moving pace of her hot, little rural town. But underneath this fictional, almost typical, \`Thirties town lies a deep, dark secret: a prevalent feeling of racism. Minus select people, most of the townspeople have an feeling superiority over the common African-American citizens. According to Jean Louise (A.K.A. Scout), the novel's protagonist, \\"I heard...[Miss Gates, a citizen of Maycomb] say it's time somebody taught \`em a lesson, they were gettin' way above themselves, an' the next thing they think they can do is marry us.\\" Throughout the novel, signs of racism appear and whittle down to a court case in which a obviously innocent African-American is accused and convicted of raping a white woman, a charge that eventually leads to his death. Maycomb's ugly racism, as shown by actions and words from minor characters, portrays the extremely racist society of the Nineteen Thirties.Harper Lee also took the metaphor of the title of her book, To Kill A Mockingbird, and used it as a common theme throughout her novel. Jean Louise learns this when she states, \\"\`Remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.'\\" That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. \`Your father's right,' she said. \`Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy . . . but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.'\\" This action, the killing of a mockingbird, is metaphoric for the loss of innocence due to another's actions. During the length of her novel, this theme appears many times. This goes from the very small, the killing of a \\"Roly-Poly\\" [Armadillidium], to a larger scale of a man's innocence, such as the death of the accused African-American rapist and the almost exposure of a legend-filled recluse on the outskirts who preforms a heroic deed. This theme is one of the most major and important in the novel.On the polar opposite end of the greatest characters in this novel, Mr. Bob Ewell is the stain on the face of Maycomb that not even the citizens like. Comparatively, Ewell is just a more radical form of the common citizen: &uuml;ber-racist and more uneducated than all the rest. In this novel, Bob Ewell is shown as a despicable character, cheating the Government out of relief checks during the Great Depression, harassing the local African-Americans and even going as far as to convince his daughter to accuse one of them of rape to cover up Bob's beating. His terrible demeanor is most clearly seen through his final act, to attempt to harm the Finch children. His ability to mentally handle the harassment of innocent victims proves that he is a horrible individual. But, in her attempt to personify Mr. Ewell, Harper Lee overdoes it quite a bit. His over-the-top actions and his coldheartedness are a little too stressed in her novel, and distracts the reader from the main plot of the novel by introducing him in little, completely meaningless, subplots. He takes away from the ability to enjoy the novel knowing that around the corner comes another Ewell escapade which will obviously not end in his favor. If altered a bit, his character could help the book's progression instead of taking away from it.When looked at as a whole, Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird is a brilliant work of historical fiction that has the ability to greatly alter the life of almost any reader. Her themes and morals shine through in this novel and expose the bad qualities of life during the Great Depression. Although some of her characters take away from the premise of the novel, they do not block out the strength of her message that will ring true throughout time."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"... mainly because it is such a good story and so well written. Come to think of it, not much of this book is really about the rape and crime. It is about childhood, growing up and growing prejudice. It is about not only racism but also feminism. Scout, the main character, has such a lovely personality and I really started to like her. It was almost like I knew her and parts of me fell in love with Jem, her brother. I found parts of the slang a bit hard to read and it took a good 100 pages before the story had me that intrigued that I couldn't put it down. Sometimes you read a book and you really do realize why some books last with us and literature forever and why some don't. This book deals with human joy and suffering, ideals and rebels, crime and punishment and of course of race and sad part of the history of the south.Even though this book was so good (or maybe because this book was so good) I thought it was very tough to get through. I read five pages then I had to just take a breather. But after 100pages I really found it hard to put the book down. I do think, however, that it will benefit from a second reading. Therefore it will not be long until I follow the adventures of Scout and Jem once again."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I honestly have no idea how many times I have read this book. I read it first as an assignment in the eighth grade; most recently, at the age of 41, I read it aloud to three of my children. As with the more recent readings that I recall, I choked up a bit at the end as Scout is experiencing the tragedy and love that surrounds her in the form of her conservatively eccentric father, her mythically reclusive neighbor, and the whole Depression-era, post-Reconstruction sugary gothic Alabama town of her home.There seems so little to add in reviewing this book. I will say that even as I read it I ponder the strength of its charm. What is it that is so powerful? Scout is herself quite endearing, although even a casual reading should tell the reader that the first-person voice that is speaking is not the voice of the eight-year old Scout; Harper Lee somehow conveys a tone that retains the childlike innocence of Scout (the child), but the story told is mature and the vocabulary is college-educated. So is this Scout (or Jean Louise Finch) as an adult? I don't think so, as there is very little biographical/autobiographical information provided beyond the timeline of the story (e.g, did Scout grow up and marry?; what happened to Scout's mother?; does everyone live happily ever after?).I read once that Harper Lee considered this to be a simple love story, or something like that. I've wondered who she was thinking about: Atticus and his kids, or Boo Radley and the kids, or some other pairing. I guess it is all of the above. It's a simple story of relatively normal children with an independently thinking father who all live in the politely racist South of the 1930's. The circumstances that confront this family (racism of the lowest order and ugly poverty and dysfunction from the underbelly of society) are really not abnormal until the violent climax. Blood is shed; much blood. But it is all presented with a humanity and Southern nostalgia that draw us into a world - as ugly as it is - that makes us wish we were there, and that we could have changed a few things.Highly recommended, if you haven't read it yet."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I honestly have no idea how many times I have read this book.

First of the 5-6 different editions available to read on Amazon provide the best print and paper so its easy to physically read and wears well so it will last the test of time. This latter point is important for those who wish our young children to read the books of your own library. I have only recently read this Pulitzer prize winning novel and was pleasantly surprised. It a story of two young children (Scout and Jem) of the local towns best lawyer (Atticus Finney). The novels story unveils itself with typical young children events the next door neighbors who never comes out of his home and perhaps the highlight is when the children notice the town dog acting like he has rabies and although beloved to the town they know he needs to be contained. Then Atticus a benevolent educated family man who in his younger years was the best marksman in the county shots down the town well loved dog and then bury's him. The plot continues with a African American with a deformed left arm is accused of raping a poor white young lady by her father. A trial unfolds were the blacks are segregated from the white in the stands of the courtroom. There are a few stories dramatically emphasizing the unjust discrimination that Blacks experienced during the mid Depression years (story takes place in 1935). He is found guilty and then the story takes off with the juxtapositioning Good and Bad and the payment of the evil things we do in life, how they can suddenly right themselves. It is a short masterpiece some 319 pages perfect for young children in 4th or 5 th grade. \\"You can shoot all the Blue Jays you want but remember its a sin to kill a Mocking Bird\\" is the famous quote from the novel."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is my all time favorite book, wonderful on so many levels.

A must read for everyone who grew up in the south....actually a must read for every American period!!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"When you're a white lawyer living in Maycomb county, Alabama its tough enough. But for a 50-year-old Atticus Finch it's even rougher. He has two kids, Jem and Scout who are in 7th and 2nd grade. As a lawyer, Atticus can be assigned to any case by a judge. Unfortunately when he is assigned to a black man's case, it all goes downhill. Atticus being the passive man that he is, I believe he accepted the case because he truly wanted it. The problem for Atticus was his kids and the people around him. Jem, who's a football star and very smart, always is defending his father. He is also good at looking after Scout and keeping her out of trouble. Scout, who is the main character in the story, is adventurous and likes to experiment with different things. Dill is Jem and Scout's friend that comes over every summer to fool around. Heck Tate is the sheriff of Maycomb County who keeps Atticus out of harm's way often. Boo Radley is a man who stays locked up in his house all day and swears to shoot any living thing that sets foot on his property. Mr. Bob Ewell testifies in the major court case that Atticus is involved in and ends up causing many problems for the Finch family. Tom Robinson is the black man that is accused of rape of Mr. Bob Ewell's daughter and is defended by Atticus. Finally there is Calpurnia (Cal for short) who is a black maid and helper in the Finch household. I think the plotline was outstanding in this book with the way that it flowed. Every time a problem was solved, another one would come up. This use of a plotline kept me interested throughout the entire book. Also every character good or bad, changed in a way through the path of the story which definitely made things more interesting.When Tom Robinson is ruled upon unfairly, bad things begin to happen. However, all of these things connect directly back to Atticus. Although problems keep happening to Atticus, he ignores them or tries to find the positive side of things. I liked this because he did not act out of anger. One thing that I did not like about the book was the things that seemed to have nothing to do with the final outcome of the book. This made it seem slow moving and boring at times. Overall I give this book a rating of 8 out of 10. What will be Tom Robinson's final fate be? More importantly what will Atticus' final fate be? Read to find out."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"One of the biggest daily challenges high school students face is the struggle to be accepted. As high school students reading Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird, we are reminded of the progressive thinking of the 1960s. Many of the lessons Atticus teaches Scout represent the values of this era. In the 60s, acceptance and love were upheld and the Civil Rights movement became apparent in everyday lives of Americans.In TKAM, Atticus addresses these morals, such as when Atticus advises Scout not to call African-Americans the n-word. Atticus explains that just because people are different doesn't mean that they should be shunned and disrespected. This is an ideal of the 60s, as shown by the progress of the Civil Rights Movement.Another of the 1960s values shown in Atticus' teachings is displayed when he says to Scout, \\"You just hold your head high and keep those fists down.\\" The anti violence concept that Atticus preaches was prevalent in the 1960s culture. Many people advocated an anti-war stance which called for peace and unity over violence. We find that To Kill a Mockingbird manifests the ideals of the 1960s which are still valuable today.By Louise G, Greg S, Talia M, Gabe P, and Larisa A"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, details the story of a young girl living in Maycomb, Alabama. this girl must learn to cope with the issues of racism and classism within her community.

Scout, being a rambunctious and feisty youngster, is forced to change her aggressive lifestyle due to constant teasing from her fellow classmates.

How I managed to get through school without reading this is a mystery, but the loss was very much mine. This book is a treasure.Set in the deep South in the 1930's, this book clearly describes both the extreme poverty and the prevalent racism of that period. Yet, this is a hopeful story that shows that even in the midst of these conditions, there are good people who will stand up for what is right. Well written, with terrific imagery, this book is both easy to read and gripping in its emotional content. The story is narrated from a child's point of view, and we witness her growing awareness of the racist issues dividing her community. Her loss of innocence is tempered by her respect for her father and his compassion.This book addresses important issues about compassion and fairness, and how they can be used to fight hatred. It shows that even in times and places of great prejudice, there can still exist individuals who can rise above these evils."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I've probably read over 1,000 novels and though I love to read them, very few get my unqualified approval. When a novel breaks into my top ten, it's a big event. When a novel contends for my number one spot, it's an earth-shaking event in my world of books. Such was the case when I recently read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" for the first time.The writing and the novelistic construction are near-perfect. But it was the emotional evocativeness that impressed me the most. The characters of Scout, Jem, Atticus, Calpurnia, and several others are flawless. This is a masterful work of art.So much has been said about this book in the many reviews here, I will add only this observation. I think readers are often too young when they read this book for the first time to fully appreciate all its merits. It's not a difficult read, and the moral lessons are so obvious and impressive that young readers do appreciate the book, and I feel it is good that they read it. But other features, such as the fine and subtle nuances of the relations among the children, and between the children and the adults, are not fully appreciated by the younger readers. Therefore this book should be read again (and again) at various points in one's life. It will reveal greater nuance and depth with more mature readings.This is a book for the ages.

Cold, unfeeling, and equally eloquent, it enlightens the minds of millions all over the world every second with deadly precision and conviction. But it was only when I read Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; that I understood, truly and fully the meanings of several simple words, some of which had not been deciphered by even the towering heights of Oxford or Webster. I understood the significance of the words: 'man' and 'father' like I had never fathomed before. To tell the honest truth, I felt, that all the multitudinous parent-children problems which exhibit themselves daily onto the world's doorsteps every day could be elucidated instantly if all of us chose the library, instead of the psychiatrist's as our destination and &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; as our Bible.&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, written in a simple yet sublimely beautiful language is flawlessly portrayed. Spaced out within the expanse of 250 odd pages, it describes the remarkable life of a bantam family of three in a small Southern town during the 1930s, with the protagonist being Jean-Louis &quot;Scout&quot; Finch, the six-year-old daughter of Atticus Finch, a middle aged, small town lawyer. The seemingly quotidian lives of Atticus, his daughter Scout and his son Jem go on in a delightfully lucent manner at the opening facets of the book. The amusing childhood of Jem and Scout in the small, somnolent town truly accounts for charming reading. Scout Finch is impish in her narration and her character is no contrast from that, as is clearly reflected from her total dislike towards anything feminine, her desire to be &quot;a man like Jem&quot; and her attraction for fighting Carthaginian battles whenever possible. Together, brother and sister enjoy many interesting adventures that the drab town has to offer, and of course, learn the lessons of life from their &quot;Atticus&quot;.This mundane life of the Finches gets suddenly shattered when Atticus Finch decides to defend a black man wrongly accused of assaulting a local white woman, and the small town suddenly becomes a turbulent intricacy with waves of racist emotions, tensions and anti black attitudes. Everyone in the town is convinced that Atticus Finch is nothing but a &quot;nigger-lover&quot; and looks down upon him and his family. But Atticus remains steadfast; he believes firmly in the edict that every man was avowed equal in the patrician institution of the courtroom. It is only the mild, diffident tall lawyer who has the courage to stand out from the crowd and to follow faithfully the principle &quot;to have faith in his own ideas; if everybody tells him otherwise then they are wrong&quot; as Abraham Lincoln put in. However, is the blue blood and heroism of the placid lawyer enough to vanquish the iniquitous forces of racist thought? The answer lies in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.And there always prevails the ever-arcane mystery of Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radley, a character little known before the concluding stages of the book. Who is Boo Radley? Some hideous vicious psychopath in human shape, as all the town hissed in undertones? Or a hapless victim of the mercilessness of the inexorable Society? Scout and Jem try in vain to explicate this insoluble mystery, much against the wishes of their Atticus. It is only in the final drama of the book that Scout realizes the reason for her father's disfavor. She discovers a new kind of racism: a bigotry, which exceeds far beyond the pitiless frontiers of colour but as torturous as ever: a racism practiced by the Community which ever relentlessly kills its helpless mockingbirds.Atticus Finch remains a resplendently inspirational character, throughout the book. He is the perfect father: a taintless blend of wisdom, devotion, affection and chumminess. It is he who remains the vital adhesive that holds the trio together during the exceedingly complex phase of their life, as the waves of censure and racist attitudes are in no manner lost upon his two children, who are, at first unsure as to who was right. He is impeccable at the courtroom, too: his superb manner and devotion: all add to the magic of his personality. In a sense, he closely resembles Dr. Stockman of Ibsen's &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;.This book is a treat from the start to the climax. Brilliantly inspirational, any of us who have faced circumstances, which have rendered us fighting alone against the raging Society, will instantly recognize comrades in Atticus, Jem and Scout Finch. A song of Rabindranath Tagore can aptly sum up the book's message: &quot; If no one answers thy clarion call then walk alone in the darkness.&quot;"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Not to like this book. Harper Lee's semi autobiographical Pulitzer Prize winner is a superb account of bigotry and injustice set in 1930's Alabama as viewed through the eyes of children.The hero of this moral fable is lawyer Atticus Finch, who sets the small town of Maycomb ablaze with controversy when he agrees to defend Tom Robinson, a crippled Negro who is accused of raping a white woman.But this isn't just a story about Tom Robinson. It's also a coming of age story, a story which blatantly illustrates the fact that we learn something new every day, and that we must never judge situations or people by appearances. Tom Robinson, a simple, hardworking Negro, is judged by the colour of his skin, and by the oft held assumption that ALL Negroes lie, that ALL Negroes are evil and dangerous, that no white woman is safe around a Negro male. And Boo Radley, the subject of decades long gossip and innuendo, is judged by the children - Jem and Scout Finch and Dill Harris - as being a bogeyman, a malevolent being who has dedicated his life to the pursuit of evil. Yet, unbeknown to them, he is their secret benefactor, and someday he shall literally save their lives.Disappointingly, this is Harper Lee's only novel. But then, any follow up to this superlative effort would surely have been inferior. It's hard to believe that Lee was an adult when she wrote this - her ability to describe the world and its idiosyncracies as seen through the unjaded, uncynical perspective of a child is one of the most memorable and enduring pieces of literature ever penned, provoking thoughts in the reader like &quot;What is truth?&quot; and &quot;What is just and right?&quot;"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird was a very enjoyable book. Harper Lee created a phenomenal page turner. It is hard to believe, however, that she wrote it over 40 years ago.

This is a tribute to the skills of Harper Lee.The way the characters are introduced and woven into the storyline was exhilarating. The rarely seen Boo Radley, for example, is one of the most important characters, even though he does not appear until the last chapters of the book. The author makes him a presence early on, through the children's imaginations. Boo remains in the reader's imagination from that point.The trial scenes stuck out the most as being a memorable part of the book. The detail that Harper Lee used placed you in the balcony with Jem, Scout, and the Reverend Sykes. It made you feel like you were right there, hoping the jury would correctly decide Tom Robinson's fate.

I can honestly say that book has had a permanent effect on me, one I cannot forget. I feel the strongest aspect of this novel is it's realistic characters and detailed adventures. Atticus is a character that has such depth and sincerity it's amazing. Atticus is an excellent example of someone who is ahead of their time, he has an unbelievably large amount of love in his heart, and his children really are his life. He is very up front and honest with Jem and Scout, always treating them as equals. Atticus has no problem with defending a black man, something the town looks down on him for. Jem is a great example of a boy going through the average adolescent pains. And Scout, the stereotypical tomboy, is along for the ride. Scout however, is changing just as much, and has a lot of growth ahead of her. From the beginning of the book, I was drawn to the mystery and uncertainty of Boo Radely. The stories about him, became more and more interesting and forced me to consider who and what he was. As I reached deeper into the book, I found more and more to relate to. I know I am reading a good book, when as I am reading it I can see a movie in my head. It's an extraordinary feeling to see a book acting itself out. To Kill A Mockingbird has every element needed to make it a classic, but I recommend children of all ages to read it because of how unique it is. I have read other coming of age novels, and none compare to this literary masterpiece. It provides facts about the past and insight to the future. It's a book that anyone can relate to. I found myself witting down quotes from the book, because some of the things in it left me speechless. I found that so many things in this book remind me of my childhood. It lets you see the world from the objective of a child, something many people forget. With an emotional end, and a wonderful flowing of incidents, To Kill A Mockingbird gives everything anyone would need to know about Maccob County ,and the word itself. Possibly the greatest work I have ever laid eyes upon, I recommend this book for anyone, who has the patience for something different."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I have read this book 8 times and am reading it for the ninth time in my highschool novels class.

It is a wonderful book written from the eyes of a child, putting you in her world. Scout and Jem are two very well developed characters that you see grow and mature through the three year time span in which the novel covers. Their father, Atticus, is a great example of how the perfect parent should be. He treats the children as young adults; allowing them to make their own decisions. Just reading about the children's mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley, brought back many childhood memories. I truly enjoyed the beginning when all that Jem, Scout, and Dill wanted to do was sneak a peak at Boo. Although the book takes a turn into another direction with Tom Robinson's trial, the ending joins both plots together, making one brilliant masterpiece. I recommend it for anyone who had a curiousity when they were younger."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I first read this book in fifth grade, as an assignment for school.

Despite its inhabitants who claim absolute faith in Christianity, they ostracise and judge others just because of their different lifestyles and behaviour. Arthur (or Boo) Radley is one of those who have suffered. He is deprived of his desperate attemps to communicate with the outside world just because of a petty crime he committed as a juvenile. Other mockingbirds include Dill, Mayella and Tom Robinson (whose court case reveals the humanity, as well as, the ugliness in the town). Hypocrisy, racism and growing up are the important themes emphasised.An awesome read for all ages. One'll love and loathe the various characters.

She lives with her widowed lawyer father, Atticus, and her older brother, Jem.

I was skeptical when we found the audio book because so many times the reader gets in the way of the story. Happily, this wasn't the case with this audio book. Roses Pritchard perfectly captures Harper Lee's distinctive and straightforward voice, finding all the subtle nuances and bringing that small southern town to life.

It's definitely one of the best modern novels that have been written! For those of you that haven't the slightest clue what this book is about...TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a story of growing up, the childhood of Scout and Jem Finch in a small town in Alabama in the 1930's. Their father, Atticus, is a respectable lawyer, given the job of defending Tom Robinson, a black man who is accused of raping a white woman. It's a very dark theme that inhabits this innocent world of youthfulness, but that is part of the plot: to describe the loss of innocence and the maturing of the children in their views and actions in the face of various social issues such as prejudice and class distinction. While being told from a child's point of view runs really deep and you'll be surprised by how intelligent Scout and Jem are. The title, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is explained on pg. 90 of the book, declaring the sin of murdering the helpless and innocent. The story is told in a flashback, by Scout, who recounts the events between her 5 and 9 years of age, the events leading up to her brother Jem's broken arm....Now don't think this book is totally dreary and hateful - most of the characters (like Scout, Jem, and Dill) are really pleasant and incredibly entertaining. The story takes on the real life approach but it is most relevant and I truly agree that this book is a must-read for everyone."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee I wanted more great reads from you!!Every writers strives to achieve what came so readily for Ms. Lee with her first and only novel.

I believe this is the only book Harper Lee wrote and what a story she had to tell.I knew very little about the storyline and anticipated racial tension and courtroom drama to be ever present. While racial inequities was \\"an\\" underlying theme I found the story much more about a man standing for what is right and his children learning how great a man he was. Tension, prejudices, and inequities are everywhere and Ms. Lee makes sure we see it in its full glory (e.g., educated vs. undereducated, rich vs. poor, wood's folk vs. town's folk, black vs. white, sick vs. healthy, the shy and reclusive vs. the curiosity of a child's mind, etc.). We all live with these forces in our lives and our surroundings and let them exist without pause. Atticus tried to stand in the middle and wear the shoes of the individuals on each side, guided by his belief that intrinsic good exist in most if not all. He believed all of us just needed to understand the other's side to make it work. Beautiful concept but a position that proves nearly tragic in Atticus' life.As stated above, it's a beautiful book. Harper Lee must have been born to write this book and she did a fantastic job. Enjoy."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To kill a Mockingbird was written beautifully by Harper Lee. Her work in this book is powerful and motivating. It is an American classic and it is loved by so many. It is a very relatable book, and it sends a strong message about discrimination and to be your own person. It teaches you to do what is right, and stand for what you believe in.We see the world, in this book, through the eyes of a young girl. It gives a new understanding and perspective of what life was like for a child during this time. We can sense and feel the childlike qualities throughout the whole book.

A wonderful book - touching, memorable and utterly enduring; a treasure for every reader of every age over 10."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This great novel is full of lessons. Perhaps it is this that makes To Kill a Mockingbird a revered and beloved classic in the eyes of millions. Or perhaps it is Harper Lee's narration in the voice of a Southern child that makes it so moving. Or perhaps it is the story's timeless ability to draw forth sympathy from its readers as much today as it did in 1960. In a great twist, Lee examines the racist South through the eyes of a young white girl.As the story unfolds, we are introduced to Scout and Jem, sister and brother living in a small, depression-era Alabama town. We follow their everyday life as they grow up and we learn the same lessons they learn. The climax finally comes when their father, Atticus, decides to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, falsely accused of raping a white woman. After news of this spreads around town, the children get a glimpse of the ugliness of racism. They learn from the example set by their father, forgiving even Mrs. Dubose, who was one of the most racism women in town.Being told from the perspective of a innocent Southern gal only makes To Kill a Mockingbird and its message more endearing. Lee's portrayal of Scout and Jem's firsthand experience with prejudice is powerful and moving. It makes me wonder: if so innocent and unknowing of a child such as Scout, can realize that racism is wrong, that an innocent man should not be punished, then why can't the adults? This nagging thought is probably what makes this novel so touching.Lee's writing makes it easy to picture the small Alabama town. Despite its many faults, there are many things and places about the town that makes it easy to love. Especially when people like the Finch's give the town an inkling of hope.What really captured me about this novel is its incredible ability to teach its readers life lessons. Through Jem's bout with Mrs. Dubose, Lee teaches us to always forgive other for their faults and look instead for the good in them. Through Tom Robinson and Boo Radley, Lee teaches us about the injustice of the world and subtly encourages us to take a stance against it.To Kill a Mockingbird will leave you breathless. It touches upon so many different values and lessons in life and unfolds in a narration that enhances the impact of the novel's message. Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill a Mockingbird most definitely merits a second and even a third read. It is a timeless piece that never fails to impress."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I know I must have read this book during my teenage years but, for some reason, couldn't remember its details. So, to read it again (possibly) in middle age was an absolute revelation. What a wonderful book. What a totally captivating story.Set in semi-rural Alabama in the years following the Great Depression, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" covers the events of a small town and some of its underlying tensions. These are largely of a racial nature where poor and scarcely literate whites seem to have an innate hatred of blacks. Thus, we see the trial of Tom Robinson, an honest but poor black man, who is unfairly convicted of the rape of Mayella Ewell, the eldest daughter of a family of white trash. This is a sad case of bad triumphing over good.However, the story has more to offer. Some degree of justice does prevail in the end. Yet, the book is more than a linear plot. It tells the story of the town brilliantly. The reader is entranced by the characters. We can see the wisdom of Atticus Finch, the town's lawyer; the violent ignorance of Bob Ewell, the father of Mayella; and the natural curiosity of Jem and Scout, the two children of Atticus. In every sense, these characters are absolutely plausible. Indeed, they are real. The reader thus feels as though he or she is a voyeur to real events. Harper Lee as the author has done a terrific job. As the work of a first time author, Lee deserves accolades of the highest order.To read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a privilege. It is English literature at its best. I feel that I am a richer person for the experience."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"\\"Whoa\\" was all I could say after I finished the novel. I reckon this classic is one of the best novels I have ever read. The words used in the novel are very easy that variety of readers can enjoy.Also, the story builds up strongly toward the theme of conscience that grows in Jean's heart and is denied by some town people. In addition, the story never neglects to work on characterization of main characters with some side stories. In their childhood, we can see and enjoy Jean and Jem's innocence when they play together. As Atticus as personal idol, Jean and Jem grow up to become caring, generous and wise.This book is also historically valid, looking at how Southern states of America suffered from severe racism. the novel follows the historical background of the states very well. The segregation, enforced by Jim Crow law, allowed the hatred and ignoring between African Americans and Whites to be formed. Through the trial, we begin to question the connection between racism and conscience. As the story develops, Jean learns conscience, and her attitude toward African Americans changes a lot. So, the book can be very educational to growing teenagers."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Around 1962, when I was a little kid, my aunt read this book. I saw the title and (in the self-righteous way only the very young have) pointed out how awful it was to have a book about killing mockingbirds. I believe she commented that the book made that very point.Ten years later I read the book myself. And have done so several times since. Once I read it while I was traveling in Germany, and was touched all the more since it is such a quintessentially American book. A striking juxtaposition to read about the rural south of the 1930's while staying in the modern Berlin of the 1990's.I grew up in the middle of California's San Joaquin valley - a flat expanse of fertile agricultural land. We lived on the edge of the country-side with a cotton field bordering our backyard. There were no sidewalks. The summer days were hot and the heat carried over long into the evening. And the kids of the neighborhood had a freedom to roam that would not be even considered today. There was a house down the street that we were sure was inhabited by witches. We braved it on Halloween, but threw away the candy lest it be tainted.Harper Lee portrayed childhood in such an adept way that the games, fantasies and structure of imagination the children built are as familiar to a California girl today as they are to a child in Alabama in the middle of the depression. I could identify with everything those children did, thought and said. It is through a child's eye that the far more serious subject matter of the book is related.So many things have stuck with me over the years. Not just the central tragedy of Tom Robinson and the Ewell's. The familiarity of a school pageant. The struggle to adapt to teachers who don't understand the cultural nuances of the class. A heroic effort to overcome addiction as a matter of self and principle. Sultry summer evenings. Walking like an Egyptian. The price one pays to learn and acquire values. Trying to make Boo Radley come out. Dill. Calpurnia. And, of course, Atticus.I was always sorry that Harper Lee didn't write more. Then I realized that she didn't need to. She'd written a perfect book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"After reading this book I find it completely reasonable that Harper Lee was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, and several other prizes, and that librarians across the United States have selected this book as the best novel of the twentieth century. It is also understandable that Harper Lee did not write any other novel after this one; she had already created a perfect one and there was no real room to improve! The aspect I loved most about this book is how it shows that when children are allowed to think by themselves, without being prejudiced by the opinion of the adults, they see everything crystal clear.Lee has created a literary masterpiece with so many remarkable aspects that one feels threatened to comment on them for fear of leaving out important ones; I will try nonetheless to point out at least a couple of them. The story revolves around the experiences of Scout, who is the one telling the story. She is a little girl whose father is assigned as the defense attorney of a black young man falsely accused of raping a white girl. The main lesson the book disseminates and the one that is easiest to grasp is that racism is destructive and has no reason to exist in our society. If you consider that the book was written in 1960, this is not a minor point, but on the contrary it is a very powerful statement. Even nowadays, we have a long way to go towards accepting that someone's skin color is completely irrelevant. Although this problem has been reduced considerably other forms of discrimination still exist and should be eradicated.It is uplifting to see a father like Atticus Finch, who is raising two kids by himself, after losing his wife, and is doing a splendid job at it. Not only he differs from the norm at the time because he never hits his children, but he also tries not to influence their ideas of what is wrong and right. Instead of promoting hatred in Scout and Jem against the people that are racist and unfair, he tries to teach them tolerance to understand that these individuals are acting mostly out of fear. Throughout the story one can observe how the two siblings go from considering Atticus an old man who could not play football with other dads to seeing him as a hero with outstanding values. Jem describes this perfectly: &quot;Atticus is a gentleman, just like me&quot;.I can understand why this book has been selected as part of the required readings in high school, and also why a lot of kids, finding it difficult to read, do not particularly enjoy it. To those of you that have a bitter recollection of this book and are now adults, I urge you to reread it and I guarantee that you will see clearly that it was worth it. If you are reading the book for high school, try to understand what the society was like in 1960 and you will enjoy this chore a lot more. Finally, I just have to say that I feel privileged for having read &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, even though nobody ever forced me to do so."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was first &quot;forced&quot; to read &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; in high school. Thank God for whatever teacher it was who made us read it. I am currently a practicing lawyer, and I have to admit that I was influenced in part to become an attorney by none other than Atticus Finch.The book is such a fantastic examination of people's prejudices, fears, and hatreds, no doubt far more scholarly people than myself have examined it and analyzed it to pieces. But it does expose so many raw nerves for so many people: the pettiness of bigotry by whites against blacks during the depression, the fear of the unknown in the person of Boo Radley, the sheer injustice of the all-white jury convicting Tom Robinson...and through it all, we are treated to the quiet dignity of Atticus Finch.The story is essentially told through the eyes of Scout, an intelligent but often guileless young girl who is frankly confused by the prejudice that rears its ugly head when Tom Robinson, a black man, is accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman, the daughter of a violent drunk white farmer.Scout's love for her father is apparent throughout the book, particularly when she watches him remain quietly courageous in the face of ever growing town anger at the prospect of Atticus defending Robinson. But there is not necessarily a happy ending here. The story is bittersweet, Atticus does not save the day for Robinson, but Scout is rescued from potential harm from an unexpected corner and learns that one should never judge anyone by appearances alone.A true, timeless classic which I have re-read several times over the years. Anyone who is not moved by this book is quite plainly an idiot."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird, by Harper Lee belongs in the pantheon of great American novels like Huck Fin. Indeed both stories are about children peering beneath the veneer of Southern life and coming face to face the ugly secrets of class distinction and racism. The discoveries of such secrets always lead children ultimately to the loss of their own innocence. However, unlike Huck Fin, Jem and Scout have Atticus Finch, their father, to guide them. Atticus is aware he can't keep the world away from his children forever. Perhaps it is for this reason that Atticus, a lawyer, decides to represent a black man wrongly accused of rape. Atticus is that rarest of people, a man who is willing to lead by example. It is the example Atticus sets for his children during this trial which will stay with Jem and Scout for the rest of their lives. I read To Kill A Mockingbird first in middle school and again years later during college. Upon my second read I was stunned by how much of the book I didn't understand during the first read. Everyone should be forced to read To Kill a Mockingbird twice. Full of profound and deeply moving truths regarding human nature, To Kill A Mockingbird is a complex and beautifully written novel.Preston McClear..."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I'm not sure how much point there is to another review of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", since it's already well established as an American classic. But here's my own take on it.The quick plot summary is that a Black man, Tom Robinson, has been falsely accused of raping a white woman in Alabama in the 1930's. Atticus (and like most people, I can think of Atticus only as Gregory Peck) is a lawyer who has been appointed by the court to represent the defendant. The story revolves around how Atticus, his family, and his friends deal with the racial hatreds and other social conflicts that result from his participation in the case.It's hard to imagine how a book can be any more perfect than this one. On every basis - plot, setting, characterizations - it is a smashing success. But I suppose if there is one thing that stands out over everything else in the book, it is the wonderful (and not so wonderful) people who populate its pages.The story is told through the eyes of Atticus's little daughter, Jean Louise (nicknamed \\"Scout\\"), who is probably the most realistically appealing child in any novel I have ever read. Lee doesn't over-romanticize the wisdom of a child, as many authors do. Any parent, or anyone who has experience with children, knows that children are NOT unspoiled creatures, free from the prejudices and selfishness that have to be taught by adults. Scout and her older brother Jem are completely natural characters, recognizable to all of us who remember our own childhoods. But because of the circumstances into which they are thrown, the two of them emerge as nothing short of heroic figures.But there are so many other memorable characters that it seems impossible that this novel could be only 323 pages long. There is Scout and Jem's annual summertime friend, Dill. There is the family maid and de facto female head of household, Calpurnia. There is the painfully naive and judgmental Miss Caroline, a recent graduate from ed school who is assigned to teach Scout's first-grade class. There is Boo Radley, the town's mysterious recluse. There is the \\"white trash\\" family that started all the trouble with their accusation of rape. Above all, there is Atticus himself, a figure of towering integrity, love, and loyalty.As wonderful as the book is all the way through, I must call special attention to Chapter 15, where the eight-year-old Scout, with simple love and unconscious courage, tames a gang of thugs who have assembled at the local jail to lynch Tom Robinson. (Classical music lovers who read this book might think of the chapter as a literary equivalent of the famous second movement of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto.) In my entire reading life, which covers more than fifty years and thousands of books, I have never read a more moving passage than this one.It is inconceivable that a writer who could create so many memorable characters in so few pages would have confined herself to this one novel as her lifetime output. But she did.So how good is this book? I used to have three all-time favorite novels (Tom Jones, And Ladies of the Club, and Lonesome Dove). Now I have four."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"There are many reviews here that tell all about this book - so I won't bother with that. However, I am grateful to Harper Lee for giving the world this timeless treasure. Thank you for giving us Scout, Jem, Atticus, Dill, Calpurnia, Boo Radley, and Tom Robinson. They are characters that will always be treasured in the hearts of people."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Each year millions of 9th grade students are required to read the Haper Lee classic &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; and like me back then, rented the movie and and faked a book report the best I could.The terrible injustice that is committed each year in public schools in the U.S. can only be righted when you go back and re-read this book without the pressure of wondering who are you going to invite to the Sadie Hawkins dance next week, Bobby or David?Harper Lee's story is both a work of fiction and part biographical. Characters include elements of her real life father (Atticus) and of childhood friend Truman Capote(Del Harris). All these characters that were captured on film are more alive and vibrant in the book. In addition the character of Ms. Dubois and her herion addiction is more clear and illustrates the pain and agony of addiction. The explanation of the the title is also clearly written and delivered in the editorial of BB Underwood the town's newspaper editor that is completely lost on film. While references to the mockingbird are made in the movie, it does not do the metaphore justice.Take time from your life, and relax with a reading of this classic piece of literature. Perhaps the 2nd most read book in the world today next to the bible. And for your reward for reading the book this time, I wont make you write a 500 word essay."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Like a lot of people, I originally read this novel in high school. It's considered a 'classic' and a book that young people should read before college. It is both of those things, but it is also an excellent novel to read for pleasure.The story takes place in Maycomb, Alabama during the 1930's. A time and place very alien to most of us in the modern world. At the center of the story is Scout, a fiesty young tomboy, just old enough to go to school. She has an older brother, Jem, and the two of them get into all sorts of scrapes. They enjoy play-acting and spinning scary tales about the spooky town recluse, Boo Radley.The other plot strand involves their father, Atticus Finch, who is the town lawyer. Atticus is called upon to defend an African-American man who has been accused of raping a white woman. The reader can imagine the climate of the town towards African-Americans at that time. The town is rampant with racism, and Atticus has his work cut out for him. Not because the accused is guilty, but because it's likely that the 12 white men sitting on the jury will convict him even if he's innocent.Lee's mastery is shown when the two plot strands come together in a spectacular way, resulting in danger for the Finch family and the man Atticus has sworn to defend.Sadly, this Pulitzer Prize winner was the only novel Lee ever wrote."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Out of all the books that I've taught to 10th graders, this is by far the most popular. More discussion comes from Mockingbird than any other I've required students to read. It's amazing to me that this was Lee's first and apparently last work. How many Pulitzer-winning authors can claim they only wrote one book? And then to have it win such acclaim! There must be good reason why it is still ranked in the Top 1000, an amazing fact when you consider how many books have been written. I just wonder how many new books today in the Top 10 will be virtually unknown five years from now. To Kill a Mockingbird deals with a number of individual and social issues. No doubt the most sensitive issue is racism. I read a newspaper article this past summer where some big-shot scholar is claiming that Mockingbird is actually racist and should be read/taught with politically correct glasses. Give me a break! Lee was way ahead of her time and dealt with reality in a quite appropriate manner. The story line is crisp and never bogs down. It will make you think, and I believe it will create an urge in you to dialogue with others about vital contemporary issues of our day."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Scout's dad is an attorney and has a reputation for winning his cases even the hard ones. She knows that he had taken on the particularly hard case of Tom a black man accused of raping a white women. Scout is confused, she has heard people muttering behind her fathers back and they don't sound supportive of him like they always have before, she wonders why.This is an excellent book about racism with a basic underlying message of \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\". This book should not be read to elementary school kids I think because it does deal with some prickly issues. If you think your kids are mature enough to handle it then knock yourself out, like I said it does preach a valuable life lesson."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The large-print, softcover edition of To Kill a Mockingbird is just beautiful. It's a very readable font and the pages have deckle-style edges. It makes a lovely gift."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel that deals with difficult circumstances around the 1930's. Atticus has two children that he must raise without his wife. Calpurnia, their Negro housekeeper, helps in raising Scout and Jem, Atticus's children. Scout is a tomboy who prefers the company of boys rather than girls; she also chooses to solve her problems with her fists. Jem always gives her a hard time and tells her to act more like a girl. Scout and Jem enjoy school, but they enjoy trying to get Boo Radley out of his house even more. Midway through the story the children come to learn that their father will be defending a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping and beating a white woman. The two learn to be tolerate to all of the racial remarks said to them daily. In the end Tom Robinson is convicted guilty and ends up being killed in his attempt to escape. One night Scout and Jem are on their way home from Scout's play and are attacked by Bob Ewell, and Boo Radley saves them. In the end Jem has a broken arm and Scout and Boo walk together to Boo's house. When Scout returns Atticus reads to her until she falls asleep.I was amazed on how exciting this book was. I couldn't put the book down. I just wanted to keep reading to find out what would happen next. It has been a while since I have read a book that I really enjoyed. The brother sister relationship of Jem and Scout reminded me about my brother and me. It is good to see that a white man was standing up for a black man in the 1930s. It is breathtaking to see that Scout and Jem learned to quickly deal with the pestering words of society, not very many kids are that strong. Racism is still around to this day and it is awesome to see that a white man was fighting so hard for a black man. We need more books that teach us what is morally right when it comes to racism. I would highly recommend this book to any person."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"While this book had a great impact in the 1960s, I didn't read it until 2002. It was on my must-read list and I'm glad I got around to it. While the novel deals with black/white issues during the 1930s, it is much more. Readers today can learn valuable lessons about honesty, integrity, and truth. It's a shame Harper Lee didn't continue to write because she had a wonderful sense of human interaction."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is perhaps the best book that I have ever read. It places you in the mind of Scout, a young girl who finds her family in the middle of a scandal that rocks her entire town. This book offers many lessons to be learn about standing firm in your beliefs, the love of family and friends and the importance of equality. Scout's father, Atticus represents the father figure that every impressionable child needs - full of love for his children and worthy of their respect. The actions of many of the townspeople demonstrate how fickle people can be. The book will teach you to open your heart and mind to the world around you."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"No wonder this story is so compelling. It's about the neighborhood where Harper Lee and Truman Capote hailed from.This is a rare instance where the novel was so phenomenal that the moviemakers in Hollywood dared not disturb the content. The casting was perfect too.What is amazing is that after all these years of legislation and social reform, the story still touches the core of human prejudice that resides in us all and the story seems timeless.If you know someone who has yet to read this book, see to it that they do; it's that significant."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee wrote one of the best books of American Literature. More than a coming-of-age tale, \`To Kill A Mockingbird' can be a life-changing experience. Her story is so simple, and at the same time so profound that it touchs deep inside.My favorite character is Scout, the narrator. She is a girl that loves being with her brother Jem and their friend Dill. And when they are together she does things that most girls don't usually do. Their father is Atticus, a lawyer that is involved with defending a black man in the court. This experience will change their lives forever and will remain with the kids for their whole lives. Scout is a very precocious child, and her comments about people she knows are funny and sincere. She has a very peculiar view of the world and life itself. All characters are well developed, but I became very fond of Calpurnia and Dill.Harper Lee's style is easy and effective, her words are simple. This is what makes the book very accessible to everyone. This is the kind of novel that makes you laugh and cry in a turn of page. I highly recommend this book to everybody. This is a great book, and above all things it is a denounce of human behavoir, and its flaws."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee is by far one of the best books I have read. I can see why it is considered a classic. I read it once before but skipped many parts and I concluded that I really didn't like it. I am glad I chose to read it again because I really feel I understand the message it is trying to send to the reader a lot better. I believe that the ideal audience is for people from about 12 up. It shouldn't be limited to people in high school at all. The book really displayed so much description I really felt that I was a part of the town another neighbor. The plot had many sub-plots that all tied into the main idea of the story about Jem and Scout growing up and learning many new things about the town they live in. I liked every minute of the plot it was exciting at times, like when Jem went to get his pants back also the fire. Then the plot was very heartwarming with Atticus always scooping the children up and really explaining things to them and all the emotions displayed in the court case. Harper Lee was also very thorough with the characterization. You felt like you knew everyone in the town and I really got into the book even more because of it. I also liked how detailed the court case was between Tom Robinson and Mr. Euwell. Harper Lee brought you into the courtroom and showed you Tom's innocence and showed how awful times were back then when the found him guilty. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone it shows every one how two children grow up and learn about themselves."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird was a very well written book. It has every element needed to get where it has gotten. It has many literary techniques and terms used in it. This book has stood the test of time and there are very many reasons for it.This book is about a family who goes through many hard times and deals with many hard issues like racism, family problems, and to deal with the loss of something. But after all is said and done they stick together and prevail over all.It has very many well-written and obvious literary terms inside the book. Characterization was a big concept used. As the story went on you felt like you were actually with the characters as they played there games or as they were in the courtroom, you got the feeling you were right there with them. Theme was another important one. Many themes showed up in this book and a couple were obvious. You have the easy one, racism, and you also have the little ones that you had to catch throughout the book. Like how reading is important and it enhances the mind. Also how you should walk a mile in someone else's shoes before you judge them.This book has stood the test of time and in my opinion everyone should take the time to read it. I recommend this book to everyone who likes to read and even people who don't because the book offers great reading material and good lessons to be learned.At this time I really couldn't find anything wrong with this well written novel. Sometimes I just wish she had written another book. I really enjoyed this book and I really didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"We had to read To Kill a Mockingbird for 9th grade. I was surprised at all of the allusions, and how deep the book actually went. There are a lot of themes that don't jump out at you all at once, and you have to re-read it to find them. I thought that this was a good book for high schoolers, but there are a couple remarks and ideas that aren't as great for middle schoolers to read. This is a good book and should be thought of as a classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I loved this book. It seemed like I could relate very well with Scout, Jem, and Atticus.

The lessons in it were not lost on me. If only all children were given the opportunities Scout was given by her father. I can read this book over and over again!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The summer before ninth grade, my teacher required that I read Harper Lee's novel To Kill A Mockingbird, and I honestly feel that it has become my favorite novel. Lee is ingenius in delivering an effective message about the effects that intolerance and racism can have on the structure of society. She portrays this concept through Scout, a young girl who is the main character of the novel. As you read, you will witness Scout's transformation from an inoccent and blissfully ignorant child to an experienced and knowledgeable young woman. It is both painful and beautiful to follow Scout on her journey, as she experiences a loss of innocence and realizes the ways of the world through the trial of a black man charged for a crime he did not commit. On the surface, the novel appears to be a simple story with an obvious moral, yet through careful analyzation, one can appreciate the profound message Lee delivers. Therefore, it is my strongest recommendation that you pick up a copy of Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird. It truly allowed me to see the world in a new light, and I think it will deeply affect you as well."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In Harper Lee's novel To Kill A Mockingbird, two young children experience the first hand effects of racism. Scout, a tomboy, and her older brother are being brought up in a Southern town in the early 1900's during a very controversial trial. A black man has been accused of assaulting a young, white woman who lives in town. Scout's father, a lawyer, is appointed to defend the black man in a trial that the town thinks is unnecessary. The author gets the point across that everyone but Scout's father knows the black man is guilty. Scout and her older brother are put in a situation where the whole town turns against them because of their father's decision. The trial is the main focus of the novel, which has some very interesting and plot changing turns throughout it.Racism has always been an issue in American history. This book represents a voice that could not be heard in the early 1900's. African-Americans were often accused of crimes they did not commit, but were still convicted only because they were black. Many were not as lucky as the black man in this novel, since his accusation at least got him a trial with a white lawyer who truly believed his innocence. In the novel, the entire town presumed the man was guilty before his trial because of their own ignorance. The people in the town get the opportunity to learn diversity and tolerance that starts to show up toward the end of the novel.I would recommend this novel to any person who can pick up a book and read. This book serves many purposes both educationally and morally. Presented by a female narrator, the book was a first of many kinds. Harper Lee took a very broad topic and created one story of the direct effects discrimination can bring on a town. I would highly recommend this book not only as pleasure reading but also for educational and cultural awareness. This book depicts a very accurate and descriptive account of how racism was a major part of every Americans' past."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"No matter how often I read it, about once every 3 to 5 years, it gives me great pleasure!

I am an English teacher and have taught this book to 9th graders for 15 years. This book has \\"turned on\\" so many of my students to reading. The best compliment they give is, \\"The movie is great but the book is so much better!\\" The lessons learned from TKAM are timeless: racial, sexual, religious, social and economic discriminations; child abuse--both physical and sexual; superstitions that we let control our lives; \\"walking around in their skin\\" point of view. This book should be read by both young and old."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I will cast my vote for \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" as the most important American novel of the twentieth century. It speaks with fresh meaning to each new generation of the reading resistant. The only other contender for such an honor is \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" These are American classic coming of age novels in the tradition of America's own extensive adolescent journey. They are the stuff that laid the first seeds of the sixties when adolescense reigned and the culture of the self was born. At times I feel that it is that 'high school book' qualification as well as the fairly well-made film, that undermines its ascendency to literary canon status. Yet, it is the 'plain folk' small town morality, as Mark Twain had proven for the nineteenth century, who are the true tellers of our national tale....The primary reason this book remains vital though, is because of its literary value. It is well-written, well-plotted and its characters are as singular as the town that is so divided. It is packed with mystery, with real and potential violence, all firsts in the eyes of its children who are the eyes of the reader.In terms of national identity, and an inclination to the notion of dare I say, something patriotic, it is in this story, its completely American moral brilliance, that I feel that swelling and stinging in the eyes for our struggle and shared journey."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

The narrator is a young girl, Scout Finch, who lives in Alabama in the 30's and shares her summertime adventures with her brother and their friend Dill. Before the core of the action starts, we are witnesses to their innocent life in the middle of a town crossed by racism and violence. It reminds us of how we lived in our small but pleasant worlds, not knowing the things that adults do. But as it happens to most of us, one day something happened that ripped that innocence and forced the kids to see the real world, in the form of an unexplainable injustice. A black man is accused of rape and murder by a white girl. Atticus Finch, Scout's father, accepts to defend the man. Through the trial, we see injustice and hatred everywhere, except in Atticus' strong attitude and firm principles. By the end, the kids will experience personally the agression and injustice of this world.Although not a first-level literary prowess, this book deserves the love most of its readers feel for it. Besides being well written, its message is universal and true. There are more elaborate and sophisticated treatments of the subject, but that in no way diminishes its value. Harper Lee is good at speaking with the voice of a child: this is very difficult and often results in corny or artificial efforts. One good thing is exactly that children's world is portrayed as innocent but by no means stupid: children are keen observers and get their own conclusions. All in all, a good novel worth reading."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"&quot;It is a sin to kill a mockingbird.&quot; This book is about justice, and conscience... it is about race, and bigotry... it is about courage, and cowardice... it is about values of the family, and the culture... it is about humanity. The novel speaks through the 8-year-old voice of Scout Finch, the youngest child of a widower, Atticus Finch. There are two stories being told. One story is about Scout, her older brother Jem and their summertime friend Dill Harris as they pass three summers together in a small town in Alabama, when they focused much of their energy on a reclusive, neighbor, Boo Radley. The other story is about the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman in 1930's Alabama. Atticus is appointed to represent the accused. The seamless writing brings both stories together in perfect accord by the conclusion.At first it would seem unbelievable that \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" was written by a Southern author, but upon reflection, it could have only been written by someone from the South. Harper Lee had one incredible story to tell and she told it well. Don't read this novel for inventiveness. Read it for the near perfect writing. Read it to be moved. Read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" because it is a sin not to."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a true American Classic. It takes place in a small Alabama town of Maycomb, with a three year journey through the life of a 8 year old girl named Scout Finch, her brother Jem and her father Atticus. Atticus Finch is a trial lawyer representing a young black man accused of raping a white woman. The entire story is told through the eyes of a child who describes the event leading up to her brother's arm being broken as the book begins it's course. There is an incredible blend of characters throughout this story including the mysterious town boogeyman \`Boo Radley'. All of the stories events surround the trial their father is involved in, and how he stands by his principles for a man he knows to be innocent despite the ugly side of generalized racial predjudice he is forced to endure as he takes on this case. The children are soon caught up in series of events they do not fully understand as a result of this. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a brilliant literary work that explores the conscienceness of innocence in a little southern girl with the triumphant heart of an adventurer. Harper Lee delivers a timeless novel about truth and honesty that is gracefully forged with the undying instruments of intrigue and heroism. Although it is set in the 1930's in Alabama, it could very well translate itself to almost any modern American city at any period in history with it's magnificent depth and beauty. Atticus is a true patriot of ethics and morality as he stands firm on the principles of truth, despite the vicious recoil he endures in his journey. A novel of profound impact on the heart and soul, Harper Lee created an incredible and unforgettable novel that deserves to be re-read generation to generation for its timeless example of fatherhood, honesty and justice. When I first read this book I knew that I had read a work of something more than a mere tale about a lazy Southern town. I was holding in my hands true beauty written by a literary master. You will love this one without a doubt. It will change you life, and rekindle that radiant spark of endless childhood in your soul. A great work indeed."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I first read this wonderful novel as a teenager while waiting for the movie starring Gregory Peck to be released that same summer. Again and again over the intervening decades since have I pulled down my hard-bound copy to read in whole or in part on a rainy afternoon because of its sheer drawing power. In today's complex world one tends to lose perspective as to how explosive, provocative, and sensational the issues of cross-race rape was in the early 1960s when Miss Lee's novel was originally published. Yet despite the sizzling if subdued sexual content and the divisive issues surrounding the book, it quickly rose to best-seller status and easily delivered the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for Harper Lee with this, her first novel.It is probably the character of Atticus Finch who deserves most of the credit for the novel's enduring popularity. Seldom has such a quietly heroic figure been so favorably and memorably described in such loving detail in an American novel as is fortyish Atticus Finch, the highly principled and somewhat befuddled widower-lawyer trying his level best to raise his two young children alone in the midst of the deep South during the early years of the Depression. As daughter Scout remembers, there was little that Atticus couldn't charm or talk his way out of. And, as played by Gregory Peck in the memorable movie, this thoughtful, moral, and courageous man became a model of modern American manhood for all who read or watched his story unfold.Of course, the other characters are also lovingly and carefully drawn and described, and the way in which the importance and relevance of the mockingbird parable is sown at a number of different levels with a number of different characters is also one of the enduring treasures found within the pages of this book. Whether considering Tom Robinson, Boo Radley, Scout, Jem, or Atticus himself, we all come to better understand the ways in which all the individuals' stories and fate are intricately and inextricably interwoven with each other and into the fabric of a particular time and place.Thus, we see the degree to which Atticus relies and depends on their black governess, and the degree to which he is concerned for her welfare as well. On the other hand, we watch as Bob Ewell acts despicably to mistreat people of color. There are volumes of wisdom herein regarding the treatment of human beings and the problems associated with trying to live in any particular place at any specific time. So well and accurately drawn are the characters of this fable of the life and times of Scout Finch in &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;, that one can only hope it continues to be widely read and appreciated as a modern American classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"\\"You have exactly two weeks to read this book and return a book report.\\"My ninth grade teacher pushed oversized glasses up her nose as she spoke.

I drew charcoal portraits of the characters, wrote an original play about Scout's adventures in my own hometown, laboriously typed it up on my Gramma's Underwood.

I did the only thing Scout would do.

I stood in line at Employment Assistance day after day, filled out form after form, met with pasty-faced placement officers and nothing, just nothing happened. I walked parking lots looking for spare pennies, enough to buy a loaf of cheap bread. Women with money passed me, didn't see my hollow cheeks, didn't notice the only dirty maternity shirt I owned.

It was everything, because it carried me through that pregnancy, sat beside me as I signed my newborn girl over to the state, held my hand during bad choices and man problems and kid emergencies and work traumas.

Through the eyes of an innocent 8-year-old girl, we can vividly see the lives of all people living in the south. Lee makes sure that this novel does not strictly focus on segregation de facto; in other words, Lee shifts the novel away from typical stories of segregation in public areas and private vicinities. What I particularly loved about this novel is the way Lee moves towards society's psychological response to plights facing African Americans at the time period.The plot's narrator, Scout, informs the reader of the south's complexity in many forms. From a hypocritical northern teacher, to the racism that destroyed an innocent man, Scout asks the reader to release all shallow misinterpretations of the south and judge it from a more complex viewpoint. The novel's hero is by far Atticus Finch, who even today has come to represent all that is just and right in our nation's justice system. Lee also utilizes his strength to portray what Scout sees as true strength in society. Finch is the archetypal man who, despite all the negative influences surrounding him, he manages to come up on top on a moral ground against the small town.Yet of course, the novel's true theme revolves around society's negative judgment on social outcasts and how these judgments reflect the nature of society itself. Scout illustrates two victims of society: Boo Radley and Tom Robinson. Boo Radley is a recluse who is the subject of town legends that depict him as a typical monster. This envokes fear within the children, who must eventually learn how to accept and understand people from all backgrounds despite what others spread. This idea is tested in a more major form, as Tom Robinson, a black man, is put on trial for raping a young white woman. Reoccuring themes of acceptance and understanding truly take form when Atticus Finch represents Robinson, despite hostile behavior of the town.Lee's writing is beautiful as it is simple, yet at the same time it is simply powerful as it brilliantly portrays the way humanity struggles to release prejudice. I urge everyone whose schools that were too misguide to assign this book to read it in their spare time for they too will be inspired."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life.To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Two motherless children try to understand life in their small southern town during the depression. A thoroughly engaging and moving reading experience, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of my all-time favourite books. Those kids (Jem and Scout Finch) are so funny and you just know that the town of Maycomb HAD to be modeled on a real town (it was - Monroeville, Alabama - where author Harper (Nelle) Lee grew up). A story about growing up and the social conscience which binds us all, this book takes place in the depressed year of 1932. The children's father, Atticus Finch,is a man who's morals and conscience remind one of Abraham Lincoln! The book is written from the point of view of Jean Louise (&quot;Scout&quot;) Finch, a six-year-old tomboy who wears dungarees: she would rather roll in old tires and climb trees with her brother Jem and their friend Dill - he was based on Lee's childhood friend Truman Capote - than do &quot;girl things&quot;. There are characters in the book which weren't included in the excellent 1962 film, such as the matronly scold Aunt Alexandra and Zeebo, Calpurnia's (the much-loved black housekeeper) son. Miss Dubose is a crotchety caution who's addicted to morphine (she falls asleep at the same time everyday while Jem reads to her - as punishment for destroying her garden). Miss Maudie and Stephanie Crawford are amusing characters. I love the part when Ms. Crawford claimed that Boo Radley was gazing at her from outside her bedroom window - Miss Maudie curtly replied thusly: &quot;Well, what did you do, Stephanie? - move over and make room for him?&quot; That shut her up. The comical moments are amusingly life-like and therefore easy to relate to. The surprisingly powerful and emotional revelation towards the end of the novel is something which one can only experience by reading literature of the top rank; this Pulizer Prize - winning novel has won the hearts of millions and will undoubtedly enlighten generations to come!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Anyone who gives this book a chance will absolutely love it! It starts out with childhood memories of Scout Finch that seem to be completely unrelated, but Harper Lee cleverly weaves them together to make a great novel. The novel's point of view is unique and is probably what makes this book a classic. The story is seen through the innocent eyes of a six year old, but is being retold by an older, more mature woman. This allows the novel to have more mature language and ideas, but everything is seen through an innocent child's eyes. It's the best of both worlds, and I promise you, you'll be in tears by the end. It's a heart wrenching novel, and though it may sound repetitive, you'll love this book if you read it!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"As a long time English teacher, I find this audio CD very good, both professionally and personally.

Harper Lee did a great job with this masterpiece. The characters Jem, Scout, Atticus, Boo, and so one, are so real and are easy to relate to. The mystery of Boo Radley was exciting, and the drama with Atticus in the court room was heartbreaking.

I felt the book expressed many questions about peoples actions and also conscience questions that as the book went on were answered. It touched on racism in America at that time. Religion and how the blacks worshiped God was also tied in with the book. ANd another thing that Lee did very well was the way she setup her characters and used her characters to show the reader particular &quot;lessons to be learned&quot;. I conclusion I felt Lee did a very ggod job on setting up the certain aspects of the story and then going through and concluding the whole story. It was a well paced reading and it told a classic of a story.

I read it in 7th grade just for a story line, but as a sophomore in high school, I read it again and realized all the symbolism involved. The characters are so broad. The lesson Lee preaches will stay with you for life. I would reccomend this book to anyone who is looking for a good novel."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Well, because this is a \\"classic\\", I will not bore anyone with details of the story within.But, I do have a few things to say about this book. The first is that To Kill a Mockingbird is very well written. It holds your attention even at the lowest points in the book. It keeps you hungry for what is to come.The second thing is that the actual story is terribly dull. While the writing keeps you going looking for what is going to happen, the story refuses to let anything happen. I can see where people could find action, but to me it is weak. After I finished the book, only then did I realize how pointless the whole experience was.It was like riding a roller coaster, but not a usual roller coaster. You patiently wait for the chain to pull you to the top of the slope (chain=writing in this metaphor). Then when you get to the top the ride is over and everyone gets out (story=depressing end to ride). You realize that there was no point to going up the hill. The ride was a waste of time. Sure, there were some neat sights to see from that height (interesting sights=minor interesting action), but who needs the sights when I wanted a ride?I just wonder why this book is a classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" at about the age of 12, when it was first published. As an evocation of time and place, and as a story of childhood grappling with maturity, it is unexcelled. It truly deserves its status as a literary icon. Like Dante and Shakespeare, it will probably survive at least a couple of centuries.But that doesn't mean it's beyond criticism. Why has no one ever pointed out that Atticus Finch does a lousy job defending his client?He knows full well the kind of prejudice his client faces. But instead of basing his defense on the fact that a man without a right arm cannot blacken the right eye of another man -- and stopping there -- he decides to indict all of Southern society for its racism.Dumb, dumb, dumb. Absolutely guar-on-TEED to get the guy convicted.I wrote a letter to Harper Lee pointing this out, but she didn't reply."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"i think that this book is ok. its kind of confusing at some points i think you have to be a really good reader and smart to understand it.i think that the book has a good point and story, but some parts you just wont get. i would reccomend this book to people who like reading books about people's rights and older books about life. i think that the book could have been more exciting or they could have made it easer for people to read. they could have got rid of all the parts (suff) not important or needed. i would say that if you were to take a test on the book i think it wise to watch the movie to help you out. but all in all i think that this book was good but could have been better. but i do have a question why was this book banned??? when you read this book you will wounder why it was benned to, trust me. and if you know why it was banned then pelase post it so i can see why. thanks. read the book if you are up to the challange just joking read it if you want to read a good but challanging book. this is the one."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee has written a book that shows us the cruelty of the human being towards the black man and those who support him very clearly through the eyes of a child. Lee makes the book easy to relate to for a middle-school student, but then drones on with long, hard to comprehend speeches that bore the reader. However, Lee then fills the book with small bits of suspense that leave you on the edge of your seat. The details are vivid, and paint a good picture of what she is talking about. Lee uses strong characterization so you feel as if you know the characters, but then kills many of them off very quickly. Lee however teaches good life lessons with themes you can relate to, but uses poor transitions between them. In the end I feel this is a fairly good book for a middle-school student and give it three-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was actually enjoying this novel. It deals with the tradition of discrimination in a small southern town called Maycomb, Alabama. It deals with how one lawyer, Atticus Finch, tries to fight discrimination and seek justice for a black man named Tom Robinson who is falsely accused of raping a white woman. However, I am thoroughly appaled at a gender discrimination in the novel. In chapter 23 (page 221 in this edition)...well, I'll type it, and u can see for yourself:'[Atticus]: &quot;...for one thing, Miss Maudie can't serve on a jury because she's a woman-&quot;&quot;You mean women in Alabama can't-?&quot; I was indignant.&quot;I do. I guess it's to protect our frail ladies from sordid cases like Tom's. Besides,&quot; Atticus grinned, &quot;I doubt if we'd ever get a complete case tried- the ladies'd be interrrupting to ask questions.&quot;Jem and I laughed....Perhaps our forefathers were wise.'Now, for a novel that isa.) written by a woman, andb.) has a lead charcter who is supposed to be educated and non-biased, it sure seems that while racial prejudice is inhumane, gender bias is accepted as normal and just, applauded as intlelligent, and even humorous to the ever noble Finch family. Is it just me, or does anyone else see this is an enormous hypocrisy? I actually wonder if I'm the first person to notice this."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I kept hoping that they would get to the point and give me some instructions, but I still don't know how to kill a mockingbird. Had to resort to an eHow article that finally worked."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is a true piece of literature that teaches everyone vital lessons dealing with poverty, racism, and even the way to place your self in another's shoes (Amazon.com). \\"Like the slow-moving occupants of her fictional town, Lee takes her time getting to the heart of her tale\\" (Amazon.com). This is very true: the first chapters of the novel were a little random and hard to follow, but the book really developed and by the end I could hardly set the book aside. As stated by one of the reviews posted on Amazon.com, every character in Lee's novel has great dimension. Lee has an extraordinary talent of showing off the way society was run back then by the nature and actions of her characters. Her inventive characters, such as the mysterious Boo Radley, the kind hearted Atticus, and even the weird Mr. Dolphus Raymond, really display the town's feeling toward abnormal people, especially African Americans, in 1930's Alabama.All of the characters seemed very realistic and natural, like you're reading an interesting biography. Lee's main character and narrator is Scout, who is said to behave similarly to the way Harper Lee acted as a child (Biblio.com). You can tell Lee really knew her little narrator well just by the actions Scout would take and the questions and remarks she would make. In the last few pages of the novel, Scout stands on the porch of Boo Radley, the man whom she has been deathly afraid of for years and years, and she brings herself to look at her neighborhood from Boo's perspective. She brings up the past and remembers her and Jem fearfully sprinting back and fourth in front of the Radley Place. It was clever the way that Lee pulled fourth this bit of maturity from eight-year-old Scout. Jem wasn't necessarily my favorite character, but I really enjoyed watching him grow up through the eyes of his little sister. Atticus was a perfect role to have in this novel. I loved to keep reading and see what his responses would be to Scout's questions. Dill was quite a wonder. I loved the line, \\"beautiful things floated around in his head\\" because it really displayed his character.When Atticus is chosen to defend Tom Robinson, a whole new story begins. Now the reader, along with Jem and Scout, are introduced to the nastier side of Maycomb. Racism is exposed everywhere, and it seems that only Atticus is going to stand up for what is right. Scout is very confused at how the strict and upright ladies forming a missionary society with her aunt can try so hard to help others and then discriminate against the black citizens of Maycomb. Scout's teacher, Miss Gates, tells the class America is a democracy. According to Miss Gates, democracy is, \\"Equal rights for all, special privileges for none.\\" Scout wonders at the way Miss Gates can encourage democracy and still be totally against her father for defending a black man. Isn't America a democracy... why are whites allowed special privileges? However, Lee expertly is able to demonstrate a good side to even some of the worst people, such as the bravery and strong will seen in the evil Mrs. Dubose as she breaks free of her morphine addiction (Amazon.com). In the end, Scout finally realizes that even the cruelest people have a hidden kindness in their hearts (Amazon.com).Of all the reviews that I searched for of To Kill a Mockingbird, not a single one had any sort of negativity. To Kill a Mockingbird was the only book that Harper Lee has ever published, and with this one book she has won a Pultzer prize and her book has been made into an Oscar winning film (Biblio.com). Overall, Lee was brilliant in the way she was able to lead us through the tough era of the Depression, full of racism and merciless judgments and hateful rumors, behind the eyes of a young girl with a strong heart...much like her father."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"i have to read this book for school. i have heard from my mother and a lot of other older people that this is a great book. i want to know why. it is true that i am only up to chapter 8, but this book is slow moving and boring. so far, i do not like this book. i am not like most people. i saw a beautiful mind, which has won 4 academy awards and i did not feel as if it should received that many. in order to do my homework i need to listen to any kind of music as long as its not classical or anything that doesnt have words. i get straight As but i do not study and i do not pay attention in class. true, there might be something wrong with me, but i just want to know why this is &quot;such a great book&quot;signed,confused"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"For more than twenty-five years, To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee has been universally ingratiated into high school English programs. The repetitious dialogue; unhindered meandering; endlessly and needlessly branching plotline and much dated speech and setting has probably frightened more sophomores out of ever reading for fun than the Great Gatsby and Watership Down combined. But just because forcing teenagers to read a detailed account of growing up in 1930s Alabama is borderline child abuse does not mean there is nothing students can learn about good literature from To Kill a Mocking Bird. The characterization is presented masterfully; the descriptions are vivid; the narration is well done and it truly reflects the trials and tribulations of the time in which was written. To Kill a Mocking Bird is a fine piece of literature, but it's a terribly boring book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I didn't see what the hype was all about.

To Kill a Mockingbird was a good book. It was about three Children Jem, Scout, and Dill who were on a mission to encounter Boo Radley. Boo was a man who lived in Maycomb County and has not been seen in years. Throughout the book a major disturbance occurs in Maycomb and there is a big trial. At the end of the book, the children finally come in contact with Boo Radley. This book was good because it taught four lessons: courage, growing up, education, and prejudice. Throughout the book, there are many different times which courage is shown. One example is when Jem lost his pants at the Radley's and he went back to get his pants off the fence. This took a lot of courage for Jem. The theme of growing up was shown most often thoughout the novel. Some examples are: Scout turns down a fight for her very first time, Jem learns to be respectful in church, and Scouts tells her uncle how to treat kids. The theme or education was taught when the kids father, Atticus, taught them not to judge people until you have got into their skin. This is something that many people in the world fail to do. Finally prejudice occured many times in the novel. There was an incident at the Radleys and someone was in the their backyard and automatically Nate Radley thought it was a black man. Another time of prejudice is when Scout wants to play with Jem and Dill, Jem doesn't want her to because she is a girl and also because of her age. These are a few times inwhich prejudice occured throught the novel. All these themes were easy to relate to and this made the book even more interesting. To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful story that portrays everyday occurences."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The fiction novel To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the best well written novels of the 1900s.

The film pales in comparison - go read the book and share it with the world."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is another of those books that everyone tells you how wonderful and incredible it is. I read it, and... okay. It's a book. And a not-bad one at that. But is it amazing? Is it the greatest, most thought-provoking book of all times? Is it truly just overrated?We have a story where it's almost as though the narrarator is not the main charactor, but rather, her father is. The story seems much more about Atticus than Scout, but that is a matter of interpertation. It's a story about racism, injustice, and thinking about all of that. Atticus is a man who goes against what the rest believes, and though he \\"fails\\", he knows that he has succeeded by making people think about the issues they are facing.So we've covered the topic. It's an interesting topic. And the book itself has some wonderful parts, but for the most part it drags on and on. So many people love this book and tell you how wonderful it is. I know that I was expecting something a bit more, and not this rather simple book. I found that a lot of the book was confusing and strange, and this did not make reading easier.While, yes, this book must have been surprising and different, it's not absolutely amazing. It's good, but perhaps a bit overrated. If you've been hearing how good it is, don't be surprised if you feel that the book is good, but not the best book of the 20th century. If you do think it's incredible, that's also understandable. Different tastes, after all. The writing style is simple, the plot drags sometimes, and parts just didn't make sense. While I'm impressed that this was written at the time it was written in, let's put things in perspective.I do like this book, I just think that it's not a \\"classic\\". \\"Classics\\" are books like \\"The Count of Monte Criso\\", or \\"Crime and Punishment\\". Perhaps it's a \\"modern classic\\", like Steinbeck or others. But I don't think it's a classic (as most of the tags for this book are: classics, classic literature, classic...).I rate this a four because I feel that it's something everyone should read (if for some odd reason you didn't read it in high school). Whether you like it like so many others, dislike it as many teenagers who are forced to read it do, or merely feel that's it's good, but overrated, like myself, it's worth reading, not just to find out where you fit, but also to try to see and understand why it is much loved. I myself have only just realized that everyone loves this for the fact that it tackled such social issues. It's worth reading, but not everyone should expect to find it a brilliant classic, but rather, just a good old book. I was a bit disappointed when I read it, so just understand that there's a possibility that you won't find it incredible.I urge you to read it, but just don't be disappointed because you were expecting something bigger and more like the rest of the \\"classics\\"."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The book is the same size and materials as a cheap paperback.

This is Harper Lee's classic novel that came out in the early 60s and is now required reading in many school districts.The story itself is reasonably entertaining fiction while at the same time examining themes such as overt racism, humaneness, fatherly love/protection, and childhood innocence. My main gripes with this book are that it doesn't really examine any of those themes on a any sort of profound level. The themes come up, sure, but Lee fails to deliver any kind of meaningful statement on any of them insofar as I can tell (unless you qualify things like 'racism is bad').In addition, the language used in the book is clearly dated, which is distracting. Part of this is because of the book's examination of flagrant racism as it was in the 1960s and prior. Much of (though not all) that has significantly abated since then.Bottom line: Good novel that makes for fairly easy reading.

It was the favorite book of so many of my friends I decided to turn aside from the more &quot;adult,&quot; intellectual work I'd been doing and check in on Scout and Atticus. What I found absorbed me entirely, and although it is sweeter and simpler in its characterizations of our human but Capra-esque heroes, it is also about continuing ugliness in the racially conflicted world we live in. E.g., Capra, with punch. It provides remarkable messages about how to be human, how to embrace what's right even when it will result in some kind of disaster--and it's wonderfully written. I love this book. Reading it was like finding a really good new friend--"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"What do you do when you sit down to write a book and you get it absolutely perfect the first time? Unfortunately, you never write another one. How could Harper Lee have possibly followed this up? Anything she wrote after \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" would have been anticlimax. So on the strength of one book, Harper Lee will be forever remembered for writing one of the greatest books of the contemporary American literature.I picked up this book late one night the year it was first published, after my mom had been raving about the book for weeks, trying to get me to read it. Well, what the heck, the late movie was boring that evening... next thing I knew, it was two o'clock in the morning and I had just turned the final page on what was the most magical reading experience of my entire life.From the opening line, \\"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow...\\" Lee hooks the reader with a deceptively simple story of a Southern family and a Southern town caught up in a cataclysmic moral crisis, and keeps us enthralled till the very last word. Lee's writing style is that of the storyteller who mesmerizes her audience telling a tale so simple, yet so compelling, that you never want it to end. Her narrator is Scout Finch, a delightfully devilish little tomboy who sees her world through the all-observant eyes of childhood. Scout is one of the most enchanting characters in modern American fiction. She's bright, funny, totally real; there's nothing contrived about her. She's someone we all knew in first or second grade, or wished we'd known. Scout lives with her brother Jem, four years her senior, her lawyer father Atticus, and their housekeeper Calpurnia, in a sleepy Alabama town where everybody knows or is related to everybody else. Lee spends the first half of the book drawing us into the life of the town and the Finch family, Scout's hilarious and problematic adjustment to first grade, and brings us into the mystery surrounding the notorious-yet-never-seen Boo Radley. The second half of the book is about the moral crisis that tears the town apart.Lee has a way of saying a lot by saying very little, and her laconic statement that the people of Maycomb had recently been told they had nothing to fear but fear itself sets the time squarely in 1933, the depths of the Great Depression. Times were bad for most people in small Southern towns; they were especially bad for poor whites and all blacks. In 1933 the South was rigidly segregated down every possible line, and a white woman's false accusation of rape was enough to get a black man hanged. When Mayella Ewell accuses Tom Robinson of rape, in the eyes of most of the white populace, Tom has been tried, convicted and is awaiting execution. Judge Taylor disagrees, and asks Atticus to take Tom's case.In Atticus Finch, Lee created what would eventually grow to be the best-loved character in all American fiction. Atticus is a loving but not a doting father, an able lawyer, and an individual of towering integrity. He takes Tom's case because he knows Mayella's accusation is full of holes, and he believes Tom is as deserving of good legal representation as anyone else. Atticus knows better than anyone else how his decision to take the case will affect his children, but as he explains to Scout, who wonders how Atticus can be right if everybody else thinks he's wrong, if he didn't take the case, he could never hold his head up in front of his children again.Atticus knows he's fighting a losing battle, but deep inside himself he believes he may lose a battle but win a bigger war. The chapters describing Tom Robinson's trial and Atticus's defense are some of the most powerful in American fiction. On of the most moving passages in the book is at the end of the trial when the town's black minister tells Scout to \\"Stand up. Your father's passin'.\\"Along with Scout and Atticus Finch, Lee created a host of other memorable characters. Jem is the perfect big brother for Scout, sometimes protective, sometimes antagonistic, always encouraging. Lee only needs to pen a few details about Calpurnia to bring her vividly to life: \\"She was all angles and bones; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard.\\" Calpurnia isn't the stereotypical Mammy of Tara; she's a no-nonsense maid and housekeeper who dishes out ample amounts of love and old-fashioned discipline in equal doses. And Miss Maudie Atkinson is a delightful creation; funny, ditzy, and wise all at once. Anyone would want her for their next-door neighbor.The two major villains, Bob Ewell and his daughter Mayella, are compelling characters in their own right. Bob Ewell is quintessential white trash, spending the family's relief money on moonshine while his children go hungry. But poor Mayella is as much victim as villain; we can't help but feel for her, ostracized and isolated, knowing only her father's physical violence and sexual abuse; her attempted seduction of Tom Robinson is a desperate cry for love and affection. But, as Lee reminds us, it's all for naught. Tom Robinson was dead the minute Mayella, caught in the act of attempted seduction by her father, opened her mouth and screamed.After the highlight of the trial, the book might have slid into anticlimax, but it's Lee's genius that she keeps the tension heightened after the trial and its denouement, through Ewell's drunken, insane attack on Atticus through his children, and their rescue by Boo Radley. And after everything she, her family, and the town have been through, what has Scout learned from all this? Pretty much what Atticus set out to teach her all along: that you can't get to know a person until you put on his shoes and walk around in them.I turned the final page of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", unbelieving that it had come to an end. I opened the front cover and immediately started reading it over again from page one. The book had that much of an effect on me. One doesn't just read this book; one experiences it. At best, one lives it. I did.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"All the reviewers who gave this movie less than 3 stars said they had to read it for English or said they &quot;Made us read it for English&quot;. When will these people learn, you read books in English. Books like To Kill A Mokingbird are classics. This is a great book. You pepple who &quot;had to read it for English&quot; open your minds and enjoy. If they had fathers more likse Atticus they would be able to enjoy reading a bit more."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Like the child in &quot;The Emperor's New Clothes&quot;, nine year old Scout Finch, together with her four years older brother Jem, point out the emptiness of pretentious upper class white folks. The southern setting in Alabama in the 1930s takes nothing away from its current applicability. Race and class consciousness, narrated through the eyes of a young girl growing up, shows the depth of the cultural conflict as it persists today. The adult world surrounding Scout and Jem Finch in their little town presents race and class conflicts of contemporary American society in a nutshell. Narration, setting, character casting, and plot work very well together, blending into an excellently written novel by a charismatic female writer."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I think this book accurately portrayed the struggles of colored people, while it deals with life as a child. The main character nicknamed Scout asks many questions about the things around her and reveals the hearts of many people in her neighborhood with her inoccence. The social class system of the South in the late 1920's and early 1930's is shown as well. Where from lowest to highest there are blacks, poor white trash, and whites. This book has a great court trial where a black man is accused of raping a white girl. Also in Scouts life there is a scary neighbor that is said to have stabbed someone with scissors."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"For those who believe that one book can change an entire life, but that have not found that book yet... In To Kill a Mockingbird pure emotions, pure thoughts get together to changes the way you look at everything surrounding you. It teaches to love and to understand."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Without question, this book is by far the best book I have ever read. It captures the soul and describes with amazing grace, human existence in 20th century America (or for that matter America)...Best book I have ever read--best writing I have seen in all of my years."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I am in 9th grade, and unlike the majority of people my age who have read this book, I read it because I chose to. I had heard so many times how wonderful it was, so I got a copy and began reading. The beginning I liked because I recognized the excellant writing and anticipated a great story later on. 200 pages later I was still waiting for anything interesting to happen and keep happening. Individual segments were good, but just when I was beginning to get interested the plot shifted to something entirely different. The writing and description were great, but even the best writing has to have a decent plot to describe. At the end of the book I found that I really didn't care about any of the characters, exept possibly Atticus. All in all I can see the appeal of this book for people who value description above plot. It did paint an admirable picture of life in the South in the early part of this century, but this alone cannot make a 281 page book worth reading. Perhaps with a better plot this would become a truly exellent book, but until that time it will remain in my mind an uninteresting, well written piece of literature."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This was an extremely boring book (contrary to most opinions) that had an extremely slow start."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Does Harper Lee have something against those of us with failing eyesight?I have and love my hardback of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. But now I really need a larger font size. That's why I got my Kindle. I read on the third-largest font size, and sometimes (after a long reading session) on the second-largest. Meaning I'll probably never read the little-font TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD again.Note that there's not even the usual button to click to request a Kindle version.

No this book has 2 large creases on the front cover, all corners bent, and writing in/on the book. This should have been listed in the details."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Widely regarded as a true American classic, I somehow avoided exposure to this novel during my educational years and have only a vague remembrance of seeing Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch in the film version. Only recently did I come into possession of a paperback copy of the book.Having completed it, I can say that by far its highest significance lay in its timing and the subject matter it tackled. In my opinion, not only is the writing itself not noteworthy, but the dialogue is so exaggerated as to be almost satirical. Being from south Arkansas, I'm familiar with southern dialect. The extremes to which the author goes to convert the ordinary English language into pidgin \\"Southspeak\\" are wildly excessive. In addition, there are several instances of dialogue attributed to minor children that are extremely unrealistic and age inappropriate.In reviewing this work, I find myself in the same predicament I faced when reviewing William Gibson's classic science fiction novel Neuromancer. Written at the cusp of the technological revolution, Gibson's novel is startling in its prescience and cutting edge subject matter. Read 20 years later, however, it necessarily suffers, having lost its novelty in the face of actual events. It is nonetheless a monumental work. Likewise, read 50 years ago at the dawn of the Civil Rights movement, this novel would be \\"cutting edge\\" and an actual force for change, despite its faults. Neuromancer and To Kill a Mockingbird lessen with age, one as a result of technological advances and the other, societal and cultural changes.While unquestionably groundbreaking and controversial at the time of its release, read 50 years later, these strengths and positive attributes fail to compensate for what becomes, by its conclusion, enormously irritating dialogue. My rating is a reflection of the current reading experience and not any indication of the significance of the novel at the time of its release."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I had to read this for school during the summer.

Once you get a couple of chapters into the book, you begin to understand why the book was written.

The story is told by a little girl that is faced with many challenges and is discovering that the world can be really unfair."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is a classic. It was required reading for my fifteen year old daughter and she loved it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I just finished studying to Kill a Mockingbird in depth, and it is really a classic. It has great artistic unity, humor, iorny, and wisdom. I loved Atticus's definiton of courage as fighting and unwinnable fight, such as the Tom Robinson trial. This is also the case with Mrs. Dubose, she fought the unwinnable fight, she knew she was going to die. The tiltle fo the book is also very meaningful. It applies to Boo Radly, Scout and Tom. By saying Bob Ewell fell on his knife, Boo was saved for death. If people found out that Boo saved the children, they would bring him pies, this would be death for Boo, he could not stand the light. Also, Tom, because he was killed, and he was innocent. He simply commited the sin of feeling sorry for a black woman. And finally, Scout is also a Mockingbird, Bob Ewell wanted to kill and innocent little girl. Maycomb was filled with all kind of prejudice, even between own religions, such as Maudie and the foot washing baptists. Atticus has great wisdom, he knew exactly what he was doing with those children."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Through the eyes of Scout Finch, the town she lives in - and the surrounding world - seem clear cut; she doesn't see the colour lines adults do and because of this is able to form sincere relationships with people of all races. This portrayal of life in the deep South (particularly notable through the language!) is told in a heartfelt and passionate manner which challenges the way you think. It is the childish logic of Scout which makes us wonder why there is the racial tension there is.

The feelings and emotions felt by Scout throughout the novel far exceed the emotions felt by any other children her age.

The emotions she feels towards out on the porch are impossible after such a traumitizing event."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It's a shame people have given this less than five stars because they expected it to be more because they heard it was a Great American Novel.

Great movie too. Scout, Jem, Dill, Atticus, Boo.. the list goes on, but were all very realistic characters. I wonder why Ms. Harper Lee didn't write anymore.

I read it as a child and I still enjoy reading it to this day."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee, is a classic set in the hard times of the Great Depression. While reading this book, you get a real sense of what life was like during that time of hardship and racism. I liked how this book gave a wonderful view of a young girl growing up, and trying to understand this big world around her.Scout Finch is being raised by her father, Atticus, along with her older brother Jem. Scout is very much a tomboy, who would rather run and fight with the boys, instead of grow up to be a proper lady. When Atticus, who is a lawyer, is put in charge of handling a case for a black man, that's when the racial trials start. Scout and Jem watch as their father defends the innocent black man, even though it risks his friendships, respect around the town, and even his children's safety. Through this book, you will see an honest father, trying to raise two young children in a time of great issues.Young Scout starts to understand the troubles in this world, but also the good in it. She sees bad people who like to manipulate, and put down others; she also sees people like her father, who are honest, and truly kindhearted. By the time the book ends, Scout has seen a lot in her young life, and through her family, friends, and her sense of humor, she starts to learn how to handle any situation, as well as be a young lady, which will set her up well for her adult life.Overall, this is a wonderful story. You will love certain characters, and dislike others, but you will always enjoy Scout and all her opinions. This book gives you a good view into the everyday life of a child growing up in that era."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Highly recommend it. Fantastic story and characters.

The first reading was a moment set apart, the second reading was a sublime moment, the third (within another seven years has passed) may cause time to move in new ways. This novel is so good that it deserves to be the standard by which other novels should be measured.Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, daughter of Atticus and sister of \\"Jem\\" and the narrator of this tale set in the mid-1930's in the quaint Southern Mississippi town of Maycomb. She leads the reader through three years of life in this village filled with wise, loving spinsters; crabby, mean widows; folks seen but not talked about but always respected; bigots, racial radicals and Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley, one of literatures least seen main characters. The story begins with the ending and is filled with how that ending came to be. Not one sentence or word is superfluous and most are placed for optimum impact.As Scout is quite precocious, she is the best choice to be the observer of the activities and the narrator of this tale. Her youth prevents her comprehending all that she sees but her naivete enables her to speak of what she sees without judgement, for the most part, as Ms. Jean Louise is certainly NOT without opinion. For her first day of school, after her teacher has demanded she stop reading, Scout replies, \\"until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.\\" (p.20). The three years covered by the book mature Scout, and the rest of the town, it seems, beyond the confines of a mere 36 months. By the time the facts have been filled in and the reader has arrived where she/he began, Scout three years old and has \\"grown but there wasn't much else . . . to learn, except possibly algebra\\" (p.321) and can understand the power of not allowing a Mockingbird to be harmed, much less killed.This is a story of such power and hope that this present age must read it in order to be reminded of what it feels like to breathe. The cynicism of the 21st Century is deeply present in the setting of the book (1935) as it was when it was written (1960) but Ms. Harper voices the reality that life is more than the harm, fear and pain to be found in life. There are neighborly acts, days of play and hard work, families with which to connect (and distance from) and a reality that those events are what keep's one's heart beating. The story ends with the knowledge, deeply felt, of injustice unanimously enacted but that cannot overcome the possibility of righteousness because people can choose to change, even thought that change may be costly and painful.This is a deeply Christian novel, even though it is not considered as such. The novel reveals itself to be genuinely so when one of the characters speaks the truth of Maycomb (and of most of us who claim to be Christ-Followers),\\"We're the safest folks in the world,\\" said Miss Maudie. \\"We're so rarely called on to be Christians, but when we are, we've got men like Atticus to go for us.\\" (p.246).The story flows from that one passage and it is painfully true, it seems, that it goes beyond the confines of Maycomb. It is so much easier to root for, or curse at, those to do the right thing for us than it is to take action ourselves but that does not relieve us of the duty to do the right thing as well. This is a truth so simple a 9-year-old understands it, how and when do we forget it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is wonderful no matter how many times you read it.

Atticus Finch is such a spectacle of honesty and integrity that , I'm afraid, it's too impossible for him to exist in real life. Following the day- to- day activities of Scout and her slightly older brother, Jem, around for a few summers makes me wish I had the childhood and upbringing they had in this story and I feel like I'm stung with such a bittersweet feeling caught in between laughing and crying.

Forever after, and for some unknown reason, I compared all families to the Finch Family. (I was not from a broken home, and many of my friends were not, either.) To me this book didn't just cover the south, it covered the potential for hope in all families. It never occurred to me that there were people out there who had not read this book. Some years later I was talking to Shawn and discovered he'd not had the joy. I admit I nagged him a little about it.Okay. I nagged him a lot.One year rolled into two, which rolled into five or more. Every time it came up in media, or someone mentioned it, or I saw maple syrup, I mentioned it. I'd say, \\"Have you read that book yet?\\" And he'd say, \\"I see the syrup is on the table again.\\" And I'd say back, \\"You'll never know how important chifferobe's are.\\" And he'd say, \\"What's a chifferobe? Why is it in the maple syrup?\\" Once I told him it was a bug, a special space bug. Another time I told him it was a type of mystical knowledge found in the leaves of a scuppernong arbor. After a long time of this one day he tells me, \\"Did you know a chifferobe is a piece of furniture? I looked it up online.\\" I told him, \\"Probably named after the wonderful seat-of-the-pants sports game in To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" And he said, \\"Oh, I should read that book, then, huh?\\" I said: \\"Yes.\\"The next day Shawn bought the book. He read three paragraphs and put it down. This is a person who consumes massive tomes in hours. I asked, \\"What are you doing? Don't you like the book?\\" And he said, \\"I like it a lot.

Honestly, I think I was sold a defective reject. The pages appear tattered because they were not trimmed to an even depth. I collect books; this one will not make it into my collection. To Kill A Mockingbird, however, is a fabulous classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I just completed reading the 50th anniversary edition of this classic book, \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", by Harper Lee. A mockingbird entertains the listeners by its pleasant songs often mimicking other birds. The title of this book roughly implies that it is always a crime to harm a person who has always been helpful to you. This subtle lesson for everyone's life has been effectively conveyed by Harper Lee through the eyes of a third grade girl child called 'Scout' Jean Louise Finch. The main protagonist of this novel being her father Atticus Finch. Though the novel is bit dated, it is a pleasurable read even today. Let us see why.The plot of the novel is based on the incidents in a county called Maycomb in the US. Widower Atticus Finch, an advocate by profession, lives with his two children - 'Scout' Jean Louise Finch and 'Jem' Jeremy Finch. They are accompanied in their house by a cook called Calpurnia, who is a Negro. Jem is elder to Scout and they have their neighbor Dill who accompanies them during vacations. Atticus defends a Negro called Tom, a married man, accused of raping a white woman. The girl's father Bob Ewell is a notorious trouble maker. The novel unfolds how the hierarchy in American society influences the lives of Atticus and his family.I really liked the character of Atticus as a father. Jem and Scout learn a lot of good habits from them and Atticus never loses his cool even when his children do some mischief like poking neighbor Boo Radley. The entire story's soul is Scout who is the narrator of all the incidents leading to the fracture of Jem's hand. Their affection towards Dill, a deprived child, moves you. The first person narration of Scout brings out the innocence evident in a kid of her age. Other characters like Tom Robinson, aunt Alexandra, and cook Calpurnia are all very realistic. Even the characters such as the neighbors of Scout, Bob Ewell, and Heck Tate keep the story more interesting.The only complaint about this novel may be that it stagnates at times on even minute details. But all the loose ends are tied and well knit towards the end making this novel a sort of thriller. It is an irony that Harper Lee never wrote another novel after writing this one. She might have surely felt that the expectations would be sky high from the readers after producing a timeless classic like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". She might not have wanted to risk trying to exceed the perfect story telling evident throughout this novel. I liked this novel and strongly recommend to readers who enjoy English classics.This novel is really a must read as it educates one as how parents have to live by example to make better humans out of their children. It also exposes the disparity prevalent in societies across the world. There was incidentally an English film of the same name based on this novel. Gregory Peck won the best actor Academy award for portraying the role of Atticus Finch. There were two more Academy awards for this film that year. However, I feel the entire credit for the film must be attributed to Harper Lee. She was instrumental in delivering a masterpiece which may be classified as one of the best English novels ever written. This novel is an important addition to any one's bookshelf."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is at least the third time I have read this book, and I loved it even more than the other two times.

Unfortunately, I cannot say that this book [..]into its pages, a la A Clockwork Orange or Slaughter-House Five. I am not saying that I did not enjoy this book, I'm just saying that it may be slightly over-rated. The pacing of this novel is relatively tepid, how ever, the extremely deep character development is easy to lose yourself in, and the dialogue is authentic of the time period.This book is about Scout, her brother Jeremy (or just Jem), and their father Atticus. The story is told through Scouts eyes, as Atticus defends a African American charged with the rape of a white girl. The book presents racial epithets and stereotypes in a frank way, and children frequently use strong slurs against African Americans. Scout's dad is even called a \\"Nigger lover\\" for defending his client in court. All in all, I would recommend this book for summer reading."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Anyone who has seen the movie starring Gregory Peck knows how moving this story of racial hate and redemption is.

Some of the parts from the book are really boring and some of the parts are really creative and interesting. The book tells a great deal about understanding and looking at someone or something by another persons point of view. The Book is basically about Jem, Scout, and Atticus. They all learn how to love and how to understand each other. I think the book is sad and dreadful at times. They treat the man that is different like a piece of trash on the street. The book talks a great deal about racism, and understanding. It also Takes a great deal of courage to do some of the things that atticus did, like support a black man in court. I think this book is interesting and somewhat worth reading!!!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee. It is a reallistic fiction book. it is loved by many and has won losts of awards, and is an instant classic. the book takes place in the 1930's so it focusess on racism, discrimanation, and things like that. harper lee has not wrote any other books, witch is suprising because everyone loves TKAM so much. this book goes through the life of scout finch, a younge girl living in a small town in alabama. she deals with the strees of life as a lawyers daughter. on top of that her father\\"atticus finch\\" is taking the case of a black man acused of raping a white woman. at the time, rape was a Capital offence in alabama. in my oppinion it was an ok book. it has a very strong plot that has caused the book to be band in many places. I think Harper Lee didi a good job of discussing the issues and conditions from back in the '30s. I would only reccomend this book to people who like a lot of drama!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Nothing I can say can accurately express how wonderful this book is.

This story takes place in the 30's right around the Great Depression, in a little town called Maycomb. Basically a lot of the story has to do with growing up as a little kid, as Scout illustrates for us, but there are also serious parts too. A man named Tom Robinson has been accused of something that he didn't do and Atticus, a lawyer, has to prove his innocence. The problem with that is that Tom is black and Atticus is white, so defending him was wrong back then.This book is influential in many ways. One is because it teaches you that everybody has the same right as everyone else no matter their skin color. It also teaches you that you should never judge people based on their race, wealth, rumors about them or even the way they look. I had to read this book for my English class and before I read it, I thought it would be long and boring. After I read it, it changed the way I looked at life and has become not only one of my favorite books but also the book that really influenced my life.This book tells us that all people are equal. I also learned a lot about myself. I learned that I should be humble and that I should never give up on anything no matter the situation. I also learned to do the right things even if it costs me popularity. I learned a lot about others too, which is that everyone deserves a 2nd chance no matter the circumstances. I really like the style of the book, it has a lot of figurative languge and it makes you feel like you know the characters. It is also very descriptive which appeals to all your senses. This book is overall the most influential and one of the best written-books I've ever read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"At the beginning of my 8th grade year in my southern Catholic school, one of our books to read in Literature was To Kill A Mockingbird. While everyone was complaining about the book and didn't read it untill the day before the test, I went home and plunged into the world of Scout, Jem, and Atticus. I remember wanting Atticus as a father because he seemed so fair and calm and collected. I finished the book in one day. I will never forget my favorite line from the book,&quot;Shoot all the blue jays you want, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.&quot; Though many in my class did not get it, th best moral teaching I have found to date is in that last chapter, while Atticus and Scout are talking about Boo and the shooting.

There is a family of beautifully powerful symbols throughout the book - the burning of Miss Maudie's house, Jem's snowman smeared with mud, the melting of the snowman, the Ewell's fence surrounding the house, the red geraniums on the Ewell's property, Jem's clipping of white camellias, the mockingbirds, and of course the most wonderful characters, Atticus, Scount, Jem, Tom, and Boo....Want to know the meaning of those symbols... read the timeless classic!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"My English teacher saved this book for last this year because she said it was her favorite. I'm glad we got to spend so much time with this wonderful book. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down! This is a portrait of the South at a very heated time,(even Scout says, &quot;Somehow, it was hotter then.&quot;) The story is full of symbolism. Scout's narration lacks the bias of most adults and has the insight only a young child can possess. It's my new favorite book!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This very well may be the best book ever written. It moves you in ways no other book can. Throughout the book Scout (the main character) expresses her obsession with finding a reclusive neighbor called Boo. What Scout finds out, as does every person that reads this book, is that a human being is a human being no matter how he or she lives. It is the simplest message that there ever was in any book, yet the author puts it into an incredibly beautiful tale of one little girls life in the prejudice south of the first half of the 20th century. This book should be read by every person, man, woman, boy, or girl, in America. It is a masterpiece that will live in your heart forever.

The children experience many ups and downs in this book. There questions about the world are never really addressed properly. They are confused about their father's occupation and the people that live in their neighbourhood. This book makes you feel angry about some of the decisions and comments made. The ending was splendid. Although some of the results were disappointing and predictable, it was a page turner. I recommend this book to people of all ages. It is a book that will be never forgotten."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is about a girl named Jean Louise Finch. Jean is nicknamed Scout and that is what her name is now. Scout has a brother named Jem. Jem and Scout live in Maycomb county with Atticus their father and Calpurnia their cook. They are neighbors with the Radleys. Boo, the Radley's son is supposed to be mad. He has been locked up and has threatened his father. Scout and Jem, with their new friend Dill sneak up on the house and are making plots to see Boo. This book is not just about Boo and the children, it is also about segregation. Atticus is defending a black man named Tom Robinson. Mayella Ewell, a white woman is accusing Tom of rape. Against an all white jury will Atticus be able to persuade them that Tom is innocent? Will the children see Boo? Read the book to find out!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird was an amazing book, and I loved it! It displayed the many hardships of growing up, as portrayed through the eyes of young Jem and Jean Louise, &quot;Scout&quot;, Finch. From the beginning of the book we realizes that the Finches are among the intelligent and &quot;well-brought-up-folk&quot; in society, and with their name comes certain expectations. &quot;Scout&quot; is expected to act more like a lady and less like a tomboy. Jem is expected to act like a gentleman, and Atticus Finch, a lawyer and there father is expected to raise his children up to act like the lady and the gentlemen that they are. I could relate to many of these expectations, but the trails don't cease here in fact the above don't even scratch the surface, but you'll have to read to find out more. However, the main conflicts in this novel come about when Atticus begins representing a young black man Tom Robinson in court, and society turns against him in his pursuits due to Tom's race. In conclusion not only was I able to relate to this book; I also learned the lesson, which everyone should gather in a book filled with them: Prejudice and hatred toward people of a different race leads only to destruction, and the wound from such destruction is not easily mended. It leaves a scar that will last for lifetime, teaching the generations to come the importance of equality. So, if you're looking for an insightful novel packed with many side plots and interest I would definitely recommend To Kill a Mockingbird."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book in my freshmen english class in high school. No other book comes close to this one. This is definitely my favorite book. I'm glad that high school english classes introduced me to reading classics. I don't think that I would've read this book if it were not assigned. I liked how the book is told in Scout's perspective. Both the book and the movie are great. If you haven't read this, READ IT NOW! This should be on everyone's reading list."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I am sorry to say that it took me this long to read this wonderful book. I won't give away any plot, because it would bore those who know about it and ruin some of it for those who aren't familiar with the story.This is a deeply rich text consisting of many beautiful relationships. I was especially touched by the brother/sister relationship that goes through changes during the time-frame of the book, but always comes back to a very caring and loving place. I loved the innocence of the characters and how they are slowly learning what the world is about. The mystery of Boo is so tangible in my mind; I played those games myself.However, in all the beauty of the town, the folks and the family there is an ugly undercurrent that drives the story. While many parts of the story are sad, I was left with a feeling of great hope and love.Harper Lee has written a novel still relavent today, over 40 years after its original publishing. This is an amazingly moving story."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is SO AMAZING! It's a flawless piece of work. I wouldn't change a thing about it.

Told by young Scout Fincg, Harper Lee tells the story of a young white girl's exposure to racism in the south. To Kill a Mockingbird is a true heroic story that forces the reader to think and reflect."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee has created a fascinating literary character, Scout Finch, whose first person account of life in a sleepy, southern town as a young girl is rich with humor, drama and humanity itself. The novel is a testimonial to Lee's love for her own father who serves as teacher, protector and reluctant hero; and, Lee's ability to immerse the reader in the depth of feeling between father and daughter is breathtaking. Within this simple love story, Lee creates a stunning dichotomy that pits the purity and simplicity of childhood innocence against one of the darkest eras in southern American history when racial biases and violence ran deep and dark. The novel's universal themes are truly studies in contrast: humor versus tragedy; innocence versus guilt; good versus evil; ignorance versus truth. Lee's character development is effortless and utterly believable, and leaves the reader pondering the futures of these beloved figures long after the last pages are read. Lee weaves all of these elements together effortlessly, and never forgets that the heart of the novel is one of pure, simple love."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"&quot;It's a sin to kill a mockingbird.&quot; These words were said by Atticus Finch to his children Jem and Scout. The theme of the book was set around this quote. I enjoyed this book because of the way it progresses. Unlike alot of books, it follows the lives of the Finch family over a time period of two to three years. It shows how everyone matures physically and emotionally. The book is very descriptive, letting the reader picture the story as it is happening. One of my favorite parts of the book is when Atticus Finch is in court defending a young black man accused of raping a white girl. Many of the people in the community dislike Atticus for taking the case. The one person who stuck by him through the whole case was his son Jem. Jem was worried after his father had an incident with Mr. Ewall, the father of the girl who was raped. In a conversation with his son, Atticus says, &quot;So, if spitting in my face and threatening me saved Mayella Ewall one extra beating, thats something I'll gladly take. He had to take it out on somebody and I rather it be me than that housefull of children out there.&quot; (pg. 211) This really showed that Atticus is not afraid to stand up for what he believes in. He risks his family and reputation for one man. The part that I thought was very significant, happened towards the end. Scout said, &quot;Naw, Jem, I think there's just one kind of folks. Folks.&quot; (pg. 227) This shows that Scout is a better person than the rest of her community to stand up for what she thinks is right. She thought that whites and blacks were equal. She also showed good character for respecting her father for the man that he was, which was honest and hard working. I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to all readers."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird, is one of my all time favorite books. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading and a good book. I think that all of us who have read the book love the fact that the main character and narrator is a little southern girl named, Scout. The whole book is seen through the eyes of this witty tomboy and this makes the book truly enjoyable. The story is about two children, Scout and Jem, and their journeys over the next two summers. During the summers the children learn major life lessons and what it is really like to live in the southern part of the United States, where racism and segragation is still very present. Harper Lee does a wonderful job of using symbolism and protrays each character as if they were real. This book is definatly the MUST read book of this century.On a more personal note, this is actually my favorite book. Lee does a wonderful job of protraying each character and makes you feel like you are right there with them. This book was almost like a slap in the face for me, before I read it, I wasn't really mature enough to understand what it was like to live in the south, and after reading it, I finally realized all the trouble and pain that the African-Americans has to go through. For me personally this is the second most influential book, only coming second to the Bible. I definatly think that ever child should be made to read this book because it teaches so many needed life lessons and it is so much easier for a child to understand these lessons because they are being told by a child and it is brought down to our level of understanding."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is a must read. It is a story of two children Jem and Scout from Maycomb County growing up and experiencing new things. Engenius and talented, these two explore Maycomb through couple of summers, learning and developing. Harper Lee uses very good symbolism and portrays the characters in a style that the characters seem to be really alive.Exciting and mysterious this book will take you down to the the south where you will experience racism and compromise. Each day for the two characters is an adventure and their wise father and many neighbors make life exciting, especially Arthur Radley. The two experience loss, hatred, love, and understanding and they soon realize their place in the world and why things happen."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"After reading the phenominal novel &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;, I can definitely understand why it has been named a classic. This book is packed with lessons and morals, has great character development, and leaves a lasting impression on the reader.One of the reasons I enjoyed this novel is because I admired the character Atticus, for his good character and strong convictions. He was presented with defending an African American man in an extremely segregated town, and although it was guaranteed he would lose no matter how convincing his trial was, he still took it on as if he had a fair chance of winning, and put up an amazing argument. I also loved how he put his heart into his trial, and really stood up for his belief against prejiduce. Even with practically the whole town believing themsleves superior to people of other colors, Atticus had good morals, and fought for what was just.Scout was another character I particularly liked, because she was rambunctious, stubborn and independant. She demonstrated how a young girl can really make a difference and have an impact on peoples lives. Gem also showed unique character changes as he went through adolescence throughout the novel. His personailty starting off soft and kind and then trasnforming to tough and boyish was an example of great character development, and amusing as well.Overall this book taught me so much about standing up for what you believe in and the realities of prejiduce. I also learned from Boo Radley that you cannot judge a person until you know them. The trial also intrigued me because I have an interest in law. The only reason I would not give it 5 stars is because some parts were slow and uninteresting, where it was hard for me to read on. Aside from that minor negative, so much can be derived from this novel and I definitely reccomend it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I have recently finished reading the book, To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee.

I guess maybe that they don't want their kids to be exposed to the language or racism. Well, my father suggested that I read this book when I was in fourth grade, and I wish I would have. The racism is used by ignorant people- I think I'd rather learn that from a book other than to be first exposed to it in real life.

The hate crimes we keep reading about in the papers show we haven't come a long way.I only lament that I didn't first read this book until I went to college and started reading it in a speed reading class. HA! There is no way you can read this book in a speedy manner. It needs to be savored slowly and revisited to fully appreciate the story.I also gave a speech on Ms. Harper's book in class as part of an assignment to sell something. Even students who didn't like reading were willing to take a chance on it, and thanked me later.I just wish Ms. Harper had written other novels. Not sequels, of course.

The only problem was, when I went to check it out of a library, there were no copies of it left! And now, I finally found out know why. This book is absolutely amazing.This is the story of a small Alabama town in 1935. It is told through the eyes of a girl nicknamed Scout, who is heartbreakingly frank about her feelings for her enviornment. The book reads quickly; you find yourself drawn into Scout's preceptions of the world around her, and you learn with her the injustices and surprises of life.I am sorry to say that life in Alabama hasn't changed much in the past 65 years. I couldn't believe how much I could relate to the book, being a native Alabamian myself (my city even get a mention :) ).

They have to face racism and prejudice when their father is appointed to defend a black man who is accused a raping a white girl. Every one in the town shows up for the trial in order to see the outcome. The two kids cannot fathom just how cruel and unfair people can be.The setting is very important element to support theme in the book. It is set in a small southern town that has hidden racism problems. The children become educated about the ways of the south and how to deal with racism and intolerence that affects themselves and their father. By setting the book in the south, the prejudice problems are more apparent. Education is a major theme that is brought out when people do things out of ignorance. Some of the white townspeople are largely ignorant and do not care about innocence or guilt, only skin color."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Expresses the life of childhood and the lessons to be learned extremely well along with life as a black in the early 1950's.

The story was so good. It was so exciting when Jem and Scout Finch tried to make Boo Radley come out of his house. It was funny when they didn't succed and almost got killed. The main story of this book, is when the African American, Tom Robinson, is on trial, and Jem and Scouts father, Atticus, is his laywer. He is innocent, but because he is black no one believes him except for Atticus. I liked this book because tof the mystery of Boo Radly, the comedy of them almost getting killed at Boo Radley's house, and the frightening ending of this story. the ending is a big shocker but it makes the book all the better. I think anyone who read this book would absolutly love it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In my English class we are required to read a book every two weeks and post a review of the book on this website. I chose to read this book because of all the positive feelings expressed from previous readers when I asked them of their opinion.This book is set in the 1930's in a small town in Maycomb County, located in the south. The novel shows how white supremacy still lived on, even many years after slavery was abolished, and this novel shows the persistent prejudice shared in the southern morals of this time. Harper Lee has portrayed a common way of thinking of the southerners who are unable to accept that the blacks have been unchained from slavery. The whites find it hard to consider themselves equal to the blacks. This theme has been shown through the lifestyles of the blacks and their struggles they experience from the white community.The main characters in the novel are Atticus Finch, he is a respected Lawyer of Maycomb County. He seems to believe in and does everything in his power to keep justice alive. He has two children, Scout and Jem. Another character of the novel is Arthur Radley, a rather subdued man who tried his best not to have any kind of relationship with anyone of the community, he never steps foot outside of his house. Although you get the feeling that he does not want to remain distant from people by the way he acts with the children (Scout and Jem). Bob Ewell is an absolute evil character who has no touch with responsible behavior. He has no care for himself, his money or his children.I would have to say the protagonist of this novel is Atticus Finch, he is the key character who directs many events that take place in the novel. Like his positive involvement with the poor whites and the underprivileged blacks of the community. He comes across to me as an understanding person who wishes for his children to grow up with a broad outlook on life and a liberal way of thinking. I particularly like this characteristic because I believe that is how every child should be brought up. The Antagonist of this novel is defiantly Bob Ewell. In the beginning you just think of him as a lazy drunk, who has no care for others. But by the end of the novel you come to feel nothing but total hatred for him because of his attempts to harm Atticus's children and how he doesn't even think twice before sending an innocent person to the gallows.I usually don't like novels based on that time period in history after the abolition movements. But this novel had a meaning much deeper than just the struggles between the white's and the black's, it illustrated the idea of how the human race thinks and deals with social issues and different morals and beliefs. The novel also had a light and humorous mood at times, like when it connects Jems brotherly manner or Scouts spontaneous actions.There's no doubt that this book is a classic. It was a time well spent you can not fully consider yourself an American before you read this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read and liked \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"Lord of the Flies\\"."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a powerful and moving story. It follows Jean Louise Finch (Scout), a young girl, through her life in growing up in Macomb, Alabama in the 1930's. It goes through her trials and growth with the help of her father, Atticus Finch, her brother, Jem Finch, her good friend, Dill Harris and other characters that inhabit the small neighborhood. The mysteries of the world began to take meaning to the children. When Atticus takes Tom Robinson's case, a black man wrongfully accused of rape, the whole town is in an uproar. The racist views of the old South have a negative affect on the Finch family, with threats and harassment. This is a well-written story of discovery and realizations of the way things are and the way they can be. In the end, through a hermit neighbor, named Boo Radley, Scout learns that you can always find the good in others if you look hard enough. This book is a great reminder of how cruel people in this world can be, but at the same time how you can find kindness where you least aspect it. I enjoyed this book, once you get into it; Scout was a very easy character to relate with. She is a symbol of childhood, and exudes thoughts and emotions, that everyone has felt at least once."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I just got done reading this book. Harper Lee was the author of this novel and she did an excellent job on writing the piece. the novel concentrates on the development of a very interesting child. Scout is her name and the story is told from her point of view. it has very good detail and it is easy to understand. Three children spend there time together and learn so much through out the story. A very inspirational man known as Atticus ficnh deals with alot of problems and not only of his own but as well as for the people living in his community and he guides the children on the right path. This book is very compassionate and dramtic. Harper Lee consists of this to be a love story, i like to think of it as a touching piece that has way more to it than just a love story."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Simply a great book. Funny, frightening, sad, hopeful, and wonderous."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The book I reviewed was called To Kill A Mockingbird. It's this story about family living in The south. Maycomb, Alabama to be exact. The story is told from the view of Scout Finch a little girl. The story is about the trials and tribulations of Scout and her brother Jem anlong with their father Atticus. Their father is a lawyer and takes on a case of a black man accused of raping a white girl. This stirs a lot of emotions from the other people living in Maycomb, mostly bad. Everyone is against Atticus. Overall the book is a classic. It deals with problems of the past as well as problems of the future. That is one reason some many people have read it. The book does a good job of using dialogue and characterization. You feel like you know all of the characters on a personal level. One thing that makes it difficult to read is the fact that the author, Lee Harper, uses the southern dialect. Some of the words she uses are slang's that people from the south would use. While reading the book you are reminded how bad those times were for black people. The book does a good job of showing the southern way of life at that time. the book starts out slow but ends up picking up making for an interesting read. I would recommend it but warn you about the slow start. If you can get past that I think you can enjoy it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee truly enthralls the mind of his reader in To Kill A Mockingbird by examining emotions, experiences, and the ignorance of people living in a small town called Maycomb. One could say that Maycomb was a town comprised of thickheaded individuals that were very closed minded and set in their ways. Also, in this era whites were dominant to blacks, and segregation was the law that by which all blacks had to abide.Atticus Finch was a lawyer, and also a single father of two children growing up in the town of Maycomb. His son Jeremy (Jem) and his daughter, the narrator Jean-Louis (Scout), were at the age of questioning everything, and also at the age where certain experiences would etch and mold the way both would think, feel, act, and behave in the future. Atticus being a wise, humble, caring man knew this so he did his best to not shelter but to welcome questions and concerns that each of his children may have.Scout tells her experiences with Atticus, Jem, their friend Dill, her talks with Miss Maudie, altercations with Mrs. Dubose and her Aunt Alexandra, her views on school, and her childhood obsession with Boo Radley. Everything seems to be well for the Finches, until Atticus agrees to defend a black man by the name of Tom Robinson that is accused of raping a white man&#65533;s daughter. The story erupts with emotion, drama, and at this point is virtually impossible to put down.This book is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Atticus Finch, a lawyer, is an honest and ethical man. These characteristics he encourages on his children. When he represents a young black man accused of rapping a white woman, the family is the aim of prejudices, racism, and criticism. Growing up in Alabama during the 1930's, Scout and Jem Finch are aware of segregation, but do not fully understand it. The children themselves are guilty of prejudice towards the town freak. Because \\"Boo\\" Radley has not been seen in years, the two are in awe over his mystery. To Kill a Mockingbird is told through the eyes of young Scout. Acting very mature in conversation, Scout does not let on that she is only eight years old. In reality, Scout does not understand what the accused rapist, Tom Robinson, has done. Throughout the story, she comes to realize that the belief that he is guilty is not because evidence suggests so, but because he is black. Harper Lee has created a true classic and a true masterpiece. This is a book that I recommend everyone read at least once in their lifetime. To Kill a Mockingbird is a timeless novel that will stir all emotions."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Different people view the same events in different ways. In Harper Lee's novel, \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", similar occurrences are interpreted in a wide variety because of beliefs, morals and values. These non-uniform perspectives are what make each character so tangible.Every event that occurs in the novel is trans scripted through the eyes of Scout Finch. Each character perspective, therefore, becomes an aspect of her point of view. Her brother's courage is an excellent example of this. \\"Jem was a born hero\\", pronounces a simple opinion of how Jem is deep down being admired by Scout, even though the two often have trouble getting along. It is the subconscious bonds between the two that keep them from slipping away when times get rough. However, Scout is seldom pleased about her brother's journey into manhood. When Calpurnia tells Scout that Jem is just about Mr. Jem, Scout scoffs \\"He ain't that old. All he needs is someone to beat him up, and I ain't big enough\\", rationalizing how Scout respects her brother, yet the respect will not extend so far as to consider him an equal to any adults. To Scout, Jem just requires assistance in assuring him he's not as old as he thinks. Scout just isn't up to the challenge. However, because Scout has such a strong admiration for her brother, much of his masculinity rubs off. This is also due to the fact that Scout never had a true mother. Most displeased with Scout's un-ladylike behavior is Aunt Alexandria, who becomes aggravated when she learns that Scout wants to be friends with a poor, uneducated Cunningham. \\"You're enough of a problem to your father as it is\\", demonstrates Aunt Alexandria's quest to make Scout behave in a more feminine way only leads to more static between the two. Scout clearly has an agenda all her own. Not Alexandria, not Jem, not even Atticus can change her attitude.Atticus is a father, a lawyer, and a human being. But in many ways, he is more than all of those. To Miss Maudie, he is a symbol of respect and gratitude. \\"Whether Maycomb knows it or not, we're paying the highest tribute we can pay a man. We trust him to do right\\" exemplifies how Miss Maudie's intelligence enables her to take everything Atticus does that she may not agree with, and respect him for daring to accomplish the things no other man could challenge. Atticus could just as well give up on the trial, or stop caring, but his will is too strong. He could never allow himself to betray another man. When the townspeople send Atticus their gifts of redemption, Atticus, while impressed, must also say \\"They must never do this again. Times are too hard\\", demonstrating Atticus, while he is obviously being respected, holds an equal respect for the people of Maycomb. He knows that it wasn't easy for so many of the families to show how grateful they were. In this way, Atticus shows he has humility for everything he does. Because of his pending antiviolence beliefs, Atticus rarely becomes angry. Instead, he forces himself to realize that as horrible as people sometimes seem, they're still human. \\"If spitting in my face and threatening me saved Mayella Ewell one extra beating, that's something I will gladly take\\", describes the father's best method of defense is to not lower himself to the level of Bob Ewell. By doing this, Atticus can avoid a serious complication, while standing up for his personal beliefs and keeping his dignity. More people than he may realize approve his courage and honesty. Miss Maudie's appreciation runs farther than anyone else, even Atticus' own family. She has nothing but praise for every action he makes. \\"If Atticus Finch drank until he was drunk he wouldn't be as hard as some men are at their best\\", associates the fact that if the worst of Atticus could suddenly be brought out of him, if his superiority began to deteriorate, if he was no longer the cunning, respectful man he was, he would still be a better man than a person like Bob Ewell could ever become. This statement proves that no one is as proud of Atticus as Miss Maudie. And yet, Atticus very rarely shows that he is proud of himself. \\"If I didn't [defend Tom Robinson] I couldn't hold my head up in town, I couldn't represent this county in the legislature, I couldn&#8217;t even tell you or Jem not to do something again\\" is a perfect example of a summary of Atticus' beliefs and values. He must defend a man with no hopes of winning against a racist jury and a clever lawyer while attempting to keep his dignity and father two growing children. Will he gain a sense of accomplishment from all this? Perhaps. The feeling that the right thing has been done? Probably. Just proving that he did the best he could, and that he tried his hardest? Definitely. That is his only reward, but for Atticus it is more than enough."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Usually I am against anything I have to read for school BEFORE I start to even read it. And then when I read it, usually it is boring anyway. Not To Kill A Mockingbird. I was ok about reading it for school, for I'd heard it was good. And it was. The story was great (and sad). The topics were really covered good. Ok, so it's about this girl (Scout) and her brother (Jem). Their dad is a lawyer who has to defend a black man against white people. This book was written to take place in a time where people are predjudice against black people, so a lot of people are against Jem and Scout's dad (Atticus) for defending the black man. But Atticus doesn't care. I hope this isn't getting too long and boring for people to read. There is another (smaller) plot in that there is a guy who never leaves his house. Scout and Jem and their friend Dill try different things to try to get him to leave his house. Does he? I'm not going to say. But even though I had to read this for school (with a teacher telling us that there was sybolism in an alarm clock, snowman, dog, and many, MANY other things, and I didn't understand any of the symbolism stuff) I thought this book was good! The message was great, and I highly reccomend To Kill A Mockingbird!"}]`),K={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},j={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],L={key:0},x={key:1};function R(n,o,s,c,r,a){const u=g("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=i("div",{class:"top-banner"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),i("div",j,[(e(!0),t(w,null,y(a.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),b(u,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",x,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",L,"See more"))],8,H)):f("",!0)])}const q=d(K,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-27f0d2fe"]]),J=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/48.md","filePath":"quotesmag/48.md"}'),B={name:"quotesmag/48.md"},F=Object.assign(B,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(q)]))}});export{J as __pageData,F as default};
