In the near future, I will review her flagship work Organizing from the Inside Out to effectively gauge just how over the top she can be on appearing to have all her stuff together. One must really feel like they are the best to write a book teaching others to manage their time.I have read many books on time management. This book, in all honesty and fairness, was just not terribly helpful to me (yet at least). I realize that to other people who have different backgrounds, problems and challenges this book may be very helpful and the authors suggestions easy to implement. In fact, I highly recommend this book to students who need some general time management help.My problems are simple. I'm saddled with many projects, many ideas,many books to read, my family, my job, graduate school and the list, like most folks, can go on and on. The plan the author describes is simple. First, write down what you need to do (ok here) second added up how long each thing will take (not OK here), Third decide to delay or delegate (unfortunately, I don't get to delegate much) and last, execute your plan. This is her W.A.D.E. system.I'm in the process of plugging my big pictures goals into Morgenstern's Time Map. It is all about breaking big goals or small ones into manageable chunks of time (containerize) and then executing them. Since many of my goals are very big, like learn ancient Greek, Latin, French, German, write a graduate thesis, improve my reading comprehension and of course become an overall better more well rounded and educated person, I don't expect to be tasting the fruits of my victories any time soon...but Morgenstern's central idea hangs around the notion that you must take concrete steps like the W and the A of WADE, if you are ever going to get the to the E(xecute)[...]"},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"I received the order in a very timely manner, and in great condition.

If organization was that \\"common sense,\\" more people would be able to get their lives together instantaneously.Morgenstern builds upon her previous best-seller hit, \\"Organizing from the Inside Out.\\" For people who have read that book, I would agree that \\"Time Management\\" does not offer much else in addition to it. However, \\"Time Management\\" stands on its own on the reader from 2000 who gave it one star failed to recognize that this book stands on its own apart from her debut.A few choice tips that I have found to have helped me:- Estimate time for big projects: Most people underestimate the time it takes them to do things. It's better to overestimate or get as accurate a time frame as possible. If you overestimate, at least you'll have time to do other things; if you underestimate, you'll feel rushed and like you never have time for anything.- The WADE formula: Readers of \\"Organizing from the Inside Out\\" know this formula well.WRITE IT DOWN: Record your tasks in a planner or one area.ADD IT UP: Estimate how long your projects will take.DECIDE what you will do: delay, delegate, delete or diminish tasks.EXECUTE YOUR PLAN: Put your plan into action.- Doing things faster: Pages 69-75 offer great tips for getting things done faster to save YOU time:- Order groceries online- Hire someone to clean if you don't have time to do it yourself- Pay bills online and do it once or twice a month- Lay out clothes the night before- Send virtual greeting cards(While many of the above tips are common sense, many people are disorganized need a gentle reminder - or a swift kick in the you know where - to do many of the easy-to-overlook things.)- Ten Questions to decide on whether to keep a document or paper- Set aside daily time to process paperworl- Compartmentalize your life into six main categories that focus on your \\"big picture goals\\" (main things you want to achieve in life). Now, break your life up into smaller pieces to work your way toward those goals.If you found the sampling above helpful, I'd recommend that you purchase this book. \\"Do not stop, do not collect $200!\\" If the above was not (somewhat) helpful to you at all, you'd probably be best skipping this book - or you're already organized and don't need it."},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"I have to be honest and say that Time Management from the Inside Out is the first \\"time management\\" book I have read; therefore, I have nothing else to compare it to. However, during my first year in college, I was forced to take a time management course and I must say Time Management from the Inside Out was a far out better course than the one I took in college. Not only does Julie Morgenstern walks us step by step on how to schedule our time, but she helps us define our \\"Big-Picture Goals\\". Chapter 9: defining your goals and activities was my favorite chapter because she made us dream BIG and made me believe our goals were manageable. I also liked that she offered real life examples so people can relate to them and follow the solution that was given. This book is easy reading but it took me a while to finish because she makes us reflect on many issues such as the current behavior one carries in which prevents us to move forward. She offers several exercises that can help one pin point a problem. This was really helpful.

It also takes into consideration people's personalities and individual lifestyles.

The book shows how to reach our goals by using our time to our advantage. It can transform the person whose time is chaotic and imprisoned and turn them into the person whose life is orderly and free!The only disadvantage to this book (very minor) is that the author starts repeating herself 2/3 of the way into the book.

Overall though, the tips for streamlining tasks and managing the various activities of life are helpful.NOTE: This reviewer is the author of \\"Never Be Late Again, 7 Cures for the Punctually Challenged.\\""},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"It's been a while since I read it, but I remember that there were a number of things that I found really helpful. The one that sticks with me is that sometimes, we budget time poorly because we don't really know how long something takes. If you think it takes you two minutes to get out the door and 10 minutes to get to work, but it really takes you seven minutes to get out and 15 minutes to commute, you're going to be 10 minutes late every day.

Knowing how long our tasks take puts us in a better position to organize our time. I know that I often pack in too many to-do's into one day and hope that things that normally take an hour will magically take 15 minutes. If I am realistic about the amount of time needed I can be deliberate and intentional about what I decide to spend my time on. The author asserts, possibly we are stressed out not only due to innumerable tasks, but also to our avoidance of confronting the reality of time and our human limitations, because by doing so we will inevitably need to purge some projects and activities.Heavy stuff. But it isn't all enforced self-illumination. There are many more good takeaways and I will list a few that I found helpful.1.) Designate a favorite wedding/shower/graduation gift and stockpile that gift along with some boxes and wrapping paper.2.) Hang a master grocery list from fridge and check off products as needed.3.) Review your tasks every two months and see if they continue to further your long-term goals.4.) If you have young children, you may be forced to schedule tasks into no more than 1-2 hour segments.5.) Create a \\"Sudden Opportunity\\" list of tasks you might do during random free moments. Divide the tasks into 5, 30 and 60 minute categories.The thrust of the book is very comprehensible until she gets to the \\"Attack\\" chapters where I found her use of the S.P.A.C.E. acronym to be a contrivance forced upon her by the necessities of branding from her previous organization books. Some of what she had to say might have been clearer had she dropped the old acronym and instead used a fresh metaphor to describe the method used to manage time.Often throughout the work she talks about being a single mother of one child. The portions discussing delegation, addressed primarily to women, display a quiet dismissal of one of the reasons women often don't delegate in the home: the job doesn't always get done correctly, or even near the acceptable mark. Morgenstern implies this to be unnecessary perfectionism and I don't think that to be an entirely fair assessment. Often men and children see a housekeeping chore as something to be rushed through as quickly as possible and the results are often slipshod. Sometimes this is a manipulation to get out of doing the task in the future, or there is an unawareness that many tasks in the home require the same rigor you might give at school or your job. Some women are indeed perfectionist, but there can be other reasons a woman is reluctant to delegate at home. That might be another book.Overall I found Morgenstern's writing to be accessible as she connected our emotional responses about time to actually managing it in a concrete manner. A worthwhile read for the modern-day multi-tasker."},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"Throw out the time management books and replace it with this one. Ms. Morgenstern is easy to read and her book is a great reference to have on hand. My husband does everything on the computer and I am a paper freak, Julie addresses both types and explains which one will be better for you. The time map is awesome once you implement it. I can't say enough about this book, but I know I need no other and they have all moved out of my house!"},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"This book should be a must read for every adult - maybe required reading for high school?

Styron begins with a true historical event -- a slave rebellion that struck terror into the hearts of white southerners before ultimately being quelled. Styron sees in the psychological tinder box ignited by the rebellion, and in its leader, Nat Turner, a little-understood passion play. Critics who complain that Styron doesn't answer some historical questions: &quot;Gee, Nat's owner didn't treat him so bad, why'd he rebel?&quot; miss the point. What fascinates Styron, and a careful reader, is what the fact of rebellion does to the minds and emotions of those it touches. Besides, anyone who finishes Styron's novel without a sense of why Turner led the rebellion wasn't reading very carefully; the whole novel turns on Styron's hypothetical answer to this question. One of the central conceits of the book is Styron's imagination that Turner could have been fueled by his sense that he had been chosen by God to lead his fellow slaves in an uprising. Styron paints a powerful picture of one driven by the conviction -- whether divinely inspired or delusional -- that he is a vengeful avatar called upon by a higher power to wreak vengeance on the perceived enemies of God. There is an obvious parallel here to the Harper's Ferry uprising led by John Brown (whom Russell Banks, in Cloudsplitter, depicts as similarly driven by mania), as well as to figures like Joan D'Arc. Styron, who wrote a moving memoir discussing his own struggle with mentally illness, has a special fascination with, and sensitivity to, such issues."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"\\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" was written from a jail house confession that Nat Turner made and which William Styron turned into a novel. Like the other reviews here say, Nat Turner led the only somewhat successful slave rebellion in the South.William Styron was very brave to write this book. And he was much pilloried by Black intellectuals for having done so.The novel is beautiful written and the prose is lyric. We are drawn into Nat's life, the life of the slaves around him, and his masters. They taught Nat to read and treated him kindly. So it is with unexpected horror that we see him lead the blacks there in Virginia to rebel against and hack apart their masters with axes. According to Styron, Turner never butchered anyone. But he lost control of his rebel army and stood by as his owners and friends were hacked to pieces by the most violent slaves. That is the great irony depicted by the novel. On minute we have peaceful chariot rides with the mistress of the plantation. The next we have brutal decapitation. The reason that Turner rose up in rebellion is never clearly explained. The reader is left to draw his own conclusion. That men can turn to monsters is very much thematic here.I think what upset the black intellectuals so much was that William Styron broke two taboos. First he depicted the slave owners in this novel as benevolent-there is not supposed to be any possibility of that so say the revisionists. (Styron points out that slaves in the cotton fields of Missippi suffered more. Farming in Virginia was not so large-scale so the work was or a different nature.) But perhaps Styron's greater sin was describing in vivid detail Nat Turner's affection for a white female. That this part of the novel was made up and that is touched on an unmentionable taboo got Sytron into much trouble. A group of black intellectuals wrote essays that attacked Styron's novel. Sytron could not understand their dismay and was hurt by their assault. I cannot remember if James Baldwin was among the vengeful. I know that he and Styron were friends."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I initially purchased this book to read for two reasons: First, it was written by William Styron, who wrote the great \\"Sophie's Choice;\\" and second, it won a Pulitzer Prize. It was only after I was into the book that I learned that this vintage sixties' book was the subject of a major controversy over the depiction of the title character, Nat Turner.I learned that Styron openly acknowledged fictionalizing large portions of Turner's life, including his motivations for leading the slave revolt. I also learned that Styron's largely fictionalized portrait of Turner outraged many black leaders of the time. Rather than painting Turner (entirely) as a hero, called to action by the injustices of slavery, Styron created a darker picture of a man fixated on religion, a vision of himself as a prophet, and frustrated by lust and desire (particularly, for a young, blond haired white girl).As I read the book, I search my own feelings, and felt that if I were black, I would certainly have objected similarly. We all need our heroes, who become much larger as symbols than they could ever be as people. For the sake of those that come after, such icons are perhaps entitled to be treated with a greater level of sensitivity and care--even at the cost of literary restraint.It is here that the story gets fascinating. After I finished the novel, I read Styron's Afterword. Styron was truly stung by the criticism and in the Afterword, provided an elegant and persuasive defense of his writings. While I will not say that Styron entirely changed my position, he definitely made me see the other side of the argument. The dialogue between Styron and his critics not only allows the reader to consider one of the great social and political issues of our time, but permits the reader a unique insight into the thinking of a great writer--and suffices, in and of itself, as a reason for reading this novel. MAKE SURE YOUR VERSION OF THE NOVEL HAS THIS AFTERWORD.Putting the issue aside as to the real \\"Nat Turner,\\" the novel itself is beautifully written. The characters are fully developed and believable. The description of the system of slavery and the relationship between whites and blacks feel very real, and very accurate. Styron shows us good and bad of each race, and how all of them are bound by the system of slavery and their actions directly the product of it."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"being or is this book written by a white guy about an entire ethnic group? I have to be able to talk to you all about slavery, the buying and selling of human beings in the United States of America, a peculiar institution abolished by law only a few generations ago. Styron's book was a fictional account dealing not peripherally with these issues and specifically with one man, a United States of America slave. If there is a problem with the scholarship, judge the book by whatever incoherent and misguided poor writing that is to be found. I was moved with sympathy, tears, anguish, anger and ultimately love by this sublime novel. I wonder what Nat Turner would have said about Styron's adaptation? It is preposterous for anyone now living to decide the man's opinion for him. Styron is an artist. He is a brilliant writer of fiction. Obviously an opinion of my own, I'm jublilant we may each agree or disagree with my analysis. What am I hearing from critics that proclaim Styron's, Confessions of Nat Turner, racist? Am I hearing the equivalent of, &quot;You can't write about that! You're the wrong shade of human!&quot;? Let's keep talking and agreeing and disagreeing. William Styron initiated another dialoge of magnificent proportions."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Styron's fictional account of Nat Turner offends because his man is neither the pitiless avenger of racial injustice nor the hapless victim of events completely beyond his control. If you're looking for the tale of a superman or mythic hero, look elsewhere. This is a novel of an ordinary man who just wanted to live as other men do: to make of his life what he chose. I was deeply moved by Styron's portrayal of Nat Turner as alternately inspired and defeated, honorable and cowardly. I'll always remember Nat's anger and pain as they carry his compatriot off to hang him - &quot;Leave him ALONE! You're hurting him. You've been hurting him all his life!&quot;"},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"In August 1831, in a remote region of south-eastern Virginia, took place the only effective and sustained revolt in the history of American Negro slavery. That year, a black man, Nat Turner, awaits death in a prison cell. He is a slave, a preacher and the leader of the revolt. Mr Styron based his novel on the single significant contemporary document concerning this insurrection, namely a brief pamphlet of twenty pages called &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot;, published in Richmond in 1831. The confession Turner made to his jailers under the duress of his God is a narrative describing a good man's transformation into an avenging angel even as it encompasses all the betrayals, cruelties and humiliations that made up slavery - and that is still present in the collective psyches of both races.This magnificent book brilliantly depicts the American past in a dazzling narrative."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"The Confessions Of Nat Turner is an excellent historical rendition of Nat's psychological and physical rebellion. Although he was unsucessful from wiping the white race out of Jerusalum and off of the planet, during the antebellum his failure makes an informative read. Styron writes a chilling account of Turner's revolt, and insane biblical visions.As a boy Nat was well treated compared to the majority of the slaves and was even taught to read by his owners wife. Eventually his owner introduced him to carpentry, which became his successful trade. However it is obvious that Turner was mentally unstable due to whatever harsh circumstances he might have delt with as a child, young adult or even adult. This book, and the rebellion itself, really produces a picture of how disturbing America's actions were during that period. It also illustrates how slavery can kill a persons mental integerity, breaking them down to the point where they create such a heinous crime.The Confessions of Nat Turner by, William Styron, is an admirable piece. Styron lyrically produced a galvanizing, well written book, that is a great read for anyone, not just history buffs."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"From the perspective of a 41 year old white woman, this is a book that will change your life. My understanding of the state of black/white relations in the U.S. has been altered fundamentally and forever by this work. Styron strikes an incredible balance, making Nat Turner a formidable, realistic, character belivably touched by God, even as he is also a man of failings and inconsistancies. The book is beautiful, horrific, unforgettable.What strikes me most about it is how Styron, years before he wrote Sophie's Choice, writes about another Holocaust in a way that forces readers to confront the history \\"we\\" (meaning the white wielders of power) have made for ourselves through our complicity in slavery.I've just begun to research African American readers' in the general public and academia responses to this work. I would love to talk with people of color to hear other points of view on this book. ..."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This novel gives the reader a lot to ponder about a figure in American history, and because this history is our history it is important that we read and imagine and try to explain what this country has done.

His genius shines fully in these pages -- exquisite writing, compelling story, and wonderful characters, all set in a time of turmoil and transformation in this country's struggle with a terrible system of wrongs.

Highly, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"When I got the book I thought is was a true diary of Nat Turner, then when I got to the end it wrote about speculation of whether or not even his confession was true. However the book was interesting and worth reading."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"The maxim in writing is to write about a topic which you know: this author violated that principle when he chose to write in the first person singular the view of a black man who lived in the south (Virginia) about 100 years prior to the white author's experience in North Carolina.Yet, knowledge can be gathered. A Davidson/Duke-educated liberal arts major made a great, if not titanic-sized, effort to be \\"real\\" when delivering to us what Nat would have seen in the early 19th century. And, that effort was well received with a Pulitzer Prize - probably the highest acclamation this author perceived in recognition of his craft.But, sometimes the well educated writer cannot leave the typewritten page and his vocabulary transcends into the dialogue or thought passages of the uneducated but bright eponymous protagonist. For instance, would a slave of the 1830's use these words in everyday language?: sedulous, caparisoned, bruited, analphabetic, empyrean, and many others. I know he read the Bible front to back. I know he memorized many passages of the Bible. And, this education occurred later in life, without much help, and probably with a very limited access to a dictionary - thereby making many passages of the Bible readable for phonetic fun - but not necessarily understood prose.What is important is that we know this murderer is a good man. What led to the revolt which is the focus of the book is more important than the revolt itself. By the time you have followed his 20th birthday, you realize he is the victim of not only slavery--but of capitalistic greed and false representation which make acceptance of future white person's promises everything false.Only one person in the book speaks to him as an equal and ultimately as a mentor. A young pretty girl says about black people , \\"I happen to know that where I live n Southampton my mother hires a darky slave who is almost as intelligent and refined and clean and religious and profoundly understanding of the Bible as Doctor Simpson (the local preacher) .\\" That was her description of Nat Turner.In the end that girl dies, as does Nat. And, about 50 white and 50 black people - most of them innocents. A bad stewing insensitively ordained lifestyle centering upon slavery was the cause of the horrible result. That was well delivered by this author. Very well delivered."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Employing one of the ugliest chapters in American history, William Styron created something in \\"The Confessions Of Nat Turner\\" that transcends racial and political boundaries even as it defines them. It is a haunting rumination on the sadness of the human condition.Nat Turner is a slave in Virginia in the early 1830s. All his life he has been better off than most slaves, sometimes even comfortable, to the point where he once looked down on his fellow blacks. But slowly he changes, a moment crystallized when a master promises Nat his freedom while a coffle of slaves en route to Georgia pass by. Nat's reading of the Bible enforces a calling he hears to serve God by freeing his fellow men. It's a calling that will leave hundreds dead, and Nat a broken, self-questioning man in his cell awaiting execution.A magnet for controversy since its 1967 publication, \\"Confessions\\" is a white secular liberal's take on a black religious zealot's life a century-and-change later. As many reviewers here point out, it's not meant as history but fiction. Turner himself is something of a mystery to historians, his only words come down to us through the writings of his oppressors. Styron wasn't writing here to fill a hole, however; he wants to employ Turner in a different cause than Turner's own, to examine how one might find meaning in a meaningless existence full of strife and injustice. Once you go with that, rather than fight it as a vision perhaps different from yours or the historic record, \\"Confessions\\" becomes a helluva ride.A central riddle of the story is why the rebellion happened where it did. Virginia in the 1830s was a far milder place for slaves than was the Deep South. Styron portrays Jerusalem, where Turner led the slaves to not just rise up but indiscriminately slay every white, as almost pleasant. The greatest harm done Nat by a white is by a well-meaning owner who simply doesn't follow through on his good intentions. Styron's point, I think, is this: It's not the individuals but the institution itself that brings the wrath of centuries down upon man, woman, and babe alike.\\"Does it seem a hopeless paradox that the less toilsome became the circumstances of my life the more I ached to escape it?\\" Turner asks us, his silent audience in his cell. \\"That the more tolerable and human white people became in their dealings with me the keener was my passion to destroy them?\\"Styron writes with an easy eloquence and a direct point of view that makes the pages whiz by. As his character of Nat is the narrator, we come to know him from the narration as much as by his actions. There are moments of uneasy levity, like some of the antics of Nat's various white masters, but overall the tone is serious. Even when action is sparse, you know it's coming, and when it does, the descriptions are ferocious.Styron spares no one's sensibilities. Nat has an explicitly rendered dalliance with another male slave, and sexually tangled feelings about white women, one in particular, which seems to influence his religious visions. His rebellion is presented as a take-no-prisoners escape attempt, rather than a suicide mission of retribution, which undercuts how many radicals prefer to see Turner today. White Southerners, which Styron was himself, are depicted in various shadings of damned and depraved.Styron struggles, as do the historians, with the concept of who Turner was and what he wanted, but I think where he succeeds, brilliantly, is in finding some principle for his existence. If there is any hope for man, it is in the passion to right wrongs against impossible odds. Alas, another brilliant aspect to Styron's book is its suggestion of ultimate hopelessness.Bleakness does not equal greatness, but when backed up by the depth of knowledge, of human feeling, of pure nerve and biting wit, that \\"Confessions\\" contains, you don't put it down, let alone argue with it. The arguments come after, which is where they should with works of art like this."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"The Confessions of Nat Turner, published in 1967 and winner of the Pulitzer Prize, is one of the best known works by William Styron. Turner was the literate slave who plotted and led the rebellion against white families in southeast Virginia in 1831, \\"hastening 55 persons to their grave\\", as Styron phrases it from the mouth of Turner's court-appointed attorney. Styron bases his novel on the actual confessions of Turner, recorded by the same attorney during Turner's short incarceration before hanging. Styron offers up his intention \\"to try to re-create a man and his era, and to produce a work that is less an 'historical novel' in conventional terms than a meditation on history\\".Styron's powers of description are on considerable display. He pulls you into the story as surely as if he were there. He thoroughly captures the burning resentment and ultimate hatred produced by a lifetime of degradation under the institution of human slavery. Styron takes the time to portray several types of slaveholders, from Nat's first enlightened owner who helped to educate him and made extensive plans for his ultimate freedom, to a pair of surly and benighted men into whose hands he fell, and ultimately to the benign but traditional master who was the first victim of the uprising.Styron made me thoroughly identify with the slaves all the way up until the actual murders began. At that point he describes the brutality in such detail that my horror buttons all went off and I saw the perpetrators as ruthless criminals. It's clear that slavery was the original mortal sin of our country, and that one cannot sow the wind without reaping the whirlwind."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I found this book to be quite challenging. I wasn't sure of the message that it was sending. Nat Turner's &quot;owner&quot; by the account treated him well. Yet, Nat Turner killed him. Why? Is the very act of owning a slave justification for the killing of the owner? Was Nat Turner just a madman as the book seems to imply? Or, was he so mistreated that he was a product of his times?This is a very thought-provoking book. Regardless of what may think of the main character or even that terrible period of our history in which people were enslaved, you should read this book. It gives a different perspective of that time. It is excellent fodder for discussion of not only Nat Turner and what happened in that particular revolt, but the entire institution of slavery. I am not sure I really understand this issue and its long term implications on our society. This book, however, helped me understand that I don't understand."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"A most interesting book written by a very intropsective author. Much like the book &quot;A lesson Before Dying&quot; it's focus is on American slavery but it's message is global. when we oppress others our crimes destroy the fabric of society. Yet it is wrong to place Nat Turner in the pantheon of Revolutionary heroes as some would like to see him. Nat Turner was more than likely unbalanced, he had a non-existant plan of action or behavior and his primary victims were children and women: a true sign of cowardice in any culture."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Good read. Can understand why some readers consider this contraversial. Trust we never go back to &#34;slave owners&#34; or their likes."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I read this novel when it came out and was aware of the criticisms of it at the time. I would have preferred to read a novel about Nat Turner's rebellion written by an African-American man or woman because I think such a writer could more deeply understand and depict the pain, rage, hatred, and justified rebellion that a Black slave would feel. However, I had and have no objection to reading such a novel written by a Caucasian man or woman. It's the truth of the story that matters. But on this level -- the story -- I feel that Styron didn't write a compelling book. The book is 480 pages long and felt like 680 pages long. It goes on and on, repeating things over and over. It seems unfocused. And the Nat Turner who emerges isn't knowable in any way that I could discern. Styron was a great writer: this book was not his best."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I really liked this book.

It felt believable and engrossing. However, the book should have been half the length. Scenarios, thoughts, daily life details are repeated over and over. By halfway through the book, you will know all you need to know and can stop reading. I wish I had."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"The 1992 Vintage edition of \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" has an afterword by the author that could be called \\"The Confessions of William Styron.\\" Here, Styron responds to the criticisms that have plagued his novel about Nat Turner, the rebel slave who in 1831 instigated an insurrection that resulted in the murders of fifty-five white people, since its initial publication in 1967. Is Styron's novel the mature, scholarly work of a man who is genuinely fascinated with an ugly historical incident in his homeland (the Tidewater region of southeastern Virginia), or just an iconic relic of the Civil Rights era? Styron would insist on the former, but posterity may judge it to be the latter.Intentionally or not, the novel is certainly a magnet for controversy simply because so few facts are known about Nat Turner's life, which required Styron to fill in the blanks with as many fictional elements as he could imagine; and many readers, perhaps misunderstanding Styron's agenda, are liable to dispute and even attack the fictional material for various reasons. Since this is not a biography, Styron was violating no ethical taboos by employing artistic license where he saw fit.The novel begins with Turner sitting in a jail cell awaiting trial for his bloody crimes and delivering to his lawyer, Thomas Gray, what will be recorded in history as his \\"confessions.\\" Speaking his bilious, violent words with precision, insight, and erudition, Nat tells the story of his life in a series of flashbacks, beginning with his childhood at the plantation of a wealthy miller named Samuel Turner, where his mother was a cook and therefore enjoyed a few more privileges than did most of the other slaves. Nat was a bright boy who, when he demonstrated a desire to learn how to read, was taught the Bible by Samuel Turner's wife and daughter. When financial ruin befell the Turner family, Nat was sold to a variety of owners until he finally came into the possession of a wheelwright named Joseph Travis.As a sincerely devout man who strove to suppress his lust and remain celibate, and as probably the only literate black man in the county, Nat became a preacher to the other slaves, who were granted some liberties on Sundays but were not allowed to assemble. The hatred he had been nursing towards white people culminated on a day he received a divine vision to kill them all, to assume the role of a murderous Moses leading his people out of bondage to the promised land. While his friend and closest associate, Hark, enlisted as many slaves as possible for a revolt, he devised plans for the most merciless of massacres that succeeded to the extent that any white Southern sentiment for abolition was consequently cooled for the time being.Styron is a meticulous, highly disciplined prose artist who writes novels that are compellingly readable and filled with savory details but somehow fail to substantiate themselves beyond the surface. The compensation for this in \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" is the selection of a loaded and endlessly discussable topic: Is a man born in chains and consigned to die in chains to be blamed if he attacks his captor in anger? Turner, in Styron's eyes, would justify the murders as evil for evil, contending that the damage done to blacks by whites is irreparable and the only remaining option is destruction. Styron calls Nat Turner a psychopath, yet composes a portrait of him that is tense but controlled and, in its thematic denunciation of slavery, roundly empathic."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"The thing about Styron I admire is his astonishing talent for prose and description. I don't get the sense that he is much appreciated for his technical prowess, but he should be. If only critics will realize that great art is first brilliant craftsmanship, I think the quality of literature, in general, would be much higher. The things I liked about this book are the vivid descriptions of plantation and rural life (you could almost smell the soap on Margaret Whitehead's skin), the often hilarious speech, the shocking violence, and the staggering hypocrisy of the people of the American South with regards to chattel slavery. The biggest thing I did not like about this book (also with Sophie's Choice) is the clipped, elliptical narrative. It was often confusing to follow. I believe &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; would have been a more powerful book if its storyline had been linear. But in the end, this is a great book. Much better than Sophie's Choice in my opinion."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"First, anyone coming to this book for the first time should not read it as an historical treatise, because it isn't. So far as is known, Nat Turner didn't display homosexual propensities, as he does in this book. The historical Turner was married; Styron's protagonist is not. Indeed, beyond his homosexual liaison with a fellow slave, he goes through life in Styron's historical novel as a celibate, lusting after nubile white girls when not plotting his apolcalyptic war against the white race. This was an issue that caused great controversy when the book first came out. It may still bother the historical purist. To others, this might be seen as a minor point. After all, Shakespeare wasn't above changing historical facts to make a more engrossing, dramatic play. There are those even today who assert the Bard unfairly maligned Richard the Third. For those wanting to read a Nat Turner biography, they should try Stephen Oates' \\"Fires of Jubilee.\\" Having said all this, Styron's book remains one of the great American historical novels. Writers at their very best perform a sort of alchemy and Styron has always been adept at this, evoking a time and place long gone with a vivid wizardry and authenticity that is wonderful, even though he often writes about the most tragic of events (for example, his novel \\"Sophie's Choice\\" deals with the Holocaust). And, despite Styron's artistic license with certain aspects of the 1831 slave rebellion, this is a powerful story, populated with unforgettable characters, and a part of our American history that I think everyone should study and be aware of. To some, Nat Turner was a hero. To others, he was a demented murderer. Whatever your viewpoint, Styron is one of America's great writers and this is a book that should be read by anyone who is interested in where we have been as a country and apprehensive about where we are headed. Some of the issues inherent in Turner's story, and the story of those who followed him to their bitter doom, are as germane today as they were in 1831."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"NAT TURNER This one moved me through the story of Nat Turner's life. Nat Turner led an unsuccessful revolt in southern Virginia in 1831. His confessions before hanging were recorded by his appointed attorney. So in writing NAT TURNER, Frazier uses this document as his blueprint to fill out the life of Nat Turner.I was deeply moved (and stirred) by the detail into the childhood (which I know is very freely created by the author, historical documents lacking). But the fact that at some point Nat Turner was taught to read by one of his owners and the fact that he could read and was set upon the Bible, which Nat (who had become a preacher among his fellow slaves) used as his own blueprint and justification for why the slaves must rise up and destroy their owners at all costs.The rebellion lead to the deaths of 50-some whites over the course of about three days. The rebellion was put down, fell apart, whatever. At its peak, Nat had enlisted approximately 75 slaves to his cause. His surprise came in how disorganized everything became as more slaves enlisted, and how at many of the attacks, the slaves of the houses instead of joining the rebellion, actually came to attack Nat's army and defend their owners.It's a powerful glimpse at an event which precedes the Civil War, and has been relegated to a quiet (and the book to a somewhat scorned) position in history, although its effects on slave owners everywhere as word spread about the uprising, must have had its own powerful undermining effect. How well could many slave owners sleep afterward, knowing that their slaves - once considered docile and subservient - might take them and cut them open in their sleep?I wonder..."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Many customers are saying this book helps you look at slavery differently. I agree. William Styron shows not only the pain and suffering of Nat Turner (more or less an average slave), but it also tells what kind of decisions a slave really made.You get paid pennies a week for the grueling work you are doing. In a few years you can buy your freedom and start a life for yourself, maybe a life in a humble cabin built by your own hands, a life full of racism, but a life non the less. At this point you would happy with whatever you could get. Or, there is the decision of revolting. With enough support you could overrun your owner and escape to the North. Unfortunately, that is a very dangerous proposition.William Styron tells the life of this religious slave in the early 19th centurey and why he did what he did. Many people would agree it is stupid to revolt. On the other hand, many say they would make the same decision, &quot;Give me Liberty or give me death.&quot; Nat Turner's revolt was debateably the only successful revolt. After Nat was made an example and hung, however, the revolt only caused a negative effect on slavery laws and caused other slave owners around the country to tighten their grip."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Any of us with a decent American History teacher first learned about Nat Turner in the 8th grade. If you're a part of the New York State Regents program you learned it again during the 12th grade. But so little is actually known about Nat Turner, short of the confession he \\"dictated\\" to attorney T.R. Gray on 5 November 1831 in his unheated, open to the elements jail cell. We also know of the personal witness accounts of his execution, including a posthumous article in The Southampton Insurrection by a writer named Drewry that said:\\"The bodies of those executed, with one exception, were buried in a decent and becoming manner. That of Nat Turner was delivered to the doctors, who skinned it and made grease of the flesh. Mr. R.S. Barham's father owned a money purse made of his hide. His skeleton was for many years in the possession of Dr. Massenberg, but has since been misplaced.\\"These are the facts we're given in William Styron's 1966 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\". There are so few books in print that have had the ability to bring water to my eyes. Perhaps no more than four in total. William Styron is responsible for two: this one and Sophie's Choice.Nat Turner's Confession is two fold. The first of course is literal and pertains to the God-driven war he executed against the dominant white man from his place of bondage. Mr. Styron's is very open about how he took remarkable license with actual facts, but the truth is that so many of the events he has given us in this book- all in first person and most in remembrance since the entire book takes place during the four days before Turner's execution at the gallows in the small town of Jerusalem, Virginia, but there's much here we haven't studied about, seen pictures of and certainly nothing here that is remotely worse than modern day treatment of our current sub-cultures (of which African Americans remain one.) It is not at all possible that in the some 8 million slaves who lived and died in America, that every single event of this book didn't happen somewhere to some0one. And as survivors of the Holocaust have said about Spielberg's shocking film, \\"Schindler's List\\" it isn't even 10% of how awful it really was.Perhaps the greatest injustice to Nat Turner was for his first Master to teach him to read , write and do math. Then, the Master's neice gave Nat his own Bible and began to teach him the word of the Lord. As a young \\"pickani**y\\" he was brought out for company and made to perform: \\"Go ahead. Ask \`im to spell somethin'. Nothin' easy neither- give \`im a hard word.\\" The boy grew up knowing that he was special because he was the only slave on that plantation- or any after it- who could read write and reason. Turner was a man and one of his greatest sins was that of Pride, a sin for which he went to his death carrying fear and doubt. Each of his visits from God could be explained biophysically- one after a five day fast, awakening to a full eclipse of the sun, the vision of the morning star on the day of his execution. These were enough for Turner- or just enough - because in addition, he heard the voice of God telling him that like the Jews out of Egypt the Blacks needed to be freed from the whites. Indeed, even the kindest abolitionists brought about hatred inside Nat Turner- a man who (at least in this book) chose to die chaste. Styron is very subtle about this but he manages to suggest that Nat Turner is a prophet as was Christ and Moses. The similarities are small, but they're everywhere. But Styron's Nat Turner is also sickened and embarrassed by the \\"nigg#rs\\" (as Turner calls them) who play dumb for the Massah, who ARE dumb, ignorant, foolishly chasing sex and apple wine or brandy. This, despite the fact that Turner himself modifies his speech patterns and accent around the white people but we gather that Nat Turner believes that the others are not in fact performing as they behave and speak in this way even when nary a white man is around, whose eyes he never meets, It is just such an act of indignation (a white slave owner forces to black slaves to fight each other and a crowd of black men- bond and free - cheer) that first causes Turner to stand up and admonish these men to take pride. He thus becomes known as the Reverend.Still, between the foolish bumbling of the slaves and the white skin of all others, Nat Turner feels hatred: Another sin.Perhaps the greatest element is the sin of doubt, since Turner was very sure of his mission until the very day it began. A wide-spread mass murder that would cost the lives of nearly two hundred people that began with Nat freezing up- out of fasting exhaustion or of doubt. Nat Turner was the very last execution to occur so he was, fiction and non-fiction, more than aware of the price that some sixty odd black men involved in this mass execution paid, to say nothing of the more than one hundred white deaths, some of them children from infancy to age thirteen, were to suffer at his hand.The strongest element of Styron's book is that upon careful thought we are forced to look upon the bottom line: birthright. As it has always been. In 1966, Styron's book won the Pulitzer in the midst of the National Civil Rights Movement (the first). As we think of the white two year old who died by the hatchet blow of one of Turner's men and think anything other than his death was caused by a miracle of birth? And Nat himself, as a very young boy, was forced to watch his mother raped by a white visitor at the plantation simply because of how he was born? The mind can continue on thinking: A white man in America is, by birth, the luckiest person on the planet, a white woman in America is second- though only slightly higher than a black man in America. A Jewish child born in Poland in 1930 was no more lucky than a Jewish Child born in 4145BC. A black man born in the Congo from any time in history right up to this writing is incredibly unlucky.Birthright. Birthwrong. And a million stories that exist as a result. It is hard to draw the line between fiction and non-fiction. If you want to live through reading in the time period here through non-fiction, then read Elizabeth Dowling Taylor's recently published A Slave In The White House which not only outlines the same domesticity for both skin colors but even touches upon Nat Turner. The difference is that a story that is told well is remarkably rare. And William Styron, the generation between Faulkner, Hemingway, Steinbeck and Irving, Lamb and Kingsolver has written a book well worthy of study. Do not read it fast. Treat yourself to some self- education. Rest in between sections and when you find yourself breathless, put the book down instead of turning pages ahead to see how long before there is a break of some kind- a literary park bench on which to rest- because writers like Styron are rare and books like The Confessions of Nat Turner even more rare.Rarer still is a reader who does the book justice. This book is just as relevant today as it was in 1966. A pity? Yes. At the same time, it was just as relevant in 4145BC and that too is a pity. Things aren't better. Yes, we have a black person, but I've heard him called a \\"nig#er\\" by more than a half dozen people- one in writing. My daughter is a white woman who is married to a black man and not only do the whites in her town brandish them with words of hate but so do the blacks.My first submission of this review was returned as \\"unpublishable\\" because it did not make the computer scan for obscenities. To me, the act of hatred is far more obscene than the word nig#ger in quotation marks.There are many reasons for all of you to read this book. Joy. Appreciation of art. Responsibility. There but for the Grace of God. History. Thinking. Future. Many more reasons. And if that isn't enough, simply because this is one of the four most powerful books ever written. Even if you read this back in the 70's, it's well worth picking up again. Aftrer all, you're 45 years older now."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This is an extremely controversial book. Before one comments on racism, it seems best to explain who you are. I am a caucasian male who would be classified as liberal. I acknowledge that, from my perspective, I don't always see racism or feel it in the same way as many minorities do. As with anyone, I can only view things from my perspective.I found this book to be beautifully written, heartbreaking and with many layers.As a previous reviewer wrote, this was a book where no character was portrayed as fully good or fully bad.Nat Turner was highly intelligent and his rage and actions were understandable given the horrific injustice of slavery. I think his portrayal was complex and sympathetic. I felt I understood why a man exposed to what he had been exposed to and treated as chattel would act as he did. I was horrified by some of the choices to kill children but again I can't say how I would act in his situation.This is a very hard hitting, disturbing work and I admire it tremendously. A point that is made very clearly is that slaveowners were different. Some were sympathetic and some were abusive. In the end, their characteristics did not save them. They were all slaveowners and were targets of the uprising. There were no good slaveowners and I like that this point was made.There is a segment where Turner lusts for a young white girl and some believe that this is a demonstration of racism in that it propagates the idea that all black men want white women. I think it is a lot more complex than that. As Styron writes in his afterword, Turner only killed one person personally and it was a young girl who he likely knew. Styron invented a story to connect the two and it made for a very powerful scene when Turner kills her.Whether you think this is racist or not, I'd encourage you to read it.I think it's an absolute masterpiece and viewing it as racist seems a very twisted interpretation."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Upon it's publication, William Styron's \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\" was hailed by The New York Times as \\"a triumph\\", and described as \\"the most profound fictional treatment of slavery in our literature\\" by The New Republic. Despite these and other glowing reviews, the book was also denounced as racist garbage which perpetuates dangerous stereotypes about African-Americans - particularly the stereotype of the sexual aggressive black male.I will talk more about this in a moment, but first I would like to say that I did not find anything racist about this novel. I found it instead to be a raw, brutal, yet strangely beautiful, work about the horror and injustice of slavery. While there are several scenes of physical brutality and deprivation between masters and slaves in this novel, Styron, through the voice of Nat, focuses more on the grinding psychological and emotional toll of slavery. Even in Virginia, the setting of the novel, where the condition of the average slave was considered \\"not that bad\\" by the standards of the time, the soul-crushing, mind-annihilating condition of being human chattel was an overwhelming burden. Nat's description of this sort of \\"life\\", and his fiery rage at the white characters of this novel are truly terrifying and unforgettable.Nat himself is portrayed as a complex and (usually) sympathetic character. He is neither a zealot or a mad-man or a one-dimensional symbol. Styron notably leaves out some of the known biographic details of Turner in his narrative - Turner's wife and child, for example - perhaps in order to develop (the fictional) Nat's inner-conflicts regarding love, hate, sexuality and sanctity, all of which are central to the novel. To return to the above-mentioned allegations of racism, it will not give too much away to reveal that Nat at one point fantasizes about raping a white woman after she reveals her own vulnerability to him and several other slaves. I saw this, and similar scenes, not as a stereotypical portrayal of uncontrollable, animal lust (a la \\"Gone with the Wind\\") but rather as a symptom of mental and emotional confusion/frustration stemming from a cruel lifetime of hatred, betrayal and deprivation. Other, perhaps less \\"self aware\\", black characters I believe are similarly meant to be viewed as products of their environments. This was my interpretation of the more controversial aspects of the novel, and I hope that other readers will not have their views towards an entire race of people diminished or altered by scenes which, I believe, are meant to shock the reader into a deeper understanding of the iniquities of human bondage.This is a deeply haunting work of fiction (and I emphasize the word fiction, as other reviewers before me have) and one that will be hard to forget. Read this with an open mind (and a copy of the historical accounts of Turner's revolt near at hand) and hopefully you were be brought to a deeper understanding not only of slavery and early American history, but also the strength and frailty of the human soul."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I read this book for my book club and I thought it was beautifully written. It has stayed with me for weeks now. I love when a book does that. I'm glad I wasn't swayed by controversy. I had no problem with the fact that the author was white and using a black voice(maybe because I'm white - but I do like when an author gets the voice right and I thought Styron did that). I didn't understand the charges of racism after reading the book. Sometimes I wonder if, what some people find uncomfortable, they label as racist or sexist or whatever. Anyway, I would encourage everyone to read this book because it gave me a fresh awareness of a huge part of U.S. history, it reminded me that there are always gray areas to consider and it was a great novel. You might think so too."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This book is captivating. Its reflection on a history that too many people have forgotten (or at the very least pretend happened longer ago than it did) is something that people should be required to recollect. The perspective that Styron gives through the eyes of slave revolt leader Nat Turner is chilling- regardless of to what degree it reflects the &quot;real&quot; perspective of Turner. The truth is that we have no idea how closely it resembles Turner's perspective. But to have perhaps been given a glimpse of such an interesting piece of American history is something to not be missed.If you do nothing else, pick up this book and read the first two paragraphs of Part III (Study War). Not only is it an excellent example of Styron's ability to write gracefully, but the content left me speechless. It is beautiful and frightening and enlightening."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"My objection to this book is that it takes a real person who lived and breathed, and began the U.S.'s only &quot;successful&quot; slave revolt, and turns him into a fictional character. People read this book and figure it IS the history of Nat Turner, and THAT is damaging to our common perception of history. Styron says repeatedly in interviews on the subject that he used all the historical information available, and only invented the parts of Turner's life that he couldn't find in history. And that's just not true. He didn't look at the trial record at all. He dismissed newspaper accounts as unbelievable, and he even veers far from the &quot;Confessions of Nat Turner,&quot; as told to Thomas Gray by the real person Nat Turner. In those &quot;Confessions,&quot; Nat doesn't repent for what he's done. He says he doesn't feel guilty at all. This is a far cry from the basis for Styron's character Nat, who feels estranged from God for some sin he has committed. The whole idea that he killed Margaret Whitehead because he lusted after her is ludicrous. It ignores the relationship that Nat had with his real-life wife -- and it perpetuates the old racist idea that we have to protect our white women from black men who want to rape them. When all along, it's Styron and other white guys who have those fantasies. They merely project them onto black men in order to justify their own behavior which is supposed to protect women and children. Of all the hundreds of lynchings that occurred after the Civil War, only 2 involved a white woman being even threatened by a black man, yet that charge of rape was the pretext for so many outright murders of black men.Nat Turner was a hero for leading that revolt. Slavery was abominable, and I'm glad some slaves finally rose up to deplore it. The murders they committed were harsh, but nowhere nearly as harsh as what African-Americans, as a whole, endured day after day as slaves. Styron tries to make Nat Turner into a quivering would-be rapist, who has killed the only person he loved, when Turner was really a man who rose up against the heinous tyranny of slavery. Every time someone reads this book and buys it as the real story, Styron succeeds in keeping the myth alive that what Turner did was wrong -- conveniently forgetting how wrong slavery was, and how much it took to stop it, and then forgetting that it took another hundred years to end segregation in the South, and even now, we don't have equal rights for all. Styron tries to turn Turner's success into failure. It's racism at its noxious core."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Why does Amazon *do* this?On the various listings of this famous novel--as well, I am sure, of hundreds of thousands of other books--the publication date is shown as ... whenever that edition was published, hello--with no mention of the real publication date of the actual novel.Very confusing, I should think, to prospective buyers. As well as false, misleading and uninformative. \\"Confessions,' for example, was published in 1967, amidst controversy and social ferment. I was at Merritt College with some of the Black Panthers, and the novel was a famous part of our Poli Sci curriculum.Mind you, no one had ever written, especially in such a frank and graphic manner, about this famously violent slave uprising--and from the slave's imagined point of view.

I agree with Styron that Nat Turner suffered from a delusion. He went through the four steps described in \\"The Psychology of Delusion\\" written by the Zuks and published in 2005. Styron's book is an application of art to history.Although criticized by some as \\"racist\\",it is essentially a psychological study fully in conformity with the theory of delusion espoused by the Zuks in their recent publication."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Then again, the whole subject of slavery is disturbing.

I'd wait until late high school or thereabouts to recommend it for reading."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Whilst I would not disagree with other reviewers who admire this novel, I would point out that there is a little-known collection of essays by black writers and black activists about Styron's novel.The theme of these essays is that Styron, a guilty white liberal, has &quot;stolen&quot; Nat Turner from the negroes, and, by perverting the historical facts for the sake of his Pulitzer prize-winner, has turned a great figure into an indecisive, vacillating and sexually ambivalent creation (as a Jew, I feel the same way when Anne Frank's diary is revised by those seeking to &quot;dilute&quot; the experience of the holocaust).Perhaps their greatest criticism of Styron's blacks is that they are portrayed as docile, imbecilic animals, a comforting fiction for guilty liberals who cannot understand why or how the slaves revolted.In the final analysis, it may be the case that only blacks have access to the authentic slave experience - and therefore, as some of the critics state, Nat Turner is still waiting for one of his brothers to write his biography.&quot;What is the price of experience? Can men buy it for a song, or wisdom for a dance in the streets? No! It is bought with the price of all that man has. His house, his wife, his children.&quot; (Blake)"},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I have not read Styron's novel yet, but I plan to. It has got to be interesting. It has got to be interesting to read the point of view of someone that has experienced mental illness describing a historic figure that reveals all the signs of psychosis. If you investigate the history of Nat Turner you will note that it is limited, but that he is described as a man having scars on multiple parts of his body. So his life in slavery was not as wonderful as history would have you to believe. Yet most information I have read state that his life was \\"okay\\", I guess okay considering other slaves. Not to justify mass murder but considering what the life he lived and that he probably also had schizophrenia ..it is not too far to believe the story. So it has to be interesting to read Stryron's novel, only someone that has seen the isolation of mental illness would be able to interpret it."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Most modern readers won't be taken in by Styron's subtle and sometimes open racism, but besides that this is a decent narrative. Styron said that he is not trying to make a &quot;historical novel&quot; but just a good read. And it is. Nat himself especially is well-developed and entertaining."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Any experience can be colored by prior expectations - as was mine. I bought the book on a whim - without reading any reviews or talking to friends about it. And I suppose I was expecting a tale of hope and revolution, a story about a young man truly believing that only violent rebellion could help his people. What I got instead was a grossly pessimistic bit of story that turned a truly inspirational figure in black history into the largest \\"darky\\" hater around! (I'd like to note here that Nat Turner is not revered because he caused the deaths of so many people, but because he fought back. It's torture to sit through countless slave stories and watch black people endure terrible torture all the while screaming \\"Just shoot him and run!!\\" without any real hope for their relief.) Any heroic features that Nat Turner holds for the black community are swiftly wiped away in this book and replaced with an infuriating man who kinda sucks.I read another review on Amazon in which the reviewer felt that the story was moving and the fictional imaginings justified. I'd have to agree. Its a hard argument to say that an imagined story isn't enough like what you yourself had imagined. But I will say that the book deals a pretty low blow to a black icon. If it was The Confessions of [some random human] I would simply not like the character and move on. But to take an iconic black figure and imagine him as the crappy dude in this book speaks to the authors ideas about black masculinity, slave mentality and black community. And I don't get the impression that he thinks very highly of any of them.I'm throwing the book out."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Is there another book or novel about Nat Turner? I can see why many blacks were disturbed about this novel. Styron took many liberties with Turner's character - especially with his &quot;infatuation&quot; for a white woman. I'm not saying that there are black men who are attracted to white women and vice versa, but does he know for a fact that Turner was actually infatuation with one?"},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"For me this was an unsatisfying read. Many pages might have been edited from this novel and very little would have been lost. It became a tedious read. The novel is an attempt by a mid 20th century white man to penetrate the psyche of a early 19th century black slave. Many times this didn't work. That fact challenged the story's credibility early on. I can understand why this novel infuriated much of the black community especially in the 1960's when it was first published. There seems to be a certain overreaching and perhaps unintended arrogance about it."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"If William Styron has done us a disservice it's that he's unleashed upon America the concept of political correctness. The backlash against this book, to a large extent, is what started it all. Some of the criticism is on-target, but much is unfair.Slaves typically have been depicted in one of two ways: as the simple-minded shuffling watermelon-eating darkie, or as the noble African struggling valiantly against the tyrannical white plantation.One depiction is overtly racist, and the secondly is unrealistically romantic (and in it's own way demeaning).What Styron gives us is \\"none of the above\\". What he tries to depict is a reality that is often overlooked or not acknowledged: that chattel slavery in the American South was a ruthlessly and crushingly effective system; so effective that throughout its history (from the 1600's through the Emancipation Proclamation) there were only two armed rebellions.Slavery was obviously a great evil; it is equally obvious that as a mechanism for suppressing the enslaved it was remarkably effective. It follows that this mechanism will have an effect on the suppressed. Chattel slavery was, in many cases, a \\"breaker of spirits\\".The depiction of the slaves in this book is not always positive. What Styron tries to show (sometimes successfully) is that slavery was a heavy weight, and that the slaves who bore this weight were not always noble. This is what many readers have found offensive, and why the book has been labeled \\"racist\\". This was not my impression (my background: I'm an African American raised in Texas.)This is a novel full of ugliness and negative characters. There is not a single fully sympathetic character in the entire book, black or white. In this way, it is an exploration of the evil of slavery.This novel is not a history lesson; and in that many readers accept the fiction as fact Styron might have done us an additional disservice. Styron himself acknowledges this in the forward of the recent addition. The controversy surrounding Confessions is not what it once was, but I'd encourage anyone who has deliberately avoided the book because they've been told it is racist to read it and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I have always admired Styron's bravery in handling difficult subjects. Styron is a novelist in the classic tradition, and is concerned with depth of theme and pyschological motivation--two things that are sneered at in todays academic climate. Yes, it is a problem straying into the political arena--but Styron achieves the important task of humanising Nat Turner--making him real, and not some dusty abstract fictional personage--consigned to the footnotes of History. Racism has many faces, and as I read Styron's novel, I became angrier and angrier, as the palpable, grinding and dehumanising aspects of America's slave legacy was unfolded in Nat's story. The ending was incredibly powerful. I urge people, of all creeds and colours, to read this book and keep an open mind. Styron is NOT a racist, but a HUMANIST.The story he tells has eternal relevance, and is told with integrity and great literary skill. A book should stand alone, but I hope some day that this novel is made into a film. Its story is too important to remain locked within the literary arena."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"William Styron had the misfortune to publish &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; in the late 1960s. The timing was such that Styron had the odd experience of a) being awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the book and b) being shunned by many, black and white, for having had the temerity to put himself in the mind of a black slave when he himself was a white Southerner.The color of Styron's skin doesn't matter anymore than it should for anyone else. &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; is a brutal accounting, from Nat Turner's point of view, of the events that led up to the only long-term revolt in the disgraceful history of American slavery. We see the beginnings of Turner's musings when, as a young and extraordinarily intelligent slave, he fights mentally against his enslavement. It's when the dam bursts and he decides to fight physically that his downfall begins. There is a suggestion of perhaps not mental illness, but a messianic complex here in Styron's rendering of Turner. It works, for a character in a novel, but some readers will be taken aback by the fact that Styron makes Turner somehow mentally unstable.As with all books, the uninitiated reader wants to know: is it a good read? It is. It's propulsive and majestic and the kind of book you don't want to end. Styron handles the ending with great delicacy and restraint. &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; is a sustained and detailed portrait of a compelling figure in early American history. It is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This is one of the most moving, intense novels I've ever read. It is a fictional account of the 1830's uprising led by the slave Nat Turner in Southampton, Virginia, which culminated in the deaths of nearly seventy white men, women, and children, and Turner's own execution.The ethics of this novel are the only thing which keeps me from giving it a full five stars. I do not fully understand the controversy surrounding it. Apparently African Americans of the 60's objected to the work not simply because it was written by a white southern man, but because of the frank depictions of Nat's secret sexual desire for a white female in the story. It has been pointed out to me that many feel that this is a case of a folk hero being (deliberately?) maligned in some way by one who cannot possibly empathize with Turner (Styron being white), and while there is some merit in that arguement, I myself found the sexual aspect justified in terms of the character's development - as a fictional interpretation (although I felt it detracted somewhat from his character -and seemed a little...easy). I can see how without any empirical evidence to support the notion that Turner held this desire, it might anger some people. Yet, this is only a fictional work. If some Frenchman were to write a novel about George Washington and portray him as lusting after little boys, I could see how an American might be angered, and yet I have faith that the majority of people would shrug it off as a simple piece of fiction. Which is what this is. A brilliant, engrossing work of fiction. People seeking facts about the insurrection should not look to fiction, though admittedly there is a lot less in the way of source material beyond the actual Confessions as they exist in historical record when compared to this novel. I still feel Styron did an excellent job of extrapolating a story from a dictated (and probably heavily interpreted) confession. Sadly, no one in this world will ever know the truth of Nat Turner's early days. His history begins and ends with his Confession.Taken alone, this novel is still a very interesting read, though I'm not exactly sure if it deserved a Pulitzer Prize. If there was any book written by a white man of the sixties which DID deserve this prestigious award, it must be \`Black Like Me.' I was not around in the sixties, but I can see that this novel might have gone a long way towards fostering an understanding (at least for white people) of the horrors of chattel slavery in America.Styron's portrayal of the day to day hardships of Nat Turner's life both external and internal are extremely vivid. The characters that populate the story, both slave, free, and master, are all very human, never degenerating to the lazy stereotypes of the shiftless and abasing Stepin Fetchit or the entirely brutal Simon LeGree (though these extremes are shown to exist). No one is entirely evil and no one is entirely good, just as in reality. The internal struggles of Nat's personality are also quite well realized, as he wrestles with the question of God, and his own self-worth (and those of his people). All in all, a striking novel by a talented writer."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This is a stunningly intense and powerful novel. The novel is written as the final confession of Nat Turner following his brutally violent slave revolt of 1831. The account is fictionalized though relies heavily on historical facts for its basis.The novel is painfully tragic as Styron masterfully portrays Turner's existence within the deep south during slavery. Styron's novel is filled with many tragic ironies that mirror the strange logic of slavery and oppression. Turner is initially uplifted by the power of religion, but eventually uses the Bible and bizarre visions to justify his brutal revolt. Throughout the novel, Styron is even-keeled, never passing judgment on Turner, ultimately allowing the reader to come to his/her own conclusions. The novel is vivid and necessarily graphic in places as Styron depicts the harsh slave world where violence leads to more violence.This is an important novel to read, for it gives important insight into how history shaped American race relations. Styron caught a lot of flak for writing this book (he is Caucasian), but ultimately, I believe his detractors are closed minded. His portrayal is simply stunning, and you needn't be white or black to understand Nat Turner's plight, but merely be a human."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"It's a shame that this book has been shrouded in accusations of racism and bigotry, because it detracts from the simple fact that &quot;Nat Turner&quot; is a beautifully written, impressively narrated and horribly affecting novel. Styron's Nat is a fully realized, memorable and finely-drawn character, whose insights into slavery and human nature in general, linger long after the closing words. In the end he emerges, not so much as a hero, but as a human pushed to the brink by circumstances beyond his control. An essential read for anyone who enjoys novels which plumb the depths of the human condition."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Written in 1968, Styron's &quot;Confessions&quot; delves deep intothe psychology behind Nat Turner's 1831 slave revolt. Almostunbearable in its graphic violence and Biblically-dimensionedheartbreak, the novel (for it *is* fictional) has Turnertelling the whole story in painfully honest detail. Styronneither defends Turner nor paints him as crazy; he is lessinterested in pointing out right or wrong than in trying tounderstand the broad ironies of the system of slavery and itseffects on the people who ran it and were subject to it.Styron's Nat Turner is a man who is both educated and destroyedby his masters; he is both uplifted and misled by the Bible.His hatred is not fueled by the hatred of whites, but by thepity of whites. And when he kills, he is only able to commitone physical murder, though he takes responsibility for 60.The book is often painful to read, especially for one whomight think that race relations today have little to do with19th-century slavery. But in its wealth of detail and itsability to enter into the mind of a complex and criminal mind,it is unique, and should be required reading for everyself-termed patriotic American."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"There is much to be said about this novel apart from the wrongly alleged &quot;subtle&quot; or &quot;open&quot; racism of its author, William Styron, a rare writer with the dark-red conscience necessary to firmly seat himself in the civil uneasy chair of revisionist sensitive-history. A brief overview of his work in both fiction and memoir shows civil rights to be a cornerstone of his thematic untertaking; thematic material that, for the most part, anglo writers either ignore or address tentatively with small equanimity. One senses, not only in Styron's work, but in his selection of narrative, a deep, vengeful need to understand a psychology and a violence that seems humanly irreconcilable. And of course it is not; Styron's, like any useful imagination, is boundless and capable of understanding all human action, no matter how sinister. Styron must have known many decades ago that what we are for any reason afraid to address satisfactorily will continue in a more destructive form in time. What better hero then, than Nat Turner? It is clear that Styron had as little choice whether or not to address this subject as Nat Turner had to address his situation all those years ago, and for precisely the same reason, to change it."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I just finished this profound, beautiful, satisfying novel by William Styron, which won the 1968 Pulitzer Prize. In 1831 Nat Turner, a Virginia slave and preacher, led the only sustained, effective slave revolt in American history, yet few records of the event offer much detail. The only one! After years of solemn, secret planning, into which the reader is methodically and eagerly enlisted, over the course of two days Nat and some 75 followers rampaged the countryside, laying waste to 55 white souls of all ages, including women and babies, before they were caught and, of course, hanged. Fifty-five cold-blooded murders plus dozens of wounded makes Charles Manson look like Martha Stewart. Styron attempts to penetrate the mind of Turner to uncover his motive and psychology and succeeds to a considerable degree, in my opinion.The book is told in first person, most of it directly by the chained Nat awaiting execution in his cold, dank cell, the rest of it summarized in dialogue with his lawyer, a neat way to get across a lot of plot points in a hurry while maintaining scene and drama. Story begins with a vision Nat has of an inscrutable, white building high on a sea cliff -- his version of freedom and glory (he has never seen the sea). Then back to the cell, and we get what happened in dialogue with his lawyer, a befuddled white man assigned to the case. The second part of the book retraces Nat's remarkable life story in recollections, slowly, gorgeously laying the groundwork for his religious convictions that lead to his plan to plunder the countryside that has served as the backdrop for the unspeakable horrors endured by his fellow slaves. Particularly effective is Styron's use of Old Testament martyrs and prophets who rose up against the Egyptians and whose fiery rhetoric lights a blaze in Nat's mind that cannot be put out. This leads right up to the climax, which the reader has been prepared for and can't wait to read, and the scene where he storms his master's bedroom does not disappoint. The deneoument brings us back to Nat's final meeting with his lawyer on the morning of his execution and his bidding goodbye to his last living comrade, led past Nat's cell, crying out that it will be all right, that it's \\"nuthin'!\\" The hangmen's call from behind the door to \\"Come!\\" becomes in Nat's mind the voice of the Lord at last, the Lord who has, for years, abandoned him and tested his will by His silence. Nat's vision of the mysterious white building on the hill becomes a metaphor for the peace of the finally imminent Afterlife.Interesting how Nat's retrospective first-person prose is simply scrumptious, lavish, almost insanely wonderful, but when he speaks, his words come out in the same impoverished dialect as the other slave characters. No excuse or explanation is given for this discrepancy -- a reminder of just how much you can get away with provided you set the standard from the get-go and never look back. Styron's prose, which I had only encountered once before, in his terrific novella The Long March, is what I would call transparent. Clear, perfect, to be devoured compulsively as you think \\"he can't possibly keep this up\\" and he does. When I read Styron's natural kinsmen such as Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Cheever, Richard Yates, I think as I read, \\"Goodness gracious but this [guy] is freaking talented with words, and he clearly knows it,\\" but when reading this book, I found myself thinking, \\"Goodness gracious but this [guy] is freaking talented with words, and he's sparing the reader the hint of his own swaggering ego to boot.\\" Hence, tranparency. The lily rendered as it is, no gilding required. Hence, my excitement upon emerging from this book is partly the prospect of his other novels, waiting for me in used bookstores and eBay auctions and garage sales.Styron took a lot of heat for his matter-of-fact treatment of Nat's character, mainly from black leaders who denounced it as perpetuating the stereotype of the sex-obsessed, violent black man. Maybe they had a point. It was 1968 after all. Then again, Nat's natural development, morally and sexually, was so warped and twisted by even the mundane practical restraints of slavery, as to supply reason enough for me. And the man presided over such unprecedented and widespread carnage -- it must be remembered that he was a mass murderer, no matter his skin color. Yet, amazingly, and probably significantly, Nat himself committed just a single murder -- that of a white girl whose beauty and sincere kindness toward him somehow overboiled his frustrated rage more than all the cruelty of his various masters and their surrogates. Finally, though, and most important to a writer, Nat is written with such humanity and compassion and courage and honesty and wit that, in the usual sense, it hardly matters what he did -- the reader is with him till the end. \\"Write unlikeable characters,\\" my writing teacher Ethan Canin told us. \\"The reader will always like them.\\" James Baldwin had his own take on the book when it came out: \\"He [Styron] has begun the common history -- ours.\\" Achieving a common history is something another writing teacher of mine, James Alan McPherson, often said should be the goal: \\"We must develop what Ralph Ellison called the omni-American sensibility.\\" Jim also once said, \\"There should be no limits whatever to the writer's imagination.\\" Amen!"},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Have you ever wanted to say something and then discovered that someone else has said it first and better than you would have? Well, that was my experience upon reading the review written by Christopher Smith at the top of the readers' reviews section.So, rather than re-hash what has already been ably stated, I will add a few more thoughts of my own.The controversy over Styron's portrayal of Nat Turner would not be nearly as furious if not for the sheer power of Styron's writing. He drags you into Turner's tortured mind and you can feel Turner's anger, rage and lust. In my case, it pulled me in so tightly during some scenes that the rest of the world was lost to me. All was a breathless rush until that little piece of this tragedy was over and I was able to breathe again. Although I am not entirely pleased with some of the liberties that were taken with the real history of Nat Turner, the writing displayed in this book is really quite exceptional and it merits the 5 stars."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This work, steeped in accurate historical settings and moving religious allegories, takes the reader into the very core of a southern slave"},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I think that this book was very well written, the author kept you in supence the entire story.

I thought the book well written. It showed another facet of possible antebellum history. Styron threw in the old chestnut of a black man lusting after a white woman which made my head ache. The book opened up a complex set of moral issues for me. Who would condone murder but then who in their right mind would own another person? To juxtapose this book I'm also reading Stephen Oates' \\"Fires of Jubilee\\" which is an historical account of this same time and incident and it's helping me separate fact and fiction. I also have a copy of \\"Ten Black Writers Respond\\" on it's way. If nothing else Styron's book promotes a need to know and understand. Even if it hadn't done this for me I'd still read it because of it's literary value."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I didn't give this three stars because of the controversy around racism. It's historical fiction, fiction being the key word. And I didn't really pick up that tone from it at all. I thought it was an innovative retelling using what information we do know and filling in the blanks from there. The reason I gave it three stars is because it contained all sorts of things that I felt could have been cut from the book and it wouldn't have mattered. I almost gave up on it in the second section. I'm glad I finished it, but it was a little tough to keep interest in it."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"For me, William Styron has written the standard from which to draw the historical novel. I say draw because an historical novel is just that; a novel. But even while the reader knows this, historical novels always seem to provoke some response framed by the light of a current outlook. This is ironic because the main attraction of historical novels (at least for me) is the escapist type pleasure that is found by immersing oneself in another world and time. This is the writer's accomplishment. William Styron does this in language and in pace so artfully that his book remains on my shelf. I keep 'The Confessions of Nat Turner' for its enjoyment and inspiration."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Before I read Styron's &quot;Lie Down In Darkness&quot;, I couldn't understand the charges of racism regarding one of my favorite books, &quot;Confessions of Nat Turner&quot;. Even so, this story is great and I can't imagine how anyone could not want Nat to succeed or understand his position. The &quot;white woman infatuation&quot; charge is ridiculous in my opinion. Nat lived in the house and was treated as an equal, the woman was kind and beautiful, it would be racist to think that Nat shouldn't be attracted to her or worthy of her love. That said, the story is much greater than that side note and wonderfully written."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"It is November of 1931 and Nat Turner awaits his death in a Virginia jail cell. Nat Turner is a black slave and a preacher. He is also the only black slave to lead a group of men against their masters and accomplish what they wanted, white terror and blood shed throughout most of America.Nat Turner's confession is made under the vision he receives from God. The confession leads the jury to decide to have him hung until death. As Nat waits in his cell with his trusty sidekick Hark he begins to recall his life and of how such a truly good man went bad and the truly cruel world of slavery.Nat turner had a wonderful childhood at Turner's Mill where Samuel Turner brought Nat into his home. After realizing how bright Nat was he started to teach him to read and write. Mr. turner was a very thoughtful man who wanted to train Nat well enough that one day he could walk free. But when things change for the worse Mr. turner is forced to send Nat to Reverend Eppes's to learn more about religion.Reverend Eppes worked Nat very hard and taught him precious little about religion. Reverend Eppes did not acknowledge that Nat could do other things then work a farm but Nat still learned about the bible from the one that Turner had given him. When Reverend Eppes went back on his word and did not set Nat free he was sold to Mr. Evens and Mr. Blanding.Mr. Evens and Mr. Blanding owned a company called Evens & Blanding. This company was based on slave auctions which at once Nat was sold at to Mr. Thomas Moore. Thomas Moore recognized Nat's traits as a carpenter and often traded him out to other people. Nat usually got Sunday's off and so he would retreat to the woods where he had a sanctuary. There he had a vision from God to kill all white people. This is where the story truly begins.&lt;P...

It is based on a slave revolt in Virginia in 1831, lead by Nate Turner. Turner&#8217;s capture and confession is the basis of this book.The novel is told in a 1st person narrative and is largely the work of Styron&#8217;s imagination. While it is brilliantly written Styron does include graphic scenes of highly erotic obsessions with various white women and one of the most vivid homosexual encounters in modern literature. Probably because of these scenes Styron was savaged by many of the leading black artists of the day but the book has endured the criticism and is, in many ways, an American Classic.Slavery is an indelible stain on the fabric of American culture. It will never be washed away. Turner is an aesthetic, a religious fanatic, a brilliant, tormented misanthropic, homicidal nihilist. His band of followers slaughters 52 men, women, and children. In retribution the white slaughter 200 blacks. Turner is captured, interrogated, and executed. Instead of inspiring a region wide uprising, he is brought down by his fellow blacks fighting alongside the plantation owners.It is a difficult book to read but it is a book that really should be read."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"not in great shape but readable- the age of the paperback added to its charmIt was a gift to my son who was born the year the book won the pulitzer 1968"},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"William Styron, a gifted writer outdid himself with this book.

A compelling masterpiece of literature."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled \\"This is a racist book disguised as a work of art.\\" It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner,\\" by T.R. Gray. Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married. Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional. So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt. In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction? Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented. Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die. That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause. What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero. Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of \\"Confessions.\\" But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia. Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself. His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"The book I ordered came quickly, and it was not expensive.

William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity. Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I came of political age during the civil rights struggle here in America in the early 1960's. Part and parcel with that awakening struggle came an increased interest in the roots of the black struggle, especially in slavery times. Such intellectuals as Herbert Apteker, the Genoveses, the Foners, Harold Cruise, James Baldwin, John Hope Franklin and others, black and white, were very interested in exploring or discovering a black resistance to the conditions of slavery not apparent on any then general reading of the black experience in America. This is the place where the recently deceased William Styron and his novelistic interpretation of one aspect of that struggle- Nat Turner's Virginia slave rebellion enters the fray.No Styron is not politically correct in his appreciation of Turner or his followers. Nor are latter day Southern whites and their sympathizers who have recoiled in horror at what expansion of Turner's rebellion might have meant for the \`peculiar institution'. But being politically correct, etc. now or historically is beside the point. Slavery was brutal. Slavery brutalized whole generations of black people for a very long time. If one expects nature's noblemen and women to come out of such a process, one will be very sadly mistaken. That the white benificaries of this system were brutalized is a given. Human progress has come about through fits and starts not a seamless curve onward and upward. Nevertheless all our sympathies are with Nat and his fellow rebels.Moreover, here are some things to think about if you are not worried about your political correctness status. Outside of John Brown at Harper's Ferry Turner's rebellion represented the highest achievement of resistance to the white slaveholders in the early 19th century. Although the fight was not pretty on either side every progressive today should stand in historical solidarity with that fight. Then one will understand not only that oppression oppresses but also that the military conditions for a successful rebellion for isolated blacks in pre- Civil War American were slim. The later incorporation of 200,000 black soldiers and sailors among the Northern forces in the Civil War are a very, very profound argument that once off the plantation blacks were as capable of bravery, courage and honor as an other American. As difficult as it is, if you do not have access to the original chronicles of the Turner uprising, read this book to get a flavor of how hard the struggle for the abolition of slavery in this country was going to be."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"William Styron sheds an interesting light on the motivations of one of American history's most intriguing figures. His fictional biography of Turner seems entirely plausible, all while raising interesting questions about slave life in the early 1800s. (For instance--does Nat's unusual level of education contribute to his dissatisfaction? Nat is treated better than most slaves--what caused him to revolt?) Styron never explicitly answers these questions, but paints a broad and detailed enough portrait of the famous slave so that the reader may come to his or her own conclusions. However, what makes this book one of my favorites is the writing, plain and simple. There are some passages in this book you will read over and over (such as when Nat kills his only victim of the whole revolt--and when he watches the sun rise from his jail cell the day of his execution). The only thing detracting from this captivating effect is Styron's constant forays into explicit sexual scenes. Grrr! One or two would have been sufficient! (Otherwise, though, a wonderful book, and very deserving of the Pulitzer)."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"Styron establishes himself as one of America's premier writers with this book. He skillfully develops the psychological despair of Nat Turner; a bright and intelligent man driven to madness and murder in the South of the early 19th century. Stryon's style is refreshing and engaging; he invokes empathy for our antagonist yet the reader is left with a sense of tragedy for the &quot;peculiar institution&quot; and the price we have all paid for its' legacy. This is a must read for those interested in understanding our terrible past and the enduring psychological scars slavery has inflicted upon our nation."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This fictional account of Nat Turner is absolutely wonderful. He makes a wonderful protaganist and throughout the story you want him to be successful and to find happiness. I was unaware that at the time the book was released, it was panned as racist by some black writers as racist. I wish they would read it again; it is a phenomenal story. Although Nat Turner is represented as a little mentally off-balanced, he is also represented as extremely smart, extremely kind, extremely strong and talented. I am reminded of Toni Morrison's Beloved, where the protaganist was also a little disturbed - driven by racism and the oppression of white society. Although her protaganist isn't as thoughtful and spiritual as Nat Turner, the idea that racism and oppression inflicted such pain is there. Add to that the absolute spiritual nature and soul-searching of Styron's Nat Turner and you have the makings a one truely great novel."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This book is fiction. There are very little accounts of what actually transpire in 1831 in Southern Virginia. What the book does, is present a fairly decent account of what slave life was like in those times. Despite it being fiction, it is well researched by William Styron and is written from the perspective of Nat Turner, who lead the greatest slave rebellion in America. It was orginally praised by black leaders in this country when first released, then with underlying theme of homosexuality by slave masters, the commentary turned nasty. This is a book that is always going to generate controversy in a similar manner that \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" did. Both books should be read for what they are, insights into the human condition during inhumane times."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"I too, am going to have to say that many recent reviewers have said what I would say if I could express myself so eloquently. This is a powerful and beautifully written book. I had heard about it and was curious, but had no idea the impact it would have on me. As a white person I've often wondered why this degree of rage hasn't been touched on before; I've always thought I would have been consumed with it had I been treated as the blacks have been. Styron's novel will haunt you long after you finsh the book."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"With avid and unsettling detail, William Styron gives us a story that is a rich and heartbreaking look at American slavery. His Nat Turner gropes blindly for mercy and for God until finally he must try to break free from bonds that are utterly, inexcusably cruel."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"If a novel like Jakes' North And South showed an unrealistic picture of the old south, then this book is its antidote. Slavery and daily life in pre-Civil War times as it surely must have been. Telling his life story as he spends his final days in a Virginia prison waiting to be hanged, Nat Turner reveals to us his secrets and the nature of his mission from God, to free the black race and punish the sins of the white man. Because its violence is kept contained until one final moment at the book's end, it seemed more shocking and visceral to me than tales of mega-death and mayhem so common in other books that chronicle bloodshed and uprising. This novel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and it earned it."},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"The Confessions of Nat Turner was a great book to read. It helped relate to the history of slavery and the many horrible things that went with it. I liked Styron's use of description in this book also. One of the best points of this book is that is contains all different aspects of life including love (between Nat and Margaret) also hate between Nat and Margaret and Nat's first owner Sam Turner, it contains peace and war. Some of the events in this book are very hard to read and seem to be confusing and weird at times but as the book progresses the reader begi to see how all the connections are coming to together. The ending is also good and very touching since the reader has been with Nat his whole life. I reccomend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"The confessions of Nat Turner","review":"This work is a must-read if you are interested in the South, slavery, and race relations. Styron's fiction is compelling. It's fiction, not history, and critics wrongly pan the work because they perceive that Styron's imagination unjustly molds &quot;facts.&quot; The novel provides readers a look at slavery through the eyes of a slave - a wonderful, mad, erudite slave. With very little historical evidence and documents to use, the author uses his vision to create a fascinating portrait of the uprising's leader, who led the only successful slave revolt in the U.S. The implications of religion and the failure of Turner's troops to take Jerusalem can be extended to today's predicament. I found the author's afterword, in this 25th Anniversary edition, particulary insightful on the reaction the book received from various critics. Styron's disappointment with critics' inabilities to distance their own personal agendas when looking at literature concurs with my own feelings about the politics of academia."},{"Title":"In the Claws of the German Eagle","review":"the book is written poorlylike a monotone and you get bored easilysame old word pharses throughoutdon't buy it"},{"Title":"Juneteenth: A Celebration of Freedom","review":"There are many books on Juneteenth, but none so informative and accessible for both kids and adults as this one.

Life becomes a bit more exciting for the town residents, however, when an elderly woman arrives and is, too all appearances, the grown-up little girl who was kidnapped from the town decades ago. Before her identity can be confirmed, though, she's found dead in the church parking lot, the victim of what appears to be a robbery gone bad. Suspicion around her death grows, however, when another member of the town is found murdered, pushed from the top of a crumbling tower. Suddenly, life in Stone's Throw isn't quite as heavenly as it once was.Fortunately, Augusta Goodnight has been assigned as a temporary guardian angel to Lucy and, bringing with her the scent of strawberries and an assortment of mouthwatering recipes, she breezes into town to help Lucy and her friends to investigate the strange occurrences that continue to plague the town and to untangle the mystery surrounding the two women's deaths. Their investigation takes a few deadly turns, to the sorrow of the entire town, but also brings about some wonderful changes in Lucy's life, including a chance for romance as well as for reconciliation with her estranged daughter.Five stars to this cozy mystery, which is the best of the Augusta Goodnight series that I've read so far.

This book was printed in Britain and very hard to find."},{"Title":"Piper Aircraft - The Development and History of Piper Designs","review":"If you're a serious Piper Aircraft fan this is a great book if you can find & obtain a copy. It's expensive but if you want a book dealing with the Piper line of A/C it's jam-packed with specifications , years of manufacture , engines , serial number ranges , number of A/C built , etc on all models from the beginning to 1996. I bought the book mainly for the J series & up to the PA18 Super Cub but the book has sure opened my eyes on the other models , prototypes , one of's & proposed A/C.Never knew that Piper had a proposal for a 4 engine PA35 Pocono. For you crop sprayers the section on PA36 Pawnee Brave is very interesting running from the different opposed piston engines to turbine power, even a PA36 ( N57569 ) equipped with a Pratt & Whitney R-985. The Piper PA48 Enforcer based on a original P-51 airframe with turbine power is included & the Lopresti - Piper based on a Globe Swift airframe also has a chapter. But lots more , too many to mention including lots of black & white plus color photos. Obviously the book is not in everyone's price range & is hard to find but if you're really into Piper A/C in a sertous manner this book is for you ! THANK YOU MR.PEPERELL - DEFINITELY FIVE STARS."},{"Title":"Your adversary, the Devil","review":"This is an excellent Biblical study on the Devil, his character, agenda and the methods he uses against the Christian in the realm of spiritual warfare.Without an understanding of Satan, his person, his plans, programs and devices, we are ill prepared for his attacks and the devious methods that he uses.The author exposes the Devil for who he really is and for what he really is.This is an excellent study of Satan from a Biblical & Christian perspective from the Fall and the traits of Satan's character as a 'deceiver', 'perverter', 'imitator', 'lawless one', 'rebel', tempter' and a 'roaring lion'.Also examined are Satan's attacks upon the Christian, the Beliver's Authority over Satan in the Name of Jesus Christ and ultimately Satan's final destiny.Little is heard or taught about Satan and the spiritual realm today. Sadly this is also true in many Churches. This in itself is one of the very agendas pursued by the Devil, as is denial of his existence which allows him, in many cases, a free hand to operate as he would like.This is an absolute must-read on this subject. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Your adversary, the Devil","review":"This is a very important book by a very great scholar, and Christian man.

It leaves a slightly disturbing view of what is left of us when loves consumes so much of us that there is little left when it's gone. This is the kind of love many of love yearn for in love, willing to exchange to have it. Life may very well be the price to pay to have it. This is all states beautifully with the quote: &quot;When love comes, you plunge without thinking. You see that your life was an empty shell before love came, so you turn your back on the past without a second thought. And then, when the world comes back to claim its own, there's no way to fight it, because you have no heart to endure loneliness anymore. You've thrown it away, like a child throwing away a paper toy.&quot; Again, Gage has written something of a fiction that is a little beyond just a story.. always nice to have something to think about after reading a book."},{"Title":"Taboo","review":"After reading Gage's novel 'Confession', I somehow wondered if I hallucinated or misremembered how trashy 'A Glimpse of Stocking' was. Could something as bland, boring and ponderous as 'Confession' originate from a person who also has a mind that concocts gloriously over-the-top melodrama? Apparently, yes. No matter what 'A Glimpse...' was or wasn't, 'Taboo' is fresh in my mind and even trashier than I remember 'A Glimpse...' being, so colour me lucid, and colour the impossible possible! Now that's what I'm talking about; so camp there's even a cabin.The gist of the set-up is 1930-1940s era Hollywood, with brief excursions to other less-glamorous places. There's a girl, there's a guy, there's haters, there's tragedy, and of course, an operatic climax. It's perfectly plotted; not only that, it has observations about Hollywood that may not be anything new, but are well-phrased and, I don't know, I just really liked reading them.I'm not usually one to be impressed by violence or business deals in my fiction (Harold Robbins, I'm looking at you--except not really), however the leading man, Joe Knight, when he makes things happen, oh boy, I wanted to applaud the guy. The bada$$ to end all bada$$es, is our Knight in shining armour. He kind of mellows some after he meets the female lead, but considering they don't meet till well on into the story it's no biggie. Also, there are other omg amazing things happening to make up for it. I won't go into those things, or any that came before it, 'cause believe me, you don't want the surprises spoiled. At least I wouldn't have.If you are at all interested in trash, camp, melodrama, you've got to get your hands on this book. It's a classic in my mind."},{"Title":"Taboo","review":"Here's another sizzler set in Hollywood, this time in the 1930's. The lives of the movers and shakers in TABOO are a roller coaster ride of sins and secrets and of unattainable happiness. Gage's two main sufferers, Kate Hamilton and Joseph Knight, go through the melodramatic motion of uniting then paying the price for it. But it's Eve Sinclair, the child superstar, who really makes TABOO a delicious romp. Her cold-hearted volcanic temperament will make any fan of Valley of the Dolls stand up and cheer.-----Martin Boucher"},{"Title":"Taboo","review":"Good read! A great page turner!

Visiting Khajuraho and Mahabalipuram in India made me feel even more deprived of the opportunity to visit Angkor - Cambodia is such a dangerous place to travel to. Consequently I have satisfied myself as best as I can with books. And so many of these refer to 'The Royal Way', a novel by Andre Malruax that it is claimed recreates the atmosphere of Angkor better than anything else. Consequently I felt even more aggrieved to find the book is just about unobtainable. Recently, however, I did get a copy which I have just finished reading.'The Royal Way' is a strong novel with good characters and ideas. It is not a happy story however. Hardship is barely rewarded for the characters. This novel is NOT about Angkor despite the bibliographies to books on Angkor that cite it. The two principle characters spend a short time on the causeway at Angkor, but even that is in the darkness of night. The novel does evoke great images of the jungle and the tribal people living there, as well as one temple from which the characters strip three huge carved stones.I could speculate that Malraux deliberately didn't write about a brilliant glowing Angkor for the very reason that he didn't want people stripping sculptures from it as his characters (and himself as a young man) did from 'lost' temples overgrown in the jungle. This is a good novel of struggle against nature and with ethics, but you should not read it for the feel of Angkor or any of the other major temple complexes in Cambodia."},{"Title":"Sweet Expectations: Michele Hoskins' Recipe for Success","review":"As I strolled down the isle of a bookstore I felt Michelle's book tugging at my inner most being.

Trust me, the power of this book will find you at whatever stage you may be in your growth, or sometime perceived decline, as an entrepreneur. I'm a huge fan of beginning chapters with quotations; I especially love authors who take as much time as this author has to select the perfect quotes that resonate deep within the reader's soul. Michele's book is profoundly broken into several 3-5 page chapters that have meaning. She ends each section small statements, keys that only an experienced, sincere, committed entrepreneur could teach. Each time you complete a section you want to return to place you were when you read the first words, because it will change you... you actually grow as you read this book.

If not, make a mental note because she is definitely an African-American businesswoman worth keeping on the radar. In her book, SWEET EXPECTATIONS, she shares not only her recipe for professional success but also her life journey. She frankly shares her successes as well as her mistakes both in business and in life.At the book's opening, Michele is in an unfulfilling yet materially comfortable marriage and she wants to make major changes in her life. She eventually divorces, abandoning a life of relative comfort and trading it for one of a struggling single parent. She sells her home and moves herself and her daughters to her mother's home. At her lowest point she was even a welfare recipient. During this time, Michele begins to consider what her long-term career goals should be and eventually decides to go into business selling syrup based on a cherished family recipe. The recipe, a closely guarded family secret, has been passed down through the generations to a few select descendants and not all of her family is pleased that she plans to market it. This becomes the source of difficulty for Michele, and in addition, she encounters problems due to her lack of knowledge about business. In spite of the difficulties, after years of struggle, Michele Hoskins eventually transitions from an unhappy wife, to a divorced welfare mom and eventually to the position of CEO of her very own multi-million dollar company.The book highlights her experiences, expounds business advice, provides inspirational quotes, and offers advice on living. There are a few dry moments, but all in all this is a truly inspiring book that reminds readers that setbacks do not have to keep them from achieving their dreams.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Sweet Expectations: Michele Hoskins' Recipe for Success","review":"I recommend this book to individuals thinking about starting a business or undertaking some other life-changing event.

It's too dry, and is too choppy. It reads like it was put together from a taped interview or speech and it's also bit cold. The author's family members are all presented in a less than flattering light and I could have done without some of the spiritual beliefs that were expressed. There was a whole lot of story here. It just wasn't crafted well."},{"Title":"The mystery of Morgan Castle (The Morgan Bay mysteries)","review":"I think I must have read this book a hundred times in elementary school.

Your kids will love it."},{"Title":"The mystery of Morgan Castle (The Morgan Bay mysteries)","review":"I had the entire series of Morgan Bay Mysteries when I was a kid--they were great fun to read. While the writing is at times a bit simplistic (\\"Gabby saw the fence. He went up to the fence. Gabby looked through the slats in the fence.\\") because it was to help students in the classroom to read better, the stories themselves were really entertaining, and the artwork was wonderfully detailed. This book is about Gabby needing money for a surfboard, and he answers a job to take care of an elderly woman's dog. She lives next door to a spooky abandoned mansion, and Gabby and the dog realize there's something going on at the place. Of course, the mystery is solved at the end, but the best thing about the book is the artwork. There is a great shot of the mansion's property from above that gives the whole layout in relation to the elderly woman's house, and the street, and the ocean side. A wonderful fun book to discover again and read."},{"Title":"Winter Fire","review":"This has to be the dumbest book I have ever had the misfortune of reading.The main character is so stupid it is a wonder she lived as long as she did.And also the book seems to skip, and not explain how it got there.Skip this one."},{"Title":"Introducing Austria: A Short History.

Sherlock Holmes fans will especially enjoy this release since it features three Holmes stories. More importantly, it provides a sampling of the varied material Conan Doyle's fertile mind created.Issue 2 consists of a trio of Holmes adventures: 'Copper Beeches,' 'Speckled Band' and 'Hound of the Baskervilles;' the Professor Challenger 'Lost World' story; a poem; an excerpt from Conan Doyle's COMING OF THE FAIRIES book ; and two science fantasy tales. I hated J. B. Bonivert's artwork for the 'Death by Electrocution' and 'The Los Amigos Fiasco' entries, his off-the-wall stylings overwhelmed the narratives of both stories. Overall I enjoyed the remaining stories and artwork. The 'Speckled Band' artwork, done by Nestor Redondo, was exceptional and brought to mind the much-beloved 'Classics Illustrated' comics of my youth. Another superior effort was the Professor Challenger tale with artwork by Donald Marquez; likewise the 'Hound' adaptation with artwork by George Sears although Sears gave Watson a nose worthy of W. C. Fields!All in all, this 2002 release is an appealing literary smorgasbord sure to interest fans of the multi-talented Conan Doyle. Recommended."},{"Title":"Graphic Classics: Arthur Conan Doyle (Graphic Classics (Graphic Novels))","review":"Continuing their Graphics Classics series, \\"Graphic Classics: Arthur Conan Doyle\\" allows several different illustrators the chance to adapt and interpret some of Doyle's most famous stories and creations, as well as a few lesser known gems. Most of the stories here are longer than in other offerings in the Graphic Classics series, but all are well done and respectful to the source material.Included are:The Adventure of the Copper Beeches - A fascinating Sherlock Holmes adventure well-adapted by Rick Geary.The Los Amigos Fiasco - An amusing tale of an Electric Chair gone wrong, with a complimenting visual style.The Adventures of the Speckled Band - Another fine Sherlock Holmes adaptation, with perfect artwork accompanying the original text.Master - A clever, short poem.The Lost World - Doyle's famous dinosaur tale. Very well done, in grand adventure style.The Coming of the Fairies - An illustrated text version of Doyle's fairy beliefs.The Hound of the Baskervilles - Sherlock Holmes most famous adventure, given good treatment.How it Happened - A quaint ghost story. Also well done.The book comes off as Sherlock Holmes heavy, which was a surprise to me, as the Graphics Classic series seems to focus on lesser-known works of authors. I would have liked to have seen an adaptation of Doyle's mummy tale \\"Lot 249,\\" or some of his other horror work.

I haven't used this book of stories by teens for teens about overcomeing hardships to teach an entire unit yet, but I keep buying more for my classroom library as more and more students ask if they can borrow copies of it. I've also loaned copies to our Department of Children and Family Services mentor as well as to our counselor.Why? Students relate to the stories. I understood that students would occassionally enjoy stories they can relate to, but I underestimated how much they'd enjoy it. In fact, I'm beginning to sense that enjoying the book may not be the reason they want it; they may need to hear stories like this.For this reason, it's a good text for inner-city teens, especially those who've undergone and continue to survive through the kind of hardships that go along with various kinds of stigmata and deprivation. And for the same reason, it's an equally good choice for teachers as it is for those non-teachers who personally know someone who might benefit from such a collection of stories. Julie Landsman continues to put together good, necessary work."},{"Title":"From Darkness to Light: Teens Write about How They Triumphed over Trouble","review":"This book is a wonderful way for clinicians or behavioral health professionals to understand the minds of teenagers. It takes themes like suicide, divorce, bullying, etc and teens who actually experience this. They write their experiences from their own words. It also can be helpful for providers to read the theme topic with the teen to help the teen identify their own experience.

Please use in appropriate context."},{"Title":"From Darkness to Light: Teens Write about How They Triumphed over Trouble","review":"I'm a counselor in an urban middle school. I used some of the stories with my 6th graders. They were very interested in the topics and the fact that the stories were written by kids their age. They could relate to the topics. I wish someone would put together another collection of more recent stories. Overall, I feel that this book is great and very inspirational."},{"Title":"The End of Elsewhere: Travels Among the Tourists","review":"The End of Elsewhere is a wonderful book that engages the reader on several levels. Firstly, it is an entertaining travelogue, much in the style of Paul Theroux's non-fiction, shrewdly observant and mordantly funny. Grescoe follows the well-trodden paths of modern tourism, from a mock-pilgrimage in Spain, along an escorted bus tour and a Mediterranean cruise, to the remnants of the hippie drug trail in India and the sex tourists of Thailand.The author interleaves his traveler's tales with just the right amount of historical and cultural context: the history of tourism from classical Greece to Cook's Tours, the perils of misleading travel guidebooks and the destructive capacity of eco-tourism, among other subjects.The thoughtful reader will be lead inevitably to re-evaluate his own travel plans - and that, more than entertainment or information, makes this book a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The End of Elsewhere: Travels Among the Tourists","review":"Let's face it - a lot of travel writing is pure crapola. How much more ink can be spilled about Machu Picchu, hidden gems on the Thai peninsula or places to eat under $10 in New York City? Then there are the stunt books - the guys who decide to row or walk from one country to another, visit every country that starts with the letter K, or To Hellholes and Back, a book that visits places that would be on no one's itinerary unless they were on a UN aid mission or insane. It's not surprising I find the latter more interesting.This is a similar book. A book about tourists themselves, rather than their well-worn destinations.Re: a reviewer's remark about \\"who talks like that?\\", I'd venture that writing is a thoughtful act of reflection. I would hope that after digesting one's experiences, I'd be able to generate prose different from how I'd talk. What a bizarre criticism - ditto for taking umbrage with injecting a bit of learning (pretentious?), not in a pedantic or showy way, but in a way that helps the narrative - exactly what Grescoe does. In my mind, he's among the finest travel writers in the business. If anyone doubts that, check out The Devil's Picnic or Sacre Blues...The book's pithy, at times funny, filled with self doubt and ultimately sad - the experience anyone has if they've been away from home for too long."},{"Title":"The End of Elsewhere: Travels Among the Tourists","review":"This outstanding book by Canadian journalist Grescoe is an absolute must for anyone who, like me, likes to travel overseas or read a good travelogue. It combines a history of tourism (ranging from the Roman Empire to modern package tours) and participatory journalism (ranging from solo hiking pilgrimage to all-inclusive cruise ship) with a very personal examination of what compels the author's own wanderlust. This is all woven into a nine-month journey that takes Grescoe from the end of the Camino de Santiago on the West coast of Spain, to the Window to the World theme park in Shenzen, China.Grescoe is the perfect kind of writer for a book with this broad a scope: erudite, witty, adventurous, insightful, and most importantly, reflective and honest. Seasoned travelers will enjoy the mini-histories, such as how the Romans established the first resort towns to indulge in outrageous behavior, how the first international travel agency (Cook's) grew from the temperance movement, the rise and fall of the \\"Grand Tour\\", the emergence of guidebook-led tourism from Michelin to Lonely Planet, and much more. As compelling as these bits are, the book's real strength lies in its provocative examination of the act of tourism.Grescoe purposely sets himself an itinerary of \\"where the tourist ruts have been plowed the deepest\\" in order to play sociologist amongst the tourists. The book's main theme is how the tourist's quest for unspoiled terrain and/or a totally \\"authentic\\" experience leads to the exact opposite of these things. This is, of course, directly linked to themes of cultural imperialism, although Grescoe is careful not to become hectoring or pedantic about any of these matters. At the same time, Grescoe is interested in why people embark on tourism and the rather depressing answer is often merely the freedom to transgress the rules of their home culture, generally in relation to some combination of alcohol, sex, or drugs. He himself falls prey to this in a low moment in Thailand, when he belatedly realizes his actions are just as ethically wrong as those of several traveling companions he's been critiquing. And that's hopefully the effect of the book on the reader -- to provoke an examination of why we want to travel and what the effects of those desires are.Note: Grescoe's two other books, on Quebec, and on forbidden pleasures, are equally excellent."},{"Title":"The End of Elsewhere: Travels Among the Tourists","review":"Brutally bad. Pretentious. Type of guy who can't use the word \\"drunk\\" but has to call it \\"inebriation.\\" Overly flowery descriptive language throughout (i.e., \\"The dying of the light is mushy and anti-climactic...\\"). Apparently a non-drinker after years of alcohol abuse but says he'll \\"indulge in ceremonial samplings of local intoxicant.\\" Honestly, who talks like this?

The story begins just after the First World War and continues into the tumultuous nineteen seventies. In tracing the journey of the family across time, the novel also traces the journey of the country. The family progresses as Jamaica progresses; in fits and starts, with notable achievements and resounding failures. The Newtons, like Jamaica, must grow, must change whether they like to or not as times change. Like their country, they shift attitudes and approaches to keep up with the march of time.The Newtons are a Jamaican archetype - landed mulattoes - privileged relative to the majority of the population. The novel introduces the issues of race, colour and class without any attempt to explain away the unpleasant realities of the Jamaican social landscape. It challenges the absurdity of American racism as directly as it does Jamaican shadism.Stone Haven is engaging. Its characters, although distinctly Jamaican, are also universal. It's themes are the maddening mix of love, envy, infidelity, ambition, irresponsibility, quarrels, parasitism and cohesiveness that exists in all families. The characters are whole and human; each an admixture of virtue and vice and therefore entirely believable. Yet it is in the area of character development that Stone Haven falters most profoundly.The novel is ambitious. The mere span of time it covers is indicative of this. In 248 pages, Evan Jones attempts to develop the characters of eleven family members. He does so with varying degrees of success.While we get a good grip on Grace, Stanley and Harold, every other family member is under developed. The most telling failure in this regard is John. John as a child is courageous, impetuous and reckless. I became so anxious about his boyish adventurism that I mumbled, \\"Da pickney damn bad\\" as I read of his exploits. His career path shows John to be as courageous as we knew him as a child. His marriage to Mavis shows that he retained his tendency toward impetuosity. There is, however, the matter of how he manages his relationship with Mavis that simply does not fit. There is nothing in John's history as we are shown it which prepares us for it; which would make us say, \\"Ah ha!\\"Mavis' characterization is hugely disappointing. She could have been one of the most interesting characters in the novel, but Evan Jones lets us down here. Mavis is, like Cynthia (Harold's wife) a malcontent. But whereas we are able to ascribe Cynthia's failings to shallowness, Mavis' earlier characterization had promised a much more substantial persona.It is also a great pity that Miriam was not developed more roundly. One of several intelligent and independent female characters, a more detailed portrait of her would have provided useful comparisons and contrasts between her grandmother, her mother and herself. It would have assisted the author in showing how courage, strength and virtue are manifested in different ways in different eras.Even Stanley's characterization is a bit problematic. Evan Jones appears to have shifted gears in the portrayal of this character without giving his readers any warning. Stanley is the rock of the family in masculine form. He is undoubtedly flawed but equally undoubtedly humane. Why Paul, his youngest son, would describe him as Machiavellian is anybody's guess. Paul himself is a bit of a puzzle. He seems to have been developed toward the end of the novel as an afterthought. Evan Jones pays scant regard to him until then. This is one character who could have been stricken from the text. I cannot think of what useful purpose he serves.It surprises me that the introduction to the book printed on the back cover suggests that the story follows Grace's life in Jamaica. While she is certainly a central character, she is no more than that - one of several central characters. Like her husband Stanley, Grace is a \\"rock\\" of the family. Simple, strong and decent she bears more than a passing resemblance in character to her mother-in-law although they were formed by highly dissimilar social, religious and economic forces.One of the most intriguing questions raised by Stone Haven is, \\"What is virtue?\\" Evan Jones presents virtue in the form of Grace's asceticism, old mother Newton's determination and pragmatism and Miriam's willingness to question tradition and authority when they invite questioning. While it makes no earth shaking pronouncements on the nature of virtue or vice, the questions raised by Stone Haven are important ones. The novel answers the questions it raises honestly and without apology.Evan Jones writes of his people and his country with a deep and abiding love. It is a love unimpaired by white washing or illusion. Stone Haven provides those of us who struggle to reconcile ourselves with the imperfections of the families and countries we love with the reassurance that we are not alone."},{"Title":"Stone Haven (Caribbean Writers Series)","review":"This author is obviously not comfortable in his own skin (whatever colour he decides that it is).

Obviously he has an unhealthy obsession with both the colour of one's skin and illicit sex."},{"Title":"Little Brown Bear","review":"I have been looking for this book for at least 30 yrs.

Its nineteen chapters focus on three themes: Plate Tectonics, Physical and Biological History (the history of Earth's physical features, systems, and the life forms that have inhabited it), and Evolution. The authors have done a very good job in making the text readable and I believe it can be read enjoyably and to great benefit by an interested general reader outside of class. At least I found it fascinating and informative. The text uses photos, diagrams, charts, and all kinds of illustrations to enhance the reader's understanding of what is being said. There is also a useful CD to supplement the text. And Thomson has provided a website with even more things to read and do.Each chapter provides an outline of what is going to be discussed, a bulleted set of chapter objectives, an introduction, and the chapter materials. The intra-chapter material is presented to questions asked in the headings of each section. The chapters also have little boxes entitled \\"What Would You Do?\\" that try to ask practical questions about real life issues that are related to the material being discussed. Each chapter ends with a bulleted Summary section, a list of important terms (that usefully has the page number where that term was used) and review questions that are multiple choice and short essay types. There is also an Apply Your Knowledge section with a few problems for the student (reader) to think about and practically apply what has been learned in that chapter. Some also have Field Questions that ask questions about a photograph, figure or table provided or referred to in the text.Chapters 1-4 lay out the systems in the Earth and how the changes its systems affect each other. They talk about the basic materials that make up the Earth, Plate Tectonics, and Geologic Time. Chapters 5 and 6 talk about Rocks, Fossils and how they fit into the time scale of the Earth - and a look at what sedimentary rocks are and how they record the history of life on Earth.Chapters 7-9 talk about Evolution, its evidences, and early life during the Precambrian period (separate chapters for the Archean Eon and the Proterozoic Eon). Chapters 10-13 cover the Paleozoic. The Mesozoic is covered in Chapters 14 and 15, the Cenozoic in 16-18, and Chapter 19 covers Primate and Human Evolution.Appendix A is a metric conversion chart, Appendix B lays out the classification of organisms, and Appendix C discusses mineral identification. There is a useful glossary and a helpful index. Between the glossary and index there is a page with the answers to each chapter's multiple choice questions.This is an interesting, well written, and useful text that is useful for all readers interested in this subject and I am happy to recommend it.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI"},{"Title":"Historical geology: Evolution of the earth and life through time","review":"This most recent edition includes an updated planetary system as well as an improved structure of the geologic time scale.

It is all laid out: not understanding the limits of our rights as partners does not mean that the real-life bigotry and narrowness will not come roaring into our lives with awful consequences. At the point that the father Donald Kowalski is willing to restrict meaningful treatment (and thereby the hope of recovery from a serious car accident) for his own child simply to satisfy his homophobia it is hard to deny that right has not been done and the best interests of Sharon Kowalski were ignored. A cautionary tale....."},{"Title":"Why Can't Sharon Kowalski Come Home?","review":"Karen Thompson and Sharon Kowalski are a lesbian couple in the midwest in the early 1980s. They were together for four years when Sharon and her niece and nephew were in an accident brought on by a drunk driver, her niece was killed and her nephew suffered permanent injuries. Sharon herself suffered as well so much that she would be unable to care for herself.She was living with Karen Thompson but nobody in her family was aware of the true nature of their relationship. Her family had tried to separate them but love conquered all. Karen was determined to take Sharon back home and care for her until the very end. I don't know if Sharon is alive but I do remembering seeing them on the Donahue show talking about their fight in a time when homosexuality and lesbianism even in the 1980s seemed very much in the closet.Karen is truly honest about her feelings. She loves Sharon and doesn't want to be apart from her. Even if it means that sexual intercourse would be impossible in Sharon's condition, think of Christopher and Dana Reeve. True love is hard to find even in heterosexual romances. Of course, Sharon's family probably thought that her lesbianism was over now forced to live her remaining years in a wheelchair and being cared for.Before Sharon's parents and relatives had visited the couple but were unknown of the nature of their relationship, this was Minnesota and possibly this was how lesbian couples maintained their secrecy. Of course, nothing is a secret anymore in our society.Sharon's family was devastated by the accident which killed one family member and severely injured two permanently. They should be angry at the drunk driver more than Karen. I know that Karen and Sharon are together if Sharon is still alive.Beyond that, I have a friend who cared for her husband suffering from Parkinson's disease. She cared for him until the very end. I have no doubt that Karen is still caring for Sharon and loving her as much as possible. Love is not about sexual intercourse but about people coming together as both friends rather than lovers.Karen fought hard to care for Sharon even if it meant feeding her, changing her, cleaning her, and doing actions that nurses are required to do for somebody so handicapped. I imagine that time has passed and Sharon's family has long made peace with Sharon's lesbianism despite their objections. It's a court case that was one of the pioneers of the gay and lesbian rights movement. I wish Karen and Sharon well and their families as well."},{"Title":"Why Can't Sharon Kowalski Come Home?","review":"I picked up this book thinking it would be a fairly tame, shallow and thoughtless book about a lesbian love affair.What a mistake I made.Although I read this book fourteen years after it was originally written, I found it to be the most influential piece of literature I have ever read.To read of such injustice and predudice towards someone and lack of care to a disabled human being devestated me. I was truly inspired by Karen Thompson's undying struggle to be reunited with her lover and partner despite all hurdles she faced.This novel highlighted the gross injustice which is being dealt to members of same sex relationships worldwide.A well written book which deserves to be placed on high school syllabuses."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"The Last of the Mohicans takes place in New York state in 1757, during the French and Indian Wars. A troop of British colonials, led by the young Major Duncan Hayward, travels through the wilderness on their way to Fort William Henry. Accompanying the soldiers are Cora and Alice Munro, the daughters of the general who presides at the fort. By happenstance they encounter the frontiersman known as Hawkeye, his Indian companion Chingachgook, and the latter's son Uncas. Hawkeye informs the party that their Indian guide, Magua, has been leading them astray, and that he is a member of the Huron tribe who is friendly with the French. Magua escapes, but later returns with a band of Indians who take the two women captive, along with Hayward and David Gamut, a teacher of religious singing who seems to exist in the book only to serve as the Christian antithesis of the stoic Hawkeye. The only hope these four prisoners have for salvation is that Hawkeye and his Indian companions will rescue them from the clutches of their hostile captors.The settlement and founding of America is such a fascinating period in history, and James Fenimore Cooper brings it vividly to life. Like his idol Sir Walter Scott, Cooper combined his own experiences of the region and its inhabitants with extensive historical research to create a romanticized version of his country's past. I have read other works by Cooper (The Spy, The Deerslayer), and found his plotting to be too meandering and haphazard in its construction. The Last of the Mohicans, on the contrary, is expertly paced, with frequent moments of intense action and suspense punctuated by interludes of more quiet contemplation. The story is captivating from beginning to end, with the exception of a couple incongruous scenes in which characters don disguises that challenge the reader's belief. Despite these low points, Cooper's writing is beautiful throughout. He describes the Adirondack wilderness with the keen observation and lyrical expression of a Thoreau. His depiction of the Native Americans in the book may not be entirely accurate, but he is always very respectful toward them. He has a tendency to portray the Indians as being too cold in their demeanor and too reliant on superstition, though never so much as to the point where his characterizations become insulting. He exhibits great reverence for the land and the traditions of its native inhabitants.If there's an obstacle preventing today's readers from tackling The Last of the Mohicans, it's the language. While the text does not contain a great deal of archaic words, the sentences are constructed with the complex, convoluted syntax of a bygone era. Everyone in the book, from the highest general to the lowliest fur trapper, speaks with the poetic voice of a Lord Byron. A dictionary is not required, but every sentence does require some thought. After a while Cooper's narrative voice grows on you, and you'll come to enjoy the antiquated cadence of his prose. There is a dignity and a gravitas to the language that no longer exists in contemporary literature. Reading The Last of the Mohicans takes you back to a now forgotten time when those who wrote books were smarter than you, and they intended every work to be a masterpiece. To that end Cooper was largely successful. Almost two centuries after its publication this novel still provides a vital and invigorating reading experience."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Having read this years ago and finding it again for my Kindle is a treat. James Fenimore Cooper delivers a great story that allows the reader to understand the era, people, geography and lives they led. As one of the first classic American writers Cooper drew on his many experiences from his youth from the area around Cooperstown,New York. This lends credibility to the story that allows one to enjoy the characters and identify with their drama as the story unfolds. I enjoyed reading this as a freshman in college and it has been great rediscovering again as one of the great pieces in the American literature lexicon."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"There are several great movies of The Last of the Mohicans especially a silent version and the Daniel Day Lewis film that came out several years ago. I've always loved the story and knew I needed to read the book. I found it a very difficult read however. The story is great but I am bogged down by James Fenimore Cooper's writing style and ponderous wording. He obviously had a good understanding of the area in which he lived and the native peoples but I found his book hard going. So I can say I read it, appreciate the story but didn't enjoy the book. Sometimes the movies are better than the book."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I liked the book, Last of the Mohicans. I notice that many reviewers who gave it one or two stars are kids who had to read the book for an advanced English class or who saw the movie and decided to read the book. It is NOT an easy read (which is probably why many kids did not like the book), but I thought it was worth the effort. It was a little difficult keeping the characters straight at first because Cooper has several names for the key characters and switches between them freely.My favorite character was actually one that I would guess is an outlier - David Gamut. His manhood is often insulted by Hawkeye, (Hawkeye calls David's pitch pipe his \\"tooting weapon\\" and he pokes fun of his useless profession of psalmody) yet David's bravery is no less than the heroes of the tale. Sure he can't shoot a gun (it would be against his principles anyway), but he sticks with the sisters when they are kidnapped by Magua and is able to come and go freely among the Indians as he is viewed by them as not having all of his mental faculties. He saves Uncas' life by secretly switching places with him and tells Hawkeye not to avenge his death should he die for the ruse. His moral character is higher, I believe, than the vengeful Indians and Hawkeye. While Hawkeye tolerates or even disdains David at the beginning of the book, I think he grows to like and even admire David by the end.The plot was interesting to me and sure some of the language is convoluted and Cooper's vocabulary is admittedly far superior to mine. However, if you keep a dictionary nearby, you'll learn several new words and enjoy an exciting tale."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"\\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is a novel for the ages and its hero Hawkeye is a man who teaches life lessons with each page you turn. Many people believe that this novel has outlived its worthiness but once turn of the pages will reveal to the reader a world that is both savage and young, characters that are both civilized and savage, and a story that harkens back to the beginnings of the new world. Cooper's language is hard to swallow sometimes, and the movie is easier to watch, but the reader who settles into the pages of Hawkeye's life and world is rewarded with lessons about friendship, love, survival and the rite of passage that all people go through. It is a definite must read for both English and History classes as it explores the beginnings of this great country in which we live."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"it is a very good book but the english that it is written in is different from the way we speak today. I enjoy the book and will recommend it to everyone looking for something that is good to read and to all children for their classes that require reading books."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Here is one of those books that is considered an American &quot;classic&quot; that few people have ever actually read. That is to say, fewer people than even the usual canon of classics. That's too bad, as this truly is an exceptional novel.Cooper's overly-formal language that he invokes for the dialogue of his characters is likely to appear stilted to the modern reader. Also, the occasions of &quot;conversation&quot; that he shares with his readers is bound to seem a bit awkward. However, the epoch in which the author lived was far different than that of today. The style of this novel is somewhat foreign, but it is a style that Cooper inherited from Europeon novels of the period.The narrative passages in the book are colorful and impressively descriptive. One cannot read this tale for long without getting the feeling that he / she is out in the forest (which is, of course, precisely the point). As a matter of fact, the novel has inspired me to someday visit the Hudson River, Lake George &amp; some other key locales described in its pages.One of the aspects of the story that surprised me was just how complicated the politics were between the Indian tribes. In truth, I knew very little about the Huron and Delaware tribes before I began reading. Since I finished the novel, I've found that Cooper's portrayal of the various races to be historically accurate. That's always a plus in any novel.For those who would like to learn more about Indian history, this book is a must-read. As the definitive novel of the French &amp; Indian war, the book would also be of interest to those who are intrigued by military history. In fact, one of the central scenes in the book details the horrifying massacre of the poor denizens of Fort William Henry, which is an actual historical event. Aside from these considerations, tho, it's just a good story - period."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"This book is an excellent read. Anyone who enjoys stories of Indian wars will love this novel. With romance and action-packed suspense with story line fits this book perfectly. James Fenimore Cooper's does a great job with the book and entices anyone who has reads it. Hawkeye acurate aim, Chingachgook's nativity, Uncas's daring thoughts, Alice's innocence, Cora's strength in mind and spirit, and Duncan's courage and love for Alice makes the book extremely breathtaking. Magua, is the evil Huron warrior who is a great enemy. His unusual love for Cora makes him extremely eery. Maguas is determined to destroy the last of the Mohicans."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"There are a vast amount of differences among the cultures and societies of different races. But what of the differences among peoples of the same race? Take for example the peoples of the United States. What are the differences between a person from California and a person from Louisiana? When looked at under a microscope, there are a great many comparisons to be made about a person from the south and a person from the west-coast. James Fenimore Cooper makes a like comparison in his classic The Last of the Mohicans. Cooper looks at the differences between white Europeans (primarily British and French) and two tribes of North American Indians: the Mohicans and the Hurons. Cooper compares the two tribes of Indians as well. Cooper sets his novel in eastern North America during the French and Indian War. His characters are of two different races: white Europeans, British and French; and North American Indians, the Mohicans and the Hurons. Cooper's description of the characters, the scenery, the sounds, the ways of the Indians-this author gives such vivid descriptions of everything that the reader gets a very clear picture of it all; almost like a movie playing inside the mind. Packed with some kind of action or adventure in every chapter, The Last of the Mohicans is a classic piece of literature that is recommended to anyone. The plot begins with the two daughters of a British general attempting to travel from the military station they are at presently to the station of their father. Accompanied by attendants and an Indian guide, they set out on the journey to their father. Not long after the party commenced travelling, they are met by three people; two Mohicans and a white scout, who is friend to the Mohicans and is well-accustomed to the ways of Indians and the wilderness. The British party's Indian guide leaves them, and they turn to the scout and the Mohicans for help. The scout and his friends agree to help them get to the station. Much action and adventure begins at this point in the novel, and continues to the very last page. The Last of the Mohicans is not only interesting to read because the plot flows and moves smoothly, but it provides historical insight as well. Cooper's look at two different tribes of Indians makes comparisons the reader may not have seen before. The author may even change the reader's mind about the opinions he may have had about Indians based on what he knew about them prior to reading the novel. The Last of the Mohicans is not exactly a short book; it has thirty-three chapters. And the action does not begin on page one, but the plot does flow smoothly and logically into it. Once action appears for the first time, it does elevate and decline throughout the novel, but not in a way that seems jumpy. The increase and decrease of action flows logically, as the plot moves from event to event. And as Cooper gives a multitude of details and description, one may find a particular chapter difficult to get through; but even so, the reader always has a mental picture of everything he is reading. The parts that one may find difficult aren't too hard, and it is well worth it when one comes to the last page. Cooper tells the story eloquently and smoothly, and in a way that the reader does not lose interest. His use of description and imagery make the plot clear and easy to follow. The plot in itself is intriguing and keeps the reader interested from the first chapter all the way through chapter thirty-three."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"This is a masterpiece that not only narrates action but explores minds and motives. If you have never read and enjoyed Dickens and Melville; don't bother with this one; it requires a reader with a brain. I was shocked by the first reviews here, and thought: &quot;Are these readers so egotistical as to think that people prior to the baby boom and going back 200 years didn't really talk like that, reason fluently in a crisis, or have deep thoughts about the meaning of life?&quot; People facing death do actually THINK (a lot) during the calm moments. This book is not always politically correct, but it is honest to a fault. It is not designed to be a romance novel; rather a novel in which romance (not sex) occurs. I HATED the movie because it tried to do a lot of anti-war, anti-imperialist moralizing.(Hollywood has no sense of history.) Did you ever read a story and think:&quot;This story is not believable. Like--when did these characters ever go to the toilet?&quot; This story is not like that. Yes it does slow down sometimes but so does life!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"The Last Of The Mohicans is a great great read. I learned a lot from this book, which in my opinion is often a true test of a books merit.Set in 1757 it follows the adventures of a group of \\"fish out of water\\" Brits and three extremely skilled woodsmen. The main character, Hawkeye, is probably one of the most exciting heroes I've come across in fiction. His constantly drawn contrasts between \\"book smarts\\" and \\"woods smarts\\" really turned the notion of what a 'savage' is on its head.Though I don't want to give anything away, the book has some surprises at the end that will surly shock you and make you re-read the passage to make sure you actually saw what you think you saw."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"a good read with lots of vivid imagery and a great story.

The protagonist, Hawkeye, and his Mohican friends are portrayed in a heroic, idealistic manner. The French and most of the Native Americans are described in less romantic terms. Cooper's writing is detailed, almost to the point of being tedious which can make the reading a bit laborious. Even so, I wholeheartedly recommend reading this great American classic. My only regret is that I saw the 1992 movie before reading the book because the movie did not accurately follow the book."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"This is a well written classic.

Can't beat the price!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I won't deny that \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is a great early-American novel. I won't even deny that I enjoyed it, because I most certainly did. However, it's Cooper's style with which I take issue. Much of his language is superfluous, and renders the text more difficult to read. And, no, it's not simply the problem of an old-fashioned writing style. The text is so riddled with repetition and passive voice that it becomes tedious and boring (even during otherwise thrilling scenes).The only other major problem I have with this book is the lack of direction. Even at the very end, it fails to arrive anywhere. I consider \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" a sometimes intriguing, sometimes lagging description of random people wandering around in the woods with no particular reason."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"This book is an American classic. It shows the conflicts between the Old World and the New, between native and colonist, between subject and ruler. In it you can see the development of a uniquely American worldview, marked by independence, strength, anti-intellectualism, and a pinch of suspicion. Really fascinating as you can see all of these qualities in so many Americans today.The e-book adaptation was great with explanatory footnotes included."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I thought the Last of the Mohicans was a good book and a bad book. I thought it was agood book because of all the suspense throughtout the book. I also liked the book because of how James Cooper described the characters and there surroundings.I didn't like the book because of how James Cooper phrased things. If you don't read well it would be hard to understand. If you were going to read the Last of the Mohicans you would want to have a old dictionary with you to understand some of the words. One more good thing is that he uses no profanity in this book."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I'm a junior in high school and recently read lotm for an advanced english 3 class.

Granted, once I finally became adapted to reading Cooper's overly exaggerated descriptive scenes, and could sift through the endless lines of details, I grew to enjoy the story.In \\"The Last of the Mohicans,\\" a group of travelers consisting of a singer, a Major of the British army, two general's daughters, and an Indian guide decide to take a shortcut to meet up with the girl's fathers at a distant British camp. The Indian guide leads them off trial and they wander around the wilderness until two other Indians, Uncas and Chicangook, as well as their white companion Hawk -Eye, decide to guide them to their destination. Along the way the travelers go through everything from a battle to two separate kidnappings. Overall the story was enjoyable but It dragged on several hundred pages longer than it had to be.In short, I recommend \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" to a true fan of 1800 era war and Native stories who have enough time on their hands to read the 430 page novel and enjoy the language used some 200 years ago."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I know this book is a classic, and James Fenimore Cooper sought to fatten these pages with epic sagas of Indian and White-Men wars, placing special emphasis on the pride of every Indian tribe and their greatly diverse natures. He succeeded. The proud and somewhat glorious adventures of these doomed warriors is on every page. The Indian tribes are richly described in their bravery and cunning at war, their knowledge of the land they love and know so much better than the White Man. In the wilderness of the 16th century, we have the Mohicans and the Mingos at war with each other and the white man. It is significant to the author to point out the last of the great Mohican tribe as a symbolic reference that, during this time frame, one tribe at least was near extinction, an omen and future yet to befall the rest of the \\"owners\\" of a country much loved and revered by the Indian. What becomes tough for the reader to sort out is this: Some tribes are referred to by three different names - or more, and within these tribes, some Indians themselves by many names. Adventure and fighting are abundant of course, and James Fenimore Cooper even adds a bit of romance and intrigue as a quest for two loved ones underlies much of the story. I am sorry to say I was lost in trying to keep it all straight, and the book put me to sleep more often than not. Still, if you are an adventure lover and particularly interested in 16th century sagas, you may thrill to these pages. If not, it's a pretty good sleeping pill."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"When I was a senior I decided to use this book for my AP English class report becuase I had loved the movie...&quot;and books are always better then the movies made after them...it must be wonderful!&quot; I thought. Ha ha. When I chose the book the teacher read a quote by Mark Twain criticising it ALOUD in class. I thought it was sort of rude at the time...then I started reading it and realized he had been trying to warn me. The book is AWFUL! Cooper can't keep his characterization straight. One line one character says something and the next, if it hadn't said &quot;so and so said&quot; I would have thought it was someone else talking, and these aren't supposed to be colonialists with muctiple personality disorder. I week before my paper was due I changed my book to Hamlet just so I wouldn't have to read the rest of that thing...and I love reading literature--I'm now an English major.

I believe I got about 200 pages into it over the course of 2 1/2 weeks, and bleh, I just can't force myself to read this any more. It is very seldom that I won't finish a book, even one I don't like, but I just can't get through this one.For the first 200 pages, the characters are shallow and uninteresting. The women are gentle and reserved and know their places, and the men are violent and love to shoot things. The plot can basically be summarized this way:-- Hack through forest.-- Make racist statements.-- Kill some people.-- Repeat.Maybe it gets better on page 201. I don't know. But this one is going in the Goodwill box."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I wanted to like this book so badly, I did, but I must admit that reading it was like being dragged naked by wild horses across a rocky terrain. I've seen the movie a dozen times. Daniel Day Lewis was the essence of every woman's idea of a hero, practically dripping with romance. Granted, I knew the book would not reflect the movie perfectly, but geez louise, Hawkeye was about as romantic as a block of stale cheese in the book. He's still loyal to the Mohawks and he's still a sure shot with his rifle, but if you're looking for the &quot;I'd-die-for-Cora-and-cut-down-anyone-in-my-way-to-save-her&quot; Hawkeye, you ain't gonna get it in the book. The book at least doled out a little action here and there, but overall it was an endurance test to finish the book. I wouldn't recommend the book simply because you loved the movie. It's totally different, with the exception that Magua is still the quintessential evil son of a *bleep*. I'm glad I read it in terms of its value as one of the first American literary classics, but for classic entertainment in general, I'd much rather read Robert Louis Stephenson or Mark Twain. Cooper's writing comes across as choppy and rough as the lives his characters lead."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Everyone knows the story of 'Last of the Mohicans', presumably from watching the Daniel Day-Lewis film. But what surprised me is how poor the novel by James Fenimore Cooper is. Two-dimensional characterisation (eg Duncan Heyward - gallant hero?) worsens a tale which seems to lack any proper structure apart from shoving in as many scenes of fighting and dramatic escape as possible. There are positive elements, such as the cunning but subtle personage of Magua and the basic premise of battles in the forested wilderness of North America. Perhaps that is why the recent film version is so much better - it takes all the good parts of the book, adds some new ideas and mixes them together."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"This book not only made me groan every time I picked it up, but discouraged me from reading other books by the same author. For anybody reading this and saying that I am wrong, I disagree. The Last of the Mohicans was not a book I would recommend, especially because of all the confusing characters , sights, and places. This book was something I might read again, but definately not until I can understand it better. James Fenimore Cooper, I give you credit, but I still did not enjoy reading you're book.

In that way, the writing style is much like Henry James. If you can \\"acclimate\\" to the style, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Cooper's second book of the Leatherstocking Tales, in which the young chief Uncas joins his father Chingachgook and Nathaniel Bumppo in battling the French and their Huron allies, is quite possibly one of the best pieces of fiction ever written. The reader can almost feel the leafy canopy closing upon them and hear the rustle of the forest floor as the intrepid woodsmen range throughout the northeastern lakes region of upstate New York. Armed conflict, the pathos of human drama, exquisitely wrought characters, and Cooper's singular ability to bring the environment to bear on the reader's sensibilities equals a reading experience rarely paralleled regardless of the 150+ years that have passed since it's creation.I can always measure my level of involvement with a historically-based novel when I am compelled to employ the atlas to find the exact locations in which the story takes place. James Fenimore Cooper had me tracing the path of Bumppo and company by index finger as I was easily transported to an age when England, France, and their Native American allies confronted each other in the backwoods of a new world to determine the ultimate mastery of a continent. It is a mark of historical irony that none of the chief competitors were ultimately successful as a fledgling United States of America emerged. Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales provide latter-day Americans a fine opportunity to relive America's early past and see it for the uncertain and exciting period it was.

It was completly different from the film. At first the language is a little challenging, I found myself re-reading passages to understand them better.

The unforgettable characters, Hawkeye Uncas, Magua, and others all tie together for a climactic ending. It is sort of confusing though, and hard to follow at times. The novel like a romeo and juliet of sorts, and the romance between Uncas and Cora is a major plot line in the story. It also deals with themes of racism and Indian relations with white men. An ok book that should be read by anyone who enjoys American literature or frontier novels. In my opinion, watch the movie, it's a lot better."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"well, as I said, if you have watched the film and then read the book, you will probably be disappointed...

Anyone who enjoys stories of the old days would love this novel. With romance and action tied into the story line perfectly this book is a riveting read. James Fenimore Cooper's great writing enchants anyone who has read this book. there werent really any gory scenes and the romance wasnt too thick.(actually it wasnt thick enough) Emotions are very deep and well put. Hawkeyes overly acurate aim, Chingachgook's native prescence, Uncas's daring ways and tender heart, Alice's innocence, Cora's strength, and Duncan's love for Alice all make the story exciting and eventful. But because of its complicated plot and length the book does seem to drag on a bit. Magua, the evil Huron warrior makes a great enemy. He will fight to the death to avenge his lost warriors. his unusual liking for Cora makes him even more eery. Maguas determination to destroy the last of the Mohicans is even more scary."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"This book greatly renewed my interest in colonial history.

First published in 1826, the book represents an early attempt to create substantial literary art from the material of North American history and geography. Although the book has its flaws, it is for the most part a success.In the novel, the white woodsman Hawk-eye and his Mohican Indian comrade Chingachgook join forces to help the daughters of a white military officer through hostile territory. The story takes place in a colonial American setting marked by conflict between French and English forces -- a conflict that also involves various Indian nations.There are a number of exciting (and often graphically violent) scenes of battle and chase. Hawk-eye, a white man who, to a large degree, rejects European-American values, is a fascinating figure -- indeed, he is one of the most enduring fictional creations in all of United States literature. Through the mouths of Hawk-eye and the various Indian characters, Cooper offers some intriguing criticisms of white culture.As I said, the book is not without flaws. The momentum of the book lags for a brief stretch, and some of Cooper's characters (in particular, his women) at times sound a bit stereotypical. But the overall power and intelligence of Cooper's work is undeniable. Particularly impressive is his re-creation of a multilingual world of complex cultural and personal conflict. Also noteworthy is his evocation of the American landscape. A tale of death and survival, of betrayal and loyalty, and, above all, of the extraordinary bond between a white man and an Indian, &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; is one classic that deserves to be read and reevaluated by each generation."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I thought that this was an excellent study of the European-Indian relationships and intertribal relationships among the Americam Indians. There are some gruesome scenes; I feel it is probably a fairly accurate account of practices at that time amongst those tribes. At times the narrative gets wordy because of the details of the history and traditions. I can't believe this book was taught in the 5-8 grades in this country 30 years ago. I don't think the majority of 12th graders could read this book with ease."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Like the Star Wars movies, Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales were written out of sequence. In their chronological order, with their order of publication in parentheses, they are: The Deerslayer (5), The Last of the Mohicans (2), The Pathfinder (4), The Pioneers (1) and The Prairie (3). So if you want to read them in either chronological or published order, you should read Mohicans second. But each novel is self-contained, so if you want to try just one, to decide if the rest are worth reading, then Mohicans is the one to start with, as it is his most famous work and generally acknowledged to be his best.The hero of these tales, the improbably named Nathaniel Bumppo (or Natty, or Deerslayer, or Hawkeye, or The Long Rifle, or...etc, etc) was the first, and remains the quintessential, all-American fictional hero; brave, noble, honest and more at home in the wilderness than the town. He is not however, the strong, silent type. He has a habit of launching into long, rambling streams of homespun philosophy at the drop of a coonskin cap. Never mind that lead shot is flying thick and fast around his ears, he will lean on his rifle and expound on the different natures of Indians and whites, or the evils of literacy.The plot of Mohicans is action-packed, but is linear - no surprise twists, and no sub-plots - and contains some highly improbable elements. Well, would you be fooled by an enemy disguised as a beaver? Michael Mann's excellent 1992 screen version reworked the plot extensively, to its advantage.Cooper was the first distinctively American novelist and was inspired by Walter Scott, the inventor of the historical novel. He was consciously attempting to emulate Scott but, although he writes quite well, he lacks Scott's lyricism. And his characters, specially the women, are resiliently two-dimensional. But he did capture the spirit of the frontier, the pride and pain of a new and growing country, and in doing so created myths out of America's past that have survived, evolved, and have sustained the nation, ever since."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I first read \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" many years ago. Recently, I was doing research on the Beaver Wars of the 17th century and learned a great deal about the history of the early colonies and the relationships between the various Native American nations and tribal groups. It's fascinating stuff, to say the least.After completing the research (which resulted in a two volume set of books entitled \\"Iroquois Wars\\" available on Amazon.com), I re-read Cooper's \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" with a more careful eye. Clearly, Cooper knew his stuff. He captures the true spirit of the American frontier spot on. He retains a mournful sensitivity toward the plight of the dwindling eastern woodland tribes while offering none of the absurd modern political correctness that makes every Indian wise, generous, and kind, and every European colonist vicious, greedy, and ignorant. While subject to the occasional novelist's hyperbole, Cooper also draws an accurate picture of Native military tactics and rituals. The various harangues and conversations he creates could have been lifted directly from the pages of the Jesuit Relations or other primary sources in which actual conversations were recorded by those who understood the various Algonquian and Iroquoian tongues.In short, I highly recommend \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" to anyone who enjoys historical novels or those with a particular interest in frontier history, the American colonial wars, or the native tribes of the eastern woodlands. The book truly is an American classic. (P.S., don't bother with the recent movie of the same name--it bears only passing resemblance to this book)."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Set in upstate New York in colonial times, Cooper here tells the story of the stolid colonial scout Hawkeye, nee Natty Bumppo (don't ask), who, with his two Indian companions Chingachgook (the Big Snake) and his son Uncas (apparently newly come to manhood), stumble on a party of British soldiers conducting two fair maidens to their father, the commander of British Fort William Henry during the French and Indian War. Under the watchful eyes of the young British officer who has the girls in his charge and led by a Huron scout, Magua, the party appears, to the indomitable Hawkeye, to be at greater risk than they realize as they trek through the wilderness toward the safety of the girls' father's garrison. And, indeed, Hawkeye's judgement is soon proved right as the scout Magua treacherously betrays the hapless girls in repayment, it seems, for a stint of corporal punishment inflicted on him previously by their absent parent. Since the Hurons, Magua's native tribe, are culturally akin to the Iroquois who are the herditary enemies of the Algonquin Delawares, from whom Chingachgook and his son hail and among whom Hawkeye has made his home and friendships, a natural antagonism has arisen almost at once between Hawkeye's party and the Huron and this proves salutary, when danger finally strikes. The tale quickly becomes a matter of flight and pursuit through thickly overgrown primeval forests, over rough mountains and across broad open lakes as the beleagured travelers first elude and then flee the dreaded Iroquois (allies of the French) who have joined the renegade Huron in an effort to seize the two girls. After a brief respite within the safety of William Henry however, the tables are once again turned as Magua's perfidy puts the girls once more at risk. And now the story shifts to a manic pursuit of the fleeing Magua who means to carry off his human prey in order to finally have his revenge on the girls' father, on the British and on the Europeans, generally, whose presence in his native country he blames (not altogether unjustifiably) for his myriad travails. Written in the fine tradition of the 19th century romance (which, of course, is what this book is), Cooper picked up where Sir Walter Scott (the venerable founder of this particular novelistic tradition) left off, creating a rich historical tale of adventure, nobility and marvelously sketched characters set against a brilliantly detailed natural landscape. If his characters are less keenly drawn than Scott's they are no less memorable for, in the quiet nobility of the scout Hawkeye lies the strong, silent hero of the wilderness which was to become the archetypical protagonist of the American western. And the Indians, Chingachgook and Uncas, are the very prototypes of the noble savage, so much used and over-used today. This is a tale of action first and foremost without much plot but so well told that you barely notice, as our heroes flee and pursue their enemies in turn until the very quickness of the prose seems to mirror and embody the speed of the action. Nor is this book only to be read for its rapid-fire rendition of flight and pursuit, for it touches the reader on another level as well, as the bold young Uncas moves out ahead of his comrades to place himself at risk for the others and the woman he loves. Although we never see Uncas at anything but a distance and never get to know the man he is supposed to be, he is yet a symbol of that people of whom he is the last chiefly descendant, the Delaware Mohicans. Nobly born into the finest of Mohican bloodlines, Uncas faces his final trial with heroic energy and resolve in order to defeat the nefarious and twisted Magua. Yet this struggle is also the final footnote in the story of a people, marking the closing chapter for all those Indians who, with the Mohicans, have seen, in Cooper's words, the morning of their nation and the inevitable nightfall which must follow. The book is a bit short on characterization and plotting and the prose is heavy for modern tastes, but the action is richly visualized in the flow of the narrative and the images are compelling. In the end, despite its flaws, this book of Cooper's is, in fact, the classic we have been told it is. -- S. W. Mirsky"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"It is easy to see that the modern action hero owes everything to Natty Bumppo. This is the best of the Leatherstocking Tales, though \\"Pathfinder\\" and \\"Deerslayer\\" are good too. \\"The Prairie\\" has its merits, but Natty is very old in that one, and \\"The Pioneers\\", the first to be published, deals only with Bumppo as a supporting character.\\"Last of the Mohicans\\", however, is a masterpiece of romantic fiction, and the birth of the American action novel. Cooper's knowledge of the American Indian is not always accurate, but it is easy to see the genesis of many legends that surrounded Native Americans in American lore into the 20th century in this and other books from the Leatherstocking Tales. The language is antiquated and may be a bit difficult for younger readers, but it is worth it.Also, a note on the film: The Daniel Day-Lewis movie is good--I enjoy that too, but it is incredibly different from the book. It is only VERY loosely based on Cooper's work, and Cooper's is unquestionably better.If you are curious as to why this book is regarded as a \\"classic\\", pick it up. I hope you get as much from it as I did."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Difficult to read as it is wordy in description and the phrasing is old.

It is dubbed a classic for good reason. This story will captivate anyone interested in the French and Indian War period, Colonial America and the origins of American Warfare. Although not nearly the same experience, I recommend the Major Motion Picture as well. The cinematography and soundtrack are amazing."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Mark Twain took great pleasure in ridiculing Cooper's novel, gleefully pointing out plot inconsistencies, unbelievable events that led often to harder to believe conclusions, and the wooden dialog and petty philosophizing of the novel's principle character - all in an effort to prove that any way you might look at it, Copper could not, for his life, tell a tale. I think that Twain might be guilty of a bit of jealousy. Many of the faults that Twain found with Cooper can be found in his own writings, from Tom Sawyer to Huckleberry Finn; moreover, in none of Twain's work can you find the dramatic action that Cooper was able to create. Also, Twain was looking backward some fifty years and American English had undergone some major transformations, becoming less structured thus making earlier American literature, by contrast, seem formal, wordy and, to some, unreadable.Cooper's work must be evaluated from within its own time frame to prove just how revolutionary his writings were. Shaped by the traditions of the eighteenth century English novel and influenced by his contemporary, Sir Walter Scott, Cooper continued this tradition of the romance novel - with a peculiarly unique American twist: three of the major characters of this novel were not European whites (the almost universal character model of the literature with which Cooper was acquainted), but American Indians. Althought this was quite unique, Cooper was not free from the prejudices that was prevalent at the time of the novel's writing, and despite being associated with the idea of the \\"noble savage\\", created many more ignoble Indians than he did noble ones.The strengths of the novel are the descriptive prose that Cooper employs to paint his picture of frontier America - descriptions which, in fact, compare with some of the best nature descriptions in American literature - and the fine character development of two of his supporting characters, Magua and Cora. Twain was correct about Cooper's hero, Hawkeye - he is wooden, ignorant, and despite his close association with his two Mohican buddies, Chingachgook and Uncas, is openly santimonious about his pure \\"un-crossed\\" white blood and rails at anything that smacks of learnedness. Magua and Cora are much more complex characters.Magua is one of the best crafted characters in early American literature. He is not the stoical Indian character type represented by Chingachgook and Uncas, but combines the bravery of the Huron warrior witht the worse habits of the white man; he is ravaged by rage and hatred, having been cast out by his own tribe and used by both the French and English for their own colonial pursuits. He comes across as a sort of native American Ahab and is not without his sympathetic side. Cora is the antithesis of her fainthearted sister, the blond Alice. She is brave, resourceful and feminine; yet never could be considered (although Hawkeye does) a member of the \\"gentle sex\\". That there is a hidden aspect to her character, that her \\"charged color\\" hints at some dark mystery only makes her more appealing as a character.In short, Cooper did know how to tell a story, and if the contemporary reader will abate some of his biases and give the novel a chance, that reader will be not only captured by the action of the book but will realize that Cooper deserves his place as America's first novelist. Do not confuse the recent movie of the novel, starring Daniel Day-Lewis, as an honest portrayal. The screenplay, when compared to Cooper's text, seems to have been based on an entirely different novel."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Set in upstate New York in colonial times, Cooper here tells the tale of the stolid colonial scout Hawkeye, nee Natty Bumppo (don't ask), who, with his two Indian companions Chingachgook (the Big Snake) and his son Uncas (apparently newly come to manhood), stumble on a party of British soldiers conducting two fair maidens to their father, the commander of British Fort William Henry during the French and Indian War.

At the tender age of 13 I picked up this book. Of course, at that age I would have had a right to dislike it ,but it turned out to be the highlight of my reading life. Ever since then I have compare every book to this one ,and in my mind's eye all have taken a backseat. I've read the whole series of Leatherstocking tales since then ,and they now hold the best seat in my library. Besides the Bible, I surely do consider the Leatherstocking tales my favorite books. In this fast paced world I can understand how people can grow weary of this book. It's much more than Indians and Pale faces running through the forest though. The reader must put as much thought and emotion into it as the author has done to develop his characters. As in the words of my English teacher ,&quot;Cooper reads like a smooth glass of lemonade--let him sit on your tongue for a moment.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I've read five chapters so far and the story is about the French & Indian war. Cora is a lady and is intimate with a major and goes along with her sister Alice on a trip guided by an indian who didn't adhere to the likings of a scout and a hunter whom were Canadians. I like the part where the mohicans have to venture out and kill a wild colt and all this so they could find shelter and the Iroquois won't get them by sunrise."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"In the old fashioned manner, each chapter of this novel written in 1825 is introduced with a quotation from another work, often by Shakespeare. In general, the writing style is quite formal and flowery, actually outright verbose. This makes it rather laborious to read and strikes a vivid contrast with the relative simplicity of the plot and of the characters. These, in a very confusing way, are often given many names. For example, the same person is called Natty Bumppo, Hawkeye, Oeil de Faucon and La Longue Carabine, all within a few paragraphs.There are definite incongruities in the plot. Beaver huts for instance are mistaken for a human settlement and a man disguised as a bear actually fools Indians who of course have lived in the woods all their lives! There are also anachronisms, such as referring constantly to the Canadas in the plural, whereas in 1757, when the novel is set, before the British Conquest, there was of course only one.This book's interest lies mainly with its North American setting and the fact it was one of the earliest novels to be written here. To the author's credit, it must be pointed out that he displays much respect for the Indians' wisdom and way of life, in marked contrast with general opinion later in the 19th century.Still, its qualities are not enough to make this work truly of major interest today."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Classic American stories are part of our lives. We read books on them, references in television series, and watch movies on them. But when we read the actual classic, we find that what we thought it was about is slightly different. The Last of the Mohicans is no different.James Fenimore Cooper wrote a classic that is read in most schools across the country. It's the story of 2 young English women on a journey to see their father who is a leader in the British Army. With an escort of British military and one native scout they find themselves ambushed. They are saved by a scout and 2 other natives. The fighting amongst the French, English, and native tribes gives Cooper a plethora of material for an intricate plot.This proved to more difficult of a read than I remember from high school when I read it. Maybe it is because I've read so many more contemporary versions and watched movies. There are several scenes were the dialogue is only in French. Sorry, I know about three words in that language. Also, so much description was placed that I'd forget what was happening in the scene.Now, I have to admit how movies ruined Cooper's book for me. The movie with Daniel Daye Lewis was great. I loved it. When I just reread the book, I was so disappointed because the storyline is so different. The book has Alice and Duncan in love. The move has Hawkeye and Cora. There are many other differences, but I would be spoiling the reading experience.If you have not read the book yet, try not to see any movies on it first. It will make the experience so much more enjoyable.Note: This book was free as a public domain piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"James Fenimore Cooper (1789-1851) is sometimes called the \\"American Scott\\". Like Sir Walter Scott who romanticized the Scottish past, Cooper focused readers attentions to the the American frontier. His most famous works are the Leatherstocking tales featuring Natty Bumpo. The novels in the series include: The Deerslayer; \\"The Pathfinder\\"; \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\"; \\"The Pioneers\\" and \\"The Prarie.\\" The most famous of these novels is \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" set during the French and Indian War in North America. Natty Bumpo the hero of the tale is said to be 40 years old; he is an experienced woodsman knowledgable in fieldcraft; Indian fighting and how to survive in a brutal frontier setting in upstate New York.The novel includes exciting fights with Indians; escapes from Indian captivity; word paintings of nature; a love story and a tale lamenting the passing of the last of the Mohicans.The characters are:Natty Bumpo-the intrepid scout for the British who rescues damsels in distress while escaping Indian capture. He is the hero of the novel and the Leatherstocking series.Duncan Heyward-A brave but inexperienced British major who is love with the inspidly portrayed Alice Murno. Alice is a stick figure with no depth or character development.Cora Munro is the sister of Alice.

He is love with the dark skinned Cora.Mauga. The evil Indian who is the major foe of the English and the friends of Hawkeye.The novel is written in an old fashioned literary style which lends itself to slow reading for moderns. The language does not, however, get in the way of the nonstop action. The book is one of the first novels written by an American author assisting at the birth of our literary heritage.

The manner Cooper uses to draw you into the story is fascinating...and strange in a world where no one has the patience to enjoy the manner of man that through his writings was discribing himself and trying to earn bread for his table that night. (Which is better than a lot of people can say.)Cooper's heroes are full of themselves. They are truly \\"men without a cross\\" as he, and they, say of themselves. Through the beautiful, melodius eloquence Cooper discribes the men that are much the same as Jonathan Seagull, Jesus Christ, Legolas and even Don Quixote. I respect him for the way that his characters DO what they believe and not wait for someone to back them up. Uncas prooved that well enough - in love or not.Most of us love The Lord Of The Rings movies, they too kill for the same reason.

As a small warning, this book is actually more graphic than the movie version--I had to literally put the book down and focus my mind on something else to calm down after a certain part. I don't know, maybe other people aren't as bothered by that kind of thing. I definitely recommend this book, though. It is exciting to read!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"To be honest a story about the early frontier days is not the type of story that generally draws my attention, but since this book was on several lists as one of the top 100 books ever written I gave it a chance. Unlike others on these types of lists which did not live up to the hype, this one succeeded.You are brought into another world and given a perspective of another culture. I couldn't believe a book written at that time would contain so much graphic images. I had read books before who had characters in them which they called savages, but it was not until this book that I actually saw what savagery really was. The aftermath of the attack on Fort William Henry contains some very shocking descriptions. Indians have different morals and superstitions, and Cooper does a good job of explaining the differences while at the same time differentiating between good and evil. Bravery as always is still highly respected by all.The story was wonderful, and the characters were memorable. There is a lot of character development. Even the villain's character of Magua grows and grows, from a mer scout to a formidable opposing chief. Cora, is a very strong female character, which to me is unique for a story written during that time period. The character of David Gamut adds some humor and an image of a free spirit who stays true to his religion, but Hawkeye the scout, Uncas the warrior and his father Chingachgook are the powerful characters that anyone would want to emulate. Heyward the young British officer comes off a little stiff, but he is very honorable.I liked the fact that Cooper incorporated some actual real life characters into his story and gave us all a little history lesson. For instance Washington is mentioned briefly and Cooper insinuates that Washington probably learned his guerilla tactics for fighting the British during his days in the French and Indian Wars. He also mentions two other real life generals in a way which adds to the story without being accused of character defamation.I'm not sure if I would call this a love story since it was mostly filled with battle scenes and war tactics, but there was a lot of love to go around. Even with the differences in culture there is still a similarity between the love shown between the father Munro and his daughters, (as a father of two daughters myself I felt his anguish Munro felt in worrying about the safety of his girls), and the love shown between and the Indian father Chingachgook and his son Uncas. You have a special bond of brothers between Hawkeye and Uncas, and you also have the love story between Heyward and one of Munro's daughters as well.While I found the book to be excellent, there are three minor criticisms I will make. Every character seems to have at least three names which is confusing at times. One which is their real name, another their friends call them, and yet a third which their enemies may bestow upon them. Also I do not speak French, and there are a few discussions throughout the book in French which are not interpreted. It didn't ruin the story since I could guess what was probably said, but it was slightly annoying. Finally the book title itself gives away more of the story than I would have liked with it's foreboding.The character Alan Alda played on the old T.V. show M.A.S.H. had always said that his favorite book was \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" and his favorite character was Hawkeye. Now I know why."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"The Last of the Mohicans was a great book in sense of adventure and intrigue. It got down to the raw life of the people back in its time and really was detailed to where you could have a vivid picture in your mind. The writing was intelligent and crafty, but shall I say, CONFUSING due to the fact that the language within it was unlike that of the language we use today. I had to re-read a lot of sections for the reason that the wording had me confused and I had to try to take in what Cooper really meant. I am not in to this sort of book for pleasurable reading (it was a class assignment) and I would not recommend it for the non-rustic teenage girl, but it does display a valuable piece of history. I really enjoyed the love-related aspect of the book because I enjoy romantics and I liked how put that in. Otherwise, I might have disliked the majority of the book. All in all, this book was written very well and is a valuable piece of literature, but I do not consider it a favorite and would not wish to recommend it to others of my generation for it is sort of out of date, so to speak."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"My book review is on Last of the Mohicans .I thought it was a GREAT book.

You can't figure out what it is saying unless you cross your eyes. If you like to read books at night to make you go to sleep this one is ideal.

In contrast to some of the other reviewers, I thought that the Indian characters were stereotyped as either &quot;noble savages&quot; or bloodthirsty brutes. The actions of the English characters are sometimes incomprehensible and the females are of course particularly helpless. Somehow when I read other period literature I can relate a woman's actions to the society of her time, but I couldn't do that here. The Hawkeye character was interesting, but often came off as eccentric rather than heroic and I'm not sure that was the intent. Well, I can say I read it.

I do hope some day to even finish the darn thing (it's nearly 400 pages long, I'm on page 102). I did give it two stars because the action scenes are so well written.

The style of the period is over-wordy by today's standards, with a great deal of what is essentially sermonizing both on the part of the author and the characters and very little real dialogue or character development. I'm a person who can generally consume any 400 page novel in a day or so, but I found I could not read more than about a chapter of LOTM at a time, and my attention wandered a lot.The story by itself it a pretty good one, dealing with the middle part of the French and Indian War. There is a great deal of fighting, striving with the wilderness, being exposed to alien cultures, and a dash of romance thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately, the story suffers from the over-abundance of words. Every encounter is melodramatized to the point of boredom, and the actual events get lost. Hawkeye, that redoubtable woodsman, never shuts up, and after a while everything he says is the same. Likewise for the other characters. There isn't any growth or development.I became increasingly offended by the portrayal of the Indians, both hostile and friendly, as either noble savages or just savages, obviously inferior to the white man. I also became increasingly offended with the portrayal of the two women, both of whom represented stereotypes of femininity popular at the time. I realise that Cooper was writing at a time when it was not much the practice to see value in native cultures and the memory, if not the actual experience, of the real violence between the American aborigines and the European immigrants was still close to the surface, but that didn't keep me from being disgusted at his overbearing and superior attitude.I'm glad I read this book, because it is held a classic. But that's the only thing that kept me going."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Excuse me, but I have read Melville and Dickens(I adore Dickens)and I would please like to ask one reviewer(and if they're reading this they know who they are) what is so intellectual about The Last of the Mohicans?

Im sure that if it was a modern book you wouldn't be so enthusiastic! I've saw modern melodramatic crap like this on the best sellers rack at Krogers.

The plot never really appeared in the book untill a 1/3 of the way in. this book is like me because the Mohicans fought for what they belived in. i'd relate this book to the Cherokee Indians becaus they were forced out of their homes in the east coast and ended the trail in Oklahoma.

It's also fun to learn a little history from the stories.Important note: The book is different than the movie, and in my opinion is much better than the movie. Hollywood had to warp the story and even changed the nature of Natty Bumppo, who is supposed to be a homely man whose charm really is his impeccable honesty and strength. The movie folks even changed who falls in love with whom, but it still was a good movie, even though it's not this story."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Some of you readers of &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; might be interestested in knowing a juicy little tidbit. I just happened to be browsing through books in the library and came across a book by Sara Donati entitled &quot;Into the Wilderness&quot;. What caught my attention was a review by my absolutely all time favorite author, Diana Gabaldon. She has a review on the cover of this book that states &quot;One of those rare stories that let you breathe the air of another time, and leave your footprints on the snow of a wild, strange place&quot;. So I checked it out figuring if Diana Gabaldon endorses this book I have to read it. And as I begin this book, imagine my surprise as I'm introduced to the stories characters... a much older Hawkeye and his very elderly adoptive father...Chingachgook! This story, &quot;Into the wilderness&quot; is the sequel to last of the Mohicans and is the story of Hawkeye's and Cora's son Nathaniel. I'm only a quarter of the way through it and enjoying it very much. I can not compare to the book &quot;last of the Mohicans&quot; because I only saw the movie but in my opinion, Sara is a good writer and I am enjoying the continuation of a great story and interesting characters. I understand Nathaniel's and Elizabeth's story continues in a third book entitled &quot;Dawn on a distant shore&quot; coming out in March of 2000. Just thought some of you might be interested. Also if any of you are interested in the best series of books of all time...read Diana Gabaldon's Outlander, Dragonfly in Amber, Voyager and The Drums of Autumn. I can promise one and all, You WILL NOT be dissappointed. I couldn't put them down and eagerly await the 5th book in the series."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I am a High School student and have read &#8220;The Last of the Mohicans&#8221; for my American Studies Class. We just finished studying the Native Nations and I have read a few articles on the Native Americans. The Last of the Mohicans, written by James Fenimore Cooper, is the paramount of American Literature. Unlike other books of its time, it ignores the stereotypes and common misconceptions of the Native Americans, concentrating only on reality. Throughout the book Cooper outlines his views on race, love and hatred between individuals from different groups within the American society of that time.The story is set in the French and Indian War. The two daughters of Colonel Munro set off into the wilderness to meet their father in Fort William Henry. They are accompanied by Major Heyward, and are guided by Magua, an Indian. They meet the scout Hawkeye and his companions Chingachgook and Uncas in the forest. The last of the Mohicans is about the treachery, loyalty, challenges, and allegiances that this group encounters during this perilous journey through the wilderness.This book might be a challenge for many readers, since the language used is not common in present-day literature. However once the reader overcomes this barrier, the true power and complexity of this story reveals itself. Cooper does not label Indians as savages in this story; instead, he shows the honorable side of them, such as the bravery and determination of Uncas, or the wit and intelligence of Chingachgook. He also presented the interaction between races, for example the doomed relationship between Uncas and Cora. Cooper&#8217;s writing style is extremely detailed and vivid. His description of fighting scenes and the emotions of individuals lets the reader experience the incident as if they were watching the event personally.The Last of the Mohicans is an extremely well written master piece by James Fenimore Cooper. In the book Cooper illustrates the greatness of Native Americans. He also outlines his views on race, love and hatred between certain groups of individuals during the French and Indian War. This book is great for people interested in understanding Native American culture, but be prepared for a fairly challenging read."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Since there are already over 100 reviews of this book and probably thousands have been written over the years, I'll do this one without benefit of book in hand, from memory and without a lot of details. It took me many years to get over the antiquated language barrier and to finally read the book. The classics are always harder to read than contemporary fiction, but sometimes it's worth the effort.What tipped the scales for me and piqued my curiosity was watching the recent movie with Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, and Eric Schweig, and realizing that this was a good story. Also, I'm very familiar with the setting in upstate NY: Lake George, Balston Spa, Glenns Falls, Scroon Lake, and surrounding area--at least as it is now, and it was fun imagining what it would have been like in those days, when the land was virgin, settlers could lose their scalps if they weren't careful, and the France contested with Britain for supremacy of the land.The book wasn't a romance--at least not in the modern sense of the word--with love scenes and the like. But it was a romance in the old sense in that the three main characters; Hawk-eye, and the two Mohicans, were larger than life heroes; in the moral, physical, and spiritual meanings of the term. The elder sister Cora was also a well developed, strong willed and heroic character, which surprised me a little considering the age in which the book was written.For me the most interesting character of the novel was Chingachgook's son, Uncas, who was the \\"last of the Mohicans,\\" a noble race of American Indians, which formerly occupied the lands by the \\"salt lake,\\" (i.e., the Atlantic Ocean), and were dispossessed and robbed of their lands and heritage by the original Dutch settlers and others. Uncas was a tracker extraordinaire, even better than the indomitable Hawk-eye in this respect. But he was young, inexperienced, and impetuous, which was eventually his undoing when he came up against the evil, and formidable Magua. But before he died, he was recognized as a king or great chief of his people, an heir apparent. So decreed the venerable Tamenund, a 100 year old patriarch and judge of the Delaware peoples, a related tribe to the Mohicans. This episode would have been difficult to write into an action movie, but it would have been great if it had been.Another interesting character completely eliminated from both the 1934 and 1992 movies was David Gamut, a preacher psalmist, whose moral presence and as a comic relief, was an integral part of the novel.All in all, this is still a book worth reading, if only to get a glimse of the way things were then and might be again."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Nathanial Bumppo, otherwise known as Leatherstocking, Deerslayer, and Long Rifle, is without a doubt the quintessential American version of Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan. To be sure, Cooper's frontier character saw print long before Burrough's creation did in 1912. This in no way invalidates the creation of ERB, but it does give more literary impact to a wholly American character who appears in what can only be defined, if one is truthful, as wholly flawed novels.The five novels which feature Bumppo were written by Cooper out of sequence. This doesn't necessarily impair the fictive underpinnings of the stories themselves, but it does give rise to certain elements which writhe like a murky thread throughout the main arc.We will, as expected, consider the best known, at least as far as the general public goes, work of Cooper, that being \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" and examine just what makes this novel tick, and why you should read it.Cooper believed that Indian culture must needs be crushed by the Anglo Saxon wheels of religion and technology. He saw no other way around this inevitability. Though he wasn't himself racist by the definitions which we adhere to today, he did have certain beliefs of superiority of his own culture which \\"dark-skinned\\" individuals had to bow down to. \\"Mohicans\\", with its poignant idea that there will come a time the \\"last\\" of this noble race will pass from the ken of men (that is to say the ken of White Men), has through this very self-same literary device carved for itself a spot of prominence withing American literature.Not everyone liked Cooper's work. He was always viewed much more favorably in Europe than by home-grown American authors. Mark Twain famously savaged Cooper's work and the savagery resonates even to this day. Yet, something about the novels, especially \\"Mohicans\\" endures. Perhaps it is the idea of a race of men passing, the thread of virgin forests and pure lakes, the savagery of life on the frontier, the fog of war, the blood-curdling violence. Whatever the reason for its longevity, and Twain notwithstanding, this book endures. Thank God.As one might expect there is very little of this book that is recognizable in the 1992 film remake of the same name. In fact, the film stole much of the story line which was rewritten in the 1920 silent film. In the modern film Hawk-eye, at the height of his powers, is taciturn to a fault but still capable of a normal sexual relationship. In the novel Natty Bumppo is not only naive sexually, he won't shut up, period. He discourses on everything, even to the halt of the action being described around him. Leaning on his rifle he has no problem detailing, to exhaustion, his opinion on events around him.Another big difference, aside from the often awkward descriptions, stereotypes of women and just plain ignorance of Native American ethnicities, is the fact a major character dies in the novel yet is allowed to survive in film. I suppose this would come as a shock to someone who saw the movie first, but there it is. Cooper has no problem dispatching that which, if allowed to live, would intercede in the future life of Hawk-eye. Natty Bumppo must remain pure. He must be allowed to view and accept nature as a powerful motivation than the love of another human being. It is his past, it is his destiny. He is akin to the figure of Greek tragedy in this way. He has a duty to perform and he will accomplish it, but he himself cannot lose the connection he has to the pristine land he loves and calls home.I highly recommend this book, though the new reader must approach it with a few caveats and not a little caution. Cooper is simply not that great a writer. I am not the first to say that nor will I be the last. Many of the passages go on far too long and the long-winded philosophies of Bumppo grate. Nevertheless, there is power here, along with pathos, grandeur, and yes, love -- though it's love on Bumppo's, and Cooper's, own terms.Despite its many flaws this is a major American novel by any definition. If you like adventure, and don't mind a little (okay, a lot) lagging, I think you will enjoy reading \\"The Last of the Mohicans.\\""},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Cooper is recognized as the father of American literature and for firmly placing America at the forefront of the literary world.His classic tale takes place in New York state in the late 1700's set against the backdrop of it's beautiful idyllic terrain which he so vividly describes and contrasts with the complex conflicts erupting within it.French against English. Indians against English. Indians against Indians.The story has a simple plot consisting of a repetition of capture and escape with frequent role reversals punctuated by brief reprieves serving to build tension.Although truly an action story, complete with a mythic hero ( Hawkeye ) who will serve as the foundation for the modern day cowboy, the tale touches on deeper issues in a subtle way.The friction of interracial amour is personified in Uncas and Cora. Their demise perhaps reflecting the authors views on transcultural relationships.The stereotyping of blonde women is brought into sharp focus in Alice's helplessness which seems never to leave her. Her character undergoes little development beyond a cardboard cutout set on a richly detailed stage adding to the effect. In contrast the dark haired Cora is seen to be a courageous practical woman embodying the frontierswoman.The struggle between civilization and savagery in the frontier is continually brought out in the conflicts with Magua, although Cooper is careful to balance his character avoiding simple dichotomous categorization into evil and good . Magua is cruel spiteful and villainous from the protagonist's perspective yet we are allowed access to Magua's thoughts and realize he wishes to live a good life in his own way and earn the respect of his people. His unslaked vengeance is his ultimate downfall.I wasnt particularly fond of the movie which is two dimensional ( literally and figuratively ) and strongly suggest reading the book."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"My initial reaction to the novel The Last of the Mohicans was, \\"wow! I am reading one of the greatest classic novels ever written.\\" When I began to read, my expectations were high, but were quickly extinguished by what I read. From what I understood, the book was quite exciting, but very wordy. It seemed to make me think very hard; perhaps harder than what I care to when I am reading. I do, however, think the book lived up to its reputation as a classic.In the book, Major Duncan Heyward is ordered to lead the Monro sisters, Cora and Alice, from Fort Edward to Fort William Henry where their father is stationed during the French and Indian War. An Indian named Magua who is supposed to know shortcut to Fort William Henry leads the group.During their travels, they come across a woodsman named Hawkeye who is accompanied by a Mohican named Chingachgook. Hawkeye explains to Duncan that Chingachgook is the last of the Mohicans.Duncan quickly explains that their guide, Magua, has become lost and cannot show them the way to Fort William Henry. Hawkeye asks Duncan of his guide's Indian background and is outraged when he learns that Magua is of the Huron tribe. Magua over hears the conversation and slips away into the forest unnoticed. He now knows that his plan to lead the group into a trap is foiled.Hawkeye, Chingachgook, and Uncas agree to lead the small group to Fort William Henry since they sense the group is in danger of being attacked by the Huron Indian tribe. The group spends the night in a cave behind a waterfall but is found by the Huron Indians. The group is attacked and Cora convinces Hawkeye and the two Mohicans to escape by swimming underwater downriver.The group is captured, and Magua leads Cora and Alice deep in the forest. He tells them of his plan to marry Cora as part of his revenge on Colonel Monro. Colonel Monro ordered Magua publicly beaten after getting drunk and not handling himself properly.Cora refused to marry Magua. This angered him greatly and was about to kill the whole group, when Hawkeye and the Mohicans rushed in to the camp, killing all the Hurons except Magua.At dawn the next day, the group drew near Fort William Henry. As they closed in, they realized that the fort was under attack by French troops and Iroquois Indians. The group moved slowly to the fort and entered uninjured, reuniting the girls with their father.I thought James Fenimore Cooper's book is an exciting, borderline thriller. What you just read is a small sample of what the book has in store for you. The best parts are yet to come. You just have to read the book to understand what I am talking about. The setting, plot, and the characters make it seem like it was a real true story that keep you on the edge of your seat the whole way through.I loved the story, but sometimes, it seemed so hard to get to the point Mr. Cooper was trying to make. His use of multiple adjectives to describe absolutely everything was quite repetitive and bothersome. I think the book would have been fifty pages shorter if he would have just got right down to the point instead of over describing the simplest of things.All of the characters in the book are quite realistic. They all seem as though they lived the time period instead of just being part of the author's imagination. The whole story is believable and realistic. I loved the book.I would recommend the book to anyone who likes this type of novel. I would even recommend this book to people who are not overly impressed by the time period, setting or plot. It is a great classic novel and it did not get to be that way by being terrible. It is complicated reading but very worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Having seen and enjoyed Last of the Mohicans movies, I knew I wanted to read the novel someday. The book, as many have noted, is challenging due to its wordy old English style, the many different characters, places and events, often referred to by different names, etc. But, if you just go with it and get the gist, and not worry about not understanding some words or phrases, it is a thoroughly engrossing read. As much as I loved the great Daniel Day Lewis LotM movie, it is only loosely related to the book. More like pieces/scenes from the book are recreated, but following a very different screenplay. For example: there is no love story, at all, between Hawkeye and Cora (and no cheesy, \\"Stay alive- I will find you!!!\\"). No murder of Munro by Magua. Duncan actually loves Alice, who both survive, while Cora is brutally murdered by Magua. And so on. While reading the book I was very aware that it would be almost impossible to make a coherent movie following the book. And, as is always true, the book provides so much more interesting detail than can be covered in a 2-3 hour movie. For example, the description of how Chingotchgook, Uncas and Hawkeye became separated from their tribe many years before, and then are emotionally reunited with their descendant tribe-a turtle tattoo figures prominently (read the book!:)- is very touching and deep. I would have loved to have seen that, somehow, in the movie.If you like early American history, Native American history at the time of the revolution, etc. this original novel of the genre is a must read. Just know that there will be sections that are kind of hard to follow. The book, despite its age and flaws, is emotionally powerful and thrilling."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"This is a flat-out great book. A classic of American adventure, it holds its own today. Granted, you have to settle into the writing style, but once you do you are invested in an adventure that is well worth the time and attention it requires."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"As a young reader who in the past had not been able to experience the glory of James Fenimore Cooper's writing, I was immensely impressed with his amazing depictions of the scenes. Armed with the biased view of the first inhabitants of this country developed through study in school, my view of the ancestors of this land changed dramatically with each page of this book. The character of Uncas, the young warrior of the Mohican race, captured my heart and I followed his tracks through the book breathlessly. I had endless confidence in the scout Hawkeye and the father of Uncas, Chingachgook. Duncan and David forever added to the flavor of the book. Every character will take on life and dance about the plot, thickening it and twirling through the words chosen by the great author Cooper. Each time I thought that I knew what would happen next, a twist would hit me unexpectedly and cause me to commend the author once again. The trials of the beautiful sisters, the fatal accuracy of &quot;Killdeer,&quot; the calm resolution of Indian warriors, and the treachery of the Huron Magua will force you to continue reading. To miss out on the unforgettable journey James Fenimore Cooper takes you through in The Last of the Mohicans would only be your loss. This classic piece of literature will not fail to enthrall you and will take your mind through a torrent of emotions invoked by the unrivaled story-telling ability of one who is called the first great American author. Grounded in the resolution of nobility, the steadfastness of a warrior, and the basis of revenge, I guarantee that this book will take hold of your senses and not let go until you've read every last word. For your own sake, give yourself a treat and grant Cooper yet another reader."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Any book illustrated by N.C.

The stories never live up to this master, and Cooper's classic is no exception."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"\\"Mohicans\\" has long been on my \\"I'll read that someday\\" list, and I finally found the time to read it over the last few months. And while I'm glad I did, it must be stated matter-of-factly that James Fenimore Cooper's writing style is not very kind to the reader. He tended to write some long-winded passages and descriptions, with sometimes a little too much detail, and his use of multiple names for the same character became annoying after a while. \\"Hawkeye,\\" one of the main characters in the story, might also be called \\"the scout,\\" \\"the Long Rifle,\\" \\"pale-face\\" and some other names, all in the same paragraph! And Cooper did this with many of his characters. It's not the most effective story-telling device.As for the story itself, I liked it very much. Set in 1757, during the Seven Years' War in America (or the French and Indian War, as it is also known), it follows the fortunes of a group of misfits caught up in the struggles between the British and French empires, as well as various Native American tribes. Strongest among these characters is Hawkeye, a white man who has nevertheless shunned living the \\"civilized life,\\" and instead lives off the land, like the Native Americans. Indeed, some of his closest friends are Mohicans, probably a novel concept when this book was written in the 1820s. Whenever I was reading about Hawkeye, I couldn't help thinking of the \\"real\\" early pioneer heroes Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett; his actions and deeds evoked images of a coonskin-capped hero \\"saving the day\\" time and again, whenever duty called. Finally, although I will not mention the ending of the story, I will say it did not have the typical \\"Hollywood Ending,\\" which, frankly, I was expecting. It was a pleasant surprise to find that Cooper did not fall prey to the \\"feel-good\\" story.It was for these reasons that I give this a favorable rating, despite the random difficulties with Cooper's writing style. \\"Mohicans\\" is worth your time, but be aware you must also be patient; for long stretches this is not a page-turner.Four stars."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Great American literature.

I love reading it. Just good all around product. I have read it several times."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Have you ever seen a movie and wondered if the book it was based on was as good as the movie? Well, that's pretty much why I read \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" by James Fenimore Cooper.This novel is a classic, true; but it is written in the overly turgid, stilted language that was popular at the time it was first released, and may be somewhat burdensome to contemporary readers.Need an example? Here, try to decipher this: \\"At each change in the evolutions of the latter, the former raised his tall person in the stirrups; producing, in this matter, by the undue elongation of his legs, such sudden growths and diminishings of the stature as baffled every conjecture that might be made as to his dimensions.\\" That sentence, from Chapter II, describes the character David Gamut, a psalmodist, as he rode a horse, attempting to catch up with the party of Cora and Alice Munro. No, he was not featured in the movie, at least not in the 1992 version which starred Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, and Wes Studi. And if you want to know what a psalmodist was, you'll just have to read the book (or look it up). Gamut was actually one of my favorite characters, and the source of most of the humor contained in the text.In fact, the novel, first published in 1826, is a good bit different in plot and characters from the 1992 film. It has been noted elsewhere that the 1992 film was based heavily on an earlier film released in 1936, and not so much on the book. Most movie critics which I have read found the film to be more entertaining than the book.As an exercise in reading an American classic, however, the book is worth the time it takes to read it. Although the language is, at times, difficult to follow, it does give the reader an appreciation of what our ancestors found to be \\"can't-put-it-down\\" reading. The book is also a window, of sorts, through which we may look to a time in our nation's earliest years. Although it may be subject to some historical criticism, it is at least a popular (at the time) rendition of how American culture viewed its recent conflicts with the French and Native Americans.If you have to read this book as a school assignment, you should not watch the movie (any of them) first. Your appreciation of the book will be keener for waiting on the film, and you will enjoy the film more for the waiting.Note: This review was originally posted to the Penguin Classics edition of this work, but for some reason, the review did not include the correct title. I have reposted to this edition in order that my review might be more helpful (can't help if can't be found). The Penguin Popular Classics version included an informative forward and footnotes which helped in putting this novel into somewhat better context.As a final note, the fictional Chingachgook was not actually the \\"last of the Mohicans.\\" There are Mohican bands in existence today, and the Tribe is federally recognized. Chingachgook can more accurately be characterized as the last in an old line of Mohican nobility, as envisioned by the author."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Once you read this it is with you forever.

His description of the Native American characters is also a sign of his time. He describes them at times as beautiful creatures amazingly in touch with nature, while at other times making them appear as savages. However, overall I felt the contrast was well done for he also does not always paint a perfect picture of the white settlers. The story has action but it's purpose is not necessarily to exite the reader in that way. It is more character driven and well defines the interaction between characters who come from completely different cultural backgrounds. It does have it's moments of good excitment though. A good book for those who can handle the diction and writing style of the 18th century."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"When I first started reading this book, I thought it was a very boring book. Then, I figured if I was going to be reading this book for at least another two weeks or so, I should go ahead and pay attention to the book. I like it when they start fighting to get Cora back from Magua. It gets pretty grotesque and detailed once they start fighting. I also think this book gives you a good idea of the French and Indian War. But, I don't really like the plot to it. I think it has a little too much detail to get to the main part of some chapters. This book did not have a lot of dialogue, but it still had a little too much unnecessary detail in some parts if the book. If I read a book, I like reading biographies and mystery type books."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I can't deny the importance of this novel, but in the end this book became more and more difficult to read. Cooper is EXCEPTIONALLY wordy and has a heavy storytelling hand. I can't say it was always boring but it just became sluggish in so many spots, with events dragged out and dialogue often unfit for the characters. Some think Cooper is torturous to read and I can see why. Make sure you have a lot of patience before you start this tale. You will be rewarded though. There are many undeniably exciting action scenes, however Cooper could have made this brisker and just as valid."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"The definitive tale of the American frontier in 1757, Cooper's masterwork captures the essence of this corner of American history.

The basic plotline is interesting, but the execution and character development is just plain awful. At many points in the book, Cooper just glosses over action leaving a confused reader wondering just what the hell happened and how. The real killer though is the character development. The unidimensional and shallow characters are stereotypes at best, and the women in the novel are written so thin they practically disappear. One might think that Cooper had never actually met a woman before given his portrayal. The book does have points to recommend it from a historical or geographical basis, but if anyone is actually looking for a good book to read, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"The Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper is a narrative told in the thirdperson. It has many action, fighting scenes, and times when the characters do nothing.The story follows a group of English around the wilderness while encountering manyobstacles.The story is set during the French and Indian War in northern America. Thesetting is important because the frontier gives a sense of danger to the story. Also, thewar brings an atmosphere of kill or be killed. The characters have to be careful who theytrust.The characters in the novel are not very believable. The characters are eithertotally good or totally evil, there are none in between. Cooper provides a stereotype whenportraying the Indians. The only good Indians in this story are the Mohicans which aredying out. The rest of the Indians are portrayed as savages.Cooper's characterization is indirect. The Characters are developed throughactions, not background. When a new character is being introduced, they are describedwith out a name. Then, after they have been left out for a while, the characters arereferred to by name. This along with the fact that many characters have more than onname often causes confusion.The language of The Last of the Mohicans is very out dated. The book waswritten in the 1500s. This makes the language very difficult. Also, this time period usedmore words to explain a scene than it would today. This makes the slower scenes dragon. The action scenes move faster but still are slow going due to language.The Last of the Mohicans is a good book, although it is difficult to read.Language and Cooper's style of writing make the book difficult to read, and at timesboring. Despite this, the novel was still a good book. The book is appropriate for aperson at the college level."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I hear the word boring used often when reviewing a book. In an age where we are bombarded with so much sensory stimulation of all kinds, reading classic literature can seem rather dull. The key is to put the book in the context in which it was written and avoid critiquing it to death. Read this book with an open mind."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Cooper's Prose at times seems designed to hide his meaning from the reader. It is florid, overblown, and full of circumlocution.Some of the plot twists can only be described as bone-headed. Two examples: The protagonists engage in a song fest while trying to hide in woods crawling with hostile Indians. They search for a fort by following the rut plowed by a cannonball.Notwithstanding its flaws, &quot;Mohicans&quot; is an engaging tale about remarkable people whom the reader comes to care about.In the Leatherstocking Saga, Cooper anticipates Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan stories. Both Tarzan and Hawk-eye are noble men from &quot;civilized&quot; stock thriving in a wilderness among &quot;savages.&quot; Cooper and Burroughs both do violence to the English language, both write contrived plots with improbable twists, but both nevertheless spin tales of wondrous adventure.One scarcely noted aspect of the story is the undercurrent of racism and tribalism that permeates the tale. Every Indian tribe seems to hate every other tribe; whites hate Indians; Indians hate whites; and so on ad nauseum.Magua tells Cora he hates her because she is white like the man who sold him whiskey and caused him to disgrace himself. Cora defends herself: &quot;And am I answerable that thoughtless and unprincipled men exist, whose shade of countenance may resemble mine?&quot; Ironically, Cora, on her mother's side, is &quot;descended ... from that unfortunate class who are so basely enslaved to administer the wants of a luxurious people.&quot;When Munro accuses Heyward of preferring his (Munro's) daughter Alice to her half-sister Cora because of Cora's Black ancestry, Heyward replies: &quot;Heaven protect me from a prejudice so unworthy of my reason!&quot; No sooner does he express this noble sentiment than he shows great relief to learn that Alice's mother is Scottish on both sides of her family.Then there is the trans-racial partnership between Hawk-eye and Chingachgook, in which some critics see the prototype for the Mel Gibson/Danny Glover partnership in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; series. And finally there is the trans-racial love between Cora and Uncas.The story, although a swashbuckling adventure, has a distinct subplot of racial prejudice. We see the characters nobly overcoming it at times but basely succumbing to it at others."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"\\"The Last of The Mohicans\\" is the second in the Leatherstocking series by America's first professional novelist, James Fenimore Cooper. Set in upstate New York during the French and Indian War, it introduces the reader to the Eighteenth Century world inhabited by settlers and Indians. This work contains both continuations and similarities to \\"The Deerlsayer\\" (see my Amazon reivew). The Deerlsayer is now known as Hawkeye and seems to be more a man of action and less a man of words. Chingachgook remains his loyal friend, although the Indian nature is more presented by his son, Unca. As in \\"Deerslayer\\", much of the story revolves around two sisters, in this case Cora and Alice, who are making their way in the wilderness with the aid of their companions. Like in \\"Deerlsayer\\" the saga finds its action in war and chase scenes involving American settlers and their Indian allies against Indians opposed to them. This series is rare among early American literature in that the Indians display characters of their own. A bit of comedy is introduced into the narrative by the character of David Gamut, the professional psalmodist who, despite having gifts so ill-suited to the environment of the story, still manages to play a helpful role in the conflict running throughout the book.I read this for \\"mood setting\\" during a trip to Cooperstown and other areas in which the book is set and in which the author lived. I was also interested in a familiarity with this classic of American literature. As a reader of my Amazon reviews is aware, I tend much more toward history than to novels and, generally, enjoy them much more. That being said, this novel is a keeper. It is an enjoyable and edifying read, even if classical novels are not your forte."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I never really had any intention of ever reading this booking, having assumed that it was romanticized nonesense, but after watching the movie, and, for some reason, enjoying it, I decided that the time had come: I had to read the book.So I did. At first, I'll admit, the going was a little slow, as the writing is somewhat fanciful and the dialogue stilted, but this awkwardness became less of an issue the more I became enthralled by the story.Having seen the movie in advance, it was interesting to see how much the movie had in fact diverged from the story. Actually, aside from many of the characters, the setting, and the general premise of the story, the movie is quite different from the book. So much so, that it is safe to say that the movie has totally failed to capture the true spirit of the novel, and is little more than the typical Hollywood historical romance. The most unfortunate aspect of the movie, however, is how the &quot;patriotic&quot; element was incorporated--this is simply not in the book. I do have to say that the movie in its own right is good, but it utterly fails as an adaptation.The is no doubt that Last of the Mohicans is a classic. It is a book that I know will be reread a number of times before my time comes, and I'm sure with each reading, new meaning and insight will be found in its pages."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I read The Last of the Mohicans for my English class. I found the first few chapters difficult to read, but as the book progressed I became accustomed to the 1800s style of writing. Once used to Cooper's writing, I cruised through the book with keen interest. Survival in the forest with hostile Indians is the idea, fighting through a few skirmishes. I am impressed with the skills Cooper bestows his characters, and enjoy learning of the Indians. The characters become well-known as reading progresses, and near the end of the novel I knew I had chosen a good book. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys an interesting writing style and a good outdoor adventure. The only bad part in the book is in the end, which I wouldn't be mean enough to relate as of yet. Stick with the first few chapters, and surely you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"This book is wonderful. The movie is equally wonderful. This is one of the rare cases when a movie and a book are BOTH enjoyable. If you enjoyed the movie, then reading the book is a necessity.The movie portrays an entirely different main character than does the book, and it is important to understand that Old Leather Stockings is a man the age of 70. The Last of the Mohicans is the last story in a collection of tales, and if one loses sight of that, then all is lost.This story is a wonderful tale about love and war--two of human natures most powerful forces. We are led on a sad journey where a man's seed dies with him, and the impact that has on the psyche.I loved this book, and could not stop reading it. Perhaps it takes a more mature eye to understand and/or appreciate the meaning in this novel. I also am a major in English, and I feel that this book has more to offer than meets the eye, you need only have the key to open the treasure chest."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"If familiarity does indeed breed contempt, then perhaps that explains why my opinion of Cooper's most famous novel has weakened over time. I recently reread the book after an interval of many years; not only was I disappointed (and somewhat bored), but I realized that it has become my least favorite of the five Leatherstocking novels.In \\"Last of the Mohicans,\\" Cooper aimed brazenly for a melodramatic adventure story in the Romantic tradition of the novels of Walter Scott. Reading it as an adult, the farcical caricatures that delighted me as a boy made me cringe at times, almost with embarrassment. (In particular, the psalmist named David Gamut is Cooper's Jar Jar Binks.) And the overwrought dialogue can be cumbersome and even unintentionally comical; only Natty (\\"Hawk-eye\\") Bumppo would deliver a 300-word speech to hush his compatriots in order to avoid the imminent risk of a possible ambush.Several things save the novel from its maudlin prose, and they alone justify its status as a \\"classic.\\" First is the unexpected depth of the portrayal of Cora. By modern standards, her character is stereotypically feminine, but she is a pioneering heroine whose depiction violates nearly every preconception of the era. A second aspect is the unhesitant and (for its time) graphic horror with which Cooper depicts hand-to-hand combat; the shocking episode that opens the massacre of the garrison still has the ability to give me nightmares. And, finally, there is Cooper's decidedly \\"unromantic\\" willingness to surprise the reader by killing off major characters with startling (and believable) twists in the plot. Set aside the cartoonish characters, the overstylized prose, the speechifying dialogue--the story alone is worth the read.So it's not a bad book by any means, and opinions will depend on taste. I prefer the character-driven narratives and the almost pastoral mood of \\"The Pioneers\\" or \\"The Prairie,\\" which at times seem to anticipate the survivalist novels of Willa Cather. For those who prefer the swashbuckling action of \\"Ivanhoe,\\" however, this is the book."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Reading this, it's easy to see why James Fennimore Cooper is considered the first true American novelist. A comparison with the rather talky, and overly descriptive English novels of the time, shows that this is vastly different.First, of course, this is about the exploits of the common man. Hawkeye, the main white character, is the quintessential rugged individualist, eschewing society to live in the woods and travel with his Indian companions.Then there is the natural setting--the woods and streams and waterfalls of upstate New York, which appear almost as characters, themselves in the novel. And then, of course, there is that most American of stories, the decimation of the Indian populations.Having not read this book since I was in grade school, I found it suprisingly enjoyable. I was also surprised to find that the true emphasis of the story was the relationship between Hawkeye, the white scout,and the Mohicans, rather than the love story cooked up for the 1991 movie, and that a love interest also exhisted between the young Mohican, Uncas, and Munro's daughter, Cora,who, expediently, turned out to be of mixed race herself.As historical fiction, this is very accurate. And though the Indians are generally depicted,at their worst, as inhuman savages, and, at their best, as surprisingly bright and sensitive savages, for the time in which it was written, it was probably rather daring, and the most one could expect toward bridging the gap between the races.I would definitely recommend that those who think of this as one of those classics they were forced to read in school, give it a second try. You may be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I do not know if I have too much to add to the outstanding reviews of this book on 'Amazon'. by Peter Reeve and B. Mirsky.However my thought is about the mythic element of the story, the creation of the type of the American hero, strong and silent, and of the 'noble savage.'What most effected me was the story of the noble savage, of Uncas, of the 'Last of the Mohicans' of the individual's dying meaning the dying of a people . In one sense this perhaps symbolizes the triumph of 'civilization'. But in another it suggests a great crime and loss.Cooper as Mark Twain perhaps too hilariously taught us writes awkwardly. But he also has a kind of strength of invention, a freshness of beginning. And that perhaps draws readers to these works in spite of their stylistic and literary defects."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I first read The Last of the Mohicans in 1973 and have reread it periodically over the years. Although Mark Twain is often given credit for being the first quintessential American author, I would vote for James Fenimore Cooper. This is a magnificent book that captures the ruggedness of the American wilderness and creates the American Hero, Hawkeye- the loner who rejects the institutions and the relationships that most men need and who stand alone for what is right. This motif has been picked up in countless American heros ranging from Hammetts Sam Spade to John Wayne.Although written in a style that may be difficult for the contemporary reader to grasp, it is, nevertheless, a beautifully written novel. Cooper has a way of describing the savage beauty of the American wilderness that is unequaled in literature. An example of this is his description of the forest swallowing up the European armies only to spit them out in ragged pieces- armies larger than those that often dispose of the scepters of the mother countries were seen to bury themselves in these forest, whence they rarely returned but in skeleton bands that were haggard with care or dejected by defeat. Raised in western Oregon and spending much of my youth in the Oregon wilderness, I know exactly what Cooper describes. There is a terrible beauty about the wilderness that both invites and destroys. It is a beauty that draws on into its inner recesses can quickly turn into terror as the weather turns foul, ones sense of direction is lost and the forest seems to close in around one fights off the feeling of terror and loneliness. It gives an rush that city folks cannot even imagine.The story is set in the geo-political struggle between the France and England for control of colonial empires both in the Americans and India. It is a story of savagery, slaughter, betrayal and courage. Of course, this book would offend the sensibilities of politically correct. Yes, Indians are describes as savages and yes, they massacre innocent women and children. Yes, Europeans get better press; but Cooper, like Melville, addresses the race issue. Hero's and villains are been on both sides of the conflict. This is a great book and should be on your must read list of American literature."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"It's hard to imagine that this novel was written over a hundred years ago, because its daring message of anti-imperialism and its detailed and sensitive study of the Native American culture. Apparently, a hundred years later, the interracial romance was still too taboo for Hollywood, so this theme was white-washed. The movie also reduced the complex Indian characters to cardboard cartoons. Read the original literary masterpiece when your brain is active, and watch the movie when your brain is near-dead."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Set in upstate New York in colonial times, Cooper here tells the story of the stolid colonial scout Hawkeye, nee Natty Bumppo (don't ask), who, with his two Indian companions Chingachgook (the Big Snake) and his son Uncas (apparently newly come to manhood), stumble on a party of British soldiers conducting two fair maidens to their father, the commander of British Fort William Henry during the French and Indian War. Under the watchful eyes of the young British officer who has the girls in his charge and led by a Huron scout, Magua, the party appears, to the indomitable Hawkeye, to be at greater risk than they realize as they trek through the wilderness toward the safety of the girls' father's garrison. And, indeed, Hawkeye's judgement is soon proved right as the scout Magua treacherously betrays the hapless girls in repayment, it seems, for a stint of corporal punishment inflicted on him previously by their absent parent. Since the Hurons, Magua's native tribe, are culturally akin to the Iroquois who are the herditary enemies of the Algonquin Delawares, from whom Chingachgook and his son hail and among whom Hawkeye has made his home and friendships, a natural antagonism has arisen almost at once between Hawkeye's party and the Huron and this proves salutary, when danger finally strikes. The tale quickly becomes a matter of flight and pursuit through thickly overgrown primeval forests, over rough mountains and across broad open lakes as the beleagured travelers first elude and then flee the dreaded Iroquois (allies of the French) who have joined the renegade Huron in an effort to seize the two girls. After a brief respite within the safety of William Henry however, the tables are once again turned as Magua's perfidy puts the girls once more at risk. And now the story shifts to a manic pursuit of the fleeing Magua who means to carry off his human prey in order to finally have his revenge on the girls' father, on the British and on the Europeans, generally, whose presence in his native country he blames (not altogether unjustifiably) for his myriad travails. Written in the fine tradition of the 19th century romance (which, of course, is what this book is), Cooper picked up where Sir Walter Scott (the venerable founder of this novelistic tradition) left off, creating a rich historical tale of adventure, nobility and marvelously sketched characters set against a brilliantly detailed natural landscape. If his characters are less keenly drawn than Scott's they are no less memorable for, in the quiet nobility of the scout Hawkeye lies the strong, silent hero of the wilderness which has become the archetypical protagonist in our own American westerns. And the Indians, Chingachgook and Uncas, are the very prototypes of the noble savage, so much used and over-used today. This is a tale of action first and foremost without much plot but so well told that you barely notice, as our heroes flee and pursue their enemies in turn until the very quickness of the prose seems to mirror and embody the speed of the action. Nor is this book only to be read for its rapid-fire rendition of flight and pursuit, for it touches the reader on another level as well, as the bold young Uncas moves out ahead of his comrades to place himself at risk for the others and the woman he loves. Although we never see Uncas at anything but a distance and never get to know the man he is supposed to be, he is yet a symbol of that people of whom he is the last chiefly descendant, the Delaware Mohicans. Nobly born into the finest of Mohican bloodlines, Uncas faces his final trial with heroic energy and resolve in order to defeat the nefarious and twisted Magua. Yet this struggle is also the final footnote in the story of a people, marking the closing chapter for all those Indians who, with the Mohicans, have seen, in Cooper's own words, the morning of their nation and the inevitable nightfall which must follow. -- Stuart W. Mirsky (mirsky@ix.netcom.com"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I had a sort of love/hate relationship with this book. Cooper's writing style is so difficult to read and there were many times that I would read and reread sections and still have no idea what Cooper was trying to say. However, I was basically able to follow the plot, and even though the book is way too long, the story is really good.I saw the movie with Daniel Day-Lewis and was completely disgusted. Cooper's book deserved so much better than it got in that movie. I can understand the movie-makers wanting to have Hawkeye be a hunky young man instead of a middle-aged man who has a tendency to talk all the time, but come on, couldn't they have stayed more true to the basic plot of the book than they did? All that crap about the Colonial Militia and Hawkeye being imprisoned for helping some of the colonists escape the fort was just irritating and stupid."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Reading this, it's easy to see why James Fennimore Cooper is considered the first true American novelist. A comparison with the rather talky, and overly descriptive English novels of the time, shows that this is vastly different.First, of course, this is about the exploits of the common man. Hawkeye, the main white character, is the quintessential rugged individualist, eschewing society to live in the woods and travel with his Indian companions.Then there is the natural setting--the woods and streams and waterfalls of upstate New York, which appear almost as characters themselves in the novel. And then, of course, there is that most American of stories, the decimation of the Indian populations.Having not read this book since I was in grade school, I found it suprisingly enjoyable. I was also surprised to find that the true emphasis of the story was the relationship between Hawkeye, the white scout,and the Mohicans, rather than the love story cooked up for the 1991 movie, and that a love interest also exhisted between the young Mohican, Uncas, and Munro's daughter, Cora,who, expediently, turned out to be of mixed race herself.There are some qualifiers here. It stands up well in its non-Indian history of the French and Indian War. However, on the Indian side Cooper tends to get his nations a little mixed up. Also, it is important to point out that the Mohicans today are a federally recognized tribe, so the title is, shall we say, a little misleading. And, of course, the major criticism from those of us who have studied American Indian history is the creation of that seemingly invincible stereotype--The Noble Savage.However, novels must be read in the context of their times and with regard for what the author meant to achieve. In this case Cooper wanted to write a truly American novel as opposed to the English novels so popular at the time, and in that sense I think he succeeded.In this edition, the N.C.Wyeth illustrations were a real asset. I wish we could go back to the days when books were beautifully bound and contained artistically rendered illustrations. It really adds to the total reading experience.If you are one of those who simply remembers this as a classic you were forced to read in school, give it a second try. You may be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"If you've read this book without Wyeth's illustrations, you've really missed something. His ability to capture the violence and vibrancy of the scenes depicted is amazing. I can feel the warmth of a dawn sun, see the dappling of sunlight in the forest, and experience the strength of the indians. If you want your children to experience a classic classic, this is one!"},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"This review pertains to the Penguin Classic edition, which has a fascinating introductory essay by Professor Richard Slatkin. But I would save the essay for last; it's so pedagogic in nature, it almost strips Cooper's French & Indian War masterpiece of the fundamental magnetism that has drawn countless readers to it for over 150 years.For this reader, that \\"magnetism\\" is the sheer awe-inspiring beauty and terror of the North American primal forest. Slatkin's essay is rather bloodless, but I can assure you that this novel is not. And the idea of constantly running and hiding from an archetypical villain, like Magua, and his band of warrior Hurons, who feel quite comfortable with the act of cleaving one's skull with a hatchet, is quite unsettling.Of course, \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is not a depiction of Native Americans through the lens of 21st Century sensibilities. Unquestionably, the modern day reader should be at least a little horrified at the near extinction of the Native American population. But no matter how sensitive one is about their tragic, inexorable decline, it is still an unalterable fact that -- under the alliance they entered into with the French -- several Eastern tribes struck abject terror into the hearts of 18th Century British Colonials. (May I suggest a casual inquiry into the colonial history of Deerfield, Massachusetts? The hatchet marks can still be seen on the wooden doors.)The setting for \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is the great waterway formed by Lake Champlain, Lake George and the Hudson River. The last glacial retreat laid down a perfect invasion route for the French moving south from Quebec, or the British moving north from Albany. That is why the area is studded with old colonial forts at strategic choke points. It is on the way to Ft. William Henry that the heroines, Cora and Alice Munro, are betrayed by Magua, who was charged with guiding the defenseless daughters to their beloved father -- an old Scottish warhorse, who serves as commander of the fort. How the daughters are captured, escape, nearly massacred and recaptured occupy the first half of the book. Their eventual rescue forms the second half.Cooper's action-packed narrative is an artful blend of history and fiction. There was, indeed, a siege of Ft. William Henry by the French General, the Marquis de Montcalm. And there was some sort of trouble with Montcalm's Indian allies, but there is now serious doubt about a full-scale massacre of the fort's inhabitants. Indeed, Cooper has been criticized for botching numerous historical facts, but the \\"massacre myth\\" cannot be laid solely at his door. No less than the preeminent American historian, Francis Parkman, devoted several pages to the supposed incident.What is outright fiction is Cooper's heroic protagonist, Hawk-eye. He is the central character throughout Cooper's 5-book Leatherstocking Series of which \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is the second installment. Hawk-eye (better known as \\"Natty Bumppo\\" in the other 4 volumes) is one of the most enduring figures in all of American Literature. The honest-speaking, self-reliant, nature-loving, chaste woodsman/warrior is indelibly etched in our national psyche. It's no exaggeration to say he has influenced generations of Americans. Surely our military has taken to the man -- the Hawkeye missile is just one explicit manifestation.Juxtaposed to Hawk-eye is the Huron Chieftain, Magua, who wreaks havoc on everyone, including himself. Trust me -- he's not the sort of fellow you'd want over for a weekend barbecue. His descent into darkness began with a fondness for the bottle, which led to the expulsion from his own tribe. And his kidnapping of Colonel Munro's daughters stems from a humiliating whipping ordered by their father. Magua lives in the obscure half-world betwixt the tribe that abandoned him and the British Army that he betrayed.Cooper has seemingly placed Hawk-eye and Magua at opposite ends on the continuum of good and evil. But perhaps they are not quite that far apart. There's something a bit unsettling about the heroic Hawk-eye. Like Magua, he occupies a strange middle ground, shunning white civilization (into which he was born), but hardly embracing Native American culture (with the exception of his friendship with Chingachgook and his son, Uncas.) And while I would not lable Hawk-eye an outright racist, he does ridicule and dehumanize his Indian foes. And as for exterminating them, he has no scruple about that. He'd shoot every one of them given the chance.Say this for Magua -- he is no racist. He offers his wigwam (albeit in forced circumstances) to Colonel Munro's eldest daughter, Cora, whose dark hair and dusky complexion are traceable to her Caribbean slave ancestry. As Slatkin points out in his essay, the commingling of their blood would unite the three great races of our nation's history. Such an amalgamation is unthinkable to Hawk-eye. In the final scene of the book, Colonel Monroe asks Hawk-eye to translate for the Delaware maidens the hope that one day all of God's children, regardless of color, will assemble around his throne. What is Hawk-eye's response? \\"To tell them this, would be to tell them that the snows come not in winter...\\"Perhaps Hawk-eye's response is his cold calculus that our country could never become part white/part red, and that the latter must inevitably fade away. Magua understands this all too well. Native Americans are playing a losing hand, especially when they end up fighting one another. Afterall, notwithstanding the honor of saving Cora and Alice, what's really in it for Hawk-eye's Mohican allies in their battle with the Hurons? In a word, extinction. In some ways, Magua is spiritually akin to the real-life Pontiac, Chief of the Ottawa Nation, who asked his tribesmen if they knew what happened to the Great Narragansett? I'll tell the reader. More than one hundred years before Cooper's haunting tale, the Puritans exterminated the Rhode Island tribe, and the Iroquois hunted down the few ragged survivors."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"The Last of the Mohicans takes place during the French and Indian War, and it covers the fall of Ft. William Henry in 1757 to the French. In the vast woods travel Chingachgook, his son Uncas, and Hawkeye, a white man who is more comfortable with Indians. Chingachgook and Uncas are the last of the Mohicans, an Indian tribe. Although Hawkeye's niche is clearly with the Mohicans, he constantly asserts throughout the book that he is white and does not have Indian blood.One day, this group meets with travelers heading to the fort. In this group are Cora and Alice Munro, Major Duncan Heyward, their Indian guide Magua, and later a minstrel named David Gamut. The girls want to meet with their father, British Colonel Munro at the fort. Magua has deliberately led them astray, but when confronted, he escapes. Magua is a Huron whose loyalities lie with the French, and he harbors deep resentment to Colonel Munro. The group arrives at the fort, but the fort falls to the French. The French and British have terms of peace, but the Indian allies of the French do not heed these terms, causing much bloodshed. Alice, Cora, and Gamut are captured, and the rest of the book covers the wild \\"rescue\\" of these three. Action and adventure depict the wild frontier, and there are also hints of love. Heyward and Alice are kind but \\"delicate\\" while Uncas and Cora are bold and courageous.Great book. The plot moves quickly, although sometimes it is a little stagnant. However, the need to know what happens next drives the reader to continue reading. In addition, Cooper does a good job describing each character. One can imagine courageous Hawkeye standing there on the hills, a white man in deerskin, with his rifle, or the laconic but admirable Uncas emanating with courage and skill. Cooper describes the setting well--the wild frontier, complete with the sound effects of nature. The Indian skirmishes are described graphically, which is all the better for forming mental images.Although this book is wonderful, I do have some complaints. In the beginning, there are long footnotes, and they distracted me. Also, there is some conversation in French but no translation! As one person pointed out, yes, a lot of characters have more than one name in the book. For example, Major Heyward is called Heyward, Duncan (his first name), the major, etc... It is not bad for Heyward, but for others, it can get a little confusing, especially in dialogue, if there are just titles (ie: \\"the Indian\\", \\"the latter,\\" \\"the scout\\"). Also, there are tons of Indian tribes mentioned--Mohawk, Delawares, Huron, Mingo, Yengeese, Maquas--some of them are one in the same, but especially in the earlier parts, it can be hard to discern who's who.I am glad I picked up The Last of the Mohicans. I am impressed by the first great American novelist, James Fenimore Cooper, and he deserves that title 100%."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"This is a book that captures the imagination of young and old. Mr. Cooper's descriptions of the wilderness and his familiarity with Indian lore are captivating. Cooper's plotting skills which manifest themselves in his stories, is incredible! This is a rip-roaring read that will keep you turning pages well into the night. His characters are also unforgettable. The relationship that develops between Hawkeye and his Indian friend Chingachgook is wonderfully told. This is an action story that could arguably be the first of the modern-day adventure story genre. It's hard to believe that this one was written in 1826."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Cora and Alice are damsels in distress. They've had a hard day. Captured by Injuns, tied to stakes to be burned alive, set free only to be recaptured later. In the 18th Century they didn't have aspirin for headaches.This may not be the most realistic book on the shelf, nor the most psychologically deep, but it is a good enough adventure story to have me reading the last 150 pages in one day.The heroes are white hunter Hawkeye with supernatural accuracy using that rifle of his, Mohican Indian chief Chingachgook, and his son Uncas. You want these guys on your side if you ever get in trouble in a bar.I learned so much from this book. I learned that the Delaware Indians, also known as Lenni-Lenape and Mohican, are all noble and brave. I learned that the Mingo Indians, also known as Maqua or Iroquois, are all lying and treacherous. Oh-kay.My guess is that at the time the book was written, the Delawares had already been defeated and dislocated off the eastern seaboard, so it was safe to glorify them. The Iroquois were probably still a threat.The folly in leading Cora and Alice through Indian territory during time of war, behind a treacherous Indian guide named Le Renard Subtil, reminds me of the folly of Friar Lawrence in Romeo And Juliet, coming up with his foolish scheme of drugging Juliet into a zombie state instead of just coming clean and telling her parents that she was married to Romeo.Anyway, good book. Read it."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"A famous classic written in a style that would confound most writers today. The use of language, vocabulary etc. shows a grasp of the English language that is unheard of today."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"The second instalment to the five novel \`Leatherstocking Tales' collection, Cooper tells the tale of a daring search and rescue mission led by uber-naturalist and Loyalist hero, Hawk-eye, in colonial America during the French and Indian War. Attended by his various sidekicks (aboriginal or otherwise), our gallant hero seeks to recover General Munro's two daughters, apparently for no other reason than it gives him something to do.The text liberally borrows from the worst tendencies of 18th century English Literature (haughty oratorical tone, frequent character soliloquies, ridiculous emotional and romantic characterizations, constant quotations from important English writers - in this case Shakespeare). This makes for a tough read. The plot is rather lumbering at times, as well. Cooper really has no time for any significant character development; what we see from the characters in the book's early pages is what we get at the end. Some characters seemingly have little or no purpose i.e. General Munro after his daughters have been abducted; a formerly confident and assertive person instantaneously becomes a doddering old fool whose sole contribution is to infrequently mewl about the loss of his \`babes.'The exception to the book's poor use of characterization is Magua, the villainous Huron Indian. Cooper's paradoxical characterizations of this \`wily Indian' often combine hatred with admiration. Cooper is never really sure what to make of him; while Magua embodies the \`savage' excesses of his race, he is also extremely charismatic, and a born leader.As this book is 180-years old, uncomfortable stereotypes and lingering racism are scattered throughout the text. Cooper's respect for aboriginal peoples really depends on which tribe he is describing. For example, when describing the eyes of Uncas, a Mohican, the narrator seemingly exclaims without irony they were beaming \\"with a sympathy that elevated him far above the intelligence, and advanced him probably centuries before the practices, of his nation.\\" Cooper also demonstrates discomfort with interracial relations, particularly of the aboriginal/Caucasian kind, preferring to change the racial backgrounds of some of his characters that may catch the fancy of the culturally inferior Indians.If nothing else, the book is a fascinating historical document that demonstrates the struggle for the formation of a unique American identity in early post-colonial times. Tendering Hawk-eye as a prototype, for Cooper, the new American is a composite of Native American, English, and colonial cultural values: brave, resourceful, judicious and cultured. While what comprises \`Americanism' is certainly more complex and ambiguous, this book comprises an early contribution to the canon of American literature and unique American experiences."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"I would have to say that I expected more from this book than I got in the final analysis.

The war is fought between the British and the French. The latter make alliances with several Native American tribes.The main characters of the novel are Hawkeye, Magua, Duncan Heyward, Uncas, Cora Munro, Alice Munro, Colonel Munro and General Montcalm. Hawkeye is a scout and woodsman. Magua is a rogue member of the Huron tribe and the villain of the story. Duncan Heyward is a young major in the British Army. Uncas is the last member of the Mohican tribe and a protege of Hawkeye. Cora Munro is the daughter of Colonel Munro who is the commander of the British Army at Fort William Henry. Cora is partly of African descent. Alice Munro is Cora's younger half-sister.

Also, when Uncas kills the Huron that killed Cora, but Mugua stabs Uncas three times and kills him is also really ironic. Magua's death was not very suspenseful. Rather than him just falling off the cliff, it would have been better if he died in a battle. The end of the story was very tragic since Chingachogook's son Uncas died and so did Colonel munro's daughter cora died. Alice and Duncan Heyward live happily ever after. Coooper shows how inter racial mixing can lead to bad consequences. From the Beginning Magua shows characteristics of an antagonist and his evil intentions that are to get revenge on Colonel Munro is one of the main things that lead to the death of Uncas, Cora, and to his own death. The main theme that Cooper is trying to get across in this book would be how the coming of the Europeans and how they brought such a different way of life that the Indians were not accustomed to, had destructed the way that the Indians in North America lived."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Reading this book is like walking through a landscape painting of 1770s America. The detail of leaf, feather, shadows and reflection are rendered as exquisitely as by the paintbrush of the master artist who is skilled in the use of light.To read this book, one must have the patience that is required to step into a painting and examine it layer by layer. But if one can, as Cooper puts it, take on \\"Indian eyes\\", a way of seeing that makes the forest read like a book, then one can enjoy a book that reads like a forest.Camouflaged within the panorama of Cooper's epic canvas is the classic story of a quest, with heroes and villains, of a heroine to be rescued, of blood and sacrifice.

There are only two downfalls to this novel. The first is that I watched the movie. I kept expecting what happened in the movie to happen in the novel. I have to tell you, the book is much different from the movie, and the book is better. The only other negative is that I was raised and taught English in the 1990's and had some difficulty reading Cooper's style of writing. However, the imagery and detail Cooper uses far out weigh the difficulties in understanding his style. Being written in English, I could understand everything he wrote, it just took me longer to read.As I alluded to, Cooper did a tremendous job of painting a picture in mind. I want to visit the Northeastern United States after reading about its beauty. I immediately noticed the attention he paid to detail compared to more modern authors I have read. Additionally, I feel Cooper portrayed Native Americans in positive light uncommon to his era. Rather than berating Native Americans in ignorance, he explained there ways of thinking and ceremonies. More importantly, he showed that every race has common values. Foremost of these is love. The love shared by the chief for his son, the white scout with his Indian friend, the Indian for Cora, all demonstrate that love can touch everyone. The last pages of this novel had more emotion than any I can recall.I enjoyed reading this novel, and encourage all those who liked the movie or are looking for a good novel to read The Last of the Mohicans."},{"Title":"The Last of the Mohicans (Lightyear Press Limited Edition)","review":"Cooper's &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; is a classic novel that stands the test of time.

At the time it was written it was most likely commonplace for authors to prey upon the ignorance of their readers and I'm afraid Cooper did just that with this novel. The novel would be much more enjoyable if the reader had absolutely no knowledge of the eastern tribes of native americans or of the colonial lifestyle.

This very good book should set a number of these notions to rest. John Prados gives us a very detailed of the CIA from its founding out of the WWII OSS.He shows us its role in engaging in alternative warfare and in undermining regimes that were hostile to America, its allies, and their mutual interests. Prados is not pro-CIA. Nor is he nakedly anti-CIA. It is pretty good reporting. I can't imagine how much digging he had to do to provide the information that is here. I enjoyed one footnote that after he got some information from some declassified files in a Presidential library that planes and agents were sent to collect those documents and others after he published his findings.Prados points up the embarrassing failures that have become public knowledge. And when there are successes, he points up the transitory nature of such clandestine efforts. He is plainly unconvinced that the long term problems created by those efforts are worth the various kinds of costs incurred in pulling them off. In his concluding chapter he points out that the CIA and intelligence gathering should not be viewed only by the ends they claim to support, but evaluated as to whether their means are compatible with our Democracy and its professed ideals. I will leave this for each reader to judge.I will say that Prados does not go out of his way, this is already a long book, to set the chessboard up and discuss what the Soviets were doing. In doing so, he makes the United States to out to be the aggressor, instigator, and fumbler of so many global events. In my view, this is a distortion. It isn't that Prados is wrong (he may well be, but I am not competent to say so), it is that he is only showing us one part of the stage. The actors that he show us look quite silly at times, however, if we saw what they were reacting to, with, or against on the unlit art of the stage, our perception of the story might well be different.Still, this is a very valuable and comprehensive telling of this history and until we get something even more complete or authoritative or more information is declassified, this is a must have text for those interested in the history of the CIA."},{"Title":"Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA","review":"These days I find myself taking the side of the CIA more and more in their wars with the Bush Administration, such the Valerie Plame affair, and the administrations manipulation of intelligence leading to the Iraq war. Amongst those scandals I was starting to forget about past misdeeds of the CIA. Thankfully, John Prados has written a history of the CIA's secret wars, some familiar, such as Cuba, Iran, and Laos, and others more obscure and in danger of being almost forgotten, such as Guyana and Tibet. It is a history of the CIA told from the perspective of its covert operations. And from this perspective we get a further glimpse of the familiar spooks and their deeds, like Allen Dulles, Frank Wisner, Ted Shackley, Richard Helms, Desmond Fitzgerald, William Harvey, and Bill Casey.Multiple conclusions can be drawn from each of the operations. A recurring theme in of these operations is that the CIA is not the \\"rogue\\" agency that does whatever it wishes without the knowledge of the president. In each of these secret wars the president often provided the initiative for the operation, was aware what was occurring, and had the full capability of stopping it at least some point in the operation. A prime example given is Kissinger and Nixon pursuing a more aggressive meddling in Chilean politics against Allende.Another recurring theme in the operations is often the targeted administrations plotted against were often moderate, independent regimes, who neither wanted to be in the Soviet camp or in the U.S. camp. But, dare they nationalize industries, and suddenly, with our obsessive paranoia of communism, the president and CIA would plot their overthrow, support the shadiest paramilitary insurgents and turn a blind eye to their misdeeds, including drug dealing. Often this led left leaning politicians of the targeted countries straight into the arms of the Soviets.In Cuba, the rebels created a \\"disposal\\" problem. What do you do with armed and trained rebels eager to dispose of Castro, and knowledge of assassination plots? Apparently some believed the answer was to keep the pot boiling. The plots against Castro continued well after Bay of Pigs. In Tibet, Hungary, and Indonesia, the CIA stirred things up and promised support, but for various reasons, such as the need for secrecy or fear of full confrontation, full support to finish the job never arrived. That left rebels dangling, and caused bitterness towards the U.S. Often these operations were fueled by bad, incomplete or ignored intelligence.Safe for Democracy is an important addition to any CIA history bookshelf. It is a well documented, objective and balanced history of CIA clandestine operations. Our foreign policy hubris is not new, something recently invented by Bush Jr. Though covert operations weren't as brazen as invading and toppling a regime by brute force, the results were destructive for the targeted nations, and did not make the world safe for democracy. The CIA, though it may not be the sole impetus for these operations, was the cat's paw for bad policy, and often a careless one too."},{"Title":"Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA","review":"If you're studying the CIA's operations and routines you can't be without Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA. It covers all the CIA's covert and political operations and also considers these actions in relation to America's quest for global democracy, using three decades of research to detail techniques, events, major personalities and more. While general-interest public library holdings may consider this, it's a special pick for college-level or military collections also strong in democratic politics.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA","review":"This is a broad and lengthy review of CIA covert operations from the earliest days to the impacts of the 2004 Intelligence Reform Act; essentially an update of a similar book Prados wrote in the mid-'80s.The book is fatally flawed by the author's clear determination to put all forms of covert ops in a negative perspective, and the narrative reflects his strong bias as he relates different operations throughout the decades. Not that all he relates was in reality sunshine and butterflies, but even considering harsh realities there are key parts missing in many stories, and others are consciously worded in the most negative manner possible.A narrative already weakened by bias is further undercut by the author's ignorance of military SOF, which is evident in the several areas where he discusses military SOF support to Agency operations. The book is also weakly sourced, with the notes section poorly structured and only partially covering the discussion in each chapter.However, I don't know of any other book as comprehensive in its attempted scope that deals with this subject matter. But, due the issues I've mentioned with this book, I'd recommend reading a number of other books focused on specific operations rather than this fatally flawed broad overview."},{"Title":"Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA","review":"Why don't they teach this stuff in high school? Oh yeah, I know why. This is part of the real history of U.S. \\"foreign policy\\" (a fancy term for imperialism). Teaching the real, sordid history of the United States would contradict all those cute values we profess to hold dear. It would get in the way of indoctrinating people with patriotism - a horribly asinine concept. War is the health of the state, whether overt or covert. There always has to be an enemy \\"out there\\", to draw attention away from the enemy \\"right here\\". Have the courage to read this book!"},{"Title":"Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA","review":"This book betrays a problem common to CIA literature: It focuses heavily on the administrative and bureaucratic side of the CIA, made possible by the various freedoms afforded to any American researcher. There are plenty of books written by former CIA operatives that explains their work in depth, and they are more interesting.For politics junkies and fellow Washingtonians who charge through nevertheless, I'd recommend skipping the last few chapters altogether and reading Steve Coll's Ghost Wars instead. It's more intelligent and better researched."},{"Title":"Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA","review":"This is not a history book. This work drips with political taint; by that I mean that the author has a view in mind and sets out to persuade you the reader of that view, ignoring or minimizing events and information that might lead you to a different conclusion. As an intelligence professional, I couldn't stomach it past the first hundred pages.If you read only this book about the CIA, you will believe it to be a corrupt and ineffective apparatus of clumsy power. While a popular view, it's not correct. But if you already believe that the CIA is a bastion of evil stupidity, prepare to have your belief system validated.It gets two stars because it does actually include correct facts; it's missing three because they are only select facts, separated by manipulation."},{"Title":"Disciple-Making Teachers","review":"Lots of good ideas and encouragment for teaching adult classes.

It provided a basic framework and flow which I found to be easy to follow and remember. The basic premise being how to present in class learning for discipleship living outside of the classroom. What really stood out for me was the challenge to teach for change in how our students will live on Monday morning. I also found it helpful on the discussion on focusing your teaching on one topic and not trying to teach too much! I highly recommend this book. We will be utilizing this book at our annual teacher's training in July 2012."},{"Title":"Disciple-Making Teachers","review":"This text closely addresses the core objectives in Christian education. With a very balanced presentation of the important elements of content, presentation method and life application the authors concentrate on the fundamentals. Their linking of teaching with exhortation and content with daily practice are key points.While the acronym D.I.S.C.I.P.L.E.S. may be too long and complex to be useful as a mnemonic tool, it does cover all the elements necessary to continued spiritual growth. As they describe these elements the authors offer theologically valuable insights. This is typical of this text throughout - Hunt and Mays emphasize the sound doctrines behind their approach. For instance, in their various discussions of application and accountability they are careful to highlight the practical reasons for Godly life, distinguishing these from salvific grace and avoiding legalistic interpretations. The care with which they treat this issue is laudable.In addition to broad concepts like this, many insightful observations are found throughout the book. Some examples include an excellent discussion on the differences between fellowship and worship (pp.27-8), personal responsibility (\\"if they drop the ball, you watch it bounce\\" p.40), and the spiritual preparation required for a teacher that can result in knowing when not to teach (p.102-3) - these are exemplary of this very practical guide.While not implicit in their statements, the authors might lead the reader to some important questions to consider. Disciple making teaching delivers truth (content) in love (within the context of grace) for the purpose of application in life (exhortation). Scripture offers many examples of each of these, but it is worth some further study to find if all of these gifts are expected to reside in a single individual teacher. Perhaps all of these are expected to be delivered by the body as a whole. Barnabas' calling Paul to Antioch (Acts 11:19 ff.) is noteworthy."},{"Title":"Disciple-Making Teachers","review":"The book I purchased on Amazon arrived in like-new condition, and even including the shipping fee, saved over half the cost of a new one.

I loved the description of life as a young Mayan girl and her family. This book also demonstrates the strengths that good teachers give to their students, especially those teachers that listen to their students' ideas. The book also gives a personal peak into life in a refugee camp.I spent 2 years in Guatemala in the Peace Corps just as the war was breaking out. I could easily picture every scene in this book.

Discussing the massacres in Guatemala and all the historical actions and inactions that have led to genocide, my students made so many connections to their own lives and to injustice in the world now.

She was halfway through the book when I realized what it was about. I am upset with myself that I have not been more diligent to look at what she is reading. While well-written, honest, and thought-provoking this book has graphic scenes of rape and murder that even many adults would find troubling. There are also several references that the US Gov't had trained, armed, and basically knew but did nothing about these genocides and of American citizens one quote is \\"Most Americans don't know what their government does. Most don't want to know.\\" I do believe that as citizens of a free & priviledged country we have a responsibility to find out about and try to right wrongs - however not all Americans are this callous.

The theme of this book is history and the horrific genocide that took place in Guatemala. She and her family are in the middle of all this in Guatemala. She is drawn to the trees for comfort and a way to be rescued from the ugly warfare. What she doesn't know is that the trees will become her worst enemy because she ends up having to witness horrible hate crimes and is stuck in the tree for two days. This is just a preview of all she endures and her amazing survival story. Mikaelsen was able to capture her character and make connections with her because it is based on an actual life experience. He was able to speak with the real \\"Tree Girl\\" and hear her story through her voice. In the story she is not only fighting a war with the soldiers and the will to stay alive but as a woman.

Even though I am a teacher, I have a hard time getting into books and am very picky. I need books with high energy and details that paint a picture.After reading this book, I was surprised I waited so long to begin it. Wow. From the moment the main character showcases her strength as a young girl, which doesn't happen as often as we would like, to the tenacity she showcases overcoming all her obstacles, I was hooked.This story is a true account of a young girl's first person involvement in genocide. I couldn't imagine living through her experience to tell the tale. This book defines bravery in every choice made. The author was a very lucky author to come across a story such as told in Tree Girl.Be prepared though, it is sad at the same time. The young girl witnesses events NO young person should ever experience. There is so much action in the book; the ending doesn't follow the same pattern. Like going on a roller coaster ride and being slightly relieved when the ride slows to a stop, this book comes to a calm ending, which disappointed some of my students. If using this with students, you must reiterate this is real life, told from the source, and if any other ending came of it, we might not be reading it. It isn't often in life people go through events like this and stand tall and shake it off as nothing happened. The book ends with a character having her head slightly above her, which is a great place to begin sorting through the events that happened.Head any lower, we wouldn't have a story. Head any higher, it wouldn't be realistic!Student Review 1 (Sadie)This book was great. Ben Mikaelsen has truly a wonderful writer and I might just as well read some of his other novels. I to would not recommend this book to young teenagers under 15 do to the cruel and violet actions. Tree Girl was a very brave and strong girl who lived to tell her story. I couldn't imagine going through any of her experiences and was very surprised that Gabi's (Tree Girl) actions. Her knowledge helped her survive through this awful genocide in her hometown. Tree Girl's point of view was always different from everybody else's and she always took in consideration of her parents, teachers, and ancestors teachings. This emotional novel reminds you, in reality that anything can happen and sometimes its not always great.Student Review 2 (Jena)Before reading this book, it didn't really interest me, all because of the title \\"Tree Girl,\\" but it also left me questioning it, what is a \\"Tree Girl?\\" After we started getting into it more and more, it left you at the end of the day speechless, wanting to read it some more. I definitely got into the book the more I read it each day, and I caught myself saying the over-used clich&eacute; \\"Never judge a book by it's cover.\\" It is a little graphic, and I think only for kids who will take these kinds of events seriously, and maturely. The ending kind of disappointed me, but also brought me some happiness, it is a good book, even for those kids who say they don't like to read!Student Review 3 (Shane)Overall I thought this book was a well write story. It was well written and kept you on the end of your seat for the most part. This story was very gruesome and shouldn't be read by any child under the age of 14. She goes through pain and trouble that no human being should ever have to go through. But overall it was a great learning experience.Student Review 4 (Sophia)The book, Tree Girl, was very gory and overwhelming. The story of a girl who fights for her life within cross fire during war in Guatemala tells of climbing trees to keep alive. Her story of struggle and death around her intrigues the reader to keep going farther into the book. The paperback itself is very eye catching, but once you've read on, you will want to know what happens subsequently. I recommend this book to many people who: find true stories captivating, love happy endings, can't resist putting the book down when interesting, and someone who just needs a little enlightenment. I don't recommend it to anyone under the age of 13, because of all of the horrific scenes."},{"Title":"Tree Girl","review":"Tree Girl, written by Ben Mikaelsen, is truly an amazing book! I am 10 years old and I suggest you may want to be a liitle older because some things may not be appropriate for kids of that age, I am in an accelerated reading class and some people who have higher reading levels sometimes cannot find hard enough books to read which are appropriate for their age and this book is definitely a good book for those whose parents give them a little more leash. I think this book is written with great wording and detail. It is about a native american girl, gabriella, who is just trying to live a normal life while war is going on. The trees, which she climbs, are her sanctuary where she can just leave the world for a little bit and just think. Her mom tells her that when she climbs the trees, she is closer to heaven. Then things start going dreadfully wrong and soldiers come asking questions and everything is messed up. Eventually she learns that after her father and mami\`die, she has to hoist all the responsibility on her shoulders, to take care of her younger siblings. this story is very emotionall- it made me cry- bust it is one of the best books I've ever read.

To their credit, the authors spend little time discussing innovation psychology and principles. They are more concerned with outlining model training sessions and workshops where participants can acquire the skills they need in the real world. The book includes a CD with PowerPoint presentations and training materials that you can print and distribute.

I enjoyed the brisk plot with the intertwined subplots that only served to add to the main plotline, rather than detract from it. After reading this book, I feel that I 'know' the main character, even without reading the previous adventures of Kirk McGarvey. This is somewhat of an accomplishment (although some of the more experienced McGarvey fans may have found the character references tiring). The book was an exciting read until the very end, when I feel that the author abruptly wrapped the main plotline. It's almost as if the author noticed the page count and then decided to get out of the book as quickly as possible. However, even this annoyance does not budge me from my rating of a 10.

However, some times the plot leaves a lot to be desired. In this particular book, many times the plot has big gaping holes and implausible scenarios. At times it is hard to believe that experts in the military\\\\intelligence arena could be so dumb. The hero, McGarvey is likeable and cool. The story started off well and the trouble in post cold-war Russia is believable. However, it could have been developed much more intelligently. Looks like Hagberg simply did not care enough about certain details, which matter to habitual spy-genre readers. Not being able to blow up the train - COME ON!!!! The french girl is hopeless.Still an absorbing read (exploits readers who are so caught up with the genre that they would gobble up anything), enough to pick up another ones of Hagberg's works, and going by reviews there seems to be better stuff from him, some of it writing as Sean Flannery."},{"Title":"Assassin","review":"Mr. Hagberg is without-a-doubt one of the finer action authors working today, and Kirk is right up there with Dirk Pitt, James Bond, Phillip Mercer, Kurt Austin and other literary He Men...only the big difference between those guys and Kirk is simple: He almost despises who he is and what he has become, yet he understands his duty and accepts responsibility when he has to. His experiences haven't been made any easier by the way he has been treated as a scapegoat by the US Government, either...all of these things factor into his decision to accept a job to assassinate the 'Tarantula', a Russian who is poised to not only win in the popular election, but who promises a whole new 'Cold War' with the Western world, one which he intends to win at ALL COSTS.But as with most charges given him by the Government, part-way into it, the rules change and suddenly the target knows what Kirk is planning, and does a little 'planning' of his own. This poor guy just cannot catch a break! But thank heavens Mr. Hagberg knows just how to treat the situation with just the right amount of thrills and chills to make it all worth reading. Is this Kirks best adventure to date? Not really. But is IS a fun read. And to those readers who just cannot get over any and all of the 'supposed' weapons flaws, get over it.

While not a spectacular read, it was definitely worth the money. The story itself puts ex-CIA assassin Kirk McGarvey in a situation where he must contemplate coming out of retirement due to a rapid deterioration of the political landscape in Russia and the seemingly irreversible rise of an evil leader of Russia. Although the plot pushes the envelope of reality a bit, the story is nonetheless within the spectrum of believability. McGarvey portrays a cool, confident, cerebral agent, yet also displays emotion sufficient to indicate that more than ice water runs through his veins. I felt that the story moved along with a reasonable pace, with sufficient action and suspense. All-in-all, even though this was not in the ranks of the best spy novels that I've read, there clearly is enough here to be of interest, and enough to make my pick up another of Hagberg's books."},{"Title":"Assassin","review":"Don't you hate being on the 20th page of a book when you realize you've been thinking about clipping your toenails for the last five minutes? This is one of those books. Its not as bad as the trash Tom Clancy has been shamelessly dishing out to an unsuspecting public for the last five years, but its not far off the mark. There are huge flaws in the plot. For example, the Russian Air Force currently has the capability of effortlessly obliterating an armoured train from 40,000 feet up and 50 miles away, yet, in this book, such a rail-slaved supertank is supposed to be unbeatable. The hero, I can't remember his name, was uninteresting and half-formed. Save your money and wait for this one to hit the bargain bins.

I think that what made me read the novel to its end was just to see if Kirk would do something outrageously different, or to see if Chernov or Tarankov would surrender.(I forgot Liesl, the bi-sexual female) Nevertheless, the novel is full of action, suspense and international cat- and-mouse chase.

I've read two other books by David Hagberg, in the hopes that he could get one right just by the law of averages. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed. I can name many other authors who are more than adequate substitutes for him, books that make you think(Tom Clancy, Larry Bond, Stephen Coonts, Len Deighton, John Le Carre, Frederick Forsyth, just to name a few). If you want to read a book about a resurgent Russia, read Icon by Frederick Forsyth. The bestseller lists are a good acid test for the techno-thriller genre. If it doesn't make it there, it's probably not worth reading."},{"Title":"Assassin","review":"We all look forward to retirement, it's only natural. Kirk Mcgarvey is not natural. A hired assasin can never rest. Hagberg portrays the inner feelings of a CIA operative who can never get out of the game, and who gets into the game of his life. Russia is in a shambles and a super-Stalin is poised to take over. McGarvey accepts an impossible assignment to fix the problem. Hagberg keeps you on the edge of your seat in this taut thriller which takes place in the U.S. and almost all of Europe. Unlike most action books, the plot is believable and unpredictable. Every move is accounted for. The reader never feels like he is being preached to or guided by the hand. This is action writing at its best. You won't want to put it down!"},{"Title":"Assassin","review":"If you like reading a story where you absolutely cannot see what's coming, then read the six McGarvey books. &quot;Assassin&quot; is right there with the best. Period. A chapter or two from this book would be someone else's entire book. Whew--what a ride!"},{"Title":"Assassin","review":"Great book &amp; a fast read. Hagberg is in top form. Exiting from start to finish. I just hop this is not the end of Kirk Mcgarvy. After all Branden Scoffield is nearing 60. &amp; McGarvy is by far better. Great book. Thanks from one of your fans."},{"Title":"Assassin","review":"This book is a whirlwind of activity with great international flavor. The book takes one into the dark side of the Kremlin and the tentative stability of the new Russia. From Paris to Langley to Moscow,the plot is such that the reader will find it difficult to put aside."},{"Title":"Assassin","review":"Alongside of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt, Hagberg's Kirk McGarvey is one of my favorite reoccuring characters in suspense thrillers. Assassin reaquaints us with old friends and new enemies and the result is another action packed thriller! The plot is well constructed and the characters are well developed. Hagberg deserves a place amongst the Clancy's, Ludlum's and Cussler's...he is definitely one of the best kept secrets in the genre! But if continues to put out more books like this it won't be long before the secret is out!!"},{"Title":"Assassin","review":"Read several books by this author. His character, Kirk McGarvey, is weak and the plot of the story is not believeable. If the book was rated by the word or number of pages, then I would rate higher. This is a 500 page book that could be condensed into a about 200 pages without losing anything.Bottom line would be to save your money and wait until the book shows up in a &quot;book trade&quot; used paper back store."},{"Title":"Assassin","review":"As the situation in Russia deteriorates, a Stalin-esque figure emerges. The Tarantula, riding the tide of burgeoning popularity and corruption throughout the military looks to seize power and put the world back in the throes of Cold War. The plot is well laid, including the armored train that &quot;can't&quot; be destroyed by the military, who due to corruption, respond with a planned under powered attack that leads the &quot;people&quot; to believe that the Tarantula is their savior and cannot be stopped. Kirk McGarvey to the rescue!! Lovers of this character will love this book, those who fail to understand the undercurrents throughout Russian society will see only shortcomings. A must read."},{"Title":"Assassin","review":"I really liked this book and the author. I will probably seek out and read more of his books. However, even though the action didn't let up for a minute, the story could have been developed and completed in probably half the number of pages. In fact, the climax came so quickly and without preamble as to be almost a let-down. All that notwithstanding, I would still highly recommend this book to anyone liking Tom Clancy type thrillers."},{"Title":"Assassin","review":"I have read almost all the books that Hagberg/Flannery has written, with the exception of two of the early ones written as Hagberg, which are not available even in used book stores. I find the author to be twisted and morose and truth be told, I love it! His cold war mentality suits me just fine. As Flannery, you really can't trust anyone. But as Hagberg, when he writes about Kirk McGarvey, you can trust the author to deliver a perfect, and dare I say, lovable protagonist. Kirk McGarvey (Along with Bob the Nailer for you Stephen Hunter fans), is one of the most unlikely heros you could find. Yet, you must root for and applaud the guy. Assassin brings Kirk McGarvey back after too long a wait. He's older and slower, but he's still got the right stuff. Mr. Hagberg, bring McGarvey back for another adventure. For all you readers who thrive on the &quot;Techno&quot; in techno-thriller, then by all means read Clancy, Coonts, Bond, et al. They are good reads too. But, if you just like to feel adventure in your gut, without testing your knowledge of the &quot;gadgets&quot; of war and spying, then Hagberg's your man!"},{"Title":"Assassin","review":"This book is definitely Hagberg's best work yet, much better than his previous High Flight. Unlike that previous novel, the situations in Assassin are all believable, and more importantly the characters all seem real with human motivations. The novel's hero, Kirk McGarvey, is no soulless, cold-blooded James Bond, but a genuine person whom we can understand and even identify with. The action is of course great, but it's the human characters that earn this novel its fifth star from me."},{"Title":"Assassin","review":"This would be the third novel I've read by Hagberg featuring &quot;super-spy&quot; Kirk McGarvey. I wish I knew what this guy was made of. Runs 10 miles per day, drinks with every meal, smokes up a storm, has the patience of Mother Theresa, tons of cash, beautiful women sent to spy on him, master minipulator of men, fluent in umpteen languages.You would think even in a state of poverty and difficult times the military could stop a train. For a french &quot;spy&quot; Jacquline is pretty sad. Elizabeth is horrid at best and manages to do in a few commandos and fight off the East German lesbian. At least Ryan gets fired. Don't waste your money, I just told you the story in 500 less pages. By the way, the best part of the book is the Tarantula, his bi wife, and Chernov/Bykov. They are the anti-heroes and they almost make this book bearable-almost."},{"Title":"Assassin","review":"Again, this book was as thick as his former ones, but again, it was going nowhere but blah, blah, blah. Sigh...... I've tried very hard to finish it but---sigh---it's awfully thick. The only way to finish it is flipping thru quickly like watching cartoon character changing and moving if you could flip fast enough. This guy is strongly recommanded to retire ASAP in order to save some trees."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Un-Common Attorney","review":"Reginald Hine, an English solicitor, wrote \\"Confessions of an Uncommon Attorney\\" 60 years ago near the end of his long career in a small law firm in Hitchin, a town north of London. What makes Hine's book so appealing is that he was an historian, a bibliophile, and a collector of interesting and curious information and anecdotes about all connected with the law and literature. Thus the book's a treasure trove of fascination. Here, for example, he descibes some features of his law firm's offices. The firm had been established in 1587. \\"The room I occupied possessed a secret chamber large enough to conceal a confidential clerk if earshot evidence of a ticklish interview were needed.... Everywhere one came upon cupboards, some of them undisturbed for centuries, filled with boxes of documents from the foremost county families. There, when the dust had died away, was all from the cradle to the grave; extracts of baptism from the parish register, a child's first stilted essays preserved by doting parents,.. letters of a more scandalous behavior from the black sheep of the family, settlements on mistresses, maintenance of natural children,.. letters in dishonorable exile from the uttermost parts of the earth, first at frequent, then infrequent intervals, fading at last into silence\\" - and on it goes. A half century before Hine the senior partner of the firm had been John Hawkins. His son, scapegrace Henry Hawkins, later his grace Lord Brampton, was the most storied and quotable member of the firm. Young Henry had been kicked out of the firm for perpetrating practicle jokes at the expense of the clients. Hine writes, \\"He forged a letter to the \\"Mercury\\" in his father's well known handwriting, announcing the death of John Curling, chairman of the local bench. The editor was astonished and enraged, when four days after publishing an obituary notice, he heard that Curling was presiding at Petty Sessions. It didn't stop there, however, for Hawkins, as soon as the hunt had died down, procured two other insertions announcing the premature deaths of Miss Beaumont and Miss Christiana Times. He felt that all these people should be dead, and that the flutter of even a false alarm might possibly shorten their days.... Not till Henry achieved fame at (an important) trial was \\"Old John\\" reconciled and even then the visits to his father's office were few and far between.\\" As might be expected, Henry's also the author of the comment, \\"If you spent all your time poring over the law there would be none left for breaking it.\\" Hine has anecdotes to share about legal and literary figues he knew; he writes about the curiosities of his legal and literary life; and, openly and between the lines, he reveals a lot about himself. Hine's more candid than I would be about personal matters but not so open as to answer the haunting question of why one day, while talking with a friend on a local railroad platform, he excused himself then stepped off the platform and onto the tracks in front of a fast moving through train."},{"Title":"A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility--Report of the Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change","review":"Together with C. K. Prahalad'sThe Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits (Wharton School Publishing Paperbacks), this book redirected my life. Although I have been an intelligence and operations professional all my life, and spent the last 20 years kicking doors down all over the world to get secret intelligence communities to focus on the 96% of the information they could get legally, ethically, and generally free or at very low cost, I was lacking a strategic frame of reference.This book literally blew my mind into smithereens. Starting with the fact that LtGen Dr. Brent Scowcorft is one of the last adults still standing with his integrity intact, I was moved to the core of my being by the following list, which is in priority order:01 Poverty02 Infectious Disease03 Environmental Degradation04 Inter-State Conflict05 Civil War06 Genocide07 Other Atrocities08 Proliferation09 Terrorism10 Transnational CrimeI cannot under-state the force with which this list hit me. In combination with Prahalad's book, which makes the point that capitalism is focused on the billion rich with a one trillion marketplace, while the five billion poor represent a FOUR trillion marketplace, I suddenly realized that the Panel had delivered one side of a strategic matrix for creating a prosperous world at peace.Despite the existence of other superb books, such asHigh Noon 20 Global Problems, 20 Years to Solve Them;The Future of Life; andPlan B 3.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization, Third Edition, no one--no one--had created a list in priority order that calls into question every national security budget on the planet, but especially that of the USA.These two books led to my decision to sell my for-profit, OSS.Net, and create, with 23 other co-founders, the Earth Intelligence Network, a 501c3 Public Charity, and to commit myself to being intelligence officer to the poor for the remainder of my life.I will just list the twelve policies and the eight humanities below, all other information is at EIN, and I do not want to distract from other reviews. This book, this list, is the single most important first step in empowering the collective intelligence of the public to the point that we can eradicate corruption, protect our commonwealths, and achieve a prosperous world at peace.Twelve policies that must be harmonized at the budget level across all Nations and corporations and foundations, and organizations (this is important because governments are organized as stovepipes--it is lunacy to use up water we don't have to grow grain we do not need to create ethanal with food instead of sugar cane, bacteria, or algae):01 Agriculture02 Diplomacy03 Economy04 Education05 Energy06 Family07 Health08 Immigration09 Justice10 Security11 Society12 WaterThe eight humanities (this is important because nothing the US or EU do unless we create, within seven years, an EarthGame that helps these dominant demographics avoid our mistakes:01 Brazil02 China03 India04 Indonesia05 Iran06 Russia07 Venezuela08 Wild Cards (e.g. Congo)There are so many books relevant to all of the above I must point to my lists, but want to list just a couple of future-oriented books here, the last being the first by EIN (free online, but lovely here at Amazon):The leadership of civilization building: Administrative and civilization theory, symbolic dialogue, and citizen skills for the 21st centuryHow to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas, Updated EditionCollective Intelligence: Creating a Prosperous World at Peace"},{"Title":"A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility--Report of the Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change","review":"This book is nothing less than a report made by a High-level Panel on the threats, challenges and change our world faces. This group of experts from different countries was established by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, with the idea of using the conclusions presented here to adapt the United Nations to what is happening nowadays, in order to make it more effective.Among other subjects, this report delves in six kinds of threats that should concern the world. That is, war between States; violence within States (including civil wars and large-scale human rights abuses); poverty, infectious disease and environmental degradation; nuclear, radiological, chemical and biological weapons; terrorism; and transnational organized crime. It also includes and explains policies to prevent them, and should that fail, adequate response to them. What is more, this book has some guidelines for the use of force in such cases, as well as reflections regarding peace enforcemen, peacekeeping capability, and post-conflict peacebuilding. Finally, ways of revitalizing existing institutions are discussed, along with the possibility of creating new institutions to meet evolving challenges.What does Kofi Annan think about the report the High-level Panel he established produced?. Well, in his own words \\"This is a report of great range and depth, which sets out a broad framework for collective security, and indeed gives a broader meaning to that concept, appropriate for the new millennium. It suggests not only ways to deal with particular threats, but also new ways of understanding the connections between them, and explains what this implies in terms of shared policies and institutions\\". Furthermore, the Secretary-General points out that he agrees with the report's core argument that a comprehensive system of collective security that tackles both new and old threats, taking into account that all are interconnected, is essential. As a result, all strategies must be comprehensive, if they are to have a chance of being successful.In my opinion, \\"A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility\\" is perfect reading material for those interested in International Relations, and also for people who are merely curious regarding what some experts whose job is to try to understand the new tendencies think about them. After all, this is a problem that concerns us all...Before ending this review, I would like to highlight the fact that a free copy of this report is available in the UN's website, in case you want to browse it before buying this book, something I recommend you to do.Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"My first-grade daughter has been fascinated by this book since she found the dog-eared 1962 copy in her school library last year. She's checked it out so many times that we're buying her a copy for her birthday.It's not often you find a science book for kids that doesn't talk down to them, or leave out a lot of facts to make the book shorter or less wordy. This book has a lot of words, some of them big scientific words, but it is so elegantly written that my daughter has never lost interest. It begins with descriptions of the creation of the planet and solar system and follows the story of life on our planet through prehistoric times, to present day life on the author's farm. The illustrations are absolutely beautiful, very folk-art like, and very detailed. If your child is interested in dinosaurs, like my daughter is, this is a great book and will broaden their interest into other eras of prehistoric creatures."},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"This book is absolutely fabulous! It reads extremely well to preschoolers and possibly younger children as well. Even though earth science has progressed since this book's first printing, it's still a great introduction some of the basic, foundational concepts in the study of: Space/Time; Earth and the Universe; Geology and Prehistoric Life Science.Also, the illustration's are beautiful! My 3yr. old is as fascinated by the pictures as he is by the story!I read this book and \\"The Little House\\" by Burton when I was a child and it has been a wonderful experience to share these books with my son!"},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"As a child this was my favorite book as well. I had it checked out of the school library so often I may as well have owned it. I was thrilled to recently find it still in print, and I ordered a copy for my kids -- and one for myself!The artwork is incredible. There's something about the style of it that almost... psychedelic. There's a swirling flow to it, with orderly ribbons of plants and animals winding into the distance. Yet while highly stylized, the artwork at the same time offers a wonderful sense of realism. The swamps of the Carboniferous seem so dark and mysterious; the verdant forests at the opening of the Cenezoic Era are infused with the essence of life born anew. And the intricate borders around the \\"program\\" at the beginning remind one of the lovingly detailed borders one might find along the high ceiling of some Victorian-era museum.Even after 40 years, the science behind the book holds up amazingly well. If you want to inspire a love of natural history in your children, get them this book!"},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"I was searching for a really good book about dinosaurs for my almost 4 year old daughter who has just developed an interest in prehistoric creatures, when I stumbled onto this book.We own other titles by Burton, The Little House, Katy and the Big Snow, and Calico the Wonder Horse, and love them all. But I think this book is the best. Why? Because, for my daughter, who demands daily readings, it has cracked the world of science wide open, spurring question after question about everything from meteors to the different types of rock, volcanoes, weather, the solar system, and on and on. Using the format of an engaging story, Burton has managed to touch on each of these subjects, and more, and pack so much information into a mere 80-pages. But it's not just rote information, it is a story, it is a play, and it is presented in such an entertaining way that it paves the path for a young child begin a journey of discovery that is integral to a life-long love and understanding of natural history and of the composition of the world around them.Burton's story begins 'eons and eons ago' when 'our sun was born.' Each page is laid out with the left side containing a one-paragraph description of the period of time being sampled. This is paired with a tri-color visual narrative of what is happening, be it a 5-sketch demonstration of lava erupting from the Earth's core or the evolutionary progression of invertebrate organisms, plants, or animals. The drawings create almost a (slow) motion picture to accompany the words. The left page is dedicated to a full-color scene, set behind a stage, complete with drawn-aside red velvet curtain, and a curious little man examining the different goings-on. He, too, becomes more modern as the story progresses.Something that I love about the format of this book is that the book begins by capturing snapshots of different periods of time that are very far apart; the first two documented time periods are 560,000,000 years apart. Mid-way through the book, the scenes are only 3,200,000 apart, and finally, by the end of the book, time slows down to 100 years, then 25, then 15, then each of the four seasons, then it is slowed to days, hours, and finally the final dark minutes before the sun rises and a new dawn is upon us. Early on, as time slows, Burton introduces her family into the story, and you find that this is her life story. On the final pages, as the story she has to tell draws to a close, Burton turns the story over to you, the reader, because it is your life story too. That last poetic touch is so beautiful, so perfect, that it leaves me in awe of the woman who wrote this book.I don't think that this book could have been written, presented, and illustrated better. Every part just 'fits.' The ending, I believe in time, will help my child to understand where she fits into this story, and perhaps she, as I do, will feel that warm swell of love toward our home, our Earth, and all the life that has walked upon it, and gratitude that she has a place among such a brilliant history."},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"I read this book almost 20 years ago in the first grade and was immediately hooked on natural history, dinosaurs, life sciences, and the like, not to mention storytelling itself. The illustrations are entrancing and the format--the history of life as a play in several acts on a world stage--is enthralling. It's highly informative, too, for a young reader (or even an old one), and it was one of the most memorable and entertaining \\"educational\\" books I read as a child.Now out of college, I have recently repurchased it for nostalgia and read it again. It remains a wonderful work. Being from 1961, it is slightly dated in spots. For example, it says that there is no record of life 2 billion years ago, whereas today we have found lifeforms dating back twice that far. Also, the dinosaurs' extinction is attributed to a cooling climate, because at the time the meteor theory was not widely accepted.But this of course is nitpicking. The ultimate point of the book is that it's an introduction to the history of our planet and everything on it, including us. The central message--that our own life stories fit into the grand tapestry of life's history--remains. This is a remarkable book, and paticularly if you have a young child, I highly recommend picking up a copy."},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"A wonderful, wonderful book, indescribable, sui generis. We bought one to read to our son, he loved it, later we gave it away, bought another to read to our daughter, she loved it, later we gave it away, and now we have a grandchild who'll be ready for it in a few years so we bought another copy.Ages 4 to 8? No, ages 4 to adult. I'm always teary-eyed by the time I read to the last page. The book is so sweet, so beautifully equipoised between art and science, between literal and stylized. This is not a book about earth sciences or evolution, it is about life itself and our place in time or space. It glides gracefully and effortlessly from astronomy to geology to biology to sociology to biography, from the story of life to the story of _a_ life. It has such a feeling of being an intergenerational _gift._The marvelous illustrations have a genuine warmth and an impish humor. They don't have the overbearing solidity that the Disney animators gave to the \\"Rites of Spring\\" sequence in \\"Fantasia.\\" They are approachable, unintimidating. It is true art to conceal art. They look like something a parent or a teacher or a child herself might draw--if those drawings actually came out the way the parent or teacher or child wanted them to.When we asked about it at Porter Square Books in Cambridge we were thrilled when they said they had two copies in stock. Then everyone had trouble finding it. Because nobody knew what section it should be in, and my wife and I missed it because we were looking for a yellow cover and this edition is a light green.(By the way, I'm not that big a fan of \\"Mike Mulligan and His Steamshovel;\\" the ending always seems creepy to me).I can't tell for sure because we don't have a copy of the yellow edition, but I'm 90% sure that in the current edition, the reproduction doesn't do justice to the illustrations. I don't want to take off a star because it is still such a wonderful, wonderful book, but in our copy the pictures are just the slightest bit greyish and muddied. My recollection, perhaps inaccurate, is that in the older edition the pictures really had a lovely tonal range, giving an almost three-dimensional look, with the picture behind the stage \\"proscenium.\\" So if the publisher reads this, I'm thrilled that it's still in print, but could you see if you can't tweak the picture reproduction a bit?"},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"Why don't the bookstores carry this one? In the tradition of Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel, and Katy and the Big Snow, Life Story presents its main tale in VLB's characteristic artwork wrapped with interesting mini drawings.

It is my favorite book from childhood and I still have my battered copy which I hope to share with my own children some day. The book is beautifully illustrated and written. The author conveys the beauty and the grandness of Earth's origins in a paen to natural history. The illustrations are what always captured me though. They are like nesting russian dolls, each layer presents its own story and suggests new meanings. It is a great introduction to the joys of exploring our world and our history."},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"My son has loved this book since he was four. From trilobites to wooly mammoths Life Story contains many things that are sure to spark a young child's curiosity. The theory of evolution has never been so wonderfully presented as in this beautiful book by Virginia Lee Burton. It is a joy to read and the illustrations can be explored and appreciated for a lifetime!"},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"I bought one copy of this book, was blown away, and bought a bunch more to give to the families of my many grand-nieces and nephews. I can't do better than quote one of the recipients:\\"Life Story is a beautiful book! I love the way the art and text in Virginia Lee Burton's books form a cohesive creation. It is fascinating to look through the pages of the book and imagine what the formation of the Earth was like. Life Story is like a journal entry from a personal witness to the creation of the world! What a marvelous experience that would be! And I love the way she involves the shapes and ideas of circles into the story of life, and its continuation through families.\\"I would like to comment on the concerns of an earlier reviewer. If your faith requires you to believe that the Earth arrived fully formed in recent years and that life did not evolve, this book is not for you. However, if you believe that humans did not come from apes, you can still read this book. Prehistoric humans arrive on page 43 writing on cave walls. There is no mention of what may have happened before that. We do see horses evolve from little bitty to modern, a topic of particular interest in my horse-loving family. We see the dinosaurs come and go. We see the climate change, not due to human intervention. My earth-scientist husband has shown it to his colleagues and they raved about it too. The way the ending circles from the eons to the seasons, past an allusion to The Little House, to the day and the hours to the morning of a new day is brilliant."},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"My 4 yr old is obsessed with this book, and subsequently, with natural history. It's a long book for bedtime, but when we are short on time, we read half of it.Provokes impossibly complex conversations to have with your child like : what was there before the big bang? Challenge yourself and take it on. We love all of her books."},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"I've used Life Story in my classroom for years. My copy disappeared several years ago and it was missed every year when my students would start researching the Time Line of Life. I'm so excited that Life Story has been updated and my children will be able to use it as a resource for their work."},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"Granted, my son is 3, and he likes to look at pictures, and I wouldn't say that the ones in this book (drawings rather than photos) really do much for him. And he likes stories, such as the one about the gingerbread man, whereas the text in this book is completely uninteresting to him. However, I expect he'll appreciate it more once he's older. Also, it seems to be a bit heavy on modern life."},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"I expected the Kindle edition to be a true copy of the book, but instead the book pages were copied as pictures with the text written out. The result is not good! The carm of the illustrations is lost. Too bad, because I think it does look like the original would be a nice book...."},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"After reading this book, as tempted as I was to buy it because I ADORE Burton's books and illustrations, I decided not to buy this book. We are a Bible believing family. We believe the scriptures clearly teach the origins and founding of the BEGINNING of LIFE. So, as a parent, if you buy this book, you must just decide what world view you want to teach your child. Did they come from sludge and by chance, (billions of years ago? Scriptures teach of a much younger existence) or are we created on purpose, with a purpose, by a loving Creator. Just my two cents by a mother of four. I feel the younger years are the most important so what we allow our children to read, no matter how sentimental or awesome the illustrations are, will form in their hearts and minds how they view themselves (do I have worth?) and the world they live in."},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"If you want to introduce your children to a prevailing modern paradigm/belief system regarding the origins of life, this isn't a bad book to do it with. It is understandably written with Ms. Burton's charming illustrations. As you will see from my title, I regard it as a fairy tale which I want my children to be familiar with. I shelved it next to D'Aulaires Greek Myths."},{"Title":"Life Story","review":"my child loves to be read to every night he is 3 years old but would not pay attention this book is worded very hard for him to follow really for me also, the pictures are beautiful but too mature for my 3 year old."},{"Title":"A Ladder from Earth to Heaven","review":"I bought this book a few years ago. It is a nice book. It walks a protestant through the how to pray the rosary. It isn't a marian rosary. The author uses the Jesus Prayer for the Hail Mary. This is more a Meditaion on Jesus' life. The book has a few other chaplets and other prays too. It has the Divine Mercy Chaplet and the Peace chaplet. I know that some protestants don't like to pray with beads but I would recomend this book to anyone wanting to learn about how to pray the rosary for thier own private worship."},{"Title":"Risen Indeed: Making Sense of the Resurrection","review":"In a field crowded by apologists, historians, and New Testament scholars, Stephen T. Davis may seem a bit out of place writing about the historicity of the resurrection of Jesus. He is, afterall, a professor of philosophy. As it turns out, his background in philosophy makes for a very gratifying book about the resurrection of Jesus (and the general resurrection of Christians).Davis covers a lot of ground. In Davis' own words, the book is \\"a somewhat eccentric mixture of philosophy, Christian theology, New Testament scholarship, and perhaps even preaching.\\" He covers a lot of ground, but largely maintains its cohesiveness. Though the structure is abrupt at one place, Risen Indeed effectively brings together the philosophy, theology, and apologetics related to the resurrection of Jesus.In his first Chapter, Davis effectively engages the arguments of David Hume and Anthony Flew, which object on philosophical grounds to the possibility of evidencing miracles. To his credit, Davis takes them more seriously than do most apologetics for the resurrection. Additionally, Risen Indeed clearly makes important distinctions, such as the difference between \\"soft apologetics\\" and \\"hard apologetics\\", and the difference between a \\"soft miracle\\" and a \\"hard miracle.\\" Davis concludes the chapter by noting that belief and denial of the resurrection of Jesus can be rational -- depending on the philosophical predisposition of the reader towards the possibility of a miracle. This sifting through the issues is very helpful in setting up the rest of Davis' \\"soft apologetic\\" for the resurrection.Chapters Two and Three also plow the ground for further discussion. In a common-sense manner, Davis reduces the argument that we cannot examine the historicity of the resurrection because it is an event \\"outside of history\\" or \\"beyond historical inquiry.\\" Such arguments in my opinion are simply dodges by historians afraid of upsetting the religious or the religious afraid of being proved wrong by the historians. As Davis shows, the resurrection -- if it happened -- is a historical event that happened within time and space. As a proposition, it is possible to investigate it in a historical manner.Davis moves into the actual apologetic for Jesus' resurrection in Chapter Four--Resurrection and the Empty Tomb. He begins by responding to common objections against its historicity and concludes by arguing for the reliability of the New Testament accounts and noting the difficulty the early Jerusalem Church would have had in proclaiming his resurrection had the tomb not been empty. Both arguments are well made, but relatively brief. For fuller defenses of the empty tomb the reader should take note of Davis' references.The book then shifts gears. Rather than proceed directly to the resurrection appearances or further evidence of Jesus' resurrection, Davis discusses basic Christian theology about the implications of Jesus' resurrection to the coming resurrection of Christians -- which, he argues, will be a similar, bodily resurrection. The theology is sound, but makes a somewhat abrupt appearance. Such considerations proceed for three chapters before we return to the direct apologetic for Jesus' resurrection. Though a little out of place in sequence, these chapters are valuable discussions of resurrection theology. Probably more interesting, however, to Christians than others.Chapter Nine discusses the role of the resurrection in apologetics. It reiterates some points earlier made, and delves into the question of Jesus' resurrection appearances and possible alternative explanations of the resurrection. Davis' discussion is well done and effectively engages contrary views. But again, this is not a work of New Testament criticism and consultation with more detailed sources will be helpful (such as N.T. Wright's The Resurrection of the Son of God).Overall, this is an excellent book. I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in understanding the nature of the reported resurrection of Jesus, the expected general resurrection of Christians, and the apologetics related to those events. It better sets the philosophical stage for such explorations than any book I have read."},{"Title":"Risen Indeed: Making Sense of the Resurrection","review":"Although Stephen T. Davis is a professor of philosophy, he appears to know the resurrection narratives as well as any Biblical scholar. In this comprehensive treatment of the resurrection, Davis addresses a wide variety of issues, including miracles, critical history, the concept of resurrection, the empty tomb story, dualism, physicalism, immortality, and apologetics. Along the way, he presents a sophisticated defense of the orthodox position against a number of objections. But Davis does more than just answer objections to Christian belief in the resurrection. He also presents what he calls a &quot;soft apologetic&quot; for the resurrection. What this means is that, unlike some apologists, Davis is NOT trying to show that nonbelief in the resurrection is irrational. Rather, he is simply trying to show that, from a supernaturalist perspective, belief in the resurrection is rational.I, for one, am happy to accept that, for certain supernaturalists in certain epistemic circumstances, belief in the resurrection can be rational. But I also happen to think (and perhaps Davis would agree) that, for other persons in other epistemic circumstances, nonbelief in the resurrection can be rational. I am not just talking about naturalists here. Suppose we put aside all worries about the existence of God and the problem of miracles. Assume that there is a God who performs miracles from time to time. The crucial question is whether the resurrection is one of those miracles. In other words, did Jesus really rise from the dead?As part of his defense of an affirmative answer to that question, Davis argues in favor of the empty tomb story. But it seems to me that his discussion is incomplete, for his defense of the *burial* of Jesus is incomplete. Davis's defense of the burial story consists almost exclusively of the argument that it is highly unlikely that Joseph of Arimathea is a Christian invention. But one can agree that Joseph of Arimathea was a real, historical individual without accepting all of the details of the Markan burial story (e.g., that Jesus was buried permanently in Joseph's tomb, etc.). And the *details* of Jesus' burial are crucial to arguments for the empty tomb, for the details have enormous implications about whether Jesus' followers knew the location of Jesus' tomb. If Jesus' followers did not know the location of the tomb, then the case for the empty tomb (and, by extension, the case for the resurrection) is greatly undermined. (For more information, see my forthcoming paper on the Secular Web about the empty tomb story.) Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, Davis did not address such details in his book. So Davis's argument is, at best, incomplete.Thus, even on the assumption that there exists a God capable of raising Jesus from the dead, I still see no reason to believe that the resurrection actually happened. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book and found it very helpful. In particular, I found Davis's chapter on bodily resurrection to be among the most helpful chapters in the entire book. Anyone interested in the historicity of the resurrection will definitely want to become familiar with Davis's book."},{"Title":"Risen Indeed: Making Sense of the Resurrection","review":"Stephen Davis, a respected professor of philosophy at California's Claremont McKenna College, has written a fine book of both biblical exegesis and philosophical argument defending traditional Christian belief in the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ and the future resurrection of the dead.In a wide-ranging but deeply informed and intelligent discussion, he treats common objections and covers such topics as physicalism, dualism, and the nature of personal identity. Latter-day Saint readers will be particularly interested in his brief reflections on the prospects for the salvation of the unevangelized, those who have not heard the message of Christ during mortal life (see pp. 159-65).In the course of his examination of that topic, he not only invokes such passages as 1 Peter 3:18-20; 4:5-6; and 1 Corinthians 15:29, so familiar to Latter-day Saints, but, without any apparent knowledge of Mormon doctrine on the subject, comes to a tentative position (a \\"conjecture\\" that he titles \\"postmortem evangelism\\") remarkably like that taught by Joseph Smith and further elaborated in the vision of the redemption of the dead granted to President Joseph F. Smith on 3 October 1918 and now recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 138."},{"Title":"Fun with Architecture","review":"This kit is not for the young child, as the stamps used are rather small and the reading level young adult.

Admitting that by the very nature of our society, we cannot help but enter into dialogue with others. People of other faiths now live right next to us, work with us, and worship within blocks of one another. Geography no longer separates us.And so, Lochhead argues that dialogue has now become an &quot;imperative&quot;. I agree. In order to be human, to relate with one another we must learn to talk with people of others faiths and cultures - even people without faith. By setting up his dialogical rubric, Lochhead attempts to do so in a &quot;Barthain&quot; mode, in reference to Karl Barth.I agree with Lochhead's assertion that there are communities which have either a hostile, isolationist, competitive or have a theory of partnership with other faiths. What he does rather glibly is box people into these and, albeit respectfully, discredits them, urging for dialogue. In the end, Lochhead pushes for &quot;dialogue for the sake of dialogue.&quot;In a sense, Lochhead argues for Dialogue that is essentially without purpose other than itself. Our &quot;intent&quot; should not be to witness, to convert, to even learn, but only to understand. Moreover, Lochhead is able to make his case in redefining dialogue to be essentially equivalent to &quot;love&quot;, for in dialogue we follow Christ command to love our neighbor. I would say this broadens the definition too much and makes dialogue too fuzzy.When he addresses &quot;witnessing&quot;, he shows a dislike for having any attempt to &quot;proclaim&quot; Christ. Once again, to try to be true to the biblical call to church mission, he then redefines what we are called to do as &quot;storytelling&quot;. He does this briefly and it is not really clear how this is different than &quot;witnessing&quot;.I am unclear how he is Barthian except in one area, namely, &quot;faithful agnosticism,&quot; meaning that we should be faithful to Christ, but not to make judgments about the validity of the faith of others. I think there is some truth to that; but I do not think he remains entirely Barthian throughout the book. In fact, I see much more of Tilich's influence in the need to let each tradition reflect on each other in dialogue so that both can be changed and to learn.His final view on comparing dialogue to the two natures of Christ is a stretch for me and a way to somehow stick to his theory while allowing for a high Christology. It does not follow that he also remains biblical and true to the narrative (i.e., story).I recommend this book (if you can find it!), but to be aware of the flaws."},{"Title":"When Dinosaurs Go Visiting","review":"This book is a delight to read.

When I consulted my teacher about whether I should choose Faulkner or another author to read, she told me something along the lines of, &quot;Faulkner's regionalistic and enigmatic style is interpreted two different ways by two different types of people: One think that he is symbolic and profound, the other think that he is not and rather full of it.&quot; Well, I do feel sorry for the 'other' group, because to not reconize the depth behind his more-poetic-than-most-poets words is just plain out wacky. I will say that he is not your typical fiction writer, his books do not have action oriented plots (or even any action in some cases), but he still somehow manages to catch your interest. I have never fell asleep while reading a book or story by Faulkner, and not many authors have earned this distinction. He also leaves you with a sense of reflection, again something distinguishing him from many others. Personally, I prefer short stories to novels, I find that my focus to the point and plot of the story is less distracted by the end as with a novel and I typically find that I retain more. I do enjoy Faulkner's novels and have read quite a few, but this collection of short stories is just brilliant beyond brilliant. His words are potent and sharp in all of them, even if his point and meaning is more elusive. I completely and totally recommend that everyone read this collection of stories. Everyone. Really. That means you too."},{"Title":"Collected Stories of William Faulkner","review":"William Faulkner (1897-1962) famously said that all novelists were failed short story writers and all short story writers were failed poets. To anyone who has tried to write fiction, I think these words make a lot of sense. However, while reading his collection of short stories, it occurred to me over and over again that the source of this quote may in fact be one of its exceptions. It goes without saying that Faulkner's novels are one of the finest bodies of work in that genre, so he was, obviously, a novelist. But with this collection of stories, it seems to me he was also a formidable short story writer. And I would challenge anyone who reads \`Carcassone', the beautiful \`story' that closes this immense collection, to tell me that Faulkner didn't have the poet in him as well.This is the collection that came out in the fifties containing 42 stories, some from earlier collection and others previously unpublished in book form. They are not grouped chronologically, but rather by \`subject': \`The Country', \`The Village', \`The Wilderness', etc. I don't know why Mr. Faulkner did this, but I found it really worked to have stories of similar themes or places grouped together.For those who haven't read Faulkner before, his writing is a dense, \`stream of consciousness' style, essentially the exact opposite of his nemesis, the minimalist Ernest Hemingway. This means these stories can be hard reading in a lot of spots, as the meaning of what is happening or what Faulkner wants us to comprehend can be elusive. Some sections or whole stories will need to be read again until the meaning becomes clear, or clearer. Luckily the other trait of Faulkner's is his perfect rhythm, almost like a galloping horse at times, which pulls us through the stories and makes us want to read them again and again.All of these stories are good, but my favorites had to be the haunting \`A Rose for Emily' and \`That Evening Sun'. \`Lo!', \`Artist at Home', and \`The Brooch' were also favorites of mine. But really, the guy had me from the first line of \`Barn Burning': \\"The store in which the Justice of the Peace's court was sitting smelled of cheese.\\" This book is for anyone who cares at all about literature. Any exploration of twentieth century American literature is virtually worthless without a dip into the ocean that is William Faulkner."},{"Title":"Collected Stories of William Faulkner","review":"A terrific introduction to the world of Faulkner's fiction. Some of these stories &quot;Wash&quot;, &quot;Barn Burning&quot;, &quot;All the Dead Pilots&quot;, and &quot;That Evening Sun&quot; serve as introductions to some of the characters that populate his novels. These 42 stories encapsulate a brilliant career, featuring a wide variety of styles and points of view.I am not a big fan of short stories, but each of these reads like a mini-novel.You will be engrossed and will want to go back and read them again."},{"Title":"Collected Stories of William Faulkner","review":"After reading \\"A Mule in the Yard,\\" \\"That Will Be Fine,\\" and \\"That Evening Sun\\" I was reminded of why this guy is one of the greatest storytellers ever.

Having read this amazing collection of short stories, I have no doubt in my mind that Faulkner was a very interesting person -- I would've loved to meet him.My favorite story is &quot;A Rose for Emily&quot;; the quirkiness and symbolism in the story is both beautiful and strange. I also like &quot;A Bear Hunt,&quot; &quot;All the Dead Pilots,&quot; &quot;Wash,&quot; and &quot;Two Soldiers&quot; -- all of the stories have a very unique language.

And indeed, in the Collected Stories there are tales of these aplenty. But refreshingly, Faulkner shows his great power as a writer by throwing a knuckle ball every now and again. There are a string of short stories in this collection which take place in the Great War and involve largely British characters (Turnabout). There is a story about aviators in the Great War (All the Dead Pilots). A story about homeless men in New York City (Pennsylvania Station) and even the writer writing of writers story (Artist at Home). Nothing is more refreshing to than to approach a writer the stature and reputation of Faulker, who made his bones in one type of literary fiction and realize that in addition to his well trodden paths he has range and depth of subject matter."},{"Title":"Collected Stories of William Faulkner","review":"... if you like Faulkner.

A Rose for Emily recounts the story of an eccentric spinster, Emily Grierson. An unnamed narrator details the strange circumstances of Emily's life and her odd relationships with her father, who controlled and manipulated her, and her lover, the Yankee road worker Homer Barron. When Homer Barron threatens to leave her, she is seen buying arsenic, which the townspeople believe she will commit suicide with. Faulkner based the story upon a true incident. The rose indeed was for his friend, Emily Grierson. In the story, the townspeople's points of views on Emily actually reflect the society's value at that moment to some extent. Emily feels that she is released when her father is dead.However, I do not recommend this book if you might get scared easily. The ending might come as a surprise, but that's suspense.

His may be a challenge merely to prove that he's worthy of the office rather than one of seeing his programs to completion. Fortunately, the financial collapse occurred the year before Obama's election, and the Iraq debacle was out of his control.

But even health care reform isn't worth another civil war.If more Americans read Faulkner, it's unlikely we would have ever come to such an absurd and truly sad, even tragic, state of affairs. In defending a lawmaker who recently heckled the president during a key speech in the halls of congress (the infamous \\"you lie\\" taunt), another Southern Republican congressman was insistent that the offender had put three of his sons in the line of fire in Iraq. Such thinking mirrors situations like those in Faulkner (as well as D. W. Griffith's \\"Birth of a Nation\\"), which show Confederate fathers sending all their precious sons to certain slaughter for the sake of pride and purity, lest the Covenant between God and the Confederacy ever be broken. Faulkner captures the dark yet passionate motives behind segregation in the Grand Old South with his portraits of true believers who would go to any lengths to avoid the introduction of the smallest percentage of black blood into immaculate lines deriving their ancestry from the Almighty Himself (to make the point, Faulkner can frequently even get mathematical, e.g. in an instance where the ostracized is the offspring of an Octoroon!). Applying Faulkner's logic to Obama, one understands more clearly why Obama (who is 25% African-American heritage) is capable of tapping buried wells of resentment.The story leading off this collection, \\"Barn Burning,\\" could just as well be the last, since Faulkner's two protagonists--the \\"white trash\\" sharecropper, racist father, Abner Snopes, and his son, Sarty, who is deeply divided between his love of family and his horror at his father's immoral behavior--reach a resolution that points to hope for the future. Sarty does what he must: he turns his father in, leading to Abner's death but also to the hope of a better world, a future recognizing one community and one human race. Most impressive, however, is Faulkner's ability to place the reader inside the consciousness of a character at once-in-a-lifetime critical moment when the question involves living or dying, denying one's own father or doing the right thing. The conflict becomes the reader's; race becomes everybody's business.Faulkner's deepest and fullest explorations of race and America are to be found in \\"Light in August\\" and his masterwork \\"Absalom! Absalom!\\" In both, characters whose skin is white but whose blood is \\"tainted\\" become scapegoats, receptacles for the violent sins of the world, unwanted and scorned by both blacks and whites. The short story \\"Wash,\\" can be used as a short and simple replacement for some of the more difficult sections of \\"Absalom\\" as well as a concise statement for the final moments of Rev. Hightower's life in \\"Light in August\\"--a climactic moment during which the reader can't know for certain whether the character experiences a genuine epiphany of transformation or succumbs to regressive visions of a noble white knight on a high-stepping white steed (reminiscent of the posters Griffith used for \\"Birth of a Nation\\" to depict the heroic Saviors of the South--an image frequently used by Faulkner as a metaphor for the blind fidelity to a noble \\"Klan\\" on a God-sanctioned crusade to right grievous wrongs to the nation.Faulkner shows that it's not the promiscuity that matters, or the white blood intermingling with the black (the \\"pickaninnies\\" littering the plantations in his stories serve as proof). It's the terrifying prospect of the least drop of black blood crossing the \\"holy\\" barrier that separates the races, and then showing up in the patronymic, matrimonial records of God's chosen. It is, on the one hand, a vision of grandiose, outsized, epic and passionate proportions and, on the other, deluded, infinitely sad, pathetic if not pathological, and potentially destructive to all.Of course, Faulkner's themes go beyond race. Few writers are so insistent on probing the innermost layers of a female psyche as Faulkner (he practically takes up where Virginia Woolf leaves off), and no writer is as obsessed with the meaning of language itself. But for all a reader might wish it otherwise, Faulkner repeatedly gets back to tracing the consequences of obstinate pride and illusions of purity, which ultimately and unavoidably returns him to the subject of race. (Ironically, political correctness has frequently claimed Faulkner as one of its victims, accusing him of the very thing he is not--a racist). When Faulkner's language gets the least bit confusing, try repeating the following phrase as a key to his meaning, a mere three words that, more than any others, captures Faulkner's entire message: \\"Blackness is humanness.\\"It's debatable if whiteness, an \\"achromatic\\" visual frequency, is even a color. The misguided attempts to preserve its purity, through practices ranging from segregation to incest, are the manifestations of pride run amok, of a deranged mentality of that can in short order become a widespread disease. Faulkner simply can not make the point frequently enough, and some might even say it's still not enough: human beings are creatures of color. The imaginary color betokening an immaculate purity, on the other hand, is limited to saints--or members of a sub-human klan."},{"Title":"A Framework for Immigration","review":"I am a professor at the University of Indiana, and I have been looking for a textbook about Asian Americans and their life in the United States. There are books about Blacks, Latinos, basically every other minority group, except Asians. Segal is a Pioneer in this sense, and the book sets a standard that will be hard to match. Segal, an immigrant herself, shines light on the Asian communities individually, rather than clumping all Asians together, as previous authors have done. So far, this book has only received positive feedback from my class. It is much better and much more organized than the previous material I had (photocopies of varies sources).

Thirty years ago, as a Washington Post reporter, I wrote a book titled \\"Dare To Be Great\\" about an entertaining guy named Glenn W. Turner. I'd covered his business adventures and legal troubles for years and was fascinated by his appeal to the hopes, dreams and greed in all of us.The book garnered excellent reviews including two in the New York Times, one in the daily book review section, the other in the Sunday Times book review section. It was not a best seller, but \\"Dare To Be Great\\" sold respectably.Time passed. Glenn Turner went in and out of jail. And like most books, mine went out of print. But thanks to the Internet and new companies such as Amazon.com, an electronic marketplace began for the resale of used books. Even better, readers could post reviews of those books on line for the world to see.Maybe, if you'd written a book, you'd do what I've done and sign on Amazon.com every year or so just to see the price your book was fetching on the open market. Even better, you could have a little fun reading reviews by recent buyers.Well, that's what I did today. And imagine how surprised I was to find that after receiving seven, five-star reviews for \\"Dare To Be Great\\" between the spring of 2001 and the fall of 2003, suddenly an unusual number of people IN A SIX DAY PERIOD last summer took the time to review my book. And all of them hated it so much they awarded it only one star and trashed my writing, my career, my motives, and my reportorial reputation.I wonder what could have caused such a huge surge in interest in a 30-year-old book?Following these words, you'll find \\"reviews\\" that show this: Between Aug. 16 and Aug. 24, 2005, an astounding nine folks HATED my book and wrote to say so. Heck, three people alone on Aug. 20th took time out of their busy lives to sign on to Amazon and slam me and my writing.As I write in the title of this review at the top, I'm impressed. Impressed that there could be such a startling revival of interest in a book written three decades ago about a guy who is only in the public eye when his hometown newspaper in Florida decides to do a \\"Whatever Happened To\\" article about him. Impressed that he still has loyal fans dedicated to smearing anyone who doesn't regard Turner as a saint. (The biography he paid a journalist named John Frasca to write years ago was titled \\"Con Man or Saint?\\")I'm also impressed that those die-hard fans would, in an eight-day period, all decide to read my book and sit down and write reviews for Amazon.As we used to often write about such things when I was the DC bureau chief for the satirical magazine called SPY . . . \\"Coincidence? I think not.\\""},{"Title":"Dare to be Great: The Unauthorized Story of Glenn Turner","review":"I well remember this book coming out by Maxa back in the 1970's and I well remember how poorly it was recieved back then. Glenn W. Turner had been named as American Of The Year, ran for political office on the democratic ticket and was considered quite a hero. His companies Koscot Interplanetary and Dare To Be Great provided opportunities for both personal and professional growth as well as income opportunities never seen before or since.This book is just a readers digest of all that the biased media wrote about GWT back in those days. In fact that was the reason the book failed, even those who did not know the truth about Dare To Be Great and Glenn Turner had already read this crap in their local newspapers and could care less about a book like this.Turners flagship company Koscot Interplanetary offered state of the art cosmetic products. And Koscot was making a lot of noise in the industry. Large, well known cosmetic companies could not understand how a harelipped, eighth grade dropuot could start a cosmetic company with only $5,000 and be breathing down their necks generating over $350 million in sales in under five years and without major advertising. They didn't understand the power of network marketing or referral marketing. That the best way to promote a product is by one friend telling another friend and so on.Boxing legend Archie Moore used the Koscot products and said it was the only product he ever used that softened his rough hands. Major celebrities and stars were using the products. Koscot's competitors were not too happy.And Dare To Be Great delivered on it's promises. Originally the program was set up as a sales and motivational program for Koscot reps. The program consisted of classes, records and movies (this was before audio cassettes and video tapes) and helped reps reach their potential in record breaking time. Eventually, the program was expanded to include family members over the age of 18 and for awhile, a modified Dare To Be Great program was being taught in Jr. and Sr High schools and even in grade schools. Turner felt that success, attitude, positive thinking and goal setting should be started at the earliest possible ages.An estimated 800 millionaires were created through Turners companies and had over 1 million people involved. The company started by Glenn Turner would eventually extrapulate to over 78 companies in over 21 countries.What I remember most about GWT was his big heart and his strong desire to help other people. He also had the unique ability to spot greatness where others didn't. For example, there was the case in New York City in 1970. GWT was in the Big Apple for a major promotion. Meeting with his top executives in a upscale restaurant in Manhatten, in walks a homeless man. This was January, 1970 and one of the coldest winters in history. Needless to say, patrons immediately called for the management to throw this \\"bum\\" out.When Turner saw what was going on, he approached the homeless man and told the management that this man was his quest. The manager was aware of who Mr. Turner was, knew that Turner frequented his establishment whenever he was in town and brought in a lot of business so allowed Turners \\"guest\\" to stay despite cries of protest from the other patrons.Turner then didn't just give the man a chance to get out of the cold and a warm meal, paid for courtesy GWT but offered him an opportunity to fly back with Turner to Orlando on his Lear jet. Turner in classic style said; \\"Let me show you what I've got. If you don't like it, I'll send you back here to go back to what you've got.\\"Needless to say the man accepted. Turner found this homeless man a place to stay, got him cleaned up, found him a job and exposed him to his company. He gave him records to listen to and films to watch. He told him the books to read like Think & Grow Rich, The Magic of Believing, The Power of Positive Thinking and so on and let attend Dare To Be Great and Koscot Opportunity Meetings. He met some of the top people in Turner's companies. Turner made the man work for everything. It was the classic story of \\"give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.\\"The story has a happy ending. The man, after working for awhile paid the $10 fee to join Koscot because that was all he could afford at the time. He eventually got his own apartmentment and bought his own car. This once homeless man became one of the great leaders in Koscot and eventually, through the profits he made with Koscot got into Dare To Be Great. A homeless man who once resided on the streets of NYC now became a successful businessman. All thanks to the generosity of Glenn W. Turner.Needless to say, you won't find that story in Maxa's book. Nor would you have found it in any of the biased newspaper articles of the times. A title that says \\"Millionaire Businessman takes homelessman under wing and transforms him into a successful businessman\\" wouldn't sell in those days and probably wouldn't sell today. As the saying goes, if it bleeds it leads, if it smells it sells, bad news headlines that is.As one of the many people who was exposed to GWT and the Dare To Be Great program all I can say to GWT is thank you, thank you, thank you. To Maxa, you should be writing articles for the cheap tabloids."},{"Title":"Dare to be Great: The Unauthorized Story of Glenn Turner","review":"First of all, interested readers should be made aware that this is not the same educational type DARE TO BE GREAT books that are out by great writers like Cameron and Kreuger. You won't find any information in this tome on how to be great at anything.Instead of being educational, this book is about an apparent ripoff company called Dare To Be Great from the 70's. According to author Rudy Maxa, the founder and CEO Glenn W. Turner cheated thousands out of $44 million+ with an apparent illegal pyramid scheme called DARE TO BE GREAT.Judging by the reviews here, Turner apparently had a lot of fans and supporters. In any event, I found this book worthless and not even worth the $1.25 it was selling for at a used book store. The book is small and has no useful content."},{"Title":"Dare to be Great: The Unauthorized Story of Glenn Turner","review":"This book by Rudy Maxa is still another attempt by a overambitious writer who attempts to use the general publics ignorance for his own personal financial gain.What Maxa does in this book is merely regurgitate the same nonsense that the mainstream media had been regurgitating since 1968. To believe Maxa, you would think that Glenn W. Turner was a cross between a tv evangelist and JR Ewing. In fact Glenn W. Turner was one of the kindest people most of us ever met.I recall hearing a story about a 12 year old girl with a harelip so severe that she went into recluse, refusing to go to school because of the constant attacks by her peers. The girls mother called Turner Enterprises hoping to get Glenn Turner to talk to her daughter knowing full well that Turner had overcome the stigma of a harelip to become super successful. Turner did better than talk to the girl by phone, he went to the girls house. Despite a great motivational speech by Turner, the girl was still distraught. Turner then informed the girls mother thant he was going to arrange to have the young girls harelip surgically removed. When the mother indicated that she couldn't afford it, Turner in classic style said; \\"No problem, I'll pay for it.\\"Maxa and the mainstream media missed this. Obviously an article about one of the wealthiest people in America paying for a 12 year olds surgery would not sell. But saying that the man was crook, an evangelist that ripped people off I suppose would. As they say in the media; \\"If it smells, it sells.\\" Even if it is not based on facts or truth.I have many fond memories of the The Dare To Great Seminars. It was exciting seeing shy, timid people come in to the seminar on day one so lacking in confidence that they couldn't even introduce themselves on day one but by day five were giving compelling presentations!Although these seminars were initially Sales & Motivation in nature, they also provided keys to family unity and balance. People reported becoming better spouses, better parents and teenagers were taught values. Many students went from graduating from High School to Dare To Be Great reps and were earning more money than their peers were many years later after completing college and working for corporate America.Contrary to what Maxa says in this book, the $5,000 was not just for a Dare To Be Great distributorship (not franchise) but was also to attend the Dare To Be Great Seminars which allowed the Dare To Be Great Rep, his spouse and family members over the age of 18 the opportunity to attend with UNLIMITED REPEAT PRIVLEDGES. Those of us who took advantage of this program felt that it worth three times the price. As noted above, those who took part in the seminars and training got great, permanent results breaking through barriers and achieving great personal and professional success.Dare To Be Great Reps became among the highest paid direct sales people in the nation and Dare To Be Great became the hottest business opportunity of the times. It was a personal development program and a business opportunity unlike anything that ever came before it and I don't think that anything has come even close to it ever since.Most of what is in this book is not true. Maxa is selling sensationalism, not truth. All he has to do is talk to any of the Dare To Be Great reps who followed the program, not the wealth without work people who willingly paid $5,000 but wouldn't go to the seminars or go to work.To these people I repeat what Turner used to say: \\"Some people are waiting for something to turn up. Why not try starting with your sleeves and go to work?\\"This book by Maxa makes for great toilet tissue. And that is being kind."},{"Title":"Dare to be Great: The Unauthorized Story of Glenn Turner","review":"Rudy Maxa certaintly is an excellent writer. But what talents he has in writing skills are far overshadowed by the ambitions he had in attacking a man who helped a lot of people, especially in the Orlando, Fl area. That man of course is the great Glenn W.

An award that was presented to him by Burt Reynolds. In fact, Maxa leaves a lot out in his book.Interesting is what happened to Maxa's career after he wrote this very biased and fact-lacking work. This book bombed and Maxa's career went right down the toilet where it rightfully belongs.Sorry, I hate to see a good man like GWT attacked undeservedly. I guess I am \\"old fashioned\\" that way.Maxa, you should consider writing a newer version of this book with an apology to GWT.

In one sense they applaud Glenn W. Turner and his great work with Koscot Interplanetary and in another sense they give this book which rips Glenn W. Turner apart five stars.Interesting that this book is selling for as much as $195. No doubt the five star reviewers are attempting to generate book sales and perhaps dupe Glenn W. Turner people into buying this trash. WARNING: It is as biased as the legal system was in the 1970's. It is NOT fair to Glenn Turner and in fact reveals him in an unfair and altered way.No mention is made in this book that Turner won 699 out of 700 (frivulous) lawsuits that were filed against the man. No mention is made of the great work that Glenn Turner did or the charities he helped. Only the gutter trash, innuendo, rumor without facts.As the title indicates, this is an \\"unauthorized story.\\" Had this author taken the time to come to Orlando and truly investigate Glenn Turner, Koscot Interplanetary and Dare To Be Great as John Frasca, a Pulitzer Prize Winner did, this story would have been quite different. Frasca won over 35 major awards for journalism including the Heywood Broun Award. As an investigative reporter his articles for the Philadelphia Daily News were publicly credited by Governor George Leader with leading to improvements in mental hospitals in Pennsylvania. The work of Mr. Frasca led to the release of a sane woman who had spent five years in a mental hospital. On another occasion, Frasca helped save an innocent man from the electric chair.After carefully researching Turner and his enterprises, Frasca wrote several books about Glenn W. Turner such as Con Man or Saint, The Unstoppable Glenn Turner and GWT Changed The World For Me. These books by Frasca offer a quite different and accurate story about Glenn W. Turner---The True Story.Regrettably, Maxa resorts to gutter journalism. This book was written back in the mid 1970's. Then as now, the media liked to go after successful businessmen, even if what they presneted in their journalistic trash was totally inaccurate. This book is like a cheap tabloid and I don't understand why it is still around or why it is selling for nearly $200!Skip this one and get one of John Frasca's books instead.

Was hoping for more insight of the underlying processes inherent in the Enneagram symbol that Gurdjieff, Bennett, Ouspensky and Vollmer discuss and how that relates to traversing the Enneagon."},{"Title":"The Enneagram of Passions and Virtues: Finding the Way Home","review":"I read this book about two years ago so unfortunately it is not fresh in my memory. However, the book did make a big impression on me at the time and I have frequently recommended it to others who have just begun their enneagram inquiries. I had previously read three books written by Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson (Personality types, Understanding the Enneagram, and another less impressive I can't remember the title...). I found that \\"The Enneagram of passions and virtues\\" was the perfect next-step in learning about the enneagram. Each chapter more profound than the next, everything tying together beautifully. The author basically underlines nine virtues and nine passions- She goes into decent detail over the pairing of these virtues and passions. She says that she has found that most people relate most frequently with one of these pairs of virtues and passions. An example of this would be \\"Envy vs. Equanimity\\" or \\"Fear Vs. Courage\\". I really recommend this book to someone new to the enneagram, someone who is looking to dig a little deeper. This begins with basic psychology, like Riso and Hudson, but goes beyond into the realm of the spiritual and existential (which, if you continue looking into the enneagram you are going to find its roots in spirituality anyway.) This book really helped me to understand myself and others, also what to do with the information in Riso and Hudson's books.Another really great thing about this book is that it was much more of a gateway into this topic because it had so many great sources that after I finished reading this book I knew exactly where to go next. I was able to trace some of the roots and history of the enneagram as well as read other authors (such as Claudio Naranjo and Gurdjieff) who have written a great deal about the enneagram.Finally, one criticism I do have about this book is that... well.... it was a bit cheesy. It seemed like the author would ocassionally go off for a few pages about how you can let your heart go free and let your soul go and move towards the light of ever-loving majestic type crap. I didn't really mind it at the time I was reading it, but it was a bit of a turn off. I guess it was just a bit excessive.All in all, wonderful amazing book for the right person at the right time. Highly recommended to enneagram beginners. This book can be very intense and really open your eyes to human behavior and human intentions. It can really open you eyes and wake you up. This is a good thing."},{"Title":"The Enneagram of Passions and Virtues: Finding the Way Home","review":"Reading Sandra Maitri is a little like wading through dark waters with gems in the creek bed. Reading is not quick and easy, but there are many rewards if you persist. I highly recommend any works of Sandra Maitri."},{"Title":"The Enneagram of Passions and Virtues: Finding the Way Home","review":"Sandra Maitri's book is useful for someone who knows a little about the enneagram (to the point at which they have narrowed down the possibilities for their type and appreciate the potential for understanding human experience provided by the enneagram). Then one wonders: Where do I go from here with this system?S. Maitri provides a somewhat broad perspective on where she sees that people can go with the enneagram as a map into new territory. She focuses on a duality for each type, one choice seeming to lead us to an evolution our ego structures underwent when we were young, and we were filtering our experience through the lenses of the various types in order to enhance our survival and establish a distinct identity, and other visceral (or what one might call instinctive) goals of humans, and the other seeming to lead to greater and greater levels of interconnection and unity, as we probe (and possibly go beyond the sharp boundaries we established for ourselves when young) the seeming universal, within our particular experiences, and which transcend our particular filters or ennea-types.She obviously seems convinced that this \\"higher\\" pursuit takes us in a direction beyond our materialistic orientation of science and technology, but what this might mean seems somewhat elusive (despite using capitalized words like \\"Being\\", suggestive of a supernatural orientation). She presents quite a balanced perspective, and frequently brings into the picture Freudian or Freudian-related viewpoints. This particular psychological vantage point is helpful, due to the broad interests of Freud and those who advanced the science after him.I thought that her project in this book was very ambitious, and perhaps deviated a little into vagueness and superficiality by attempting to make so many connections. On the other hand, this large perspective is a valuable one to be exposed to as one person's vision about a direction for further investigation after assimilating some of the important ideas about the enneagram."},{"Title":"The Enneagram of Passions and Virtues: Finding the Way Home","review":"I can't speak highly enough about this book.If you sense that ontology empowers psychology, and that good psychology can open the door to make the leap to profound ontological inquiry ... you will LOVE this book!Sandra's maturity and compassion and commitment reveal itself on every page.The book has a momentum that creeps up on you ... and before you know it, your cells are TINGLING (if you are open)!My highest compliment is to say that I hope one day to have an in-depth conversation with Sandra Maitri.Namaste ..."},{"Title":"The Enneagram of Passions and Virtues: Finding the Way Home","review":"The Book explains in easy to understand terms for those who are ready to embrace a deeper understanding about ourselves.

This book however gave me much more in depth material that was hard to process (the author does not tipy toe around the issues) but very important to learn and work with. I highly recommend this book, as well as her other book \\"The Sprititual Dimension of the Enneagram\\", for those that are seriously working on themselves."},{"Title":"The Enneagram of Passions and Virtues: Finding the Way Home","review":"Great subject. Boring book. I find that the Riso/Hudson version of the E is great for work on the personality. But limited. When I encountered their version of it, I thought that the older E with the passions, virtues, holy ideas, fixations, was outdated.With authors like Maitri, I found that I was dead wrong. The passions and virtues speaks of an aspect of the Work, a psycho/emotional inner alchemy.One problem I have found about her two books is a sense of repetative language, and a constant attempt to force intellectual language. You can tell that she is not the dry, intellectual Almaas. But still tries to be. And fails. Got sort of sick of the fluffy talk about true nature, and \\"obvious\\" facts, such as how we are not our bodies and so on.I would have enjoyed more talk about how one's energies get redirected and transmuted into the virtues with inner work. Instead of the transformation just happening. Very much felt that is was missing something."},{"Title":"The Enneagram of Passions and Virtues: Finding the Way Home","review":"Maitri ends a lot of time in this book delving into psychology, especially Freud.I find her insights into the Enneagram fascinating and eminently useful."},{"Title":"The Enneagram of Passions and Virtues: Finding the Way Home","review":"This is an amazing book on the enneagram, in that it shows us how each type's issues are issues for all of us. We are not simply different, but kin.

There aren't any reviews posted, so mine will be a bit long-ish.Have you read books like Andrew Dalby's \\"Language in Danger\\" or David Crystal's \\"Language Death\\" and wanted something a bit more academic-oriented and informative? Are you a linguistics major who's considering doing fieldwork on an endangered or minority language? The two books above will pique your interest in endangered languages; Professor Tsunoda's book will take you one step further and serve as a reference manual for your own studies.\\"Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization\\" is an invaluable reference work for graduate students and anyone venturing into the field of endangered languages and the state of their documentation and revitalization activities. Despite being packed with reference material, it's quite usable as a textbook (our class used it) and doesn't lack for readability.Each chapter introduces another aspect of language endangerment, and presents essential terminology, summaries of previous work, and an introduction to various linguists and their positions on debates in different areas. Chapter 10 (Maintenance and Revival) is particularly useful and fascinating -- a look at how moribund and once-extinct languages are being brought back. This is the soul of the book, and Chapters 12 (Role and ethics of researchers) and 13 (Methods of documentation and training of fieldworkers) will serve as your instruction manual as you perform your own research.Almost every page is filled with references to previous works, painstakingly noted with a very complete bibliography. This alone makes it something you'll find yourself referring to often.If you're not familiar with Aboriginal Australian languages, you soon will be. Professor Tsunoda is an expert on several Australian tongues which have gone extinct within living memory, are precariously endangered, or are in the process of revival. The overemphasis on these languages, and the numerous examples using them, can be off-putting if you're expecting the entire globe to be equally represented, but their obscurity can be the very thing that makes this book instructive -- the Warrungu language's syntactic ergativity in particular is one rare linguistic feature that you would never know about if not for books like this.I give the book four and a half stars, rounded up to five now that the price will finally be within reach -- a paperback edition is coming soon, putting this valuable reference in the realm of affordability to students as well as faculty. And if you're a university librarian or linguistics department administrator, you should be buying it now.In conclusion, as a postgraduate linguist myself, not a week goes by when I'm not thinking back to important concepts and previous research mentioned in this book. Get it on your bookshelf and broaden your horizons to the world's endangered languages."},{"Title":"The Last Tasmanian Tiger: The History and Extinction of the Thylacine","review":"i write this recommendation to emphasise to potential readers that this is a very worthy study of the extinction of the Thylacine. whilst true that this book will not inspire hope that this most unique of creatures survives, it does unravel the reasoning behind it's rapid fall into extinction. Paddle offers a gentle introduction to the species' biology and ecology, aswell as a history in captivity, but it is his research of bounty records and contemperary accounts that sets this work above others. scientific maybe, but well planned, researched and written, and the twist he brings in regarding the reason for the bounty is worthy of an agatha christie novel! an excellent piece of work and well suited to conservation biologists, natural historians and anyone with an interest in the twentieth century's greatest loss."},{"Title":"The Last Tasmanian Tiger: The History and Extinction of the Thylacine","review":"Robert Paddle's controversial book, The Last Tasmanian Tiger, attempts to overturn most previously accepted anecdotal reasoning on a subject that is fast becoming popular world wide. Paddle has rather recklessly thrown caution to the wind in his sometimes dangerous dismantilling of sound anecdotal evidence, replacing it with his own logic, which is in many cases sadly wide of the mark. The Last Tasmanian Tiger could prove to be a dangerous book in the wrong hands, for it could lead astray those tender souls genuinely seeking information of this unique creature. Being pro-scientific as it is, Paddle's book is written in a style that can be hard to decipher for us mere mortals. But, all this aside, Paddle has done a tremendous ammount of research in assembling his book, some of it ground breaking, and from this point alone it makes worthwhile reading. The Last Tasmanian Tiger is definitely not suitable for the novice thylacine enthusiast."},{"Title":"Giant Steps: Bebop and the Creators of Modern Jazz, 1945-65","review":"If you have trouble differentiating among Chocolate Williams, Rubberlegs Williams and Horsecollar Williams, here's a volume to straighten you out. In profiling eleven musical thinkers who've helped to shape today's music, Kenny Mathieson enlivens his text with numerous references to other peripheral characters hovering around the scene during the 40s and 50s - for example, \\"...an unshakably persistent black saxophonist from Newark known as The Demon, whom Dizzy dubbed \`the first freedom player - freedom from harmony, freedom from rhythm, freedom from anything.'\\"Since I've always been intrigued to learn exactly where this music took shape, I was pleased to find references to a long-gone New York club called Snookie's (in which Dizzy's horn was famously bent during a birthday celebration), to the old McKinley Theater in the Bronx (where Bird sat in with the Gillespie big band) and to The Finale, a short-lived spot in LA's Little Tokyo district that Ross Russell termed \\"a West Coast Minton's\\". Mathieson even identifies the location of that Harlem chili parlor where Bird had his celebrated epiphany.Hey, did you know that James P. Johnson lived in Manhattan's San Juan Hill near the home where Monk grew up? That Blue Note first recorded Monk at Ike Quebec's urging? That one of Bud Powell's earliest piano heroes was Billy Kyle? That Max Roach served as house drummer at the Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach for six months during the early 50s? That Fats Navarro was Charlie Shavers' third cousin? Or that Chano Pozo's cousin was Chino Pozo? Me, either.Yet despite these fascinating digressions, Mathieson's principal focus remains the recorded output on the eleven players he's elected to spotlight: Gillespie, Parker, Navarro, Powell, Roach, Monk, Mingus, Rollins, Davis, Herbie Nichols and Coltrane. He's chosen this order deliberately - and does manage to provide substantial amounts of information on other key players throughout (for example, on Clifford Brown in the chapter on Roach and on Tadd Dameron in the section on Navarro).As Mathieson notes, no one much under seventy is likely to have heard Parker during his peak years - and no one much under fifty will have experienced Coltrane live. Consequently, the recordings left by these prime movers is the closest most of us can ever get to them. His stress, therefore, is on those recordings, with enlightening reference to the circumstances surrounding them.Mathieson says that the last roughly comparable venture he's aware of was the Jazz Masters series originally published by Macmillan in the mid-60s. His aim, he adds, was to make this volume accessible to readers with no technical knowledge of music. Still, I doubt that Giant Steps would serve as a good introduction to jazz for someone who hasn't already listened carefully to lots of it.Salted throughout are aptly chosen quotes from other jazz writers. But I found many of the author's own observations on these players, their recordings and their legacies especially thought-provoking.For example: \\"As a musical process, bebop is a curious mixture of macho display and infinitely subtle musicality, of rote playing (all players have their melodic cliches, their little phrases which will always work when run over a particular given sequence of chord changes) and inspirational improvisation.\\"And elsewhere: \\"The environment which forged bebop was a tough one, but it meant that the music evolved as a meritocracy rather than a closed shop. That element of competitive muscle-flexing probably played its part in determining both the strengths and weaknesses of the emerging form, with its emphasis on virtuoso soloing, advanced harmonic understanding and crackling tempos, and its underlying structural paucity.\\"Noting that unlike Miles or Mingus, whose compositions tended to evolve over the years, Mathieson observes that Monk kept the form of his tunes pretty much intact. Then he quotes Charlie Rouse stressing that Monk \\"...wanted you to play the melody just the way he created it, but with the chords, he wanted you to know them, but he didn't want to hear you just play them in that way, he wanted to hear you experiment with them, not be confined by them.\\"Later in his chapter on Thelonious, the author observes, \\"As many musicians have discovered to their cost, the kind of harmonic fudging which can carry a player through a bop structure without a precise knowledge of the underlying harmonies does not work with Monk's music, where it is not only essential to know the melody and the harmony intimately but also comprehend fully the way in which they relate to each other and to the essential rhythmic scheme which fits them.\\"As I read, I jotted down references to numerous recordings I've never heard but would like to (for example, a late-40s aircheck that included Navarro, Parker and Lennie Tristano, four 1949 Navarro sides pairing him with Sonny Stitt - who was, Mathieson reports, Miles' original first choice on alto for his \\"Birth of the Cool\\" nonet! - and a 1963 Powell session for Reprise actually supervised by Ellington) and to others that no one will likely ever get a chance to hear (e.g. an abortive 1953 studio date for Norman Granz that had Parker playing Gil Evans arrangements; Dizzy making a few gigs with the Kenton band).Mathieson envisions Giant Steps as the first in a series of similar studies. The next, he says, will be entitled Cookin': Hard Bop and Soul Jazz and focus on such figures as Art Blakey, Horace Silver, Lee Morgan, Cannonball Adderley, Booker Ervin, Elmo Hope, Tina Brooks and Gigi Gryce.Except for a puzzling reference to \\"Senator Adam Powell\\" and an assertion that Miles' \\"Budo\\" is a contrafact of Bud Powell's \\"Hallucinations\\" (wait, aren't they the same tune, as the author himself indicates elsewhere?), I have no quibbles concerning factual statements, artistic judgment or style.I hope that the next edition of Giant Steps boasts a far more attractive cover plus an index (crucial for those who'll use this book as a reference). And since readers will doubtless want to know something about Kenny Mathieson himself, how about a bio page?"},{"Title":"Giant Steps: Bebop and the Creators of Modern Jazz, 1945-65","review":"Much has been written about these folks. This books reminded me of why I enjoy this music so much. Well written and insightful."},{"Title":"Giant Steps: Bebop and the Creators of Modern Jazz, 1945-65","review":"The story of bebop has never been better told than is told here. This is an incomparably astute narration of the birth and development of modern Jazz.Using the musical biographies and many scintillating details about the eleven most prominent innovators and trail-blazers of the bebop era, mostly as a prop, the author takes us on a dizzying romp back to the creation and brings us forward in time to Jazz's heyday, and beyond.Since his main concern is with the music, the biographies are necessarily thin and are almost incidental to the story: important only to the extent they shed more light on the development of the music itself. Already knowing the biographies of these musicians \\"by heart,\\" the author's emphasis was exactly the emphasis I was looking for.What we get as a trade-off for thin and sometimes sketchy biographies -- but with lots of juicy and often irrelevant details -- is an in-depth look at the music of modern jazz itself. In the subtext, we discover the most important thing about the music there is to discover: why it was invented, and how it was made.It seems to have emerged, almost unforced out of the complex social and spiritual \\"ether\\" of the post-war era: directly from the shared (scarily symbiotic) collaborative and restless minds, energy and emotions of Diz and Bird: the \\"two-man vanguard\\" of America's reigning avant garde of the new \\"yet-to-be-named\\" movement.Bebop was the form that emerged from the collective disgust with \\"Jim Crow\\" and the growing boredom with \\"old musical forms.\\" The old musical forms, even those that \\"swung,\\" simply were no longer up to the task of handling the emotional demands, pressures and needs of the times. Something new had to emerge; something new was already in the air; Jazz had to happen.Modern Jazz thus was an organic development called up from the existential depths of angst and pathos of American black men of the times. The milieu was one in which deep musical training, vision and insight served as the backdrop, if not the launching pad for a leap into the artistic and aesthetic unknown. Without any discussions about where the journey ahead would land them, these pioneering aesthetic adventurers and explorers, were ready for the take-off when the times came calling.They came calling at Minton's in 1945 on 52nd street in New York city.Something new emerged out of the crucible of America's complex racial ether. \\"Good old music\\" and \\"old good music\\" was no longer \\"good enough.\\" It could and would be made \\"whole,\\" that is to say, it could and would be made better by enriching its harmonies with substitute chords (augmented, flatted, diminished, and raised, even twisted -- that is through reharmonization) and refreshing its melodies; and by giving it new rhythms (up-tempo, syncopated, behind and before the beat, anything but \\"two\\" and \\"four.\\")Make no mistakes about it, this was a heady intellectual, social and aesthetic high-wire act, and these eleven men were up to the task. [The book said nothing of the author's background, but you can bet I'll be looking for any other books on music he has written.] This is a mini-master piece.

I thought it was going to be more about the Olympic Games, but it turned out to be about every single member of the team & coaching staff instead. It took the entire book to review the game, and it was intermixed with bios and vignettes about so many people that it was quite confusing.This book actually made a hockey game drag and become somewhat boring."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"Who are these awesome athletes on and off the ice? This heart-warming and honest story makes me very proud that my country has produced citizens of such character and commitment. They were winners in hockey in1980, and they are winners in life now.

Game One was certainly a \\"flat atmosphere\\" and the building was not full. I had a discounted $10 ticket to two games, and the earlier matinee had been more entertaining, with a skilled Canadian team scoring goals against a Dutch team every few minutes. Who were these US guys? No one knew, or expected much. But when Bill Baker slapped home a last minute bullet to \\"win\\" a tie in that first game, a jolt of electricity leapt through everyone standing. These boys were suddenly in the tournament. THE BOYS OF WINTER takes the reader right back to the snowy streets of Lake Placid and puts the chill back in one's spine.The author surprises. This is not a run-of-the-mill sports book, or simple rehash of glory days. Coffey paces the story brilliantly, interlacing beautifully descriptive action from the medal game against the Soviets with stories of how the team was built, why players were selected, who they were, and fabulous background on where they came from. Oliver Ames High School in Massachusetts turned out Jimmy Craig? Who knew Minnesota was so huge or that the Christian brothers made hockey sticks 400 miles from the Twin Cities? It's amazing to learn that players' parents missed these games in Lake Placid, because they could not afford time off from teaching school, or hauling iron-ore on railroad cars to Great Lake ports. It's interesting to learn about the post-Olympic lives of the players, the success and the failures. It's a joy to wade through the ageless hockey names from the past -- from Cleary & Christian to Pavelich & Harrington to Kharlamov & Tretiak.THE BOYS OF WINTER is a fabulously well-researched history of this amazing moment in sports. Wayne Coffey's countless travels, interviews and memoirs paid wonderful dividends. I'd rate it ahead of the wonderful movie, which focuses on Coach Herb Brooks. TBOW puts the spotlight on all involved, including parents, trainers, ex-coaches, Russians, and most of all the players themselves. Get a copy today! As Badger Bob Johnson said, \\"It's a great day for hockey.\\""},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"Wayne Coffey's book on the 1980 United States Olympic hockey team is an outstanding book. He did a nice job of providing information about all the members of the famous squad. I also enjoyed the movie \\"Miracle,\\" although I felt that too much of the focus was on Boston University players while important members of the squad like defenseman Ken Morrow were marginalized. There was no such issue with Coffey's book. I felt that he gave prominent coverage to all the players on the team.Coffey was frank in his evaluations of the gold medal team. He was critical of the draconian approach that Herb Brooks sometimes used to motivate players. However, Brooks was able to gain the respect of his players. He played the bad cop while assistant coach Craig Patrick was the good cop to whom the players confided and expressed their concerns.Coffey treated the Soviet members of the team with fairness. He recognized that these were men trying to feed their families and were doing their jobs. They were unfairly cast as the villians by the media, although they had no influence on Soviet policies. Coffey made some insightful observations, such as the fact that the Soviet coach's decision to bench superstar goalie Tretiak was a disastrous move that sucked the energy out of the team.Coffey discusses the cultural impact that the upset victory had on a sagging American morale. The nation was hurting economically and getting embarrassed politically by the Iranian hostage situation. The stunning iconic win by the Olympic boys gave the nation a shot in the arm and showed them that there was hope and possibility that the future would be brighter. This was a terrifc book that was a delight to read."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"The Boys of Winter was a fantastic book. I am not usually into non-fiction, but this really interested me because I love hockey and have heard of the 1980 Olympic team. I love how Coffey went into it giving you a ton of background on the players themselves. It really made you look back at the players and where they started their life. I also loved how the book gave you play-by-play insight on the game against the Soviet Union. He molded the facts about the players perfectly into the game. Overall this was a phenomenal book that I would recommend to anybody!"},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"I was so excited to find this book on my recommendations. I downloaded it instantly and started reading immediately. While I LOVE Hockey, and Love Love Love the 1980 team, this is not what I expected.The way the book is pieced together it is very choppy to read and a little confusing. The author takes you through the russian game piece by piece, but when he is focusing on Buzz, you will go back into his childhood and it is very rambling. Good information, not well placed. You will find out about the town and growing up, and the socio economic issues the town had, not in a smooth telling, they will talk about the town then talk about how many people were laid off in 2003 and then back to Buzz as a child. Very disjointed. Then the when done with Buzz it goes back the game and picks up another player.Brooks is in here in chunks, and then back to game or player. This is one of my favorite stories, and I did like some insight from the Russian players; however, it was too difficult to get to the pertinent material. It felt like there was a lot of filler information that was not necessary or was so poorly placed it lost its importance in the jumble.I gave it the rating I did just because I LOVE this team, I was 9 years old and watching the Olympics with my parents and God parents in Lake Tahoe. I did like the author pointed out that people remember exactly where they were and that is rare for something good, usually you remember that for major tragedies, like 9/11, The Challenger explosion etc.If you are wild about this story and willing to wade through this to get information it is ok. If you are hoping for an easy enjoyable read I would pass."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"I have been making my way through this book for the past month and a half. It's a very quick read, but I had set it aside as my \\"reward\\" for when I finished a hard week of writing papers. I became like an addict, pulling the book out for a quick fix while waiting for a class to start. This book truly was a delight to read.I love reading non-fiction because, well, it's real. And when things work out for the better, you're really happy for that person. But the beauty of non-fiction, and especially this book, is that they don't just show the good parts of the story. This book beautifully showed that life is hard. From the mini-biographies of each player to the description of how hard these players had to win the gold, Wayne Coffey doesn't sugar coat a thing.Coffey is an artist using words to create a masterpiece. Many times, his descriptions seemed like poetry. I was thoroughly impressed that there was an artistry to a sports book at all. The fact that it didn't detract from the story at all elevates that accomplishment to an even higher level.So, would I recommend this book to someone? Heck yes! And if someone was on the fence about reading it, I might just follow them around reading it out loud to them. It's that good."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"Such a great book!

Great book about a key moment in sports and our nation's history."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"Though they were a group of young, no-named amateurs who came from nowhere to win the gold medal over Finland in the 1980 Olympics, the U.S. hockey team was loaded with Midwest and East Coast talent and well prepared prior to competition. In fact, far from just being thrown together and told to play, enigmatic coach Herb Brooks took the team on a grueling 61-game schedule through Europe prior to the Olympics, and the squad faced off against a few NHL teams for good measure. So though the Americans weren't seasoned professionals like the Russian team they beat in the Olympic semifinals on Feb. 22, 1980, Brooks' team was finely honed, competitive and extremely well conditioned by that point. Thirteen U.S.A. squad members went on to play in the NHL, paving the way for future Americans to get drafted in the league during a time when Canadian players mostly ruled it.Told in a straightforward, no-frills manner, Wayne Coffey's \\"The Boys of Winter\\" is a compelling read, especially the portions that focus on Coach Brooks and life in 1980, a simpler time in some respects compared to today. As Coffey aptly mentions, this was before the days that corporate sponsorship, drug testing, judging scandals, self-proclaimed \\"dream teams\\" and an overall glamorous, corporate vibe pervaded at the Olympics. Held in remote Lake Placid in upstate New York, the \`80 Olympics are now know as the \\"last of the small games.\\" Some of the athletes and coaches felt the Lake Placid venues had a \\"grade school\\" atmosphere, and one U.S. hockey player was shocked at the crowd's ultra-quiet manner in the half-empty arena during the team's first Olympic game.But as the squad got closer to its ultimate quest for gold, all that changed. As has been documented ad nauseam, the gold-medal-winning U.S. Olympic hockey team gave Americans something to feel joyous about during a bleak period in the country's history. A deep recession, high inflation, long lines at gas stations and a major international conflict with Iran had people feeling down. Interestingly, for all the mind games he used to motivate his players, Brooks steered clear of using politics to get his team going. Instead, he chose to implement innovative strategies to compete with the high-flying Russian hockey team, things that lesser coaches would have shunned.An excellent judge of character and talent, Coach Brooks, who sadly died in a car wreck in 2003, was one of a kind. He taught new-age ideas on the ice but had an old-school, obstinate style of coaching; he coached with an iron fist but encouraged his players to be creative on ice; few coaches in history have worked their players harder than Brooks in practice, yet he gave them free reign off the ice and had no team curfew. His contradictory and sometimes complicated and aloof manner rubbed some people the wrong way, but Brooks' coaching skills cannot be denied. Along with the illustrious \`80 gold medal on his resume, he also coached the University of Minnesota to three national titles, and he had some success in the NHL later. In the hockey world, Brooks is a legend.Overall, the U.S. hockey team in 1980 were a tough, intense bunch of guys who lived and breathed for their sport. They were cocky as a whole -- some in-your-face attitude is likely a prerequisite to win a gold medal -- but their manner was also down-to-earth and their goal pure -- simply to win for the country they loved. Like the movieMiracle (Widescreen Edition), Coffey does a good job of giving this somewhat faceless team a new life and energy, interspersing player bios with on-the-spot action from the U.S.-Russia game that takes some hockey knowledge and can border on tedious at times. Nonetheless, \\"The Boys of Winter\\" is ultimately very inspirational, and its common theme of enjoying present achievements but moving on with your life is excellent advice for anybody."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"Wayne Coffey has been writing great stories about sports for years with the New York Daily News. But his work is not just sports writing. He uses sports as a portal into the things that matter for everyone -- family, work, faith, struggle, overcoming. And that's why this us such a great book. If this was just another sports book, I wouldn't be interested. I'm not much of a hockey fan (I was not very disturbed when thge NHL canceled its season a year ago). Coffey looks at not only how the team won -- how trhe maniac Herb Brooks manipulated and drove his players -- but a larger story about what happens to people when something huge happens to them. Like Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer, this book probes deep into the lives and passions, the triumphs and losses, of one of the most improbable teams in American sports history."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"I remember watching the games on televison when I was just about the age of the players. Thus the book brought back fond memories and (for me) did so in a well written narrative fashion. To me it is a good read for those who are interested in \\"David and Goliath\\" type events, have an interest in history, the Olympics, or hockey in general.The only complaints (which I hope will be corrected in future editions) is that as a non-hockey follower, a lot of the terms or actions as described in the book meant nothing to me (i.e. among other things, where is a blue line and what is it's signifigance?). so I think a glossary of hockey terminology would be of benefit for those who do not follow the sport that much.The other complaint is that the author did not include enough pictures of the team members in the photo section. There were twenty men on that team, and most had a section written about them in the narrative, but only about a third had their photographs (either still or action) in that section.But overall the book is worth a read."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"While I always thought I knew the story and the mythology of the Olympic Hockey Team for the first team everyone involved with it was treated as a human being. Even with all the human foibles that the author describes everyone comes across as even greater. You realize how great the US team was. In addition the Soviets are seen as human beings not the monolithic communists that have been previously portrayed. After reading the book you come away with a love of hockey.Even if you think you know all about the Olympic Hockey Miracle, Think Again."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"If you think you know the story of the upstart 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team, think again. It's clear from this expertly told account that Coffey has traveled great distances and put in a tremendous amount of legwork to research the behind-the-scenes, gripping details that make this celebrated story all the more remarkable. Coffey is as gifted a writer as he is a reporter, and the result of his labors provides us with an exciting and intimate look at the \\"Miracle on Ice\\" that should appeal to, and captivate, all readers--event those who don't normally consider themselves sports fans. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"The really helped me understand what happened with players during the 1980 Miracle on Ice.

A must read for hockey fans."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"Anyone who fondly remembers the \\"Miracle On Ice\\" will find this book to be an enjoyable walk down memory lane of the greatest sports event in the history of the United States. The author's unique storytelling intertwines the play-by-play of the semi-final game between the USA and USSR with the individual stories of the game's major \\"characters.\\"The story of the game and circumstances surrounding that time in US history has been told so many times, that many of the tales in the book are familiar but the author keeps it interesting. He also provides more insight into the Soviet team and its background than I've ever previously encountered. The only dissapointment for me was the lack of attention to the other games that the United States played during its Olympic run."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"Celebrity bios are something that my mom lives for, but if it's hockey (and figure skating for that matter) polar bears couldn't keep me away. I was glad that Coffey put out this blunt and artistically written piece defining \\"the greatest moment in sports history\\" because the Miracle HBO documentary left me flat (just under an hour but had great classic clips of the '80 team's tourney tour) and Disney's Miracle was heartwarming but left out the nitty-gritty (and by that I mean UGLY) of what these guys had to endure to SURVIVE on Herbie's team let alone make the cut. Coffey's prose style was especially impressive splicing together each player's background and the US-USSR game's play-by-play as if the actors in Miracle were having flashbacks (hope you're reading this O'Connor!) during the game.The book's foreword was written by none other than #30 himself, the Golden Goalie, Jimmy Craig. Now I've read a few articles (that I could find) on Jim back in his hockey heyday (including the SI issue where he was featured on the cover) and judging by the tone of his interviews Coffey was right on the money about his complexity and uncensored opines, but he seemed pretty shy. On the other hand, the team's on-ice chatterbox certainly grew into that role (judging by the guy's website advertising his corporate motivational speaking tours) off the ice since his NHL life turned out to be one of those celeb morality tales. Whatta salesman- and he became one after retirement. But it was nice to hear from the flip side, Craig's Minnesotan counterpart, #1 and the answer to a trivia question, Steve Janaszak. This bond salesman who became a Long Island transplant turns out to be cool as a cucumber over the fact he got NO ice time during the Olys and very little game time overall for that season, despite being MVP the season prior when Minnesota U won the '79 NCAA. The saddest account was #15 Mark Wells, his was a true Cinderella story battling a crippling back injury, a failed business, and pain killer addiction after winning the gold. As for the Charlestown native growing up rough in an all-Irish 'hood, #17 Jack O'Callahan proved himself to be the badass (and then some) for Brooks, the Blackhawks, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. And if you're wondering why #16 Mark Pavelich was a no-show for the '02 Olys (and ironically he has the most decorated NHL career out of the group) the story of a hunting trip with his best friend gone horrifically wrong might provide some illumination.Those are just a few of the stories, take them to heart as this book makes them real people and that's what fueled mythos of the Miracle Team. Also, you can't help but NOT hate the Russians. Yes those evil Commie Reds (BTW communism is a bunch of crap or Cuba and to a SEVERELY lesser extent North Korea would be paradises) are human too with foibles, families, and a crazy coach that looks like a chicken. Stan Laurel- I mean Boris Mikhailov, pfft! You can't beat that guy? Pfft!"},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"I picked this book up on a whim because it looked interesting and I'm glad I did, it has to be one of my favorite books I've read in the past few years. I quickly finished it and it definitely deserves 5 stars. The book is very well written with the game versus the russians interspersed with mini-biographies of the members of the U.S. team. You really develop an emotional connection with the individual members. While the movie \\"Miracle\\" is great it missed so much about the history of the players, which this book excells at. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"The book mainly covers the U.S. hockey team's amazing upset of the powerful USSR team, but also provides the background story of just about everybody involved. I'll never forget that game, and reading about it brought back the excitement of that night. I found myself almost cheering outloud when I read about the great plays.There will never be another Olympic story like this, because now the games are dominated by pro teams. We have \\"dream teams\\" instead of teams full of kids who would dream of doing what just about everybody thought was impossible.The background stories are great and give you a better understanding of what was going on in and before the games to get these guys to the point where they were able to pull off this amazing run.I don't know of any hockey fan who wouldn't like this book."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"Gave this book to my husband for his birthday he read it in 2 days.

This book takes you back to that special time, that could be considered a turning point for US/USSR relations. After reading the book, I bought 2 DVDs. The movie about the game and the HBO documentary on the same subject.

Still feel the excitement. Still remember where I was, on the day a group of little known athletes beat the worlds best to move on to the gold medal game.Mr. Coffey does a good job of bringing those moments back, although his concentration is soley on the one game itself.A nice glimpse into those involved....both prior, during and since that momentous night (afternoon).I enjoyed his job of retelling the event, although I have to admit, I popped \\"Miracle\\" into the DVD player about half way through the book in order to get a quick fix.All in all.....a quick read and a nice way to bring those memories back to the surface."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"More than just an underdog-achieves-greatness story, this book is a revealing look at the elements that went into that incredible victory in Lake Placid. Little is glossed over, and both Herb Brooks and several players are examined in detail. Brooks is not portrayed as a saint, but his genius in creating a team and a system to win gold shines through.The Russians are not treated as a bunch of villains, but instead are shown to be just as human as the American boys. The political climate of the time obviously made the victory that much sweeter, and Coffey does an excellent job of setting the victory against that backdrop.As a hockey fan, it's difficult to think of a greater moment than watching the players and crowd go crazy as those final seconds ticked away - for many of us, it still gives us chills 25 years later. This book does a wonderful job of honoring one of the great moments in American sports history."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"I was 18, almost 19, years old that night in February 1980. I was a freshman in college, only a handful of years younger than the talented young men who donned the sweaters of the USA to play in the Lake Placid Olympics. It would be hard to imagine a time when morale was lower, and people felt more negatively about being an American--it was the Carter administration, interest rates were 21%, the Iranian hostage crisis was in full disaster mode, and the Soviets had just invaded Afghanistan. I grew up 65 miles from Three Mile Island, and the accident there had occurred two days after my 18th birthday in March 1979, and nobody knew whether the accident there would have long-term negative effects. Relations with the Soviets were at their nadir, the Cold War was at its height, and I remembered that things in this country were at about their lowest point possible.And then a miracle occurred.Herb Brooks and his team of unknown college kids beat the greatest hockey team in the world, perhaps in history. I will never forget--as long as I live--hearing Al Michaels cry out, \\"Do you believe in miracles? Yes!\\" as time ran out, and seeing the bedlam when the U.S. boys realized what they had accomplished. At that moment, it was okay to be an American again. I think that the resurgence of the Reagan years actually began that night in Lake Placid. It certainly marked the height of amateur hockey in the Olympics--the whole concept of \\"Dream Teams\\" was not even yet on the drawing board.Wayne Coffey has written the definitive book on the Miracle game. It covers the action on the ice in minute detail while also telling us just who these unknown college kids--and their sphinx-like coach--were. Coffey tells us what has happened to these 20 men since their miracle, and discusses the travails and accomplishments, ranging from Mark Wells, who has faced nothing but adversity and illness, to men like Mark Pavelich, a great player who remains as enigmatic today as he was then.For those who remember that night, or those who want to know more about it, there are two things I can recommend--the 2003 movie Miracle, where Kurt Russell BECAME Herbie Brooks--and this book. It's a quick, easy read by a master of sportswriting craft, and I can't imagine anything ever topping this book. The tragedy, of course, is that Herb Brooks died in a car accident in the summer of 2003, and never got to see either Russell's wonderful portrayal of him, or the reunion of his boys at Salt Lake City--now older, fatter, and grayer--when they lit the Olympic flame and re-captured the joy of their miracle moment.Buy it. Read it. Cherish the memories. And remember the greatest moment in the history of sports when a bunch of unknown college kids beat the best team on earth."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"Given that I was born in June of 1980 - some 4 months after the greatest sports moment of the last 25 years - I have had to rely 100 percent on documentaries, articles and movies to truly understand how important this event really was. My father, who has everything from DVDs to framed artwork commemorating the game, still talks about the event today as if it just happened.But, even the movie Miracle, which came out last year and is No. 1 on my all-time sports movie list, didn't do for me what this book does.What history has told us again and again over the last 25 years is how special this victory was because of the fact that it was a bunch of college players who were virtually unheard of taking down a Soviet powerhouse made up of solid veterans. However, what nobody has attempted to do was tell us the story of who these 20 young men really were. Until now.Wayne Coffey takes us through - not only the game minute-by-minute, period-by-period, but also he tells the story of the players. Who they were. Where they came from. Where they are now. He does a marvelous job of breaking down the book and weaving in and out between past and present. With such in depth analysis, you would think it would be hard to follow, but Coffey's gift for story telling makes it easy to get through. There are some books that once you finish you feel kind of dissapointed - not because you didn't enjoy the book, but because you enjoyed it so much you are going to miss it. This is true of this one.After you're done, you feel as if you know the team personally, as if you were the 21st member in Lake Placid, along side Pavelich, O'Callahan, Harrington, Suter, Craig, Eruzione, McClanahan, Johnson and even the legendary late coach himself, Herb Brooks.This one is a real page-turner from start to finish. The book brings those like my father right back to a time in history that will never again be revisited and for people my age, it brings us to a time that we wish we could have experienced first hand. Obviously, we will never be able to go back. But this is the next best thing."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"Wayne Coffey is a wonderful sportswriter for the NY Daily News, so seeing his name on this book gave me every reason to believe I would like it. I was right.A huge amount has been written and done about this team. There was a full-length movie, an outstanding HBO documentary and a made-for-TV movie (Karl Malden as Herb Brooks).This book fills a lot of the gaps and gives a lot of insight into the individuals. I especially appreciated that Coffey interviewed many of the Russians, his sections on Tarasov and Tikhinov are fascinating.Unlike Mr. Barat, I was able to follow the narrative of the book, it did not bounce around too much for me.And while I would have preferred more coverage on the other games the team played, before and during the Olympics, that is a mild quibble.The biggest gotcha in the book is when it talks about the game that the US played against the USSR two weeks before the Olympics. That game was won by the USSR 10-3 and it wasn't that close. Other sources said that both teams were trying 100%. Coffey believes that Brooks held back the US team a lot, not wanting to show his hand to them.I rarely give 5 stars to a book, this one deserves them."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"On the fateful night of 22 February 1980, I was 12 yrs old and witnessed the best event on tv or otherwise that I had *ever* seen or have seen since. The game against the Russians and ensuing victory forever changed my life. I have been both a hockey fan since and I most assuredly *do* believe in miracles. I was too young to appreciate the world events that kept the mood in the country downtrodden but I will always remember that game if only for the tremendously motivating story that it is. It's not possible to capture an intangible like hope, however Coffey's book certainly accomplishes precisely that. If you never read another sports based book, this one will be all that you'll ever need. Now if I can just find a VHS copy of the 13th Winter Olypic Games that features the game in question so I can burn the game to DVD to have forever more."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"Curiously, though the event has rated an HBO documentary, a made-for-TV movie, and a full-blown theatrical retelling, the complete story of the \\"Miracle on Ice\\" has never been put between covers in a real, live book (as opposed to a tome of the \\"instant paperback\\" variety). Unfortunately, it still hasn't. Coffey does a good enough job of telling the only story that people seem to care about anymore - the February 22, 1980, shocker that the U.S. hockey team pulled off against the unbeatable Soviets - but he reproduces each and every hockey movement of the game to such an excruciating degree that it's all the harder to forgive him for paying scant attention to the rest of the games that the Americans played to cop the gold. The interstitital mini-biographies of the various players and Coach Herb Brooks (whose 2003 funeral following a fatal car crash serves as the book's curtain-raiser) break the game narrative up to the point that the book is a bit confusing to read. It's an OK effort, but \\"Do You Believe in Miracles?\\" (the HBO documentary) and \\"Miracle\\" (the Disney feature flick) remain the best reminiscences of this epochal moment in sports history."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"I remember the day well back in 1980. My Pee Wee hockey team traveled to Toronto from Detroit that Friday for a tournament that weekend. When we arrived, all the parents that made the trip and us kids all watched the game in the hotel bar. After all the excitement from seeing USA beating Russian, the parents went crazy and some cried and hugged each other. Me and my hockey teammates were just kids and really didn't understand the significance of the game, but definitely wanted USA to win. From the time I was a Mite to my last year in Juniors, hockey was my life as it was for a lot of kids that grew up playing hockey.That following summer in 1980, I attended West Suburban Hockey Camp in Michigan which was owned and operated by the now infamous Bob Goodenow. Mark Wells, who played on the 1980 Olympic Hockey Team, was one of the instructors at the camp. It was awesome having the chance to be coached and taught hockey skills by Mark Wells. He was a very good instructor and some the fake and deke techniques he taught me helped me out as much as anything I ever learned from any hockey coach or instructor. Myself and other players at the camp were in awe of Mark Wells because he was just so powerful, fast and talented on the ice and a super nice guy as well.When I read the part about Mark Wells in the book, I became a little emotional. I was sorry to hear about the struggles he has had over the years. After the movie \\"Miracle\\" came out, it got me thinking of what happened to Mark and to find out that he has had some difficulties in life were a surprise to me. I am happy to hear that Mark is doing well, moving forward and enjoying life now.Hockey is unlike any other sport. The amount of time and money that the parents of young amateur hockey players put into their kids is huge, far beyond other major sports. All the traveling including many weekends of overnight travel, late night games and practices, buying new skates and equipment every year because kids are constantly growing out of them, the cost of ice time and giving much if not all of their own time just to let their kids to play hockey...and these parents wouldn't have it any other way.You don't have to be an ex hockey player or even a real hockey fan to enjoy this book. Wayne Coffee does a great job telling the reader just what the players on the 1980 USA team gave up and then gained as hockey players and as people in achieving the unimaginable for their country."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"I reommend The Boys of Winter for you to read. It is a great story of the 1980 hockey team.The goalie on the team, Jim Craig, tells the story. It is from his perspective. So he also tells you what it was like behind the mask.There are a lot of flashblacks in the book. Herb Brooks died in 2003, so his funeral is also included . It also goes into the lockerroom to see what life was like in there. It is a great story and I definitely recommend it for you to read."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"Mr. Coffey invested two years of his life into this book, and the result is a lovingly crafted account of this now legendary hockey team and their enigmatic coach.A great book for sports fans of any persuasion, Mr. Coffey's play-by-play retelling of the instantly famous game is expertly woven with the stories of the players themselves. What continues to fascinate and inspire is how the the exceptional, daresay miraculous, seemingly exploded from such ordinariness and anonymity. (I suppose there is hope for me yet!)To those considering the very worthwhile purchase of this book, and to those who may already have enjoyed it, I would also recommend \\"Home Ice\\" by Jack Falla. Mr. Falla's book dovetails nicely with the recurrent themes of love, family, and integrity found in \\"The Boys of Winter.\\" And for those fortunate enough to live in colder climates, there is even a bonus chapter complete with instructions for building your own backdoor rink.Finally, a comment for anyone who may have wondered just how much poetic license may have been taken in the production of Disney's film \\"Miracle.\\" Based on a comparison to Mr. Coffey's extensively researched account, the answer is very little. How encouraging that such an extraordinary and uplifitng event was perfectly scripted the moment it unfolded before our eyes, without need of exaggeration or mythologizing. Enjoy the movie, guilt-free!"},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"I just finished reading Wayne Coffey's book \\"The Boys of Winter\\" and old memories came back,as I was at that game on February 22-1980 in Lake Placid.

If you enjoyed the motion picture \\"Miracle\\", you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"This is the first book that I've read that was written by Wayne Coffey. His writing is original, crisp and full of interesting details about the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team.He juxaposes the life stories (then, since then and now) of the U.S. players into three periods of the semifinal win over the Soviet Union. I give him credit for bravely deciding that this kind of format could work. For the most part, he pulls it off. But his narration of the game, and his tale, seemed to slow down in some places, especially in the second period.Still, I skated on. I did so because my curiosity was fed: What was it like for those players as individuals in 1980 and what became of their lives here in the first decade of the 21st century? Coffey satisfied my appetite and I believe any bloke who follows hockey with soft, mild or rabid interest would find this work worthy.The 4-3 over the Soviets was not so much a miracle as it was a carefully planned ambush, brilliantly executed by coach Herb Brooks and 20 focused players who were in the best shape of their lives. The 1980 Olympic Winter Games were seminal for U.S. hockey players; those Olympics were a door-opener for hundreds of future U.S. players who played in the National Hockey League.Coffey, like all good writers, spices up his tale with curious and charming details. There is opinion and recollection by some members of that 1980 Soviet team, too. That added to the depth of the book.Mr. Coffey worked hard to find and visit members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team. He matches his diligent footwork with fine writing. This book is worth your money and reading attention."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"I'm a sports fanatic, and I read a lot of sports books. The ones I like the best are those that show how an underdog triumphed over the heavy favorite--David vs Goliath. Well, this is that kind of story, and the author does a GREAT job of telling it. My heart's pounding right now just thinking of his account of that final game. I didn't read it all in one sitting--hey, I've got a life, a family, and a job, so I can't sit around reading all day like a professional reviewer--but I would have if I could have, because it's very, very absorbing. You start reading this book and you won't want to stop, regardless of whether you're a hockey fan or not. I'm not much of one, but it didn't matter. The story and the characters are so vividly rendered that you care about them (even the Russians, who weren't really bad guys), and that's the mark of good writing.I've recommended this book to anyone I know who loves a good, inspiring sports story.

To tell this story properly the book should be in the 400-500 page range. I wanted to know more about the American players, the ones who brought home the gold as well as those who, like Her Brooks in 1960, were among the last cuts. What were their feelings after \\"The Miracle\\" knowing that they had been that close to being a part of it. I wanted to know more about Brooks himself. His relationship with his wife and kids, did he ever get tired of talking about the 1980 games? I wanted to know more about the Russian players. Is the loss still talked about in Russia? How long did it take the players and hockey in the Soviet Union to get over the upset?All of these subjects were touched upon, but that's the point--they were only touched upon and nothing was delved into completely so as to peel away layers of a more interesting story.The 1980 U.S. hockey team is one of my favorite subjects. I found the team back then, and still find their achievement today, a tremendous source of inspiration. I just didn't learn very much new about them in this book."},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: The Untold Story of a Coach, a Dream, and the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team","review":"An excellent book for the hockey nut you may know.

But Wayne Coffey made this book exciting, interesting, and so enjoyable to read (and I thank him for not using too many hard-to-understand words!). I loved reading all of the players' individual stories, and even though I only recently got into hockey after seeing Miracle, I was able to follow the game descriptions as well.

The chapters are very short, and the language is accessible to the mind of a twelve-year-old. Doyle includes a fair amount of humor and a tinge of romance, but leaves the latter as a tantalizing backdrop to the entire story. Examples of character sketches and humorous anecdotes abound within the unfolding story, keeping the reader wondering just how strange this little town really is!Also available in paperback: Scholastic Books."},{"Title":"Roman Law in Context (Key Themes in Ancient History)","review":"Johnston's book is basically organized into three sections, thought there is no mention of this structure in the table of contents. The first section introduces the reader to the sources of Roman law (how the law was made, and who made it). The second section discusses the substantive law of family, property, and contracts. The third section discusses litigation (or how the laws discussed in section two worked in practice). At the end of the book, there is a very good glossary of Roman legal terms, followed by an extremely helpful discussion of the Roman legal literature for the serious student of Roman Law to pursue.Johnston's book does a great job of packing a lot of information into very few pages, but often at the expense of several rereads by the reader. The information is accurate and well-researched, thought it could have been presented better (see next paragraph). However, whether you're new to Roman law, or have studied the subject in depth, you will come away with a better grasp of Rome's legal system, her institutions, and her laws.Now, for the criticism. I believe that Johnston's book would have been much better if he would have followed his discussion of the sources of Roman law (section I) with the section on litigation (section III, which discusses how the law operated in practice), followed then by a discussion of the substantive law. Johnston's organization, by not doing this, presented the reader with an entire book of disparate and seemingly disjunctive technical material without a mechanism for synthesizing it until the reader reached Johnston's last chapter on litigation. This was the chapter that tied everything together, and it should have been discussed earlier. Only upon reading this last chapter did I finally understood why everything Johnston had told me before was important, and because of this, it looks like I'll be reading this book again to fully appreciate the impact of the previous chapters.Therefore, I would recommend reading chapter one, then the last chapter, and then the material on the substantive law following the first chapter. Doing so, I guarantee, will save you a lot of head scratching and will enable you to appreciate this book, which is otherwise very good.Personally, while this book is accessible to the beginner, I would recommend that a reader unfamiliar with Roman law begin with Nicholas' &quot;An Introduction to Roman Law&quot; or Crook's &quot;Law and Life of Rome,&quot; both of which are excellent and will better prepare you for Johnston's book."},{"Title":"Roman Law in Context (Key Themes in Ancient History)","review":"It is hard to imagine a better introduction to the grand world of Roman law and legal history.

The bad news is that the book stays narrowly focused on technical legal doctrines, only sketching the law's social and political context. Bottomline: this is a great book for someone, perhaps a law student or non-legal historian of Rome, who wants a quick guide to Roman legal rules.

It is appears very hard for the authors to know at what level to pitch the information - should details of practical procedures be included? What about the basic science? What about history taking and clinical examination? None of the books seem to get the formula quite right and students dip into their meagre bank accounts in order to buy slightly inadequate texts. It will come as a surprise, then, to find that there is a book which makes it all look easy. Essentials of Surgery has the formula cracked. It almost exudes authority and relaxes in the knowledge that it is delivering exactly what is required. The first half of the book deals with the basic science behind surgical diseases, from cellular biology right through to transplant immunology. The reader's journey through the book is clearly sign-posted at all times and the copious diagrams and tables ensure that even the most complex arguments are rendered rational and lucid. The second part of the book deals with surgical practice and is divided according to body systems. Each section begins with the anatomy, physiology and embryology of the system in question and follows with diseases of that system. At all times, the reader is introduced to the clinical features, diagnosis, investigations and management of each disease. There are even brief descriptions of the surgical procedures enabling the student to impress their consultant and know what is happening when they see the operation in theatre. Despite the monochrome diagrams, this is not the cheapest of books available to students and certainly would not fit into the beloved white coat pocket but when the \\"information delivered versus cost\\" equation is considered, there can be no doubt that Essentials of Surgery comes out very much on top. Admittedly, this book may not be everyone's cup of tea and there are many books that deliver less information in a slightly more edible form. However, I believe that any medical student who is serious about learning surgery would be foolish to buy any other text."},{"Title":"Essentials of Surgery: Scientific Principles and Practice","review":"perfect manual to review didactic approaches in general surgery.a good lecture for surgical residents preparing basic exam.as it has been published in 1997 it isnt a great reference for laparoscopy and bio-genetics"},{"Title":"Jesus Christ : heir to the astronauts","review":"If you are fan of Eric Van Daniken then you may like this.

In fact, except for correction of \\"obvious printing errors,\\" it reproduces the 1941 Shanghai edition of a book published in Peking (Beijing) in 1931 as \\"Outlines of Chinese Symbolism,\\" and previously revised in 1932. The full title of Williams' final version is \\"Outlines of Chinese Symbolism and Art Motives: an alphabetical compendium of antique legends and beliefs, as reflected in the manners and customs of the Chinese.\\" As reproduced by Dover Publications in 1976, with 401 illustrations (including color plates on the inside covers), it is an extremely attractive volume, packed with information, and reasonably well arranged. It looks like everything an ordinary curious reader could want; and I have found nothing quite comparable to it, at least in English, although there are now excellent studies of particular symbols and concepts. (Eberhard's \\"Dictionary of Chinese Symbols\\" has a different focus.) It is still cited in reputable works by professional Sinologists, along with Williams' \\"Manual of Chinese Metaphor\\" (1920).There are other reprintings besides that by Dover; it also appears in hardcover and paperback editions as \\"Chinese Symbolism and Art Motifs\\" (note the modernized spelling), and \\"Encyclopedia of Chinese symbolism and art motives.\\" There may be some other variations on the title that I have missed.Under any title, it should, however, be used with caution; a useful resource to someone with the necessary background can be a snare for the rest of us. Described by Dover as the \\"work of a scholarly English resident of China,\\" it does not seem to reflect professional skills as a Sinologist, and frequently reports information at second or third hand, some of it already antiquated in 1921. Williams' own observations are interesting, but largely restricted to North China, mainly Peking and its vicinity (to Williams, very properly for the time, Peiping), and various Western enclaves on the coast. It is to Williams' credit, however, that he at least tries to include some Chinese popular culture, rather than just the idealized official versions. It is a reflection of the time that he actually rather apologizes for including Buddhist (therefore \\"foreign\\") and Taoist (to the elite as well as the missionaries, \\"superstitious\\") as well as Confucian symbols and concepts.Those who have read much about China will soon notice that the transliterations are inconsistent, and sometimes very odd, at times corresponding to no system that is readily apparent. This is particularly common in Williams' quotations from his sources. I suspect that a mixture of the use of spoken vernaculars and \\"classical\\" pronunciation in those sources, alongside differing transliteration systems themselves, is responsible; Williams doesn't seem to have made a clear statement of his approach to this problem (or I missed it). Apparently he used the Wade-Giles himself, but didn't try to impose it on quotations. In a world of books then already littered with German, French, Dutch, English, and other systems for alphabetical renderings of Chinese, and now with the continuing use of the old Wade-Giles system alongside the \\"official\\" Pinyin, both with variants, this is a real nuisance, although usually not more than that. (It would be nice if, in some future edition, a qualified person supplied current Romanized renderings for the Chinese characters; and possibly the modern, simplified form; but it doesn't seem likely.)More serious is Williams' sometimes free-and-easy use of materials without, apparently, checking their ultimate origin, so that his impressive citations can't always be taken at face value. (In addition, his references to nineteenth-century academic journals are of little practical help today, although inevitable when the book was first published.) In one extreme case, the result is rather amusing. Williams mentions that the standard version of the \\"Willow Pattern\\" design on porcelain was invented in England in the eighteenth century, and copied for the foreign market by Chinese manufacturers. But he then reproduces a long, romantic, story explaining it, without making it quite clear that the story is also a Western concoction, containing only a few Chinese elements, which he does identify. This leaves the impression that it is, at whatever remove, and however freely, translated from a Chinese source. Robert H. van Gulik, diplomat, scholar, and novelist, later incorporated the outlines of the tale into his Judge Dee mystery, \\"The Willow Pattern,\\" explaining the situation in a Postscript, which cites Williams as a readily available source for the story. The Chinese translation of his novel, he pointed out, would introduce the supposedly Chinese story to the Chinese language....Wherever there is overlap in coverage, I try to check Williams against Wolfram Eberhard's \\"A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols,\\" which, among its other merits, often mentions whether a particular concept is common Chinese, regional, local, or associated mainly with minority cultures; an issue often ignored by Williams and his sources, including missionaries and merchants who took the groups they were working with as perfect representatives of Chinese culture. Of course, the same problem was found among serious scholars, who often described everything about the better-educated Chinese they came in contact with as \\"typical\\" until told that it wasn't; and tended to regard it at as in any case more genuine than the beliefs of the vast majority of Chinese. Williams' industry was admirable; one wishes the product of it had gone through further revision."},{"Title":"Outlines of Chinese Symbolism and Art Motives (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)","review":"As with the previous reviewer, this was also one of the first in my collection.

After of a two-page explanation of a task we are about to perform, Mojica writes, \\"I hope this doesn't sound too complicated.\\" You hope wrong.Jose Mojica and his editor need some tutorials themselves in how to skill-build through programming examples. \\"Disjointed\\" is truly an appropriate adjective to describe this book, the biggest disappointment of all the Visual Quickstarts I own. This book is like a tour bus zig-zagging across the country without stopping long enough to get a good view of anything.I am currently reading this book cover-to-cover and have been programming C#/ASP.NET Web Parts for over a year. I bought it almost two years ago to learn ASP.NET from scratch but immediately shelved it when I got completely overwhelmed by Mojica's needlessly complex samples and multiple unrelated code snippets. Now that I've got some C# behind me I can finally understand what he is saying, and he is filling in some learning gaps well, but overall what's the point?Most new programmers (especially transitioning ASP programmers) just want to make simple web pages that process button clicks and handle events. Instead of keeping the examples elementary, Mojica seeks every opportunity to \\"kick it up a notch\\" by covering topics newbies simply won't need immediately, if ever. Peachpit thinks this makes the book good for reference, but I've tried using it for quick reference in the past and got completely lost because some code samples tie back to a project begun at the beginning of the chapter and some are just cute, imaginary projects. Prior skills are rarely reiterated, and this makes it hard to jump into the middle of the book.Ironically, Mojica's best programming example is one the reader never even gets to code. To explain inheritance, abstract classes and overridable methods, he does a great job creating a Bank class creating Savings and Checking objects which derive from a class called Account. This example is developed well through multiple chapters and truly says a lot with very little code, yet we never put hand to keyboard to write the program. Why couldn't we have created this one example throughout the whole book?I have taught courses in Windows, Office and HTML to many a newbie, and if someone wanted to learn ASP.NET or even OO I would steer him away from this book.

Larger-scale insets describe difficult or confusing sections of the routes. The route descriptions lend themselves to photocopying (and laminating for waterproofness) for easy reference whilst in the canoe.Hap guides the canoeist through tricky spots in lakes, gives sane warnings where trouble can lurk, and advises the reader on the safest way to navigate rapids: if Hap says, &quot;DO NOT RUN!&quot; this rapid, you'd be crazy to try. This book has a very nice how-to section on canoeing and canoe-camping, and sound advice on what and what not to bring with you. He discusses paddling techniques and demonstrates how and when you use themAlthough the routes he describes change but little over the years, some inaccuracies have crept in, due largely to natural changes in topography. Rivers change their appearance, water levels alter rapids, beaver dams come and go, and some campsites have disappeared while others have been made since Hap gathered his information. &quot;Temagami Canoe Routes&quot; should have a mechanism to permit fellow trippers the opportunity to contribute their observations on the conditions of the routes, and have them incorporated into future revisions.

My favorite TPB so far has been the second (Lust for Life), because the first has that new-comic unevenness and the third and fourth had a little too much pointless vulgarity for my taste. But this fifth one really impressed me. Like the others, it's grim, bitter, and funny, and Spider says utterly disgusting and shocking things in that sardonic way that makes him fascinating. But the graphic novel also takes up the issue of the human condition again, makes you remember that the reason Spider is fascinating is that he's not -just- a rat bastard -- he actually cares about the state of the world, and is equally sensitized to both its beauty and its horror. Spider has learned, essentially, that the best way to pursue the truth and fight the Man is to be an evil ****.

Not sure who would act as Spider either (Johnny Depp? Credit where it's due, the man acted very well as Hunter S Thompson in Fear and loathing in Las Vegas)...for some reason, when I read this comic I keep imagining his voice having an english accent. Maybe that's because I read what Patrick Stuart had to say about the comic. Always kind of intrigued me that I could never quite figure Spider out. While reading, I would try to imagine what would happen next, something I've become fairly good at as I continue to fill my head with as much fiction as possible, but with Spider, I never guess right. The bastard really is insane, and never does what's expected of him. Entertainment at its best! I forcefully recommend this series to anyone and everyone I meet. Heaven help them if they show any resistance to it. I know no mercy. Kidding aside, in my review of Preacher, I made mention of my advice, that anyone considering buying a book online should first read a little bit of what they're thinking about buying before doing so.

His passion and anger at the force's coverup lends some moments of sensitivity and humanitarianism, and some of hilarity monstering, as Spider yet again goes balls deep on uncovering the truth. The series' plot really takes off here, particularly at the end of Lonely City vol. 3, where the plot against the Smiler really begins to take shape.Great stuff; this one's real good.

Following a Senator's sex scandal leads Spider and his filthy assistants, Yellena and Channon, to massive corruption within the police force of the city where a hate crime has been essentially buried. But when Spider raises his hackles on the police, he finds that he's walked into a bloody trap...This book takes the story of the Smiler and Spider to the next level with the opening shots fired against Truth and Justice. As the bodies pile up, Spider realises the fun is has begun and the innocent must be avenged, and, with the white hot self-righteous bile vomiting forth from Warren Ellis' mind, this book is as fun and brilliant as the others are.Also included are a couple of one-shot issues, one is an interview with Spider giving the reader more background on the character and insights into his childhood, while another is an illustrated column of Spider's \\"I Hate It Here\\".The series continues to be excellent and \\"Lonely City\\" is a fine addition to the fun and silly, clever and dramatic stories that are building towards a compelling and enthralling storyline. Excellent writing and drawing, any fans of the series so far won't be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"Transmetropolitan Vol. 5: Lonely City","review":"Warren Ellis, Transmetropolitan: Lonely City (Vertigo, 2001)Lonely City starts out with much the same problem The New Scum had, in that Ellis has sacrificed a good deal of the series' humor in order to amp up the social commentary. That said, he makes up for it in spades in the latter half of the book, which gets us back into the plot, and the convulsive humor germane to the series.

It tells you all the know-hows for a city mom including information on great places to change a baby's diapers, baby-friendly restaurants, music-dancing-swim-gym programs, pre-school, mother's luncheons, child-friendly parks, where to have birthday parties, baby photographers and entertainers, nanny and baby-sitting services, where to shop for baby furniture, clothes, toys, what kind of baby items to get, etc. It's well organized and easy to read with useful tidbits for new moms. Since I am expecting my baby in a month, only 2/3 of the book was useful for me (since it will be a long time before I do pre-school activities and toddler-related activities).The only problem I have with this otherwise fabulous book is that as of March 2009, a lot of the information is outdated in this fast-changing NYC environment because this 3rd edition was printed back in 2005. Just to cite a few example, there is no mention of the recent Bugaboo Chameleon or Orbit strollers; no mention of recent manufacturers and shops for baby products; even the restaurants are kind of outdated... which is not surprising since most of the information was probably collected around 2004, which was 5 years ago.

Most readers will read the entire book the first week, and then start reading again.Ms. Sharbuno writes with exceptional clarity, wit, organization, and insight into everyday concerns and challenges. Additionally, she has pulled together fifty-two marvelous quotations to segue into each short essay.She explains her term \\"success from the inside out.\\" To attain success, she advises, we cannot rely on outer circumstances. Instead, success depends more upon how we use our inner resources, often in the face of a threatening environment.The book is highly contemporary, in matters such as providing guidance for launching a new career after a job loss. Readers will listen to her because she experienced that adversity herself, and transitioned happily into a new arena.Likewise, when she talks about making your dreams come true, she explains how she achieved her fantasy of becoming a published writer.Ms. Sharbuno counsels us on other important topics. Examples: overcoming procrastination, the value of our \\"body wisdom\\" (which others might call \\"gut feelings\\"), dividing huge tasks into manageable pieces, adopting an attitude of abundance, and reshaping our attitudes.52 Ways will make you think, laugh, and reassess yourself, and will prompt you to alter your personal and professional relationships.

Born in Berdichev, Ukraine in 1905, Grossman rose to prominence and received national acclaim as a war reporter for Red Star, the official newspaper of the Red Army. Grossman's coverage of the Battle for Stalingrad was popular and well known. In fact, Grossman may have been the first reporter to tell the story of the Holocaust, beginning with his reports subsequent to the liberation of Treblinka in Poland. Prior to the publication (abroad) of Forever Flowing Grossman had seen his other major work, Life & Fate, banned by the KGB. In February 1961, a KGB Colonel, Vladimir Prokopenko came to Grossman's flat not to arrest Grossman but to arrest his novel \\"Life and Fate\\". Grossman's manuscripts, carbon copies, notebooks and typewriter ribbons were all seized. These events took contemporaneously with the authorized publication in the USSR of Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. An explanation of why Grossman was perceived as more of a threat than Solzhenitsyn can be gleaned from the contents of Forever Flowing. (The story of the eventual publication of Life and Fate is best left to reviewers of that book.)\\"Forever Flowing\\" tells a simple, yet emotionally deep and politically nuanced tale. The story begins with the 1957 return to Moscow of Ivan Grigoryevich after 30 years of forced labor in the Gulag. (1957 marked the year in which the tide of returning prisoners of the Gulag reached its peak.) He arrives at the flat of his cousin, Nikolay Andreyevich. Nikolay, a scientist with less than stellar skills, has reached some measure of success at the laboratory through dint of being a survivor. He reaches the top of his profession only after those of his more talented colleagues are skimmed from the laboratory after purges (Stalin's last campaign - the Doctors Plot - seems to be referenced here) and other typical political campaigns. The meeting in the flat is entirely unsatisfactory for both parties. Nikolay is particularly upset (although he is not capable of figuring out why) as he sees his pale imitation of a life reflected through the prism of his cousin's 30 year journey. Grossman paints a vivid picture of Nikolay, more than a bit jealous that Ivan's light had always shone brighter than his own prior to Ivan's arrest. Nikolay suffers from the guilt of one who was not arrested and who is painfully aware of the choices he made to keep from being arrested. In that sense having Ivan sit across from him at the dinner table disturbs Nikolay no end because Ivan represents a mirror into which Nikolay can see only his own hollow reflection.Grigoryevich leaves Moscow for his old city of Leningrad, the place where he was first arrested in 1927. There, quite by chance, he runs into the person whose denunciation placed him in jail in the first place. Grossman here embarks on a discourse on the different types and forms of denunciation available to the Soviet citizen. It is a remarkable discourse that shows how many different ways there are to participate in a purge and how many ways there are to legitimize ones participation and/or acquiescence.From Leningrad Ivan travels to a southern industrial city where he finds work and eventually finds a deep and satisfying love in the person of his landlady, a grieving war widow. That relationship forms the centerpiece of what might be called Grossman's vision that love and freedom are two goals, not mutually exclusive, that form the essence of our shared humanity.The above summary does not do justice to the power and depth of Grossman's prose. Further, it cannot do justice to the literary and political importance of the work. Since the death of Stalin, the Soviet line had remained relatively firm - Stalin's excesses were the product of a disturbed mind that represented a horrible deviation from the theory and principles of Leninism. The USSR's best path is the one that returned it to the path created by Lenin. Khrushchev first enunciated this line. (Brezhnev never paid it much mind as his own administration marked a step back towards Stalinism in some respects.) Even Gorbachev's perestroika was based on the theory that a return to first-principles, i.e. Leninism, would save the USSR from destruction.Grossman did not buy into this line and Forever Flowing is noted for a remarkable attack not only on Stalin but on Lenin and Lenin's anti-democratic tendencies that had more in common with Ivan the Terrible than the principles of revolutionary democracy. \\"All the triumphs of Party and State were bound up with the name of Lenin. But all the cruelty inflicted on the nation also lay - tragically - on Lenin's shoulders.\\" Grossman may have been the first to make this leap and he paid the price for making that leap. (This involves the suppression of his Life & Fate.)Despite the horrors set out, quietly and without excess rhetoric, Grossman returns to an somewhat optimistic vision of mans search for freedom\\" \\"No matter how enormous the skyscrapers, no matter how powerful the cannon, no matter how unlimited the might of the state, no matter how vast its empire, all this was only smoke and mist which would disappear. There remained alive and growing one genuine force alone, consisting of one element only - freedom. To live meant to be a free human being.Forever Flowing (and Life and Fate) are well worth the time and attention of anyone with an interest in the subject matter."},{"Title":"Forever Flowing (European Classics)","review":"Grossman began writing this book in 1955, two years after Stalin died. It was completed one year before the author's death in 1964, but was not published until 1970. Framed as a novel, and written with great tenderness, &quot;Forever Flowing&quot; is primarily a history of the horrors of the Soviet state before, during, and after its Stalinist phase. Grossman's chapters recounting the huge famine of 1932, which was a government-enforced starvation of millions, particularly in the Ukraine, are matchlessly brilliant and profoundly moving. The entire novel is a tribute to human freedom. It also reflects the great courage of its author. In my opinion, &quot;Forever Flowing&quot; will become more widely read as time passes, and will become increasingly recognized as one of the greatest books of the 20th century. It is a true classic. The lucid translation by Thomas P. Whitney is excellent. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Forever Flowing (European Classics)","review":"This translation should not have been republished.

I think Dostoyevsky is a little easier to understand now. I look forward to reading Life and Fate."},{"Title":"Forever Flowing (European Classics)","review":"As in his more famous \\"Life and Fate,\\" Grossman does a brilliant job getting into the minds of a variety of Soviet characters who are forced to deal with Stalin's brutal system and its aftermath. It is enlightening for those of us in the West to realize that, unlike the Germans after the fall of Hitler, the Russian people never had \\"closure\\" with their even bloodier past. Grossman shows us the thinking, not only of the released prisoners of the gulag, but the soul-searching of the men and women who denounced them or who merely stood by."},{"Title":"I Can Practice Writing Cursive","review":"I am ordering 2 copies of this book after already using it once for my home-schooled son.

Also, this workbook has lots of circles, loops and slanted lines: Very important in warming up and learning proper stroking. (Surprisingly, many other cursive workbooks don't even include this!)

There is ONE example alphabet page at the front of the book followed by 6 pages of basic strokes (diagonal lines, straight lines, curves, zig zags, and circles). I would guess that 1/3 to 1/2 of the remaining pages are blank 'lined' practice sheets, which aren't presented in any logical order (i.e. pages 18-25 are blank, followed by 9 practice pages with NO blank side, then another 8 blank pages. The pages that DO have copy material on them do not follow any pattern of writing but seem to be organized around 'themes' (the first set of copy pages are numbers, then shapes, colors, days of the week, holidays etc.I expected a grade 2 book to be more focused on basic strokes and individual letter formation. This book does NOT do that at all. The only page that shows 'how' to form the letters is the example page at the beginning of the book.The lack of instructive cohesion, combined with the un-necessary number of 'blank' practice pages really detracts from the value of this book. It might be useful for a student who has a year or two of cursive instruction behind them and just needs to neaten up their style - but for beginners it's truly useless."},{"Title":"I Can Practice Writing Cursive","review":"I am very please with this book.

The Doctor and Peri don't actually become fully involved in the story until about half-way through, and the villain of the piece is pretty clich&eacute;d, including deciding to make Peri his mate.

It has rocket planes, tele-screens, and everything we associate with classic, 2001-style science fiction. Then it hits you. This book is about exactly what the title implies: The Mind Parasites. This is mind-blowing, cutting edge philosophy thinly disguised as science fiction. Who are the mind parasites? Read this book, because it's here better than anywhere else I've seen. Then read Aldous Huxley, Terrence McKenna, Michael Talbot, even The Bible, and you begin to suspect that, just as Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction predicted the realization of geostationary satellites and interplanetary travel, this book predicts the coming explorations into the &quot;geography of consciousnes,&quot; and therefore, the discovery, realization, and fight against creatures such as these. The mind parasites flourish as long as we are unaware of their existence. From the book: &quot;Possibly the Christian idea of the devil arises from some obscure intuition of the part they had played in human history: how their role is to take over a man's mind, and to cause him to become an enemy of life and of the human race. But it would be a mistake to blame the vampires for all the misfortunes of the human race. Man is an animal who is trying to evolve into a god. Many of his problems are an inevitable result of this struggle.... It is not their actual intention to destroy...

The history is superb from Homer through Hellenistic times. Lesky purposefully scants the Empire, the Roman Empire, that is, as well as Greek patristic literature. Also, a new version of this book has just come out in German as of 1998.

It is, however, a more in-depth study of the breed. For those who just want tips on how to raise a puppy, I recommend Verne Foster's book. For those who want to understand the breed and the background of their dog, get Kitty's book. I recommend getting both!There is an earlier version of this book which Kitty wrote with Deyanne Miller (who made the first successful introduction of the PWD to the United States & worked hard to rescue the breed). You do not need that edition unless you want to see photos of some of the early PWDs that are omitted in the revised edition."},{"Title":"The New Complete Portuguese Water Dog (Howell Reference Books)","review":"More about history and breading that a guide for new owners.

It leaves you wanting more. While Oliver's use of the present tense is immediately inviting (reminiscent of the Greek of Mark's Gospel!), Oliver's true gift is in his ability to create characters. His characterization is simply second to none. Unlike so many authors who devote a novel to unfolding one character and giving short shrift to the rest, Oliver in an economy of words is able to introduce us to people who will live with us the rest of our lives. Who, having once met them, can ever forget the likes of LidaJean, Rose and Lennie, Alexa, Anthony, or Bea? And that is to say nothing about Pete, his mom or Bill. Read the book, folks! This man has the GIFT."},{"Title":"Closing Distance","review":"How many times have you borrowed a book and then went out to buy it AFTER you read it? This book is a keeper, probably one of the best books of gay fiction I've read. While it was indeed tough to get into the book at first, as one reviewer commented, it was well worth the read. Once past the first few chapters, I wasn't able to put it down. It made me smile, and there were chapters in there (particularly when describing his brother-in-law poolside) that you wondered why it was in the book at all. But, afterward, the payoff was such that you were even tempted to reread these chapters over again, hoping to get the point once more. What I liked about this book was its celebration and acceptance of gay life from various perspectives, all not necessarily gay (for instance, from his Mother's point of view). This book will have you smiling, and wanting to remember particular lines, and jumping for joy. And maybe even give you a few good, happy tears at points. I would most assuredly recommend this book to anyone. A must read!"},{"Title":"Closing Distance","review":"Yes the book is open ended (which I usually dislike), but it gives enough clues where one can put the pieces together and come up with an answer for themselves."},{"Title":"Closing Distance","review":"A friend of mine insisted that this was the best book he'd ever read, and after finishing it, I'm curious to know if I missed something. Jim Oliver's novel is the story of a wealthy family's handling of their matriarch's terminal illness. It is told mostly through the viewpoint of the family's gay son, Pete, an affable but wishy-washy character. I feel the one main problem with this book is the abundance of sub-plots created for undeveloped characters. Most of them are summarily dropped without conclusions. One sister is having an affair, another sister is worried her husband is having an affair, the brother is doing some kind of insider trading, and a friend is considering going to Saudi Arabia for a job despite being Jewish and deathly afraid of flying. These characters are given screen-time but little development, and the reader ends up having no real investment in them.Pete is vaguely dissatisfied with his life, and he doesn't learn until very late in the story what his goal is, and it's probably much too late for the reader. What he wants involves a contrived, unexplained get-rich scheme and the new found ability to be spontaneous and do things he's always wanted to do. The reader doesn't know of these desires until two-hundred pages into the book, and the book only has 249 pages. Apparently, a major hurdle for our hero is officially coming out to his family. The problem is that it wasn't established very well that he was fearfully or despondently closeted and it's fairly obvious that they all know anyway and accept him as he is.On the plus side, Liz Flowers, the aforementioned matriarch, is a strong and believable character. A reader could probably be inspired by her fortitude in the face of death. Furthermore, the topic of AIDS is discussed intelligently and rationally, and although the AIDS subplot is also unresolved, one can deduce that it's not important to know if Pete has AIDS, it's just important for him to start living life. A good lesson, but if perhaps he had been a more vivid and lovable character, this would have been a more compelling story. I would probably still recommend it to some readers interested in early 90's gay fiction."},{"Title":"Closing Distance","review":"I don't know what the reviewers were on when they read this book, but it certainly effected their judgement.

I grabbed The Gathering with the same joy---only to be tremendously disappointed.The most difficult part of this book was the endless repetition and back-tracking---explaining and re-explaining the already tedious details. The characters were wooden--I couldn't care less about any of them.... And the dialogue: had Kienzle ever tuned in to a conversation between Catholic teenagers, even in that era? About as unrealistic as I could imagine. And was it necessary to create perhaps the worst priest to ever be ordained as the antagonist here? Having gone all through Catholic school during this era, and knowing hundreds of priests, I can't imagine any of them playing with Church doctrine in this way. Bottom line--an awful book.

However, if you're interested in a pretty decent character study of 4 young people preparing to enter the religious life, then you might enjoy it.

Taken on that level, this is one of his best in the last few years."},{"Title":"The Gathering","review":"I can understand what William Kienzle is trying to do. He wantsto help Roman Catholics and others to understand that theirchurch has changed, become more human and humane.

I'm glad I did, even though the consensus seems to be that this is probably his weakest mystery. Since I love mysteries, I'll try another too. =)"},{"Title":"The Gathering","review":"How unfortunate that \\"The Gathering\\" is the last book that William X. Kienzle wrote. It is nothing more than a vapid retelling, and retelling, and .... (get the picture) of five young people,how they came to arrive at the decision to enter religious life and the events that occurred along the way. The solving of \\"THE\\" murder, which really isn't one, doesn't pan out (and at that very weakly) until the very last few pages of the book. Until that point the reader suffers through how Rose and Alice and Mike and Manny and Benny and yes, the hero, Robert Koesler, came to the decision to choose a religious life and the trials and tribulations that played out along the way.The book begins as Fr. Koesler returns to a now defunct seminary building in anticipation for a reunion with the surviving five religious and former religious who formed the \\"group\\". That brief glimpse of the aging priest doesn't last long. The novel then takes the reader back to the time when these young people either made the decision to enter religious life or had the decision made for them. The dialogue is weak, repetitive and lacks any spark of life. It is too bad that Mr. Kienzle discussed the most questionable tactics of one priest who used the \\"missionary's privilege\\" to pave the way for a most unwilling candidate to enter the seminary. With all the criticism the Catholic church has received in recent months, this reader wished that Benny's plight had been edited from the book.It is difficult to believe that the man who penned \\"The Rosary Murders\\" and so many other great mysteries has passed away. It is even more difficult to realize that William Kienzle left his fans with arguably the worst story line he ever created. One will just have to chalk \\"The Gathering\\" up to the fates that come with a dwindling creative spark. Sorry it was such a poor read, Sir. You deserved to go out with a bang, not a whimper."},{"Title":"The Gathering","review":"I am amazed that the previous review, the book flap, and one of the Editorial descriptions refer to this as a &quot;mystery&quot;. It is not. This is a character piece about 6 childhood friends who plan as kids to enter the religious life; the book follows their lives until they are in their 70s. Yes, one of them dies, but only in the loosest of definitions is book a mystery.Sometimes I wonder if I should go back and re-read one or two of Kienzle's earliest books. I remember them as being so good, but his most recent books have not been very good at all. He has always included long digressions, explaining the arcane points of Catholic theology or Canon Law. However, his more recent books seem to have a mystery plot only for the sake of a framework to hang the digressions upon.In this book, he also repeats himself constantly. There aren't that many characters; I think I can keep track of who is whose twin, and the significance of choosing this seminary over that seminary (since both are significant plot points). It is almost as if it was intended to be read in installments over a long period of time.All of this is not to say that I didn't find elements of this book (and other recent ones) interesting -- just that the books are guilty of false advertising of sorts.The author died in December 2001.

The IPO game, the manipulation of charts, and the churning of accounts still exist, and are still used to keep the small investor buying shares that are worth less and less as the years pass.No one, especially resource investors, should confuse a bull market with genius, and all should realize that the market consistently rewards those investors who, if they are not true insiders, act like they are.Spending an evening with Hazard is a jading experience; he finds no public morality where the vultures gather to pick clean the bones and retirement funds of the small investor.But it is an education that no investor should deprive himself of, especially with the sharks of the dotcom boom swimming unseen into the growing pool of resource stocks."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Wall Street insider","review":"This book, although from the early 70's scratches the surface of what happens on Wall St and how investors get screwed!!!!!!!!!!!Had this book back in 1972 and found it again as I wanted another copy and after working in this industry for over 26 years I can say that he is right on and how the execs on the street cover it all up"},{"Title":"A Scandal in Bohemia (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes)","review":"A Scandal in Bohemia was a nicely written short story.

At first I didn't really like Irene Adler for no reason I can think of now. But she grew on me and by the end of the story, she was my favorite character. The King was an absolute idiot."},{"Title":"A Scandal in Bohemia (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes)","review":"\\"To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name.\\"Well this was a surprise; the classics and especially mysteries are not my usual fare but due to my recent obsession with the BBC series SherlockSherlock: Season Two(How yummy is Benedict Cumberbatch BTW?) and then watching Downey and Jude Law in the movieSherlock Holmes: A Game of ShadowsI realized that I had never actually read any of Conan Doyle's stories. After some research trying to figure out where to begin, I eventually boughtThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmesand settled on this story. And wow, I didn't expect to enjoy this half as much as I did (or at all for that matter) but I guess this is why Sherlock Holmes is still relatable today.I'd initially expected to have to put in considerable effort just to get through this, I mean it was written in 1892 so it was bound to be very, well literary. You know all formal and tedious. In fact I'd anticipated needing a dictionary just to be able to understand what the characters were talking about, but to my surprise A Scandal In Bohemia turned out to be an absolute delight to read. The actual story is quite basic yet also filled with complexities and hidden meanings and I would also have to call this a romance -of sorts. It's also funny, relevant, cunning, witty, romantic and ultimately sad. What a great introduction to the world of Sherlock Holmes.Told from Dr. Watsons POV (now that I didn't know - I'd just assumed these were Sherlock's stories.) We begin with Watson \\"dropping by\\" Baker Street to visit Holmes. He hasn't been by his old residence or seen Holmes of late due to his recent marriage and the two have drifted apart. I guess you could say he feels nervous about visiting because he never really knows what state Holmes will be in; elated, depressed, manic, high on opium or cocaine or in some clever disguise? It's always a bit of a crap shoot. In any case he appears happy today and also excited due to the prospect of a new and exciting case. Sherlock then asks if Watson will assist him;\\"I shall be delighted\\"\\"You don't mind breaking the law?\\"\\"Not in the least.\\"\\"Nor running a chance of arrest?\\"\\"Not in good cause.\\"\\"Oh the cause is excellent.\\"\\"Then I am your man.\\"\\"I was sure that I could rely on you.\\"The client turns out to be the King of Bohemia; he requires Holmes' assistance in obtaining an incriminating photograph of himself and one Irene Adler before he marries. It seems this past affair would ruin him because of her \\"station.\\" So far the King has tried unsuccessfully to buy it (she won't sell) to bribe her servants and finally even to steal it but Ms. Adler is always one step ahead. Holmes dons several disguises throughout his case, first as a groomsman to gain access to Adler's property and spy on her and then later as an (injured) clergyman. Irene Adler is a fantastic character, gaining the upper hand and in the end even outsmarting Holmes. I suppose it's her cleverness that causes Holmes to fall for her and why in the end she becomes known only as the woman.

This one however sits at the top of my heap. It wasn't too bad..theres lots of information about bread history, health problems and grooming. The major problem I find in all bread specific books is that there is only so much you can write about a breed, the rest of the book is made up of stuff that can be applied to all puppies and grown dogs (training, eating, vaccinations ect). This book has the same sort of section. I get the impression that the authors just replace the phrase &quot;your dog&quot; with &quot;your maltese.&quot; But all in all this book did its best with the little information you can write about the matlese breed and I was pleased. My favorite section of the book was the one that outlined &quot;leisure cuts&quot; for this dogs, as most books go into great detail about coat length and top knots, it was refreshing to read about a grooming style that I am more interested in.

The author touches upon many useless topics to the new dog owner and seemingly knows little about the dog's ancestry.Furthermore, the author advocates for positive-reinforcement training only while advising extreme caution against any type of negative reinforcement. This failure to recognize an important training technique for say, barking problems, illustrates this particular author's failure to address the basic dog owner's needs.I found this book to be condescending at best and in most instances a poor reference.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about the struggles that continued in the rural south long past the civil rights movement. 'Praying for Sheetrock' is a history book that reads like fiction.

Read them both!"},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"Nothing makes me yearn for a good beach read like a heavy dose of non-fiction. More informative than enjoyable, this book is about corruption and civil rights in coastal McIntosh County, Georgia, in the 70s. Since it's a true story, I hesitate to use the word \\"characters,\\" but the two main ones are white sheriff Tom Poppell and black resident Thurnell Alston. Neither is all good or all bad, and certainly the shades of gray are an improvement over some of the fiction I've read lately. Poppell is trying to keep the future at bay by denying the blacks an opportunity to hold any real public office, to serve on a jury, or to occupy white-collar jobs. He's also the force behind blatant criminal activity, as roadside stands routinely hoodwink travelers into ponying up their entire vacation stash and more in rigged games of chance. On the other hand, he looks the other way whenever a semi spills its cargo in a crash, allowing the poor black families to pillage the shoes, dry wall, or whatever. Alston, a boilermaker on disability, becomes the spokesperson for the disenfranchised black population, but he's no saint and eventually degenerates into a flawed figurehead. Two unfortunate events define his later life, and he sinks even further, although there appears to be some sliver of hope for redemption at the end. The author and her husband both worked for the Georgia Legal Services Program during the time that GLSP assisted the blacks in McIntosh County in their quest to achieve representation. Greene's participation in that effort obviously afforded her the opportunity to see both the good and the shortcomings of the people on whose behalf GLSP filed suit. This book is definitely not a celebration of victory but is a stark look at an ongoing struggle for self-respect and equality."},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"I grew up in Mcintosh County and was a teen during the years of Uncle Tom, he and his right hand man (deputy) may have done somethings above the law, but he watched out for us kids.

He gave me a receipt -- from a generic \\"receipt book\\" and sent me on my way. Quite an experience; informative, and, I don't mind saying, frightening. I haven't read \\"Sheetrock\\" but believe there likely wasn't much the man wasn't capable of."},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"Melissa Faye, author of Praying for Sheetrock, was born and raised in Georiga and has written three highly-acclaimed, award winning documentaries on discrimination in Georgia. Praying for Sheetrock, her first novel, is about the unspectacular Mcintosh County. There lives a tight-knit black community that has been barred from gaining equality well after the civil rights movement, in the late 1970's. The true battle begins when a black man is shot in broad-daylight and held in jail without medical attention. This aroused the community to take action and face down the corrupt white sheriff who held the town in the palm of his hand. This book goes through the process that Thurnell Alston and some of his friends go through to fight the white judicial system and fight the status quo of a very closed-minded town. They engage the help of the Georgia Legal Services, who are a group of lawyers who help poverty-level clients with their legal woes. Fay does a fantastic job using detail and really creates an emotional bond between the reader and the characters she portrays. While it is an interesting book, it adds far too much unnecessary detail, like the county's gambling and prostitution rings. While this is an interesting sub-plot it really adds nothing to the important topic of civil rights. I would, however, recommend the book to anyone interested in civil rights or interested in a book full of stories of the human condition."},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"This book held my attention, and was fantastic.

This must be one of the classics for books written about the south."},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"Having lived in the south for all of my almost 50 years, I will say that I Mrs. Green really captured the era. The town I lived in was somewhat larger but not much. Our schools were integrated and for the most part we all got along fine. I went to my 30 year high school reunion in 2010 that had a turn out of almost 70 classmates (plus spouses). We planned for a year and called everyone we knew but only 10 white students came. We had a blast anyway!So I ask how much has really changed? All of my white friends said they would come, but something came up and they couldn't make it. The part of the book that really nailed it for me was when the lady was walking down the street with the little boy that was helping her around the house. A man on the street called the boy out for walking on the sidewalk and the lady told the man it was 'ok, he's with me'. Both kinds of racism...overt and subtle. That, to me, is the best description where we still are today. Great book!"},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"This book was so informative.

McIntosh County in Georgia is just north of us. On the tours and walks we have taken of this area we would hear you need to read Praying for Sheetrock.

It had the benefits of a novel with the descriptive, eloquent writing style of the author, but with the added value of learning a true historic tale.

The Board of Ed of Topeka Kansas , that held that Separate but Equal was in fact unequal. Twenty years later-despite legal desegregation, successful boycotts and the Civil Rights act of 1964 - McIntosh county along the Georgia coast existed very much the way they always had. It seemed as if the Blacks went about their lives there in a comfortably inferior position with daily exchanges of niceties and a humble respect for their place among the whites. Their behavior was rewarded with the occasional bone thrown to them by Sheriff Poppel in the form of a favor or free stolen goods, and the local whites allowed them to coexist without any overt hostility. That was until the subtle discrimination they lived with, took the form of a violent abuse of power on the evening of March 22nd in the year 1973. With these words: 'they done shot Finch', a revolution was born in McIntosh County. Those words served as a catalyst to stimulate the awareness of the oppressed. And suddenly, the life they had lived all along-without complaint, without ingratitude- was simply insufficient."},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"I read 'Praying for Sheetrock' as a text for one of my college classes. The book was intrieging from the very beginning, but was slightly boring at first. It takes a while for the reader to be able to get into the book - the first few chapters were tedious reading. As for the content - this was the first time I'd read a book on the Civil Rights Movement, and it was quite an enlightening experience. Not having travelled on US 17, but having taken I 95 instead while driving through Georgia, but still being able to smell the paper mills, there was new meaning to me when I went through Georgia after reading this book. Ms.Greene goes into minute detail in certain parts of the book, but seems to skim over other events - some which might have been interesting to read.

This is a must-read for anyone interested in race relations in the US."},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"My first thought on this book was 'did you really think that a few laws and a few court cases was going to make really serious differences in the way people thought. Yes, you can force some things, like the attendance of a token few blacks at an all white high school, but back in the remote hinterlands life is going to go on much as before.This is a story of race in a backwater southern community where an old-time sheriff continued to rule his domain much as before. The result was, eventually, for white legal aid attorneys to overthrow the system.This is a story of race, but it's also a story of the lack of political power for a selected community. Much the same tale could have been told of Chicago in the Daley days, of jews during the holocaust and unfortunately of many other peoples over many other times. It is a fascinating story that ultimately offers some hope for the future."},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"I live in McIntosh County and recognized many of the characters in the book as well as familiar places.

Practically everyone has a story to tell about life in this small fishing town...Melissa, three questions: 1) will there be a sequel, 2) what happened to the parts that were edited, and 3) is there to be a movie?"},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"My mother was born and raised in McIntosh County Georgia. She confirms the truck crash incident along with the Sheriff's drug cartel and other corruptions. She admitted that many blacks in the County looked up to Sheriff Tom Poppel and considered him a good man. I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Upon recommendation by a doctor my mother moved home to McIntosh County. I became a citizen of McIntosh County in 1983 and experienced an extreme culture-shock. The housing was inadequate, education was minimum, employment was scarce, race relations were very much segregated and people still spake Gullah. As a matter of fact in 1983 there was a separate prom for white and black students. It is fatally ironic that Thurnell Alston was caught in a drug sting. The truth of the matter is he became a victim of his own circumstance. I visited him in the hospital before he succumbed to cancer. His sons and I were close friends and I never really understood the significance of who he was until I read the book (Praying for Sheetrock) and consider it to be a well-written book for all to read especially citizens of McIntosh County. However because the lack of education exists many in McIntosh County will not read the book. Unfortunately the more things change the more they remain the same."},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"As a native Southerner, I can say that Melissa Faye Greene is spot-on in creating her characters. Her descriptions of people, places, scenes, sounds, and smells bring everything to life. I find myself saying again and again, \\"I've experienced that; I know that person.\\" I gave this book to my teen-ager so she would understand why racial politics are what they are in the South; she's now re-reading it -- on her own -- for the third time. Parts of this story will make you laugh out loud; others will make you angry; throughout, there is the human struggle for dignity. If you want to understand the South of the current generation and the one before it, I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"There are a number of astonishing things about this provocative and evocative history of a remote coastal region of Georgia. Greene's chronicle is not simply an account of the institutional and covert racism that plagued one Southern county. Nor is it merely a biography of an unlikely black leader who led a momentous, peaceful rebellion against the white hierarchy before succumbing (at best) to his own credulity or (at worst) to the very corruption he criticized. Instead, \\"Praying for Sheetrock\\" is a composite oral history of a complex, deceptively quiet community during the 1970s and 1980s, where the social norms seemed old-fashioned, even quaint, and where even justifiably disgruntled citizens, both white and black, are restrained equally by an ill-defined sense of fear and by a desire to get along with their neighbors.At the time of the writing, McIntosh County had been dominated by a corrupt yet efficient, nepotistic yet clever \\"Old Boy\\" network, but it was also populated by an impoverished black community that, on the surface, seemed to have been on good terms with the local white authorities all through the chaos of the civil rights struggle. For many years, state and federal authorities suspected that county officials, led by Sheriff Tom Poppell, had been deeply implicated in jury tampering, tax evasion, bribery, illegal gambling, drug-running, prostitution, and even murder. Folks joked that Poppell \\"was the only sheriff in America who owned four houses, one with an airfield, and all on twelve thousand dollars a year.\\" Yet every attempt by higher authorities (who regularly indicated on their reports that Poppell was to be considered \\"armed and dangerous\\") failed to nab the suspects. The victims of their never-indicted yet well-documented activities included tourists on the way through the county to family vacations in Florida as well as the local poor.The story of how this county eventually entered the late 20th century makes fascinating reading, and Greene's prose is an odd yet refreshing blend of journalism and lyricism. (It was included among the top 100 works of 20th-century American journalism by the New York University School of Journalism.) The reader is repeatedly stunned by her ability to persuade such a wide spectrum of local citizens--rich and poor, white and black, conservative and liberal--to talk at such length and with such honesty. Only at the very end of the book, in the acknowledgments, does it become clear that the author was far from a Janie-come-lately to the scene: she worked at Georgia Legal Services (which provided advice on civil liberties matters for the black community), was a witness to most of the events, and married one of the lawyers featured in the book. Rather than prejudicing her account, her experiences give the events an insider's perspective and make her relative objectivity all the more admirable. In fact, it's safe to say that only Greene could have written this book. And, much like \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" (itself set only a few miles to the north), her book manages to look underneath the scandal and the poverty and to reveal much to admire in the gentle camaraderie of these easygoing neighbors.Above all, \\"Praying for Sheetrock\\" reminds us of the courageous heroes who look \\"upon law, upon the Constitution, as a series of fundamental truths about basic human rights.\\" Those heroes include black community members, young and old, willing to risk everything for those rights; the lawyers who represented and advised them for next to nothing; and the small yet powerful number of local whites who believed that enough was enough. It's an inspiring tale that reminds us that the civil rights struggle is far from over."},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"Having been born and raised in a small community in south Georgia, I have seen first-hand much of what was described in this book. I found this work to be incredibly interesting and moving. Have attitudes evolved and changed for the better in this area? Yes, fortunately. Are there still traces of this? Yes, unfortunately. But with excellent works such as this, we can only hope that the sad attitudes and discrimination that is so accurately described in Ms. Greene's work will become a part of our distant past."},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"What a wonderful work! Melissa Faye Greene has brought together a passion for scholarship and a mellifluous writing style. Darien, Georgia is hardly the place to begin when one studies the civil rights movement in America -- but Melissa Faye Greene shows us the impact of this revolution in rural America, a story too often neglected in favor of stories of urban desegregation. Beautifully written, Ms. Greene elucidates the struggles of blacks and whites to come to terms with a changing social reality, and cast off decades of de facto dictatorial rule by a white aristocracy. In the process, both white and black come to see that what unites them is greater than what divides them, even though what unites them is not always to their liking"},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"Once I picked this book up, I could not put it down. The way Greene chose to set up this book and play out the story is excellent. She laid out the characters and the scene in such a way to allow the reader to draw their own conclusions to the facts, giving equal voice to all parties. Though the heroes and villians are obvious, she doesn't portray them in a straight forward way. It opens with a complete and thorough description of everything surrounding the actual story, which gives the reader the feeling that they are there - a part of it - before all is said and done. The research she did on the subject to offer a tale told with all sides is commendable. Equally Fascinating and Intriguing!!"},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"This tale hangs about you like Spanish moss--quiet, phospherescent, and pervasive. At first, I wondered where she could be taking me. The characters and anecdotal tales seemed to be jumbled and never forming a conclustion. But I stayed with it; it wasn't until the last 60 pages that it all came together for me and really became rewarding. Greene's writing style and tone is soft, rather like sipping a mint julep--and yes, by the time I finished it, I had &quot;a little color in my cheeks.&quot;"},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"Coastal Georgia is a frequent destination for me. Whenever I have to be away from it, I am planning the next time I'll be able to smell the marsh, feel the sand in my shoes and hear the musical voices of the residents. I have been to Darien many, many times, but my first visit was in 1994, long after the initial events in this book took place. Reading PRAYING FOR SHEETROCK was educational, to say the least. What Melissa Fay Greene does in her narrative is show you the different Dariens - the black experience is (or was) far different from the one enjoyed by whites in this historic community.It is said that there are two sides to every story; in SHEETROCK, there are significantly more than that to be found. McIntosh County is a prism, and the truth is refracted through every possible angle. Greene tries not to take sides. She offers as much of a journalistic approach as possible, starting with the early 1970s and the corruption in the local government, and ending with the changes in the life of Thurnell Alston, the man who, with others in his community, stood up to the status quo.At times, Greene's writing approaches the poetic. Her use of language is nothing less than stunning. She evokes the true beauty of this part of the world, and reminds me, even in the bleak passages, why I love it so. Few other authors I've read have been so successful in bringing the environment to mind, even when describing the mosquitos and choking dust on a dry day. Almost anyone can write a beautiful sunset; it's a truly excellent writer who can narrate a lack of plumbing and make it interesting.PRAYING FOR SHEETROCK may not prove to be interesting to everyone who reads it. Those who have ties to the McIntosh County will get the most out of it, I believe, and others may be bored. As someone who loves Coastal Georgia, and American history, I was fascinated."},{"Title":"Praying for Sheetrock","review":"That about says it. My uncle from Gerogia remembers the stories of the southern area and the shame of the events. It's hard to determine which is the greater strength - the story itself or the characters.

This didn't continue throughout the book. It became more of a &quot;he said, then he said, then he said&quot; narrative. The beautiful language that Greene uses vanishes as she gets more deeply into the story. I was intrigued by the politics involved. Not being very politically astute, I was amazed at how the sheriff controlled everything in that county. I was also captivated by the tale of civil rights struggles in backwoods Georgia. This was such an interesting book, but Greene's talent at using language seemed to be subverted by her need to tell the story. This was our book group's topic of discussion for this evening; it made for a lively talk. Next time I'm on my way thru Georgia, I DO intend to drive down 17 thru McIntosh County.

At times, the book often wears its morality lesson on its sleeve, but does so in such a sincere manner that its hard not to appreciate the story and theme given the intended audience -- the young adult.A relatively quick read, THE RETURN OF GABRIEL has one huge strength and that is the variety of characters it brings to the page. Although few make any significant change in their attitude or thoughts by the novel's end, that is true to life. Cooper and his black friend Jubal's relationship goes through its growing pains as their individual perspectives on the civil rights fight are clearly influenced by different factors.As a YA novel that is purposely trying to make a point, this book succeeds admirably, though it does leave a number of questions (that teenagers will have about the story and its characters) unanswered. Adults will find it a bit too simplistic in its storytelling, but appreciate its intention to inform as historical fiction.I intend on using this book in my class to help flesh out the subject of Hate for a unit I am teaching. I know there are surely better books on the subject of America's civil rights movement, but this book fits in well as a selection of the Sunshine State Recommended Reading List for 2006-2007 for grades 6 through 8."},{"Title":"The Return of Gabriel","review":"This book was chosen by Starkville Reads, a one book, one city program in Starkville ,MS. We found it to be excellent for the program in that it generated a lot of interest in the community and provided a focus for some enjoyable and informative discussions.The book is about the experiences of a couple of teenagers in MS in the 60's. One of the teens is black, the other white. In addition to sharing a lot of experiences common to teens every where, the two friends get swept up in the civil rights problems of Mississippi in the 60's. There are many good guys and bad guys, the latter in the form of the Klan. People get threatened and hassled, and buildings burned. There is some mysterious ancestry, and a few natural and not so natural deaths.It is all pretty exciting in addition to being informative.Readers participating in discussions of the book, most of whom were in MS when it all happenned, generally agreed that the author had depicted life in MS pretty well.The book is really primarily for young adult readers which isn't all bad, ie it moves fast and has short chapters.If you are looking for a short, very well written book that depicts life in rural areas of MS in the 60's through the eyes of teenagers, then this is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"The Return of Gabriel","review":"I cannot wait for my children to read Dr. John's newest book. In a time when we desperately need to be coming together as a nation, this book hits on the emotional level that children can understand how we as a society need to accept each other. Children will identify with the familial ties that bind us as well as the friendship ties that help build our character in times of trouble. I hope my children see the bigger issues in this story and appreciate the real history that unfolds. I love the way Dr. John has ordinary children doing extraordinary feats. His children, his characters remind me of the humble men in the Bible that God used. Ironic...I don't think so. The weaving of morality,spirituality, and frail humanity make these the kind of stories you want your children to aspire and be inspired by.

It's a collection of essays, all (bar one) especially written for this volume, each of them authored by a leading scholar on the respective dialogue or topic. Especially the pieces by Frede and Fine constitute path-breaking, durable contributions to Plato scholarship; each of them would merit the purchase by itself. Between them, Frede and Fine also introduce the reader to two rather different approaches to interpreting Plato, and at once present these approaches at their very best.Some essays are naturally harder than others, ranging from the instantly accessible to the rather technical. This is as it should be: a reader's companion to Plato's dialogues which themselves vary from the easy to the 'forbidding'. And a book that won't become redundant as your own competence with the dialogues grows (who ever said it won't?).To conclude: these pieces range from the good to the outstanding, none of them is harder than it should be, and they display considerable diversity in methodology.PS People interested in the 'non-doctrinal' approach to reading Plato may profitably consult Ferrari's piece at http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2000/2000-11-10.html, and the \\"Introduction\\" (pt.III-IV) in John Cooper, \\"Plato: Complete Works\\" (Hackett 1997)."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Plato (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)","review":"Plato is perhaps the most approachable of the major philosophers. His work is largely presented in short dialogues. Their brevity allow them to be read in a single sitting, and their characterizations, humor, and stories engage even the reader new to philosophy.Given this, it may surprise those unfamiliar with Plato to learn that the interpretation of him has always been the subject of hot dispute - perhaps only Nietzsche among philosophers has inspired more controversy.Why is this? Why is Plato so easy to read and yet so difficult?Five problems are worth calling out:(1) Dramatic presentation: All of Plato's published works are presented as dialogues between characters - Plato himself is never a character. Thus, any interpretation must have some mapping (implicit or explicit) between the characters' views and Plato's views, as well as how the dramatic structure (setting, characters, story) as a whole presents Plato's views.(2) Irony: The main speaker in most of Plato's dialogues is Socrates, a character who often speaks ironically. Other characters can be read as sometimes being ironical as well (such as The Athenian in the dialogue &quot;Laws&quot;). Any interpretation must determine when a character is speaking ironically and when seriously.(3) Stories/Myths: Characters in Plato's dialogues often tell stories whose subject matter is mythological - they concern Gods and Goddesses, the afterlife, and other subject matter beyond ordinary human experience. Any interpretation that deals with them must determine how they are to be read.(4) The Platonic Lie: In &quot;The Republic&quot;, Plato endorses (or seems to endorse) lying as a means of instilling beneficial beliefs in audiences that are unable to acquire philosophical knowledge. A beneficial belief is one that is not true in its substance, but which, if believed, will tend to the same end as would the corresponding knowledge. If we accept that this is Plato's view, then interpretations must consider whether views expressed in the dialogues are themselves Platonic Lies, and not real representations of Plato's thought.(5) Historical Background: Plato lived in a time and place different from our own, whose language, customs, intellectual background, and attitudes are not ours. This is a much bigger problem than just unfamiliar names - it is the unconscious attitudes we absorb from our culture (and he from his) of which we are not necessarily even consciously aware. Different interpreters do not read these influences the same way (there is no book we can all go to called &quot;How We Thought About Things&quot;, authored by &quot;The Ancient Greeks&quot;).With regard to these issues, the dominant view in &quot;A Cambridge Companion to Plato&quot; is something I would call Platonic Fundamentalism: &quot;Socrates says what Plato means, and he means what he says&quot; (this is after the Christian Fundamentalist credo: &quot;The Bible says what it means and it means what it says&quot;).A difficulty with this view is that it leaves Plato contradicting himself an awful lot. The general solution presented here is the evolving-Plato theory - that the dialogues were written over a long period of time and that the contradictions represent real changes in Plato's views. The collection thus abounds in references to Plato's &quot;early dialogues&quot; or &quot;middle dialogues&quot; or &quot;late dialogues&quot;.Now, there are certainly Plato scholars, past and present, who do not accept this particular interpretive framework, but their views, if raised at all, are raised only so that they may be dismissed (sometimes in the same sentence). Those looking for substantial engagement on the problems of Platonic interpretation must look elsewhere.So, given that the book does not aim to present the scholarly debate on interpreting Plato, it is fair to ask: what does it aim to do? This is an excellent question, but I could not find the answer to it in the book itself.If it were for the beginning reader, I would think it would focus on the order of reading, and on prepping the reader with background info for each dialogue so as to make reading it more rewarding. But it doesn't do anything like that.If it were for the intermediate reader, I would think it would focus on illuminating doubtful passages or drawing connecting webs across disparate ones. But it doesn't do that either.If it were for the advanced reader, I would think it would focus on the debates in the secondary literature, and that it would be used by peers to address peers on controversies. But it doesn't do that either.So, when it comes to the ultimate question of whether I should recommend the book or not, I just can't think of anyone to whom I would recommend it.Finally, to take another tack at how worthwhile a book is: the basic challenge any work of secondary literature must face is whether it is more profitable to read it, or to give the primary literature another reading instead.The only work in the collection that I would say clearly passes that test is Constance Meinwald's essay on &quot;Parmenides&quot; (for those who don't know, &quot;Parmenides&quot; is by far the most formidable work in the Platonic corpus - the first half works to demolish the theory of Forms that we might otherwise hold to be Plato's view, and the second half defies the ability of most readers to make any sense of at all). Even here, however, if you want to read Meinwald's theories on &quot;Parmenides&quot; (and they are worth reading), you would do better to get her book &quot;Plato's Parmenides&quot; than to read the essay excerpted from that book included here."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Plato (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)","review":"The Cambridge Companion to Plato is an extrememly good primer of Plato's philosophy.

This overview is particularly helpful for those who have never studied Plato before and essential for those who use this book, as I did, as their first exposure to the study of philosophy.Like all books in the Cambridge series, the Companion to Plato consists of a number of essays written by preminent scholars. These essays explain and evaluate various aspects of Plato's philosophy, from &quot;the defense of justice in Plato's Republic&quot; to &quot;mathematical method and philosophical truth.&quot;Like any philosophy textbook, The Cambridge Companion to Plato can, at times, be dense. I won't recommend it for everbody; a hearty interest in learning philosophy is definately required. However, I've found it to be one of the finest introductions to Plato in his philosophy. It provides a good foundation for actual reading of Plato's texts, which is the next logical step beyond this book. It is also perfect for those who wish to gain a working understanding of Plato's view of the world but, like me, simply do not have the patience to garner it from Plato's own work."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Plato (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)","review":"This collection of essays written by a host of outstanding scholars of ancient philosophy in this generation may well serve as a comprehensive and dense guideline to the philosophy of Plato and the contemporary viewpoints concerning the arguments presented by Plato. I am especially impressed by the excellent introduction written by the editor of this book, Richard Kraut. It is so well-organized, sharply presented and teemed with useful materials that I find it to be the best short introduction on Plato I ever read. And the structure of the whole book is also well balanced that the essays of which it is composed nearly touch every controverisal problems concerning Plato's philosophy and that those problems are all more or less treated in a appreciable way."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Plato (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)","review":"I find it richly ironic that there is no Cambridge companion to the Cambridge Platonists.How come?

It was funny, heart-warming, and heart-breaking. Rufus had uncompromising character (at least in the field; at home he was a bit of a terror); he loved his work and he was truly an inspiration. At first I thought the birding/hunting terminology would be a problem; I'm a vegetarian who knows nothing about the subject. But I assure you, being unfamiliar with the subject didn't affect my enjoyment of the book at all. In fact, I felt guilty that my Brittany, Pointer and Weimaraner have never had such experiences. A dog, like a human, has certain gifts and talents, and Rufus was lucky enough to utilize his to the fullest. Mr. Gusewelle is very talented - he had a wonderful story to tell and he told it beautifully. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Rufus Chronicle : Another Autumn","review":"This memoir by columnist Gusewelle of the life of his dog Rufus is rich, funny and gives a thorough explication of what it meant to live with the Brittany Rufus. I was not partial to the passages on hunting, as I am not a hunter, but I was still engrossed in the book, because these incidents told a lot about Rufus, and after all, HE loved the hunt. It's a pleasant read, with a not unexpected end that while sad completes the story satisfactorily. If you know someone who loves to read, hunt and loves his dogs, this book is definitely the perfect gift."},{"Title":"Rufus Chronicle : Another Autumn","review":"Rarely does a book come along that seems upon first reading like reacquainting oneself with an old friend. But, with The Rufus Chronicle: Another Autumn, author C.W. Gusewelle's writing is like taking a walk in the quail fields with hunters we have known.The book is about Gusewelle's dog, Rufus, a Brittany Spaniel. Rather, it is a chronicle, a diary of the life of Rufus with Gusewelle from a pup until maturity at 13 seasons. It has plenty of dog lore, from puppyhood to middle age to advanced years, seemingly paralleling the stages of the author's own life. Along the way, we read pearls of wisdom, such as: &quot;\\"I've seen people wear out, forget their purpose. But, an old bird dog, when autumn comes, always can smell tomorrow on the wind.&quot; And: &quot;There's no surer way to friendship than to praise a stranger's dog.&quot; Or, &quot;a morning hunt's missed is one you'll never have again.&quot; Chronicle is a time well spent, foraging in the fields of the heart."},{"Title":"Rufus Chronicle : Another Autumn","review":"I dislike books about dogs as a general rule, but The Rufus Chronicle was an unexpected treasure. Gusewelle speaks with a solid yet familiar voice about the joys and the learning curve of raising a dog from a pup with the intent for it to be a hunting dog. I haven't hunted or had a dog for many years, but with every turn of the page I was transported back to a time when my greatest pleasure was taking to the field with my canine companion. This book has the rare quality of speaking to the reader on a basic human level, causing you to not only remember scenes from your past, but also sounds, smells, and feelings. If you hunt, keep dogs, or are simply an animal lover with a big heart, then you must read this book."},{"Title":"Rufus Chronicle : Another Autumn","review":"This book catches your attention immediately.

The essays are charming, very comical at times, and describe the lessons Rufus attempts to teach each of his family members over the thirteen years of his life. Anyone who has ever cared for, loved, and shared a home with a dog will appreciate this book, and smile, chuckle, and weep at the memories evoked with regard to having known his or her own pets, and from being acquainted with the wonderful creatures we know as dogs, in general. If I have a &quot;criticism&quot; of this book, it is that it left me longing to hear more about Rufus, his sometimes bumbling &quot;master&quot;, a! nd the rest of his loving family (which eventually included two of his sons)."},{"Title":"Rufus Chronicle : Another Autumn","review":"This is a tremendous book.

Birren and Kathryn CochranI have led Guided Autobiography groups using, Telling the Stories of Life Through Guided Autobiography Groups, as my guide. The manual has proven to be the ticket to success!.Guided Autobiography is an ordered, logical process of sequential steps that assist in writing one's life story. Each of the ten week sessions focuses on a theme that explores the important aspects of life and provides sensitizing questions as a guide to uncover the true life story. The purpose is an exploration of one's own life in a meaningful way that isself-enriching and can also be left as a legacy for family members. The group process supports this end and provides the security and encouragement for self-exploration.James Birren and Kathryn Cochran have provided guidelines to lead groups from the initial steps of recruiting group members to the final wrap-up session and saying good bye. Complete lesson plans are included that cover every feature of the weekly session. Each of the ten-week sessions includes a specific checklist, e.g., reminders to bring name tags, roster sheet, paper, pens, etc. to ensure success. The sensitzing questions, one of the keys to the Guided Autobiography process, areincluded for each life theme. Furthermore, there are additionalsuggestions and techniques for each session to stimulate creative writing skills, use of metaphor, and prompts to prime memories among others.Having the training manual when running Guided Autobiography groups is like having a professional pack your suitcase when you embark on an extended ten week journey; nothing has been forgotten, the proper clothes for each occasion and all weather conditions have been anticipated, everything is mixed and matched perfectly, and all that's left is for you to enjoy the trip.Telling the Stories of Life Through Guided Autobiography Groups does all that and more. Having the training manual frees you to fully engage yourself in the exciting Guided Autobiography process and grow along with your fellow travelers."},{"Title":"Telling the Stories of Life through Guided Autobiography Groups","review":"This book describes in great detail the method James Birren has used for over a quarter of a century. It contains very useful and evocative prompts covering major areas of life to use with autobiography groups. Its advice on group organization and facilitation is outstanding, revealing the knowledge, perception, skills and experience of the authors. The tone throughout the book is one of respect and attention to the uniqueness and dignity of all individuals involved, not surprising to any familiar with the career of or personally acquainted with its major author, James Birren.I found that this handbook also provided innumerable aids in facilitating a process similar to Guided Autobiography, \\"Life Review,\\" for groups in a variety of settings--nursing homes, retreat and senior centers, faith sharing groups and training of counseling and health care professionals. There is nothing important left out from the organization to the implementation of such groups. The insightful and sensitive prompts provided addressing a person's life story have routinely produced rich responses from those involved. While not the major intent of the book, utilizing the process described has not failed to produce group bonding in the groups where it has been used.Particular attention should be paid to the leadership of these groups. Experienced leaders will recognize the wise advice and others will have sound counsel from Birren and Cocharan about the skills needed and pitfalls to be avoided. I highly recommend the book for guided autobiography and other similar groups."},{"Title":"Telling the Stories of Life through Guided Autobiography Groups","review":"Does to perfection what the book title suggests. The authors have given a helpful, and essential, description of the qualities which a group faciitator should possess. Following this the whole program is set out clearly, week by week, with useful suggestions for the presenter. This is a rich source of experience which has been shared so generously by the authors. Dr.James Birren and colleague have practised and shared a wonderful journey to be enjoyed by many people. The group I am leading is highly motivated; they are finding that their involvement not only gets them moving to write their stories but it also becomes a truly desirable social experience."},{"Title":"Telling the Stories of Life through Guided Autobiography Groups","review":"An inspiring and meticulous Handbook that provides everything you need to know about conducting groups using this proven methodology. Includes \\"camera-ready\\" materials for planning, promoting, organizing, and conducting your course -- from the initial news release, to the final session evaluation form. The authors are the originator of the method, James Birren, a giant in the field of gerontology, and an experienced practitioner."},{"Title":"Telling the Stories of Life through Guided Autobiography Groups","review":"I found this book to provide excellent guidance on facilitating a Life Writing course. I had no experience in running a Life Writing Program but with the lesson outlines and other important suggestions included I found my feet very quickly. I have to admit, I adapted some of the lesson plans and put more emphasis on writing exercises which stimulated people's memories, creativity and flow, rather than personal development.The groups I've taught were mainly older people, aged 60 years +, and they seemed to appreciate this focus. The sensitizing questions and weekly topics offered in the book and given out to participants seemed to stimulate a lot of writing and creativity. One of the Senior groups I ran wanted the course to run 24 weeks rather than 12 and has kept meeting (self run) weekly for nearly 18 months. The group is about to publish a book of stories. There also seems to be friendships along with confidence and well developed writing capacity among the participants. After a year some members had written more than 25,000 words on their life story. I suggest reading Gabrielle Rico's book, Writing the Natural Way also, as her writing exercises help people overcome writing blocks and can be incorporated into lessons."},{"Title":"Ellis Island: Tracing Your Family History Through America's Gateway","review":"The first chapters of the book describe the history of Ellis Island, and its role in American history. After reading the first two sentences of the book, we have already learned that Ellis Island is a \\"treshold of liberty\\" and \\"the symbolic shrine to freedom and opportunity\\". The first half of the book is filled with similar platitudes.The author seems to be more interested in reinforcing romantic prejudices than in factual correctness. An example is name changes at Ellis Island. \\"Names were often a problem\\", writes Mrs. Szucs. \\"Not all immigrants could spell their names, and baffled officials jotted down names as they sounded.\\" Those officials handled thousands of immigrants, and it would take more than a foreign-sounding name to \\"baffle\\" them. Name changes at Ellis Island were rare. Mrs. Szucs should have known better.Another myth that the author reinforces but should have debunked is the \\"ocean journey that could last several months\\". The era of Ellis Island was also the era of steam ships. Maybe some ocean journeys lasted several months, but most of them lasted only a couple of weeks.Later chapters are more down to earth, giving practical, useful (albeit terse) information on tracing immigrant ancestors (not limited to Ellis Island)."},{"Title":"Comprehension Instruction: Research-Based Best Practices","review":"A very useful book for those seeking to apply a research based approach to improving their pedagogical knowledge.

Freedom of the Hills for example.Illustrations are nice, but entertaining at it's best value relative to other books. considering it truly offers less than dozen knots and hitches, with variations in all it's pages (been a while since I referred to this book.)Image on the cover is probably not that dangerous as suggested by another reader, but definitely outdated practice of rappeling.Advantage, in the initial days of your rope work learning, you could dog ear this book, as is less bulky to carry around your garage."},{"Title":"Knots & Ropes for Climbers (Outdoor and Nature)","review":"I really liked the book, the drawings are great and the words are fun. I was rappeling not too long ago using the prusik to make me safe like they do on the cover of the book. The prusik tightened onto the rope just at the end of my reach, and I was hanging from the one loop around my leg. It was really uncomfortable and it took me a long time to get free. I asked a guide friend and he showed me two much safer ways to do the setup.

No nonsense, very clear, easy to figure out illustrations (really Mike Clelland is possibly the best, to say nothing of his great cartoons).

It's not just a collection of a large number of knots you could use and have at it sort of thing. Since there are not that many that a climber truly needs (or wants), this book's it.

It is a book for the serious seamstress, who has already mastered the elements of embroidery and now wants to go on to something more imaginative that will tax her skill. It is sure to provide a source of stimulating ideas, as well as expert advice on technique. The book is divided into three sections, the first dealing with the nature of fabrics, and the suitability of various kinds when used in applique, patchwork raised surfaces, and hand and machine embroidery. The second is on threads- the many different kinds, and their many different uses. The third deals with the mixed techniques of print embroidery. The illustrations are superbly reproduced, and show the smallest detail with great clarity. They are drawn from both historic and modern sources, ranging from a seventeenth-century night-shirt, through Victorian Samplers to wonderfully imaginative modern abstracts and clever 'free needleweaving' by schoolgirls."},{"Title":"Pattern and embroidery","review":"Embroidery, like crochet, patchwork and rug making, has made an enormous comeback. There is, however, a vast difference between the embroidery of today and some of the rather insipid type of work that was found in so many Victorian households. Because machines can do so much in the way of stitchery these days, hand embroidery has to be completely individual in design and full of character in order to compete. Gratifyingly, a return is evident to many of the stitches used in the Seventeenth century and earlier, and these are sometimes combined most effectively with modernistic designs. Moreover, much of the handwork done nowadays is used for interior decoration, rather than for small items such as traycloths, or on clothes. For those who are skilful with the needle and interested in this kind of work, this book is full of ideas to stimulate the imagination, and the basic kind of instruction which a beginner needs. It contains a collection of pictures of different pieces of work, some ancient, some modern. The chapter on patchwork, an old art now very mod, suggests varying ways of joining pieces of material to achieve variety in the appearance of the work. For instance, attractive pictures can be made merely by using different shaped patches- another idea for interior decorating. The section on raised surface, quilting in particular, is unusual. In case you think quilting is only for making quilts, or possibly skirts, try this: When embroidering a figure, pad the face, hands and feet. the resulting picture looks very different from that with a flat surface. The book contains on applique; the effects achieved by using grainy fabrics on a smooth background; drawn thread and cut fabrics work: net darning; needle and felt weaving (working over the warp threads of a fabric to create a new surface texture) and blackwork, one of the most effective types of embroidery."},{"Title":"Pattern and embroidery","review":"The book will be useful for students in colleges of education and those studying for examinations, and also for teachers since it explains the effects which can be achieved by the use of different techniques. It points out that techniques are chosen for a particular purpose and are not purely accidental. The reader is helped thereby to look more critically at finished work. The inclusion of comparable techniques in both historic and present-day embroidery is very valuable, making students aware that many so-called 'new ideas' can be found in historic work, thus making museum study more interesting and profitable. The problems of printed fabrics with embroidery are explained with sound advice and some stimulating experimental ideas."},{"Title":"Pattern and embroidery","review":"This is a beautifully produced book of particular interest to the advanced student of embroidery, studying this subject on an intellectual level. But it is a stimulating ideas source for anyone.

The book is divided into three main sections. The first is concerned with the nature of fabric, the effect of patterned fabrics and their suitability when used in the techniques of applique, patchwork, raised surfaces, hand and machine embroidery. The second section on threads is divided into two parts. The first deals with drawn fabrics and thread, net darning, needleweaving, blackwork, and canvas stitches; the second with embroidery stitches and the combination of embroidery with print. The third section examines the effect that different grounds have on the print and so on the type and style of the embroidery.

I am just under 60 years of age and I grew up in the town I live in. Growing up there were no book stores and the only place in town to find a paperback or two, was the local newspaper distributor. One morning after we suffered one of the great northeaster snowstorms out here, I wandered over to said newsstand to pick us some comic books and I looked through a shelf with 10 or 11 paperback books on it. The title herein was one of the books on that stand and I quickly flipped through it and noticed the great selection of poems and poets. The poets were strangers to me, I was in 10th grade at the time, but I was intrigued and bought the book. That paperback has been with me through thick and thin. Late nights after dances, or lonely evenings alone, off to college, and through every move I made after that, the book was a mainstay. I learned about the poets, one by one, especially attracted to Edgar Lee Masters and the Revolt of the Village type writers. This book introduced me into a world that prove to be a wonderland of scholarly and leisurely delight.The cover has been worn off the book and I have many other books about the poets and their lives and styles, but Untermeyer's masterpiece has remained by my side and will stay with me until the end. It was an education as well as a treasury, and it turned my small town head in a direction that would offer me solace and pleasure for the days of my life. One in a million, I expect that everyone has a special book that changed their life, but this is the one for me.

Tory had special sensory skills that allowed her to see and know things that others could not. She had actually used her powers to help locate missing children during her years in New York. The mystery of the brutal death of her childhood friend still plagued her, and was part of the reason she was returning to Progress. She was also attempting to confront and banish the lingering sense of failure and fear instilled by her father.When she arrived in Progress to open up an artistic gift shop, she immediately caught the eye of Cade Lavelle, the older brother of her former friend, Hope. Cade was attracted to her, even though she brought back painful memories of his younger sister. Hope's twin sister, Faith, is the bad girl in the plot with her flamboyant, lazy ways and string of failed marriages.The book is populated with unique and interesting characters and quaint depictions of small town life. Tory's vow to solve the mystery of Hope's death provides a level of intrigue and suspense that serves as an interesting back-drop for the burgeoning romance between she and Cade. Another sub plot is the developing romance between Faith and Wade, the town's vet and Cade's best friend.Although the outcome of the romance is predictable, the solution to the string of murders is surprising, and the plot keeps you intrigued to the last pages of the book. Nora Roberts has mastered the art of weaving romance into a believable and interesting story."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I've never written a review before, because I haven't felt strongly enough about a book to do so, but here goes:While reading Carolina Moon, I was entranced from the beginning. Tory Bodeen's story was exremely fascinating as are the alternate charachters in the book.The variety of twists and turns in plot kept me turning pages. Throughout reading the book it was as if turning each page, you didn't quite know what was going to happen next, and to whom!Personally, I found this book to be one of Nora's BEST! I have read a lot of her books, but in all honesty hadn't read the last few. I am glad someone suggested it to me, and I will be going back to read the ones I have missed.I did not want to put it down. Excellent creativity in development of plot scenes and characters. I found Carolina Moon had just the right amount of detail which enabled me to get lost in the story so I could envision myself right there amongst the action.Of course I found Tory (Victoria)to be an extremely powerful character, which in my opinion did not overpower the story itself. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I figured out the murderer by mid book mainly because I know Nora Roberts style of having a surprise ending that could still make sense to the story and so it was easy to figure out. Still I read it through to be sure I was right. The romance didn't make me feel anything. The characters didn't seem to connect in a way that made me feel that they were honestly in love. The lead male was two dimensional and even the lead female was a little too cold at times but still had depth. The theme of sex and violence was a nice change for me. I enjoyed that it was a little different from all her books and more of a mystery. I wanted more of a closure at the ending, but it kind of ended abruptly. Also, there were times when the story dragged as Roberts tried to flesh out small characters. I could have done with out that but still it was interesting and a good book to read if there's nothing else to do."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I read this book, and the comparison IMMEDIATELY jumped out at me. I gave it to mys sister, without telling her what I saw, and she got the connection too. I mean, the small, southern town, the death, the separation, the children of both the founding family and of the resident white trash, the hero's sister. All of it was eerily familiar. Even Robert's inclusion of &quot;the sight&quot; smacked of Linda Howard.Still, the comparison didn't disturb me. I love Howard, and I liked &quot;After the Night,&quot; but this was so much better. All of the characters were more appealing, and the story was stronger, and much more sympathetic. in ATN, there was a vicious arrogance about the hero, and an old, cruel conflict that I never felt was fully resolved, or that he was ever even really sorry for.The characters in CM are stronger, and much more grown up. They have conversations that last more than ten minutes at a time, don't solve every problem with hot, hard sex, but make a connection on a more intellectual level. So, yeah, they're similar, but this one comes out on top!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This was a different story line for Roberts, but the great mix of characters make it all worth while. The flash backs and the suspense were excellent. The bond that Tory shared with Hope is undeniable. Never have I read a book that completely shocked me at the end. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"As usual, enjoyed the romance of Nora Roberts -- and in this case the unusual qualities of the heroine -- but the mystery aspect of the story was lackluster in its resolution."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Many years after leaving the small town of Progress, Tory Bodeen returned home to the Lavelle family who held her responsible for her best friend's, Hope Lavelle, murder; the father who loved raising his hands to women and inducing violence; Cade, the only Lavelle who sees her innocence; And the killer who took her friend's life and is now awaiting to take hers.Carolina Moon is a nice, sweet love story with not much conflict or intrigue, but full of entertaining characters and a nice plot. It's not a story that will leave a lasting impression, but it's a nice way to escape everyday life, and after all, isn't that why people read?"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Carolina Moon will be added to Carnal Innocence and Hidden Riches as my three all time favorite books by Nora Roberts. This story was completely enthralling. Faith, the heroine, goes back home to confront her past and solve the long-ago murder of her childhood friend, and falls in love with Faith's brother, Cade. Nora's writing just keeps getting better. I was immersed in this story from start to finish. The only thing that marred my enjoyment was the characterization. With all that happened in the story, I didn't feel as connected to the hero and heroine as I usually do in Roberts's books. However, that fact doesn't detract from Carolina Moon's top notch mystery. This is one book you'd be ill-advised to miss!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I have read Nora Robert's books for the past 8 years or so, and am happy to report that I loved this book. Her characters were well developed, the plot very interesting and the ending was a little out of left field, I mean it kept me guessing. I really enjoyed the characters of Tory, Cade, Wade, Faith, and Iris. Hannibal was really scary as Tory's father. Those of you who haven't read it yet, please stop here. I thought the end was anticlimatic at first but then the real ending was a bit of a surprise. This book reminds me of Nora's earlier masterpieces such as Carnal Innocence, Divine Evil and True Lies. Of her series romances I enjoyed the &quot;Born in...&quot; series. However, I haven't had the urge to read the others. I tend to enjoy her novels that stand alone rather than those in a series. Overall this book was quite engaging and I really enjoyed it. Neither diehard Nora fans nor new readers will be disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Once again Nora Roberts visits the south and spinns a marvelous tale. Tory just &quot;knows things,&quot; which gets her in trouble with her Bible thumping father. Her only friend understands her,and they have a deep friendhsip as only two young girls can during the summer between childhood and adolesence. This leads to tragedy, and this is where Nora Roberts glows in her writing. Returning home after self-exile, Tory discovers Kincade, and the story takes off from there. She weaves the threads of youthful friends, tragic death, and &quot;knowing things,&quot; artfully to grab the reader and wring you dry. This has to be the BEST Nora Roberts book yet. You might want to check out &quot;Carnal Innocence,&quot; an earlier work, also with a southern setting, but equally gripping story line."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I don't know how Nora Roberts consistently creates stories and characters that alternately have you laughing and crying, in between being scared to death, but I am so glad that she does.Tory is one of her best heroines to date and Cade is her match. The love between Tory and her murdered little friend, Hope, is touching, real and tragic as Tory keeps &quot;seeing&quot; Hope's murder over and over. Tory's efforts to deal with Hope's death after almost 20 years and solve her murder, as well as come to terms with her abusive father, is a very compelling read. In addition, there is a great secondary love story for Cade's remaining sister, Faith.The action and suspense keep building and the identity of the killer is a shock.Can't wait for her next book. Thank God she is such a quick (and Fabulous) author."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"With some authors, you read one book, and you've read them all....the plots are just so similar. Not so with Nora Roberts. Carolina Moon is another wonderful story, with the main character, Tory, bringing a smile to your face with her wit, just after you've grabbed a kleenex to wipe away a tear for what she has endured in her life. Ms. Roberts makes you feel the terror that Tory feels as she unwillingly &quot;sees&quot; things she wishes she didn't. Her characters and storyline are so well developed that you find yourself drawn into the action as if you were there yourself. As with most of her books, I only put it down with great reluctance and almost finished it in one sitting."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Carolina Moon was fascinating with Tory Bodeen's psychic ability adding an spooky quality to the story. When Tory decides to return home to open a store she also decides she will put to rest her tragic past. A past the includes the murder of her best friend and the memories of a brutal father.There is a romance that develops between Tory and Cade, her deceased best friend's brother. A friendship is also developed between Tory and Faith, her deceased best friend's twin sister.I was falling in love with the town, feeling like the characters were my friends too, and all around impressed with Robert's technical skill in this novel. Nora Roberts knows how to deliver a great romantic and suspenseful novel. Carolina Moon is no exception!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I've always been able to depend on Nora Roberts for an entertaining story, but her latest works have been top of the line storytelling at it's best. Carolina Moon is a bit more gritty and earthy than some of her prior novels. It's a well rounded read, filled with complex characters and intense plot lines. Tory, the heroine, is quite engaging, not a simpering southern belle, but a deep individual coming to terms with her past as well as looking towards her future. Cade, as the understanding hero of the book, is not just a spoiled rich boy, but a man who tries his best to be a fair person in a climate where right isn't always the most popular course to follow. With supporting characters that are just as interesting as the leads, this book is a can't-put-down kind of story, with nail-biting intensity. It's Nora Roberts at her best!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Tory Bodeen and Hope Lavelle were inseparable eight year olds. When Tory is unable to meet Hope at their special place after a beating from her father, Hope is goes alone and is murdered. Due to her psychic ability, Tory is able to see it as it happens and leads the Lavelle's to Hope. Unfortunately it is too late, and no one believes her about her gift. She hasn't been back for 18 years but is compelled to return because Tory's murder still haunts her.Cade Lavelle has always had a soft spot for Tory, and was left feeling empty when she left so many years ago. When he tries to get close to Tory, she rebuffs him because her second sight offends most people she comes in contact with. They feel uncomfortable about the secrets that are revealed to her. Cade eventually wins her over with his sexiness and charm. When Hope's killer takes another life, they realize they can't move forward until the past is put to rest.The characters in this story are so strong and well developed. Tory and Cade are wonderful, but so are the supporting characters like Wade and Faith. The romance is to die for, and the mystery will draw you in and keep you guessing until the very end."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"For some reason I didn't like this new book by Nora Roberts. It seems to me that there is not a strong relationship between Cade and Tory. I don't think her characters had as much depth as they usually do in her books. Nora is still my favorite author, but I would suggest her mystery books, by J.D.Robb pseudonym, as a better alternative to Carolina Moon. Witness in Death was just released and it was excellent."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"WOW! This book was excellent - I was up until 3:00 AM reading it because I could not put it down. I loved the characters in this novel, especially Faith. The book kept me guessing until the end as to who the killer was (and what a shock it was). A must read!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I couldn't wait for this book to come out and I wasn't disappointed! Nora Roberts sometimes gets accused (sometimes justly so) of making her heroines weak and dependent, but Tory doesn't fit that mold no matter how much she herself feels she may fall apart. Which doesn't mean she doesn't come to need and depend on Cade, the wonderful brother of her childhood friend who comes back into her life. It just means that, having taking control of her life and become her own master, she's finally ready to share that life with someone who's not looking to control it. The relationship between these two was very realistic, very sweet, and a necessary part of Tory's healing process from her abusive childhood. As a murder mystery, there were few real &quot;clues&quot; as to who the killer was, but I did guess halfway through. This didn't diminish my enjoyment, it just made me want to see if I was right. I also noticed the screw-up other readers have mentioned that the author made in terms of the timing of the murders -- I wondered if in editing all the dates got mistaken by 10 years or so. After puzzling over the inconsistencies and then reading the reviews on this website where other people noticed the same thing, I let it go and didn't let it hinder my enjoyment of the book at all. It'll get fixed in the next printing. Lastly, I agree the ending was fairly abrupt. The book definitely could have used an epilogue or something so that the reader would get some payoff and see Tory and Cade happy, Faith restored (pardon the pun), and Progress healed. All in all, an excellent, page-turning story."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Tory Bodeen is blessed or cursed (however one may view it) with the gift of 2nd sight. Just about everyone in town is either afraid of her or fears her. Her best friend, Hope was murdered and Tory sensed her friend's demise. I've read many Nora Robert's books and this one was one of the spookiest. I like the way the author let Tory have conversations with Hope through dreams that didn't appear to be quite dreamy. There was one scene when Tory had fallen asleep while Hope's killer is nearby and Hope warns her. I felt a chill up my spine when Tory pops up out of her sleep like a jack-in-the-box. I liked Cade, too. He was able to empathize with Tory, even though his mother blamed her for Hope's death. He was earnest in his feelings for Tory, even though she's afraid to get close to anyone, thanks to Hope's death and past child abuse. Hope's twin sister even comes around, despite being jealous of Tory and Hope's friendship. If you like reading a story with a good mix of mystery and paranormal, this one's a good bet."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this book - I had the murderer picked in the first 50 pages and found the overall story to be extremely predictable. I thought the characters were too simple; the good were very good and the bad very bad. There was very little depth or complexity to the characters or plot. This was the first Nora Roberts book I've read and it will be the last."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Sorry for Nora's fans and all the people who love this book for my negative review.I honestly think this book is a VERY fogettable book. Not that I didn't enjoy reading this book (Nora just can't write a terrible book, her books always at least enjoyable). It just that this book has NOTHING to remember. It's an average book with an average ingredients that, apart from having Nora's name on the cover, has nothing impressive enough to stick in my memory. The mystery&amp;suspense part isn't captivating enough to be a page turner. The romantic part is shallow and unbelievable, no touching or sparking moment. The killer identity is easy to guess, it'd have been better if it's a surprise. The characters're even easier to forget, none of them have any potential to make me care or felt anything for them. After I finished this book I took it to an exchanged shop with just a little hesitation.And never wonder why I didn't mention any scenes or character's names at all in my review, I've forgotten them already!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"\\"Carolina Moon\\" by Nora Roberts is a skilfully rendered tale of mystery and romance. Roberts has created a chilling story, full of rich characters and haunting imagery that is sure to stay with readers long after the book is done.Tory Bodeen has returned to her hometown of Progress, South Carolina to deal with her memories of an abusive father and her childhood friend Hope's brutal murder. She is determined to open her own store and rebuild her life, and so sets about doing just that.As Tory struggles to deal with her disturbing visions of Hope's death, she develops a relationship with Hope's older brother, Cade Lavelle. Tory and Cade find comfort and passion in each other's arms, and their romance is exquisitely tender and highly erotic.Unfortunately, Tory's connection to Hope's death makes her the focus of the Lavelle family's hatred. Cade stands by Tory, but the bitter accusations and threats from his mother have Tory questioning the future of her relationship with Cade. Cade and Tory have an unbreakable bond in their grief and love for Hope, but will that grief bring them closer together or tear them apart?Living back in Progress has been hard for Tory, but it's about to get a lot more frightening and dangerous than she ever expected, because Hope's killer is still at large, and is much, much closer than anyone realizes!\\"Carolina Moon\\" is a captivating mix of mystery, suspense, and romance, guaranteed to keep you turning pages. The storyline is highly original and very intriguing. You don't want to miss this one, so buy it today and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I'm a big fan of this writer's (usually) but I'm sorry to say a little dissappointed with this book. It was okay but not up to Nora's usual norm. Will I buy her next book? CERTAINLY! I'm one of her biggest fans!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Wow!! What can I possibly say about this book except that it is great! Definitely one of the best books I've read this year. Carolina Moon has everything needed for a great womens novel: romance, intrigue, suspense, jealousy, characters you love to hate and to spice things up just a bit, murders.This was the first Nora Roberts book I've read and I simply enjoyed it to the max. Carolina Moon is well written. It is written in present day and with flashbacks to the past. I thought the flashbacks added in made the book all the better. The characters were well developed and well written. The plot was fantastic. The whole storyline was just great! I just can't say enough about this book. It is definitely a must read that will keep you away from your work and keep you up at night!!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I hesitated when purchasing this book. After reading Carolina Moon, I have a new respect for Nora Robert's writing. This is a wonderful book. Read this book slowly. The characters, the dialogue and the clever descriptions (analogies) are a delicious treat! I cheated and looked at the back (don't spoil it for yourself) page. Even though I knew the ending, I went back and enjoyed each page. Couldn't put it down. The characters were strong. Although there were evil characters, as all romance thrillers should have, the balance was perfect. I felt good after reading this book."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I can't really share why I think she was unfair to her readers in this one without revealing too much of the plot. But let me at least say that I don't think she truly provided clues so that a close reader could have figured out the mystery. When the killer was revealed, instead of being filled with amazement and wonder at her cleverness in hiding his true identity, I was just filled with resentment. She had provided almost no clues to his identity and the ones she did provide were based more on prejudice against a minority that even politically correct Americans still find it acceptable to put down. I can't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I have read and enjoyed a few of Nora Roberts books, specifically Inner Harbor. Unfortunately, Carolina Moon is not one of Robert's better efforts. Unfortunately she seems to be moving into a phase where she feels compelled to create plots with explicit sexual violence and murder scenes, and although all the other reviews I have read have been OK with it, haven't even mentioned it in fact, I am not. Nasty rape scenes are definitely not something I want to read fictionalized accounts of for entertainment, and sorry, I don't believe such explicitness is required for plot development. If you are not the type to be bothered by it though, this book is formulaic yet readable and will hold your attention on a airplane."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I really enjoyed this novel. I will have to say that in the first few pages, I was a little confused about the characters. It is worth a little confusion to forge ahead. What a delight! Carolina Moon has a little bit of everything including murder, romance, small town gossip, spousal abuse, child abuse, and so much more. One of those books you just can't put down. For me the ending was the best. Wow, what a surprise. You won't be disappointed, so go ahead and read it."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Nora Roberts is an excellent romance writer, she's also an excellent mystery writer.

My Mother-in-law suggested Nora Roberts so I opted for this title. Never before have I been so engrossed in a novel that I actually envisioned it as a movie, with Sandra Bullock as Tori, Matthew McConnaghey (sp?) as Cade, and Gwennyth Paltrow as Faith. FUN!

Wonderfully exciting reading!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Carolina Moon kept my attention during the entire book."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I've been reading Nora Roberts for about three years and always enjoy her books. Carolina Moon was no exception. I especially enjoyed the relationship between Faith and Wade. However, being a veterinarian myself, I can say the scenes in the vet clinic were completely unrealistic. At times, I found myself laughing at how off base Roberts was on the workings of a veterinary clinic. Otherwise, the book was good, although the ending was a bit strange."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"What a great read..N&gt;R has really done it this time. I could not put it down and hated when it ended. Growing up in many of the same places that the book was set in, the scenes were accurate and the book riveting. Until the final moment I thought the bad guy was the father. If you read one book this year make in Carolina Moon."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I started reading this book Friday night and finished Saturday night. It held my interest. Very suspenseful. I will have to admit I'd figured out who the killer was. Once revealed I wish the author had gone back and showed more people's reactions. But, I still enjoyed."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I have read just about everything Nora Roberts has written and would count this one as one of her best. I loved the relationship between Cade and Tory and the secondary relationship between Faith and Dr. Wade. Nora Roberts knows how to write a mystery and weave in a great love story or two. The characters in this book were likeable and a little quirky. I loved the &quot;small town&quot; gossip. I would definitely recommend this book. Some of the subject matter in this book is disturbing (child abuse, rape), but central to the character development and plot."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Nora Robert's book have absolutely no originality. Carolina Moon is no exception.Her books are all copies of each other, with different character names and settings. They all follow a predictable pattern: a hurt, emotionally abused heroine goes back to her hometown or some other place to solve a mystery or murder from her past. She meets a gorgeous, oh-so-wonderful man who falls in love with her within two days (even though she treats him terribly). She acts like she wants nothing to do with him until two pages before the book ends. She then declares she is madly in love with him and cannot survive without him *snort* and they live happily ever after. Oh yeah, while they're &quot;falling in love&quot; (and by the way, Robert's love scenes are terrible; I usually end up laughing at the absurdity of most of them), they come with inane clues and try to solve the mystery/murder but the suspect always end up being someone who makes no sense at all.At any rate, I am not reading another Robert's book again. I can only stomach the same old plot so many times."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"just when i thought that i couldnt get interested in reading again because of my mothers illness i picked up nora roberts book and i just couldnt put itdown- it took my mind off of my troubles and i was able to again enjoy reading. this book doesnt let you down for just one minute- it is even better than rivers end which i thought she outdid herself as an author"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"How can you tell any of Nora Roberts' single title hardcovers apart? They all have the same stock characters and plots, she only changes the setting: The trampy girl with a heart of gold, the artistic heroine with a disturbing murder in her past, the quirky townsfolk, the bitter martiarch, etc. The story is predictable, as are the romances. Just once I'd like to see Roberts make the hero the killer---but then she wouldn't sell nearly as many books. Disappointing and uninvolving, it's simply a retread of any of her earlier books."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"When she was eight, Tory Bodeen witnessed the murder of her best friend . . . though she wasn't there. Visions of what happened to Hope assaulted her then, and haunt her now. It's time for Tory to come home and face the past -- face the visions that she can't escape. Tory opens a new store, and opens up the past someone hopes will stay buried.Cade Lavelle lost his sister Hope when she was brutally murdered. And though the rest of his family survived, he lost them as well that fatal night. And now Tory Bodeen is back, claiming she &quot;saw&quot; what happened that night and plans to find out who killed Hope. Tory could be trouble . . . or she could be the best thing that ever happened to him.Carolina Moon is a heart-touching romance, as well as a classic whodunit with a paranormal, but not overwhelming, twist that makes for a powerful, page-turning read."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This was a great book in a way that left you on the edge of your seat. Nora Roberts plays with your mind and leads you to believe two different things. It's a book about friendship, evil ways of adolescense, and love. I would definately recommend this book."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This was one of Nora Robert's better recent efforts. Her one fault is that once the abused heroine meets up with Mr. Right and they get together, she never again has any fallout from abuse - and that just would not happen in real life! For what it's worth, I thought the heroine reached out the hero out of a need for affirmation that she was still alive, not out of callousness or insensitivity, although I can understand why that could be interpreted in that way. I really enjoyed the character of Faith in particular."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This was a good book. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I wish Roberts would have explored the reasons behind Tory's fathers rage and history of abuse. I just felt that was never really explored; Or even the relationship between her two parents. The other characters, especially Faith and Wade and Cade and Tory were really well developed."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"As an avid reader of Nora Robert's books, I was more than a little disapointed over her latest novel. As a South Carolinian, I found her depiction of small-town southern style accurate but I felt that she tried to force the entire character of Tory on the reader. The first chapter was unnecessary and the whole plot felt awkward. As always, however, she managed to heat up the story with steamy scenes and emotions. Loved the setting, but it didn't have the vintage twist and pull of a Robert's novel"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Excuse me, but wasnt anyone who has read this book as appalled as I was by the fact that the empath-heroine walks herself through the scene of a brutal rape/murder, basically experiencing everything the victim did, and then immediately goes home and has sex with her perfect love interest? Yuck! Until I reached that point, I was genuinely compelled by the book, the choppy writing and the inconsistencies notwithstanding. But that scene was utterly arrogant on Roberts' part. I'm willing to suspend disbelief and lose myself in a romantic fantasy, but it should at least ring A LITTLE BIT true. Am I as a reader supposed to immediately dismiss this perfectly nice girl (who could just as well have been the heroine of another romance) who's been brutally murdered and instead identify with a heroine so callous? Don't insult me."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I always buy Nora Roberts books--this one however was a disappointment to me. It seemed choppy and not believable.....and the ending just didn't seem to ring true. It just seemed like she rushed through writing it....I couldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I really enjoy Nora Roberts books and especially the once she writes under the name of J.D.Robb. Her style is very entertaining and keeps you involved in the story from the beginning till the end. Most of the time you are sorry to see the story come to a end. But this book is a big let down. From the first page on it is very hard to become involved into the story and to remain interested. It is not worth the money. I am sorry to say so. But it is true. It is a bit unrealistic,has some mistakes in it and even though that is not bad, the whole story is absolutely boring.Been there, done that, have read this multiple times before, is the type of feeling you get right away. The end unrealistic and the whole book feels so depressive and totally is not worth your time and not getting any better. I hope her next books are more like herself and her style again. I like changes but this is boring and almost makes you feel as if she didn't spend much time on it."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This is has got to be one of Nora's best books.

All I can say is the movie does not begin to feel the essence of the book. IT is a dark plot in some ways as it deals with child abuse, rape and murder but yet there is so much humor scattered through out the book which the movie completely missed. Tory's grandma is a gem and Aunt Rosie is hilarious as well as Faith is delightful. There is more to her than you first see. Wade's mother (Tory's aunt) is delightful also. Having seen the movie, I of course was not surprised by the murderer and in the movie had him picked out almost from the beginning. I think if you only read the book, it wouldn't be as easy to figure him out. Cade was great for Tory and understanding of her \\"gift\\". An Epilogue would have been nice a few years down the road to see what happened with Wade and Faith and to see if there were babies and etc. However, we can use our imaginations for that. THere were just os many interesting characters in this story that kept me interested to the end."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I had only read a few other Nora Roberts books at the time that I took this book out from my high school library.

I found myself very fond of the people in this story and concerned about what would happen to them. Any fan of Nora's or of good romantic stories will be pleased with this book. Loved it.Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel \\"To Be Chosen\\""},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Tory Bodeen had a pretty miserable childhood, growing up with a religiously fantatic father who physically beat her and a mother who didn't protect her. Her father tried to drive away Tory's gift, which was a psychic sense about people and their circumstances. She had one childhood friend, Hope Lavelle, who helped her escape her unhappy home each day as they did what children do...use their imagination freely and have fun. Unfortunately, at the age of eight, Hope was brutally murdered and Tory experienced the event psychically and was forever defined by her involvement. The murder remained unsolved and, after many years, Tory has returned home to Progress, South Carolina to make peace with her past and come to terms with herself.This is one of Nora's best romantic suspense stories I've read to date. It has a good, complex mystery, strong main characters in Tory and Cade Lavell (Hope's older brother), interesting secondary characters and a Southern backdrop. While there are a few quirky people in the town of Progress, they aren't stereotypically diminshed and are central to the main story and Tory's life. And, there are a few other romances in the works in addition to Tory and Cade, who is a real dream. Sometimes I thought he had psychic abilities in the way he knew how to just \\"be\\" for Tory, knowing exactly what she needed and when to dispense it.The descriptions in this story are vividly brought to life without the usual metaphors. There were occasions where I had to just stop and think about them, letting the words roll around in my head. This is a fine piece of writing.While I figured out the killer fairly early on, no way was I certain about my choice throughout the story and kept considering other possibilities. It's a good story, extremely well written and kept my interest throughout...no real lulls here. This one ranks in my top five of Nora's standalone titles."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I'm very happy with my book I got it before the time it was meant to be delivered and its great quality! I haven't read it yet but I'm looking forward to reading it.It looks like a fun and interesting book to read during work thank you for you prompt service and wonderful product."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I loved this book. It was my first Nora Roberts book and it turned me into an instant fan. I would suggest anyone who loves a mystery with a side of romance to purchase this book. It is a page turner!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"There is some suspense in this romantic suspense, but I was able to guess who the villain was. Parts of the book are reminiscent of other books by Roberts: Tory's little store in a small town is much like other little stores run by other heroines in small towns. I don't mind the author rehashing themes and plot devices, but sometimes I wish she'd come up with a wider range of careers. The best part of this book is the heroine, Tory, who is psychic and had an abusive childhood, but she is almost upstaged by the hero's sister, Faith, who is a restless, mean woman trying to overcome herself. There is a double romance to be enjoyed: Tory and Cade, Faith and Wade (who happens to be Tory's cousin and the town veterinarian). I'm not keen on the Cade and Wade rhyming names, though. Nora Roberts is known for witty dialogue, usually between the hero and heroine, but most of the best dialogue in this book is among other characters. But she is a highly competent writer and though this isn't her best book, it's worth reading."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"All the way through, the book was really good. I LOVE the name Kincade Lavelle. And I really liked all of the characters, especially Faith. There always seem to be great secondary characters in Roberts' books (Like Farley in Black Hills). The plot was good and so was the romance. I was very satisifed as the very end of the book neared.But in the last few pages, when you find out who the REAL murdering creep was, it ruined everything. when the identity of Hope's real murderer is tossed at you in like the last four pages, it isn't clever, it isn't good. This overall good story was ruined and left me very disappointed. There were no good clues leading up to make you believe he really was the killer. Roberts just kind of put him there, I suppose as like a final twist. Well, it stunk because it's unbelievable. Not even a spectacular kind of unbelievable, it was stupid. Completely stupid."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Tory Bodeen and Hope Lavelle were inseparable eight year olds. When Tory is unable to meet Hope at their special place after a beating from her father, Hope is goes alone and is murdered. Due to her psychic ability, Tory is able to see it as it happens and leads the Lavelle's to Hope. Unfortunately it is too late, and no one believes her about her gift. She hasn't been back for 18 years but is compelled to return because Tory's murder still haunts her.Cade Lavelle has always had a soft spot for Tory, and was left feeling empty when she left so many years ago. When he tries to get close to Tory, she rebuffs him because her second sight offends most people she comes in contact with. They feel uncomfortable about the secrets that are revealed to her. Cade eventually wins her over with his sexiness and charm. When Hope's killer takes another life, they realize they can't move forward until the past is put to rest.The characters in this story are so strong and well developed. Tory and Cade are wonderful, but so are the supporting characters like Wade and Faith. The romance is to die for, and the mystery will draw you in and keep you guessing until the very end."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"In reference to the unabridged audio, which is the same as reading the book, I will say that I throroughly enjoyed this story. Tory Bodeen returns to the town she grew up in to start her own business and to find out who killed her best friend Hope when they were children. In comes Cade, Hope's brother who is quite fond of Tory, in spite of his mother's demand that he not see her; the woman blames Tory for the death of her daughter. Tory, somewhat phychic can read minds and knows of the killers other victims. Faith, Hope's twin sister is a woman who while having resented Tory for her sisterlike relationship with her own twin is in my opinion a character I grew to like. Nevertheless, the ending of the book literally blindsided me. Not saying it was a bad ending, just not what I expected. If you haven't tried audio books (unabridged as you don't want to miss the details) they are great especially to those who like to walk with a walkman intact."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I had the pleasure of visiting South Carolina last summer which put me in the mood to read this book. There is something hauntingly beautiful about the area that fits the mood of the story very well. It is a mystery/romance, and so much of the book is itself unexplained and makes no sense. But it is a story well told that unfolds slowly and rewards you with a satisfying, if incomplete, ending. I liked this book. I liked these characters. I wanted to know more about them. I wanted all my questions answered, all the loose ends tied up. Alas, that was not the case. It was still a good story and I will probably reread it two or three times before my next vacation. Disturbing violent theme but not graphic. Exciting sex but not graphic. Some exploration of what makes a a family of adults function. Happy ending."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Tory and Hope were constant companions, twins of the soul even though Hope already had a real twin sister, Faith. Faith always resented the bond. Then one night all their lives were shattered. What was to be a midnight camp out by two 8 years olds bent on adventure, sees one girl beaten severely, another raped and dead in the swamp. Tory and Hope were to sneak out and meet late that night, but Tory's brutal father took a belt to his only child because she had the devil in her, she was born with 'the sight'. Bruised mentally and physically, she was unable to meet Hope as they planned. And it may have cost Hope her life. Though unable to go Hope's aid, Tory suffered the torment of 'seeing' her true friend murdered in a brutal fashion.Haunted by the dreams of Hope, Tory knows she must return to face the nightmare of what happened to Hope, and to stop the man who killed her friend, for he was killing still now 20 years later.Being back in lazy Southern town causes problems, for there are those that wish she had never returned to stir up old scars and memories. Faith still resents that her twin sister was closer to Tory. Cade, their older brother,wants answers about his sister's death he knows Tory holds, but he also want Tory.Is the mad man killing on August 23 the man that fathered Tory? Or one of the other upstanding citizens of Progress.This book won't let you but it down!!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I normally don't read \\"romance\\" novels (since I prefer Sci-Fi), but this was book was great! I was unsure of the culptrit right to the end. The love stories were a little saucy, but not too much so, and only added to the overall elevated emotion of the story. I especially appreciated the comic relief and Ms. Roberts' uncanny ability to draw the scenery so well. I look forward to reading some of her other books. I hope you enjoy it, too."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Robert's has outdone herself with Carolina Moon. Mixing intrugue, suspense, murder, laughter, and above all love. You'll find yourself wrapped up in Progress along with Tory trying to figure out just what happened 18 years before."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Well, it has all the goodies, good romance, great suspense, strong characters, but personally I found Faith and Wade's romance much more interesting than Cade and Tory's one, however it was great to read this amazing story."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This is story about a woman who is going back to past.

The author did a great job with how this book flowed and her description of the many characters in the book. I fell in love with the hero, Cade and how he stood by Tory. Tory annoyed me at times but then grew on me. They had great chemistry. Tory's opening up and sharing with Cade was touching and well written by the author. There were many other characters in this book that had their own story going on. At first, I detested Cade's rich, spoiled, self-centered sister Faith. However, by the end of the book, she totally redeemed herself and was my favorite character. I enjoyed most the dialogue in this book between Faith and whomever she was talking to. The suspense was great. However, the reason I am not giving this book 5 stars is because I felt the ending was flat. ***Spoiler Alert*** I felt in my opinion, the murderer and rapist was not realistic. I had a feeling it may have been him but dismissed it because what his age would have been when Hope was murdered. I know it is a fictional book, but an autopsy would not have revealed Hope was raped by a boy? A major clue. Due to that, I was left disappointed with who the murderer was. I felt the author just decided to make it him at the last minute. All in all, a book that caught my interest and held it!!!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"In the novel Carolina Moon, Nora roberts does an excellent job with characteristics and action.

Carolina Moon was my first book by this author, but it will definitely not be my last.I really enjoyed this book &amp; then couldn't wait for my 17 year old daughter to read it so we could compare notes. The character development is wonderful, as is the descriptive writing about this part of the country.

Tory was the daughter of an abusive father and a mother that stood by her husband. Her best friend, Hope Lavelle, was the daughter of a well-to-do family. After Hope was murdered, Tory eventually left her family and set out on her own. Tory has also been gifted with psychic powers; &quot;the sight&quot;, her grandmother called it. Now Tory is a grown woman and she's come back to her old home, moved into the house where she grew up on the Lavelle's property, and is opening her own business. Now she must learn to face the animosity of some, and the gossip of others, make her place in the town she once called home, and face the circumstances of Hope's death. She must discover who the murderer is, or she may be next."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I just finished Carolina Moon late last night and was enthralled, as usual, by Roberts' plot and characterization. I have not read so many of her novels that I am disappointed as some of her fans. Yet, having read The Villa beforehand, I do see a strong resemblance in character types, as one reviewer pointed out. Still, I enjoyed CM due to its energy, especially.Some negatives I found disappointing are the stereotyping of Southern people, the overworked setting of swamp vs. &quot;culture,&quot; the cruel, alcoholic father and abused family. I recently read Fox's Earth and find a strong similarity between Roberts' writing and that of Anne Rivers Siddons. I have grown weary of Siddons' rehashing of plots.I enjoyed the characterization of Faith the most. Cade was almost too good to be true, as was hero in Villa. Loved Aunt Rosie!Why were the FBI even in this one? Plenty of characters without them. Also, I occasionally was confused by the switching of points of view!Finally, the ending of this was surprising though not as shocking as that of Montana Sky.I will read others by Roberts and continue to consider her talents. This one held my interest and I have recommended it already to others."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"For some reason I alternate between loving her books or hating them. But this one was definately a winner. I loved the sister Faith, she was strong and sane and the real glue here. Roberts could have done a little more at the end(it seemed to run out of gas) but it was a worthwhile trip."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Carolina Moon is a fairly typical NR book in that the characters are well developed (especially the side line characters of Faith and Wade)there's a twist at the very end, which, even though fairly typical, was still unexpected in that I knew it was going to happen but didn't expect who it was.All in all other fine read. But then, I don't think I've read anything by NR that hasn't been."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I found this book to be a great, multi-faceted and deeply interesting read. The characters are very alive.. and a bit unpredictable. The setting is fabulous, the story line is great. Tori is a gutsy gal! The only problem I had with this book was the ending, although a totally unexpected surprise, seemed odd and a bit out of place in contrast to the rest of the book -- kind of weak. However..I did very much enjoy reading it and based on this one, can't wait to read another Nora Roberts novel."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I found this story to be a good read well up to Nora Robert's usual standards. Tory Bodeen grew up in an abusive home with a father who tried to beat her strange &quot;feelings&quot; out of her. She has psychic/empathic feelings and felt her best friend, Hope, being murdered at the age of 8. Tory returns to her home town to open a store in the area hoping to bring closure to the murder for herself. She becomes involved with Hope's older brother, Cade, and Hope's twin sister, Faith. With her return she stumbles on another murder out of the past and with research through an attorney friend discovers several other murders of slim, blonde, women who were the same age as Hope if she had lived and always in August the month of Hope's birthday. Her return is the catalyst for many of the town's citizens."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I really enjoyed this book, I loved the interaction of the characters, the growth they go through and the pain that Tory feels. I loved the friendship that blossomed between Faith and Tory and the reaction, they themselves had for it. I did feel that the ending was very abrupt, sort of like, all right, conflict settled, it would have been nice to actually read about the wedding,including the moth eaten dress and the moldy top hat. It would also have been nice to find out what happened to the killer and his wfie. The ending sort of left me hanging, unless there's a sequal planned. All in all this was a great read, I stayed up half the night trying to figure out who the killer was and was genuinly surprised by it."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Very Good Book. It has romance and mystery. It is one of Nora Roberts best books. I have read this book over and over again. The characters are well developed. The relationship between the charcaters are fun and meaningful. Again this is one of Nora Roberts best."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I thought this book was great. The combination of mystery with romance. One of my favorites!!!! - Would love more books just like this one. And a happy ending too."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I have grown up reading Nora Roberts' books, and I always eagerly anticipate the next release. &quot;Carolina Moon&quot; was absolutely worth the wait. Ms. Roberts did a fantastic job fleshing out the personality of the characters - once you turn the first page you are completely engrossed in the plot. If you read only one Nora Roberts book, this is it."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"There isn't anything to say about this novel that hasn't already been said by the other reviewers concerning the storyline. It is fantastic, I loved the characters-especially Faith. My two cents about this novel is this, if you plan on reading this, isolate yourself somewhere so you can read it straight through. You'll only get frustrated if you're interrrupted. Second, if you haven't read Carnal Innocence by Ms. Roberts go get it now. She uses the same type of southern characters with twice as much suspense. Carolina Moon is definitely a keeper, one you will find yourself reading again just to see what you missed the first time. The dialogue is snappy with some great one-liners. How Ms. Roberts keeps writing so many great novels is beyond me. She is truly one of the most creative writers I have ever read."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Nora Roberts keeps getting better and better. I've read all her books and enjoyed each and every one, but Carolina Moon was fantastic. I had to read it in one sitting and stayed up until 3:30AM to finish.

The story moves ahead 18 years and picks up w/Tory as an adult dealing with the ghosts of her past and present. \\"Carolina Moon\\" is a very well-written story and will keep you fascinated until the very conclusion. Supporting players such as Iris (Tory's grandmother) and Cecil (Tory's grandmother's hot boyfriend) as well as Wade (her cousin), add amazing color to the plot. Personalities are described so well you can almost see these people and feel for each in their dealings with life's turmoil as well as joy. I would definitely recommend this book to all, especially Nora lovers! It has murder, mystery, romance, and comedy. What more could you ask for in a book?"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This was the first book by Nora Roberts that I have read. Of course, now that I have read it, I plan on reading more of her books.The Story starts off with Tory (Victoria) coming back to her home town Progress to open up a little shop.

When she arrives, the town starts buzzing with gossip.Once she arrives, Hopes older brother, the dashing Cade Lavelle, falls madly in love with her. But, after a short while, strange things start happening in Progress. There are murders, and other bad misfortunes, that are all somehow connected to Tory.This was a great read.

A good read &amp; a good love story."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"The mystery kept me turning the pages, but I didn't quite get into the characters like I usually do in Nora Roberts' books. I think there were too many who were introduced for no real reason (like Cade's eccentric aunt). Tory's 'ability' seemed a bit unbelieveable at times, but her determination to make a name for herself in her hometown - where she didn't have any warm, fuzzy memories - made her a great lead anyway. And she found romance with Cade the older brother of her murdered childhood best friend. I thought I had the murderer figured out, but was proven wrong at the end."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"It took me a long time to finish this book because I boughtthe audio version, as I do with many books and have for years.I have to say that I have heard all kinds of narrators on thesebooks, some obviously better than others, but this was theworst I have ever heard. A horrible, grating, scratchy voice.Not the slightest change in inflection or voice from one character to the next. It was often impossible to follow whena different character was speaking so that the whole process oftrying to determine this was distracting. But the worst partwas just the voice. I finally gave up, something I've neverdone before, since I was enjoying the plot of the book. I wasn't about to buy the paperback, already feeling like thepublisher had cheated me by making the audio version unlistenable.Finally, a friend loaned me the paperback to read.I generally enjoyed it, there were several interesting characters, although I'm still at a loss about the confusionregarding the different dates stated about the murders, especially since the killer said Hope was the first, butthe book states the first murder took place 7 years beforeher death. Huh? I did think the killer was a bit far-fetchedand i think the book needed an epilogue. I'm not surewhat it is, but lately especially, I've noticed a real trendwith some established writers like Roberts, Sandra Brown, andStella Cameron, to name a few, that they seem to totally rush the endings. A lot of these books need an epilogue, but I guess it's just too much work for the authors to take the extra time?Anyway, other than that, it was a good book. I liked the main characters well enough and the mystery was a good one."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I just read this for the second time, and I was surprised that I had forgotten 'who dunnit'!

Now Hope is dead and Tory must find the courage to return to her hometown after running away for so long. Tory wasn't bad, she was special.

No one does all of the above as good as NR. I especially like the interaction between Tory and Hope's sister, and in turn between her and Tory's cousin.

Tory needed to grow a spine. Her ability to read people's minds was never really explained.

This books was very disappointing. The story wasn't so much about character development as creepy stuff."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I love Roberts' humor and writing style BUT I don't like to read books, particularly romance, that contain scenes of child abuse or sexual perversion. The graphic rating on these is not as high as her work as Robb but it's NOT her &quot;Born in&quot; series either. Please, can this type of book come with a warning label? Sort of like a the parental advisory found on CDs. If I want to read a description of how a child screams while being beaten by father's belt or how many times a rape victim gets smacked about, I'll start reading the horror stories in a big city paper."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Great book! It sent me &quot;over the moon!&quot;"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Nora Roberts' latest novel, \\"Carolina Moon,\\" fits quite comfortably in the category of romance.Unfortunately, that particular description seems to have a stigma that turns away people leery of the genre, especially men, expect the stereotypical white-knight, breathless-heroine, ripped-bodice plots.The readers that turn away are missing out.Most novels that are called romances are so much more than that, and just as deserving of readers' attentions as anything by John Grisham or Stephen King, or backed by Oprah Winfrey.\\"Carolina Moon\\" is no different. It is a tale that will thrill any romantic spirit, but also quick-witted, engaging, erotic and contains enough danger and mystery to make it a viable action-adventure.You won't be bored.As a child in South Carolina, eight-year-old Tory Bodeen escaped her abusive father's rage through the adventures she shared with Hope Levelle, the eight-year-old daughter of a wealthy family. When Hope was brutally murdered, shame and secrets surrounded Tory's departure.Years later, she's back in town where it all began - Progress, South Carolina - and the same whispers are still following her as she fights to make peace with what happened the night of Hope's murder.Along the way, Tory finds friendship with Hope's rebellious twin sister Faith, and love with Hope's older brother Cade. Just one problem - the monster who killed Hope is still free. And he's been waiting for Tory to return.Roberts has penned an edge-of-your-seat thriller. Each time Tory (who has a bit of a psychic thing going on) feels the presence of Hope's killer nearby, the reader's heart pounds with fear. It's a chilling whodunit, enhanced by the fact that everyone in town is suspect.It also deserves mention that one of the most interesting characters is Progress itself. The town has a mood, an aura of mystery to it, and is filled with bizarre characters to give it an eclectic feel:There's Cade and Faith's domineering mother, a woman who puts the capital \\"B\\" in ... There's Cade's eccentric Aunt Rosie, whose absent-minded thefts drive Tory up a wall, and there's Cecil, Tory's grandmother's kindhearted plumber/lover.Faith is a particularly joyous delight to behold, and her sizzling affair with Wade, the town's sensitive veterinarian, is a hoot.Don't let the \\"romance novel\\" label scare you away from this wonderful book. \\"Carolina Moon\\" ultimately boils down to good old-fashioned storytelling at its best, and no one should go away without experiencing it."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I have only read one other Nora Roberts book, River's End. I decided to give this one a try. I wonder of all the things I could have rather been doing than reading this. Hmmm, cleaning the cat litter box comes to mind...Well, it wasn't really 'that' bad, but it wasn't very good. It seemed to follow the exact pattern of River's End. Even the way it ended, with the &quot;surprise&quot; right at the last second, was exactly the same. I wondered if all her books were as similar.The characters did not ever seem real to me. They were so obviously characters. The only one I remotely liked was Faith, and that was only toward the end. The romance between Tory and Cade seemed completely false and forced. I sped through the book to the end, only wanting to find out 'whodunnit'. Even that was a disappointment.Nora Roberts is extremely popular and seems to pump out her books at a non-stop pace.

This one was a little more predictable. Though I couldn't figure out who the real killer was, I knew it wasn't the \\"usual suspect\\". The writing was wonderful and the characters were very well developed. However, the plot wasn't fascinating. It was a typical story and didn't leave me feeling fulfilled at the end."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Roberts has a great talent for keeping her readers interested in this novel. Up until the last five pages..my thoughts were she should have left it out or used another character.One of my biggest disappointments of this book was Roberts poor taste in using God's &amp; Jesus' name in vain continuously :( . She could have chosen a numerous amount of words that would emphasize the emotions of her characters.Other than that it was difficult to put the book down! :)"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"The heart behind this book was amazing. While this book is not the obvious tear-jerker, I found myself weaping several times. You will fall in love with these characters. Cade and Tory is a couple that you can't help but cheer for. You will also fall in love with Faith, Cade's sister. She's was a twin who felt she lived in the shadows of her murdered sister. However she soon realizes her own worth, and her ability to love. She is funny, sarcastic, vulnerable, and surprisingly likable. This is a definite winner for Roberts."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Nora Roberts is a great novelist. And this novel in particular is as good as the others I've read. I just wanted to make a comment on Roberts' character portrayal of the Southern characters in this book. I felt that her descriptions of the Southern characters and their dialogues were making fun of Southern people. Just for clarity sake, we don't talk like that!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Another good book from Nora Roberts. The characters where solid, the storyline believable and the suspense top-notch.I enjoyed the development of the two main characters Tory and Cade. There was a sensitivitly and realness in both of them that appealed greatly. In addition the development of the other characters Faith and Wade, added significantly to the story without overpowering. The suspense was also nicely built throughout the story. I did not know who the real killer was right up until the end, and the tension that built was enough that I could not put the book down (actually I could not put the book down after the first page!!)After reading Carolina Moon I went back and read some of NR's earlier books. There where parallels to her earlier book Carnal Innocence. But it does not matter where NR gets her inspiration, she still writes a strong story that can stand on its own feet."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This was the first Nora Roberts novel I read, and by far the best I've ever read. This book had me glued from beginning to end, yes there are some nasty parts about child abuse, but it is something that happens in stories and in real life. This was a great book. I also enjoy reading Sandra Brown books, between her and Nora Roberts I never get anything done. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Carolina Moon was the first book that I ever read from Nora Roberts.

This one just didn't do much for me. I realized I had read over half of the book before anything happened! There were just too many words and not enough story. I never really cared for the characters, none of them were convincing to me. I liked the end and had it figured out long before I got to it, but the book ended so abruptly. It felt like the author had to get a certain number of pages, got there, wrapped it up and got it published."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This is the second book I ever read by the author, and I have to admit it got me hooked on her books and romace novels in general. I thoroughly enjoyed the interactions between the main protaginists, but found the secondary romantic relationships just as compelling.

Tory may have come back for herself, but in order for her to heal, she soon discovers that she has to solve the mystery of Hope's death."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Carolina Moon was my first introduction to Nora Roberts. It is a wonderful book that keeps you engaged. The murder mystery and medium like abilities are well written and exciting. The murder mystery is very suspensful. I enjoy the spoiled,damaged but has a big heart, Faith. Tory is a strong leading female and I loved Cade and Tory's romance. It is definitely a book I would recommend to others."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I have not read any other books by Nora Roberts. Reaching for a book to read while I was trapped in a car on a road trip, I remembered a favorable blurb in the newspaper and grabbed Carolina Moon. Soon I was engrossed in the story of Tory Bodeen and her quest to return to her hometown to confront the ghosts from her past. The white trash Bodeens had been tenants of the Lavelle family and young Tory's friendship with Hope Lavelle was a source of joy for both children. a brutal act cuts short the life of Hope and sends Tory into hiding from her self and her feelings. Eventually, Tory realizes that she must confront the past in order to heal. She returns to Progress, the town of her childhood to delve out the secrets of the past. Once there she renews contact with the remaining Lavelle family and family members who still live in Progress. She also begins to trust and rely on a special gift that has always been a part of her. In the process of setting out to start a new life, she discovers love and a very real danger from her past which can destroy her. As the story comes to an end, it almost seems too pat...be prepared. This was a really well paced book and I plan to look into other books by this writer."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This book is the first I have ever not been able to finish. I think Nora Roberts is a poor author. I don't know if it is because she used too many adjectives or because she jumps around in time too much, but I found this book to be too confusing. Her character descriptions do not offer anything concrete to remember the character by... so you are constantly trying to remember who she is talking about. Also, there are too many characters - which also confuses the story. I lost my concentration so much that I finally gave up and put it up for auction on Amazon, thank goodness I got most of my money back."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"As a first time reader of Nora Robers, attracted to the book by the &quot;Carolina&quot; part of the title, I was blown away. I literally could not put the book down once I started. I read from 9 pm till 6 am the next morning and found myself laughing outloud and crying like a sap when Tory and Cade got engaged. I rushed out and just bought &quot;Honest Illusions.&quot; I have yet to start, but I'm afraid I'll not sleep again tonight! I highly reccoment this wonderful book. It's truthfully the best book I've read in a LONG time."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I have been a fan of Nora Roberts for a long time -- since the late 1980s -- and I try to read most/all of her novels. She has been a consistently decent/good writer. However, this story is somewhat similar to Linda Howard's After the Night, which I just finished. Therefore, I didn't find it very fresh or original. (After the Night is also set in a small southern town; the heroine is part of the &quot;white trash&quot; and the hero is the only son of the wealthiest family in town; the heroine had a tough childhood with parents who were physically or mentally abusive; the hero has a messed up sister; the hero's mother has an unhealthy hatred for the heroine because she attributes her husband's death to the heroine's family; the heroine grows up and comes back into town to open her own business and try to solve the mystery re who killed the hero's dad; certain small-minded townspeople won't let her forget her bad-seed &quot;roots&quot; -- sounds familiar? yup, practically identical to some of the plot elements of Carolina Moon, just substitute the hero's dad for the sister.) Actually, during the past year or two, I've begun to catch many recycled plots, characters, etc. in her novels. It seems unavoidable, given that she publishes so much (several mainstream fiction under her name and J.D. Robb each year; and numerous Harlequin and/or Silhouette novels each year)! The ending was just o.k. I figured that Roberts would use someone &quot;unexpected&quot; as the killer. But I wish the ending didn't feel as abrupt as it did. I'd go into my dissatisfaction with the ending some more but I don't want to spoil it for anyone who has not yet read the book. Still, it was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I am not an avid Nora Roberts fan, but this one is very different. The story started out a bit slowly, and the introduction of all the characters was confusing. In typical Roberts style, though,the various introductory stories wove into an exciting and gripping whole with strong believable characters. I particularly liked the psychic aspect and the way that this was the pivotal part of the story.I personally feel that Nora Roberts portrays the masculine point of view better than any other romance writer, and again she has created men you can actually relate to.This book is definitely worth reading but be sure to block out enough time, as I dare you to put it down!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I just couldn't put this one down! I've been a Noraholic since the 80's and love to read her books. This book had less romance than I expected, and the ending was too abrupt for me, but I can live with that. I've read all of her J D ROBB books and can't wait until they are out. This book falls in the line of these books - the darker side of childhood, living with the pain as an adult, etc. I loved the heroine in this book, felt her need to overcome the pain of her childhood, the loss of her friend, wanting a &quot;normal&quot; life. I couldn't put the book down and read it right to the end. It's a keeper! I recommend this one to all who love a little romance and suspense, but be warned that the issue of child abuse is involved. Thanks Nora!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This book was great. I loved the characters, and the story line. It was just perfect. Everything sort of flowed through, the way it's supposed to. The killer at the end is someone I never thought of. I loved Faith. She was really cool. Almost as cool as Cade. : )"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I thought that while this was not one of Robert's very best efforts, it was definitely a worthwhile read. The plot was creepy without going overboard, and I thought that it was well paced. I thought that the love scenes were steamy and definitely up to Robert's high standards. The book is similar in many ways to another of her books about another small town in Mississippi, several murders and a rich hero with a spoiled sister. While the plots were not exactly the same, I think that Robert's should be careful not to repeat herself. This was a great yarn and definitely entertaining, which let's face it, is what we're looking for. All in all I definitely enjoyed the book and wait impatiently for the next adventure!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I hated this book. I guessed &quot;whodunit&quot; about half-way through. I did not like any of the characters - Tory's repeated proclamations about her independence became tiresome very quickly. I thought Cade was whimpy and Faith's character inconsistent. The remainder of the characters were poorly drawn. I was so bored with the plot that I skimmed the last 20 or so pages just to finish what I started."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This was not the book that I thought I could read over a few days. I was so sure I knew who the killer was this time I had to keep reading to see if I was right, but she got me again! Anyone who is the least bit interested in the psychic world, loves a good who dunnit, a love story and all the rest will enjoy this book. Tory is a lot of people in this world who have to learn how to trust again, and Cade was just the guy to help her out."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I think Nora Roberts has done her personal best.In a story where suspense and romance meet. Tory Bodeen and Cade Lavelle discovers the truth behind little Hope Lavelle's death. Through visions, experience, memories and blaming. It all end up back to the circle of friends that all began the story.Tory Bodeen had return to Progress, South Carolina to start a new life as she tells everyone else. But in truth, she came for herself, to get over the fear and while doing so -as Hope's serial killer is back- to avenge for little Hope's death.In this book, I shed tears and got nightmares. The suspense is unbelievably realistic. The story was very touching. This story revolves around a person who never got over a loss in her life and the people who critize and blames her for it. But as more was known and understood about Tory, feelings from Cade begins to arise and the hatred from Faith begins to decay.This is a thriller/romance novel. This is a story of an everlasting friendship with a girl who would stay a child forever. A book you would never forget, one that you would read over and over again. I give Mrs. Roberts's new novel a five star and possibly 10 out of 10.The character's personality was developed well...the irony was swell, the change of hearts was done beautifully.Although the ending of the story could have been a little better, the ending seemed a bit rushed. And the serial killer one that you would never suspect.The book is a keeper, one to stay in your heart and on your shelf forever."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This is the book that got me hooked on Nora's suspense-romances! Before this one, I'd only read her Irish novels, but this one blew the door open on a whole new genre for me to enjoy. Lush descriptions, well developed characters, thoroughly engrossing story! Suspense mixed with a touching romance, a bit of the supernatural (a delightful touch, by the way) adds up to a winner for Nora Roberts! One of my favorites and a definite Keeper!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It has a good plot with a history. At 470 pages, the book was long enough to develop characters and plot both."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I didn't finish this book, the depictions of child molestation and murder were too disturbing. If you like the murder mysteries you might like this book, a romance reader probably won't."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This has to be one of the BEST books she has written. I have read approximately 20 of her books. They are all page turners, but this one is the ultimate!! The main character, Tory, has these psychic powers.

Absolutely incredible!!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I just finished this book last night, after taking me only over the weekend to read. Throughout the book you can feel the emotions and struggles of the main character, Tory, as she tries to heal after the trials from her childhood. Faced with memories of an awful summer night when she was eight years old, a budding romance with a childhood acquaintance, and the knowledge that events from all those years ago are still ever-present and dangerous, she finds the courage to fight back and hold on to the love of people around her. Filled with moments of sentiment, love, surprise, hate and shock, this book had me mesmerized from page one on. Buy, borrow, or steal this book in order to read it...you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Nora Roberts has done it again, brought to our daily lives the wonderful suspense, love and humility that has made her one of my favorite authors. In Carolina Moon the range of human emotions and struggles brought to me a feeling of happiness when they were overcome. The courage the characters exhibit in their lives is worth remebering.

It is a very refreshing story line and an enjoyable read. I recommend it to anyone who wants a break from today."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Carolina Moon is an off-beat but fun mystery to read. The story revolves around the female characters, mainly the heroine, Tory. There are also other female characters portrayed in such a way that they are interesting, strong and inspiring despite some of their less than desirable personality traits. However, as a Carolinian myself, it was very disheartening and unusually elementary for Nora Roberts to use the names Bodeen and Clampett to try to invoke a sense of &quot;southern hicks&quot;. One does not need such a subconscious reminder of The Beverly Hillbillies to get a sense of small, southern town atmosphere!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I was hoping to finish this book, and respond with 'of course, I should have figured that out!'. But instead, I said 'give me a break'! A good mystery must be mysterious and not easily solved; but it also must all come together in the end. I am sorry, but this one doesn't. She could have chosen anyone of the 20 or so characters and had the same result. Come on Nora, you can do better. I have read previous Nora Roberts books and quite enjoyed them, even if I did figure out the mystery before it was revealed. But this one, I just don't buy! Don't waste your time on it. There are too many really good books out there. Choose wisely."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I really enjoyed this book and the only thing I didn't like was that I had to spread out reading the whole thing over almost two weeks due to LIFE!

I just knew there wouldn't be a &quot;pat&quot; ending and I was not disappointed."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Nora Roberts is a wonderful author. I cannot believe she allowed this narrator to read her best story yet. She reads in a hurried raspy monotone with no change in voice between characters.

Couldn't stand it...bought the book--great book, terrible audio."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I have to say I was pretty intrigued throughout most of the book, but the ending was horrible. I had so many questions that weren't answered and there was absolutely no logic to the reason Hope died, the other killings and especially why if the killer was bent on &quot;killing Hope over and over again&quot; that Faith -- who was Hope's identical twin! -- was never in any danger! I was very disappointed in the ending."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I looked forward eagerly after reading 5 star reviews of this book. I was supremely disappointed.The writing does not flow smoothly; it does not capture and hold my interest. The characters are not all that likeable.Nora does write well often, but not in this book. I was plain bored. I would like to see more books such as &quot;Divine Evil&quot;, or &quot;Homeport&quot;."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Nora Roberts has really hit the nail on the head with this one. I used to be a devout reader of hers but have recently been disappointed with her books but Carolina Moon has brought me back to the fold. It is a definite Keeper."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Sweet, shy and slightly broken/psychic Victoria \\"Tory\\" Bodeen has made the decision to return to her hometown of Progress, South Carolina. Abused as a child by her father, Tory knows that returning to her hometown will be difficult. After all, her parents are outcasts and no one, not even the Lavelle's, ever understood Tory's relationship with prominent, wealthy and now deceased Hope. Coupled with that, Tory was blamed when her visions lead them to discover Hope raped and murdered in the swamp. Unfortunately, Tory's psychic visions never allowed her to see Hope's killer. Wanting more for herself and to escape the abuse of her father, Tory leaves Progress briefly and uses her \\"powers\\" for good (to locate missing children) until her heart is broken by a careless man. Wanting to find closure on her past, yet filled with hope for the future she returns to Progress to open a shop and discover who killed her childhood friend. With Tory's return, the Lavelle's lives are turned upside down. Cade (Hope's surviving brother) and Faith (Hope's surviving twin) each have definite ideas about what Tory means to them, one is falling in love with her while the other harbors animosity and jealousy about their relationship (Hope and Tory's). However, as time progresses and Tory becomes more entrenched in the community and in their lives, they both grow to understand and love her. There are other interesting characters in this dark drama: there was Wade, the town veterinarian who loves Faith for what she is. There are town gossips, a loving grandmother (who regrets the decisions her child has made, picking her abusive husband over her daughter), a sweet uncle (JR), Cade's zany Aunt Rosie (who shoplifts), Wade's caring mother (who only wants her son's happiness), a vengeful mother (Margaret), a loving housekeeper (Lilah) and town snobs. What I enjoyed the most about this dark, suspense story was Robert's ability to allow Tory to flourish and overcome her background. Although the odds were against her, in the end, she found true love and happiness. And while the story ended abruptly (we all could have had just a little more), I knew that Tory and Cade would live happily ever after because what had been broken in them both was now repaired. And finally what I really liked about this book, as I do so many other Robert's novels, is her ability to take a tragic story of lost innocence, betrayal and murder, and weave a decent story that leads to redemption. I really enjoyed Carolina Moon and would recommend it to any Nora Roberts lovers out there."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Carolina Moon is one of my favourite Nora Roberts books and one I have re-read many times. However, I recently purchased the Unabridged, Audio CD version and it is by far the WORST audio book I have ever listened to. The reader is practically monotone and makes NO effort to provide different voices for the various characters. I could barely make it through the first few chapters before I quit.My recommendation: Read the book, it's fabulous. But DON'T waste your money on the audio version."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Tory Bodeen was beaten by her father who said she was evil because she could feel and see things that 'normal' people couldn't. But Hope was her friend and she coped until Hope was murdered and Tory 'saw' the whole thing happen as she recovered from another beating. No one believed that she wasn't there with Hope and escaped while Hope was being murdered when she lead them to Hope's body the next morning.Years later Tory returns to her home town to open a gift shop and to reconcile herself to the loss of Hope. But many in the town can't forgive or forget including Hope's mother. However, Cade Lavelle, Hope's older brother, finds that Tory is what's been missing in his life. He refuses to let her shut him out even when someone seems to be trying to force Tory to leave or die.A good story, strong characters with believable motives. Even the supporting characters are interesting and multi-dimensional."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"For such a prolific author, Nora Roberts sure spins some fantastic tales.This is the tale of a cursed woman. She can find things, she can see things. She can read people.When she was a child, her best friend was murdered. And her own father beat her regularaly, trying to rid her of the devil.The majority of the story involves her tackling her own demons.There's nothing really new in this story. There are so many characters and so much back story that I felt none were really given the time they needed to flesh out their motivations.Definitely not my favorite NR book.(*)>"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I enjoyed every minute of the plot and the characters; however, the person who narrated this audiobook had a voice that grated on my nerves.

With the help of the victims brother ( the love interest)Tory tries to solve the old murder and new murders she &quot;feels&quot; are coming. I found the characters developemnt slow in this book and felt I never really got to know the two main leads. The romance was somewhat contrived.

Meanwhile, Her childhood best friend's brother Cade Lavelle wants more from Tory than Tory has ever wanted to give. That's the romance part. But I was intriqued by who the bad guy is. You know one of the character that was introduced in the storyline has to be it and you think you might know but then again is Ms. Roberts that obvious? Read the book and enjoy the suspenseful climax."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I've read a few of Nora's books. None however have been as compelling as Caroline Moon. The plot and characters were very well developed and the the twists caught me off guard. Nora has plenty of opportunities for sequels &amp; prequels. Faith &amp; Wade, Cade's parents, and there are many stories to be told about Aunt Rosie. If Nora ever turns to writing police stories, I'd like to see one about Dwight's years.This is an excellent read, regardless of whether you are sitting on a beach somewhere sunny or curling up in front of a fire."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I usually enjoy NR's books, but I found this plot to be too weird and off-the-wall to enjoy. The writing, as always, is top-notch, and it certainly kept my attention, but I don't expect it to be a book I reread often, if ever. There are serial killer plots I've found interesting before, but since what I found interesting about them was the police work behind the search, this didn't provoke the same interest. I was just too disturbed by the plot to be able to appreciate the book."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"wasn't anybody else bothered by the timeline which supposedly showed Hope's killer killing other women at the same age Hope would have been? On page 172 it says hope would have been 16 in 1990, meaning she was killed at age 8 in 1982. Yet on page 285 it says a 12-year-old was killed in 1975; a 19-year-old was killed in 1982 (the same year Hope was killed at age 8!); and a 26-year-old was killed in 1989 (the year before Hope would have been 16). Then on page 286 it says &quot;Every one was the age Hope would have been if she'd lived.&quot; Huh?"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I'm being a little generous with the 4 stars, it should be 3 1/2. Nora's books are always fun to read, but they all follow the same basic pattern. The one thing that was different about this book though was the fact that the heroine didn't hate the hero at the start of the story and then grow to love him, she liked him pretty much right from the beginning. Reading Nora Roberts is like watching most 1/2 hour sitcoms, enjoyable, easy to follow, with a happy ending. And I am not knocking that, but I think she can do better (in her older books she did). Maybe if Nora didn't have to knock out a new novel every few months, she would be able to put a little more effort into her new ones."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I read this in a day. I could not put it down. I enjoyed everything about this book i.e. the mind reading, suspense, love and mystery. I kept changing my mind about who was the killer. I think I picked the actual person twice but kept changing my mind. It was wonderful to read while I am anticipating the continuation of the Jewel of the Sun series."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Every time I read a Nora Roberts book I think -- this is the best yet. I've never written a review of a book before but Carolina Moon stayed in my thoughts until the last page was turned. All of the characters came alive and I could feel Tory's emotions. Just when I thought I had figured out &quot;who done it&quot; someone else came into the picture who could be the one. Mystery and love - what more could you want. I congratulate Nora on another job well done."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I was expecting this book to be very good because I know that Nora Roberts is a popular romance writer. &quot;Carolina Moon&quot; was the first book by her that I've read and my expectations were not at all met. It was extremely overdramatic and most of the time I would feel like rolling my eyes. The conversations were much too lengthy and didn't always reveal very much and the characters were too horny. They made it sound more like lust than love. The ending was pretty abrupt and also very unrealistic. DUMB. I'm not reading another Nora Roberts, especially after having read that most of her books are the same plot and characters over and over again."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"It is not often that a book so totally consumes me that I can't put it down, but this one did. There were times when I was so overwhelmed with the emotion of the book I did have to stop reading it because it was making my heart race. I identified with Tory because I had an alcoholic father, and although he did not physically abuse my family, I felt the emotional pain she must have felt. I also thought the characters were very real, and I was especially glad Tory did not waste a lot of time pretending she didn't love Cade. I hated for the book to end, and I'm afraid there may not be another book out there that will make me feel this way again."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"The story starts off promising as Nora Roberts sets the stage for her mystery. However, about halfway through the book the story gets bogged down and becomes predictable. The characters become cookie-cutter, and the story sort of veers off on a couple of tangents.The character of Dwight pops up at seemingly inopportune times in the story, and because Nora draws attention to him by doing that, it kind of gave the story away, in my opinion.I stopped reading the book for a few weeks because I was bored with it, and when I picked it up a few weeks later, the story unfolded just as I suspected.I love Nora's books, but I wouldn't recommend this one."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I had begun to be a bit jaded by Nora Roberts' books, thinking that maybe she'd lost a bit of the magic that I used to get from her books. &quot;Carolina Moon&quot; sees, I believe, a return to form by The author. The novel does use a similar plot to nearly all Roberts' books and the murderer is far too easy to work out but the way the author tackles the emotions of the two main characters made this book stand out for me, you could really identify with what they were feeling. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"If you liked Linda Howard's After the Night (poor white trash girl makes good and comes home to solve old mystery), Linda Howard's Dream Man (misunderstood psychic helps catch serial killer), or Carol O'Connell's Judas Child (&quot;left behind&quot; child grows up and returns to home town to help catch killer of childhood friend), then you'll like Carolina Moon. I did."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I couldn't wait to get this book and when I finally did I flew through it, and now I wish I was just getting it. It's one of those books that you just can't pick up another book after reading because the characters still have a hold on you. Nora Roberts has done it again. The characters are well developed and very lovable. I personally loved Faith. Youv'e got to love watching a person struggle with their feelings and I've never liked one as much as I did Faith. This is just an added bonus to Tory and Cade. It's gripping, and heartwrenching but leaves you toatally satisfied. The end will totally shock you."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I could not put this book down I really loved it so much I had to slow myself down from finishing it right away.I didn't want it to end.This book grabs you at the start and never lets you go.The only thing I didn't like...was it had to end.A fast read,Hard to put down.I loved it!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Hey you Roberts' fans, skip this book. I am a big fan of Roberts..ever since I read Honest Illusions ( best book ! ) I got hooked, but she should stick to what she does best, and that's contemporary romance. What's with this trend of romance writers (Lindsey, Coulter, Robards....) writing gross suspense thrillers in which the victim is ALWAYS a woman! Why advocate such brutality? I read a book as a past time. I enjoy a good suspense book like anyone else but draw the line at sicko stalkers.There is a difference between a suspense/mystery and brutal-violent suspense. I mean, the ending is so silly--it's as if Roberts had no clue who the stalker was till the very end. Very very weak. Is she even writing these? This one isn't worth it. Go read Jewels in the Sun. Now that one is fun. I am anxiously awaiting the second book in this new trilogy."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This was a good beach read, but not the best NR book I have ever read. The plot has been recycled, reading like &quot;Carnal Innocence&quot;. The editting bothered me: not only the timeline, but the repeated use here (and in other NR books) of the word &quot;undo&quot;. It should read &quot;undue influence&quot; or &quot;undue effort&quot;. The two words mean completely different things (unnecessary vs. come undone) and are NOT interchangable. Does the editor not own a dictionary?"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I have read several books by Nora Roberts and have enjoyed them all. I could not even finish this one. I hope her next novel is better!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I was enjoying this book and found it a good suspense read, however, I was a bit disappointed by the scooby-doo type ending. I won't ruin the ending for you readers. I'll just say Roberts pulled that out of thin air with no clues leading to it. You could never get to that conclusion based on the things she tells you throughout the book and she tries to wrap up the real ending in the last 5 pages (I could just hear the scooby group explaining the impossible to solve mystery in 2 minutes). I also feel the author left some loose ends (like between Margaret and Tory). It is a surprise ending, but aren't all mysteries supposed to be like that? This ending was just totally out of the reader's reach, came out of nowhere."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Nora Robert's female characters were becoming a bit too predictable and I was starting to get bored but when I read this book, she had some diverse characters and the story moved quickly. A lovely romance with some thriller qualities about it. I would recommend this book as one of Nora's best books."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I have never read a Nora Roberts book before. I picked up Carolina Moon because I live in South Carolina. That was the only reason.I could not put it down. I've read it twice. I loved how Ms. Roberts combined several genres in one book. I'm not a romance junkie, but this one was good for me.I also loved how I knew the places she was talking about because I live near them. She described the locals with precision.A big thumbs up from me!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This is yet another great book. I have become quite a fan of Nora Roberts in recent months as I have begun to discover her amazing talent to captivate and enchant and surprise. I look forward to another adventure with her."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I loved this book, the reason for the three stars is the very predictable ending. I've only read a few Nora Roberts books, and already its obvious that in most if not all, there is either an engagement or a wedding being planned. The thing that bothered me in this book is that the wedding is being planned only days after main character's mother dies. Their relationship was never very good, practically non-existent, but it still bothered me how it was almost brushed aside. Also, people change so fast in these books.Other than that, the book is very good, it grips you from page one and doesnt let go until the end. A real page turner."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I absolutely love Nora Roberts. She knows exactly how to keep you entertained until the very end of the book, quite literally as I belive you dont find out who the real killer is until the last couple pages!! She knows how to keep you guessing, until you almost just want to skip to the end to find the killer that way! She knows just how to disguise the real killer, and yet give subtle hints as to who he is. This may be a graphic book, but its well worth the reading time! What a page turner!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I must say, that I have read this book time and time again-not like I don't have other books that need to be reador anything. It's that good of a book. The two loves stories mixed into one make it a great love story. But it's also a great thriller. How kiled the hero-Kincade-younger sister when she was but 8 years old, and why did they rape her? The suspense makes the 478 pages fly and gives you the just satisfaction of the story line."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"A great read full of twists and turns and plenty of romance! Nora Roberts does an excellent job of bringing the reader in head first right from the beginning.As with all of her books, the plot is unique. Tory Bodeen returns to her childhood home to bury the memories of a childhood friend. Her past is murky and she must face the whispers and stares of the small town community. Through it all, she must find herself and find a place for love in her life.A delightful read that will keep you up late into the night, wondering how it will end!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Tory Bodeen returns to her childhood home in South Carolina to open a store and reclaim her life there. The return is difficult for her because she has to face the memories of her best friend, Hope, who was killed at age 8 when she went to a swamp for a midnight rendezvous with Tory. Tory never made it to the swamp because her father beat her so badly that she couldn't go. She was able to picture Hope's death in her mind and always afterward felt guilty for not being around to protect her friend. Now she is grown up, but prejudices and hatreds still remain in her hometown. This book has a pleasing mixture of romance and mystery and the author spins an interesting tale."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Victoria Bodeen's only light in her horrible, abusive childhood was the friendship of Hope Lavelle untill her body was found in the wild marsh used as a hide out.Years later Tory has decided to return to the home she left at such an early age.

I congratulate Nora on another job well done."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I can honestly say that I'm somewhat surprised to see this book warrant so many five stars from readers. I have been an avid Nora Robert's fan for some time now and have read a truly countless amount of her books and this one, though good, is forgettable, at best.If I were to compare this book to another of Robert's novels I would compare it to &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and mention that it lacks the feverish intensity of that gripping novel.As I said, it's a decent work but as far as Robert's best, I wouldn't even think to name this novel in the top five."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I loved this book from the attractive front cover to the last period. The story line was very clear and there was just the right amount of suspense. I was even surprised with the villian. I wasn't able to put it down, so I would recommend that you start it when you don't have a lot to do. Nora sure makes it hard to pick a favorite book because it is usuallly the next one!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I'm writing this review for anyone who might be thinking about listening to the audio version. It is the worst audiobook to which I've listened! The reader poorly conveyed emotion of the characters in conversation, sometimes, I think, messing up what was actually being said. What was worse was trying to figure out who was actually speaking since all characters had the same accent, voice, and expression. I'm really disappointed that I didn't actually read this book...I think it would have been a decent suspense read!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I just finished reading CAROLINA MOON and feel let down. Don't get me wrong, I'm not downcast from the story itself, it was so well written that I wanted the story to continue. The fact that there weren't thousands of pages was the let down, not the content.This is the tale of Tory Bodeen, who has endured a childhood that would break most people. When she returns to the small town of Progress as an adult, she must face her past including the murder of her best friend when she was only a young child. She must also face people's scorn towards her ability to \\"see\\" events both long ago and present even when she's not physically in attendance. She's not necessarily a psychic (our definition is different than what she experiences) -- she feels what people feel, she doesn't just get a glimpse at the scene.Nora Roberts has once again blended romance and mystery to create a book that readers will enjoy. Her main characters are vibrant and the reader can easily relate to them. Tory's romantic interest, Cade Lavelle is the type of man who frequents every woman's dreams. He's handsome, sensitive, strong and romantic. At times, Roberts' supporting characters over-shadow the main duo, but not in an annoying way. It reminds me of a walk through town and the many interactions that go on every day in a small town where everyone knows everyone else - these constant interactions are present in this story.Unlike SANCTUARY or THE RIVER, the mystery portion of CAROLINA MOON isn't strong. Instead this one leans more toward the romantic side of the combination of genres.CAROLINA MOON illustrates why Nora Roberts dominates the literary market with bestseller following bestseller. She captivates her audience with a great plot, strong cast of characters, interesting town as a backdrop, mystery and romance. Nora Roberts's fans won't be disappointed and those new to Roberts' work will be addicted to her unique writing style."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Carolina Moon is a sultry, exciting murder mystery that is also loaded with romance. The lead characters are Tory and Cade, and they remain one of my favourite \`couples' because their personalities are built up so well and they have a fantastic spark between them.Tory Bodeen was the victim of violence as a girl but now she has returned to her childhood home to confront the past. I liked her because she was a strong woman who wasn't brash or rude, instead she was quiet and vulnerable but with a core of iron. The fact that she was gifted with physic powers was an interesting subplot that was handled well.Cade Lavelle is the brother of Tory's best friend who was murdered when they were little. His unique point is that although he has inherited farmland from his father he has gone out on a limb to practise organic farming despite the ridicule he faces from neighbours and workers alike. The chemistry is there between the two from the moment they meet up again and only builds as the novel progresses. I liked that Cade was protective of Tory but not in an overbearing way. He really respects her and doesn't react badly to her \`powers' such as having visions and reliving past events which another man in her past did. He was thoughtful and caring in a manly way.The only complaints I have were that sometimes the story meandered with aimless points of view of seemingly minor characters which didn't have a lot to do with the main story or plot development. During these bits I just thought \`Let's get back to the real action with Tory and Cade'. Secondly Faith, Cade's sister, was not at all likeable in the beginning and was very rude and bitter. Even considering her cold upbringing I thought she was overly harsh, especially to the man who clearly loved her, Wade. However the romance between her and Wade was done well and by the end of the book I was pleased that they got together and felt glad that she had turned into a better person.Overall Carolina Moon is a fun, gripping read with original characters, strong dialogue and a smart murder mystery. I would recommend this to people who want to read a really good example of romantic suspense.JoAnne"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"When Tory was only 8 years old she lost hope in 2 ways - her 8 year old friend, Hope was brutally murdered along with that she lost some hope for life - i.e. adventure, fun and just being a child.Tory was a poor child, with a father who beat her to no good end, and a mother whom looked passed the beatings with fear of losing the man she loved.Hope was a rich and happy child, full of adventure, determination and spirit. Hope was also a twin to Faith, a disobedient child determined to do exactly the opposite of her parents wishes. Hope and Tory were the best of friends they did everything together, until one night someone decided to brutally murder Hope.When Tory was 18 she took all the money she managed to save up and started a new life, or at least she tried. But the only way she was going to get on with her life was to go back to the place where Hope was murdered and try to make sense of all that went so horribly wrong when she was 8 years old.I gave this novel four stars because its pace was slow moving at times, but that aside, all and all it was an entertaining and very interesting read that had me captivated. Excellent romance, loveable &amp; hate able characters, a magnificent ending not to mention a very interesting plot. A must read."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I was only looking for a quick summer read to tide me over until one of my favorite authors released a new novel, but what I discovered was that this author is superb at her game. The blurb on the back cover gave me the information that intrigued me into choosing this paperback: Tory is moving back to her southern hometown after years away because she can no longer avoid her strong feelings about her childhood best friend's murder. Tory hopes to put her lingering melancholy to rest by facing it directly, and in the process she finds herself growing closer to her late friend's older brother. Unbeknownst to her, the killer is aware of Tory's presence and making terrible plans. There's also a supernatural element that adds a deliciously Stephen-King-esque flavor to the tale. Roberts crafts her stories with excellent attention to detail; settings are lovingly rendered, characters reveal themselves slowly but compellingly, dialogue is snappy and incidents are described with an immediacy that puts the reader right in the character's shoes. I was falling in love with the town, feeling like the characters were my friends too and all around impressed with Roberts's technical skill. I picked up some of Roberts's previous romantic suspense after reading this one - I personally enjoyed 'River's End', but a book written prior to that one, 'Sanctuary', had some plot element problems. I think Roberts, who is apparently branching out from mainstream romance, was feeling her way into this genre and I think she shows amazing potential to get even better. As a matter of fact, I'm looking forward to her next foray into suspense."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Nora Roberts has always been one of my favorite authors,but lately it seems that she is not at her best. I used to look forward to her novels, but now I can take them or leave them. Although this book's villain was surprising, the ending was lackluster. I think Nora is putting her books out to fast and can't really get into the storyline or her characters like she used to. I hope that she gets her gift of talented writing back, before she loses a devoted reader."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"After reading Carnal Innocence, I was most anxiously awaiting Nora Robert's new book. Although an enjoyable read, it was nowhere near the books of Carnal Innocence or River's End. The book did not flow, it was written very choppily which made difficult reading. After reading the above two, I wondered if it was written by the same author. Do they sometimes do an outline and let someone else fill it in? It certainly wasn't the caliber I expected of Nora Roberts. Also, the situation with Cade's mother was not developed and was left dangling and was Faith (his sister) and Wade's relationship. The ending was abrupt. I was disappointed this time."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This is not my usual genre-choice, yet I was so engaged and engrossed in Nora Roberts writing, I have to extend my kudos to her. With one of the most scintillating first sentences I have read in a long time (I won't give it away) how could I not be curious to know more about Tory Bodeen and her keen sixth sense or her friend Hope and the aftermath of what happened the summer they were both eight years old?I actually put this book down for an entire week (yes, life gets busy!) and when I picked it back up was ready for the ending I expected.Roberts didn't stoop to that: instead, she wove the threads in a completely different direction than I was expecting. When I got to the \\"surprise within a surprise\\" I was let down at first, thinking \\"formula!\\" but then that evaporated into more delightful nuances.I enjoyed the backdrops - Tory's store opening, the small, southern hamlet \\"Progress\\" and the variety of supportive characters throughout the book.This is a winner on many planes - and if you are a writer, read this one simply to watch a mastercraftswoman in action, whether you usually read books like this or not, you will find value here."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This was my first Nora Roberts book. It's not my most favorite book but I must admit that it kept my interest. This author provides very detailed narratives of the surroundings and the atmosphere of each a every scene without becoming boring. My favorite characters were Cade and Wade. Both men with such different personalities and yet so alike when it came to their feelings of love and dedication. I could've easily fallen in love with either one of them! lol! Faith provided the comic relief as well as Rosie and Isis. All in all, a good story that kept me entertained."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This book is about the story of a girl, Tory. Her struggle to regain control of her life after a very difficult childhood and the death of her best friend.This is one of the first times I have read a book by Nora Roberts who also deals with mystery mixed with romance.

Well recommended."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I have always been a fan of Nora Roberts. This is one of her best books. This is great reading even for those who don't care for romance novels.

Have you ever not been able to put a book down even though you need to get some sleep? Well, that's what will happen to you with this book. This is a book for people who can appreciate good literature,just like O'dell's 'Back Roads' or Brauner's 'Love songs of the tone deaf' this is beautiful, lyrical, and poetic storytelling at it's best. If you like to curl up for hours with a good book, grab this one."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I just finished Karen Robard's GHOST MOON. I didn't even realize their names until I finished the book. What I liked about this one was Roberts goes into detail for every character, unlike Robard who only mentions the killer every once and a while. I loved both of them and if you liked this one try GHOST MOON. They both made me make sure my doors are locked!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"As a HUGE fan and owner of all her books (including one autographed copy), I have to say that this is probably one of the BEST of Nora Roberts' romantic suspense. From the very beginning you just grab onto the characters and can't let go. The only bad thing is the inability to put in down... I was late for work. Thanks, Nora for another great book... Now I'll just have to wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Nora Roberts does it again. I totally enjoyed this book. Roberts just has a way of grabbing you and keeping you interested until the very end. I just wish I would have waited until the weekend to get this book. I stayed up most of the night Monday reading it and I had to work the next day. It was worth it. Now I am going to take this weekend and reread it. Roberts writes the kind of books that I read over and over again."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This was the best Nora Roberts book I have ever read, and I've read quite a few.

A definite buy!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Nora Roberts is a literary genious. She just keeps proving it again and again. Carolina Moon grabs you and plunges you head first into these characters lives. Way to go Ms. Roberts."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I love Nora Roberts books and this one is just as good as the others. I was surprised by the ending, loved the 2 romances, and really enjoyed the way the characters evolved in the story - especially Faith."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"Victoria &quot;Tory&quot; Bodeen has come home to Progress, South Carolina, the place of her birth and scene of her worst nightmares. Her best friend, Hope Lavelle, was murdered in Progress when she was 8 years old and it was Tory who led police to the body. Tory has psychic visions and watched the murder in her mind's eye as she lay weeping in her bed after a particularly brutal beating at the hands of her father. Tory fled Progress at the age of 18 and looked back only once, when she went at age 20 to visit her parents. That visit was cut short when her father, Hannibal Bodeen, beat Tory up and her mother, Sarabeth, berated Tory for upsetting him.Now, Tory has come back to be near her beloved grandmother, put her ghosts behind her, and open a store in town. The reserved, ultra-standoffish Tory's motives are twofold: to guage her own strength by putting the past behind her, and to unmask Hope's murderer. As a tenuous friendship emerges between straight-laced Tory and Hope's wild and irrepressible twin, Faith, a romance blossoms with handsome Cade Lavelle.Soon, a young woman in town is murdered and Tory learns that there have been others over the years, all fitting a pattern of looking like Hope would have looked had she lived and being killed on or near Hope's birthday. All of the signs are pointing to the malevolent, half-mad Hannibal Bodeen. When Sarabeth Bodeen is murdered while Hannibal is on the run from a rape charge, that pretty well clinches his guilt in the minds of many. But is it true? Only after another couple of blood-curdling confrontations does the full truth emerge.This book plays heavily on the romance angle, but is also full of mystery and intrigue to satisfy the suspense aficionado. Ms. Roberts's writing is strong and evocative; indeed, she chooses her words to paint South Carolina with the brush of a master.

As usual, her banter was well written, the novel was character driven, and highly entertaining. Although I was pretty sure who the murderer was by the first fourth of the book, I was never 100% sure until nearly the end."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This book started out interesting but somewhere along the way i lost interest after that it just felt like it was dragging and just too long. The bright spot was Faith's character that didn't look that good in the beginning but got better and better as the book progressed. Her interactions with both Tory and her brother Cade were quiet funny. I had a smile on my face while reading about her.Tory was altogether too serious although she gave Faith and Cade Sometimes as good as she got but she was nowhere near as good as Faith or even Cade. Cade was good too. He was funny and gentle bully. He bullied Tory to do things his way but she didn't mind it so much because it was her way as well.Somewhere along the way my interest started decreasing. i even skipped some pages which i rarely do. The climax did come as a surprise but it was an expected surprise because no way was i believing the person Tory was suspecting to be murderer was going to be the murder, it would have all been too easy then, and you just know how suspense novels work!"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"\\"I killed her or was it an accident?\\" Will Tory ever tell someone.

In a great blend of mystery, romance and suspense this story tells the tale of Tory Bodeen--a woman with the gift of ESP and hellish childhood memories. As a child, her best friend and soulmate Hope was viciously murdered--and the culprit was never found. Now, as a young woman, Tory returns to Progress, South Carolina, the town where she grew up, to confront her own personal demons. However, there are a couple of physical ones that Tory must also contend with; her own abusive father, who seems intent on continuing that legacy, and Hope's murderer--who is still out there. Or are they one and the same? Equally disturbing to Tory are the feelings that she is discovering that she has for Hope's surviving brother Kincade...has she found love at last? Can it survive all of the violence and evil to come?Nora Roberts has put together the best of every genre in this wonderful tale. She has certainly found another fan in me.DYB"},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I won't go into detail about the summary of the book because others have already done that. I will say this is one of my favorite books by Nora Roberts (other than the In Death series). The characters are very well developed and you could relate to them. The one thing I wanted was a longer ending. Or maybe even a sequel. Or maybe Tory's child or grandchild helping Eve Dallas out on a murder investigation. Hey, it could happen. After all, she's the author of both stories."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"I don't know if I'm just really good at knowing who the killer is in a book or if it was just too obvious but I knew who commited this crime at about a third of the way through the novel. Still I enjoyed the story somewhat.The lead character was a strong woman but after all the abuse from her evil dad and pitiful mother, it was amazing she turned out ok (and unrealistic). I think the father was also unrealistic in some ways. If he wanted to molest his daughter and not just beat her (the daughter admits she knew her father wanted her sexually when she was a child), it's hard for me to believe that a man as evil as he was would hold back.Things just didn't add up in her family life, and the end was cheesy and predictable. Definately not one of her best books but still interesting."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"This book was wonderful, a prime example of Roberts at work in the creation of a thriller and romance novel.A young woman, having some psychic powers, returns to the town where she was raised to start over again. Hampered by the abuse she received from her father as a child, and the loss of her best friend at 8 years old, her return is more difficult than she expects. And becomes life-threatening as she realizes her friends killer is still on the lose.Similar in genre to Carnal Innocence and Homeport, Carolina Moon will have you turning pages in surprise up to the very end."},{"Title":"Carolina Moon","review":"As a long time reader of Nora Roberts I was again disappointed in her writing. Reading about a killer/child rapist is just not an enjoyable read for me. The main characters Tory, an emotional ill woman and Cade, a spineless mama's boy just became a bland mix.

The hero is noble and good. He even makes a moving sacrifice at the end. The villain is completely evil. His actions throughout are disturbing. The art is rough, like a book of quickly drawn storyboards. Which is fitting since the author works for Pixar as a storyboard artist."},{"Title":"Tales of Colossus","review":"One of the great things about being able to read a lot of graphic novels is finding that book that catches you by surprise. Tales of Colossus by Mark Andrews is just such a book. The first surprising thing is that it was drawn entirely on the computer. As mentioned in the introduction, the only paper used was in the printing of the book. The second surprising thing is that you'd never guess it was done on computer. We've come quite a long way since the days of Batman: Digital Justice I guess. In fact the cinematic art style calls to mind hand drawn storyboards used in films in not only the art style, but in also in Andrew's concise pacing, often without dialog, and allowing the action to tell the story.The story is set during the time of the Holy Crusades as a Middle Eastern fortress guarded by knights is overrun by Muslim forces. The only survivor of the attack is a knight named Orlant who is capture and tortured in the dungeons. His will to live sparks interest in the villainous sorcerer Al Rahzear who uses Orlant as a tool of revenge against the European crusaders by placing his soul into a great, metal golem named Colossus and returning him to Europe to wreak havoc on the Muslim's enemies. As Colossus is about to kill the king, the wizard Maulore casts a bolt of magical energy at the construct which has the unintended effect of freeing Orlant's consciousness from Al Rahzear's spell. He now remembers his life and vows he took as a knight and while he's considered a monster, Colossus continues to serve the cause of good.Two hundred years later, Colossus still lives. People leave gold out for him as he comes to their aid to slay the evil beasts which prey upon the local peasants and receives aid from a local blacksmith named Malcom who keeps his weapons sharp and in repair. The arrival of an evil paladin however spells trouble for Colossus and the local citizens. Grimon Delavrignac arrives with a reputation as a slayer of beasts and an enchanted blade. While he vows to serve the king his true desires for the king's daughter and his throne soon become apparent. Colossus is soundly defeated and one of his metallic arms dismembered. Now the only hope is to find the one man who may be able to mend him and help him defeat the evil knight. But does the wizard Maulore still live?Tales of Colossus is like an epic Greek myth with a tragic hero, a princess in need of aid, evil villains, and terrible beasts. Even while being hunted and maligned as a tool of evil, Colossus still adheres to the vows he took as a knight to serve good and is appalled at the behavior of Grimon who has disgraced the knighthood. As mentioned Andrews is such a skilled storyteller that he uses a minimum of dialog. What a welcome relief that is from so many other graphic stories that tend to be on the wordy side. Outstanding effort!Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"How to Rebuild and Modify Your Muscle Car: High-Performace Restoration (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"I learned about this book after I bought a copy of Scott's &quot;How To Tune Your 1982-1998 Camaro&quot;, while fixing up my '92 25th Anniversary Camaro. I really liked that book, so when I picked up an old '70 Nova to play with, I decided to get this book.This book was even more helpful than the Camaro had been. Scott describes what's wrong with muscle car suspensions, brakes, engines, transmissions and other parts, then tells you how to fix those problems. Yes, it's a bit generic. But the advice applies to just about any muscle car, and there are plenty of specific examples throughout the book for every make and many models.My biggest complaint with the Nova was the suspension. It felt like a marshmallow. This book pointed out a bunch of ways to cure that by modifying parts I already had, or ones I could get at the junkyard. It also suggests new hi-perf parts you can buy, to save yourself some of the work. I did a combination: got larger used wheels &amp; tires, new poly bushings, new shocks and cheap replacement springs. It worked great. It won't out-handle my 92 Camaro, but it's now much more fun to drive. And more controllable. And it cost me about $150.The money I saved on the suspension rebuild more than paid for this book. And I've already seen a bunch of tips I want to try in the other chapters.If you've got an old muscle car that you like to really drive, get this book.You won't regret it."},{"Title":"How to Rebuild and Modify Your Muscle Car: High-Performace Restoration (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"I've spent the last 10 years modifying and restoring a classic Corvette and I've read several how-to guides. Most of them have decent information, but there are always minor errors here and there. This one has a BIG one.In the chapter on the electrical system it says that you can add a second battery to your muscle car to get more electrical capacity. This is true, but the author got it backwards. If you hook up two twelve-volt batteries with one positive terminal connected to the negative terminal of the second battery, you will DOUBLE the voltage. If you don't believe me, try it with a couple of D-cells and a voltmeter.There is some good information on performance upgrades, but the author is kind of a nervous-Nancy. He leans towards that \\"factory original\\" conservative-collector anal-retentive obsessive-compulsive... restoration. Practically every chapter has a paragraph that says the factory original design was perfectly adequate for most street applications. For example, he tells the reader to never use a NOS system on the street. (Believe me, hot rodders have been using NOS on street driven cars since it was invented.) He is not entirely incorrect, just slightly biased.He also is a little paranoid about the EPA. If you have a muscle car that is pre-'73 (varies with state), you are going to be exempt from emissions laws (at least in America). If you have just purchased one of these cars it is extremely unlikely that it has ANY emissions controls on it because a previous owner probably took it all off. But, if you have a car that has not been stripped of its emissions systems, I would suggest that you leave them on. Unless you are competitively racing the car, you won't notice much of a performance decrease.In my opinion, those people who are \\"collectors\\" are actually causing the muscle car hobby to BECOME extinct. If everyone who owned a muscle car never drove it or rarely drove it, the businesses that supply the restoration parts would soon go out of business. The classic muscle car hobby would eventually become extinct. There are those owners who like to drive their Mercedes to work, but they have one or more muscle cars they keep for an \\"investment\\" because they won't settle for those old cars as daily drivers. This is BS. Please don't become one of them.Just my two cents."},{"Title":"Death Zone Attack (C.a.D.S)","review":"I wanted to like these books. The concept of America rising from the ashes of World War III with Super Battle Armor was intriguing... especially to a teenage boy. But even back then I was not overly impressed with the writing, and quickly grew tired of the more and more explicit (gory) death scenes. And how many of the suits can be blown to pieces before a war ravaged county runs out?These books grew progressively worse and tiresome, but early on there was a spark; a small spark, but a spark. Had the books moved forward in time towards a conclusion, it would have done much more to keep the long term story interesting."},{"Title":"Ambition and Love in Modern American Art","review":"I loved this book. This magisterial work makes for absorptive reading- it absorbs your interest in art as well as your capacity to read further. The author displays an incredible sponge-like capacity. Like a sponge used to prevent any conception, the work keeps anything from coming into mind. I particularly loved the chapters on Wharhole and Polyp: Weineberg's own style pays fantastic homage in imitating the abrasive contents of the former's brillo box. It's also great how the author just soaks up some cast off comments from Freud and Manzoni, draining them like a vampire. He just sinks his teeth right in! I had a few disagreements about how he handled Basquiat with rubber gloves, especially the early work, but in the end I appreciated Weinberg's janitorial finesse and the range of his sweeping generalization."},{"Title":"Ambition and Love in Modern American Art","review":"It's certainly true, as some critics have argued, that there's not enough here to satisfy the intellectual curiosity of professional art historians. But that misses Weinberg's central point: that it's far less important to possess talent than it is to convince others that you have it. Indeed, implicit in Weinberg's study is the idea that the plain and undisguised absence of talent is no obstacle to thinking of oneself as an artist. But whereas any number of critics have made this argument before, and convincingly so, what makes Weinberg's analysis different is his choice of words -- for even as he neatly reiterates the arguments of earlier scholars, he oftentimes uses entirely different words to do so, sometimes going so far as to construct whole sentences that might reasonably be labelled as his own. Less hospitable reviewers have described Weinberg's book as &quot;an academic redundancy,&quot; &quot;the fatuous mutterings of a vacant and sterile intellect,&quot; and even &quot;the crudely drawn transcript of a mind nearly porcine in its desire to wallow around in its own filth.&quot; But what such judgments fail to acknowledge is that, in the context of Weinberg's book, such intellectual ineptitude is transformed into a self-justifying vehicle for professional advancement. It may be all its critics have made it out to be (in the end, one is hard pressed to refute their attacks). But the important lesson that Weinberg teaches us is that scholarly merit, or the lack thereof, is ultimately no substitute for artless ambition."},{"Title":"Ambition and Love in Modern American Art","review":"I, like others, picked up Weinberg's book after the stellar Nochlin review. I was somewhat puzzled by the project at first, but as is often the case with the art Weinberg discusses, \\"Ambition and Love in Modern American Art\\" is too seductive to dismiss. While his categories seem vague, even silly, his discussion of the artists and their work is elegant. His style is always engaging, mostly because it is so often personal. I suspect that critics have been troubled by Weinberg's approach, the lack of any real scholarly investigation, replaced by coffee-table talk and emotional musings. I can't really refute such critiques. But I do think that Weinberg's approach holds a lesson for all those interested in studying, writing about, and even practicing art. To try and separate oneself from the art you create or examine is a futile enteprise. His inclusion and discussion of such themes (God forbid!) as love, desire, and ambition adds a much needed jolt of blood and flesh into art history. It reminds us that art history is no science and that art historians need not feel so insecure about that. After all, art-making itself is not just a process of intellect, it is one of passion. Perhaps historians should investigate their own stirrings a bit more, as Weinberg has done here, to make their own scholarship truly insightful and what's more, readable."},{"Title":"Ambition and Love in Modern American Art","review":"Picked up this book based on Linda Nochlin's rave review in Art in America, and also, having recently heard Weinberg speak in New Mexico. This is a smart well-written text which will appeal to scholars and regular folks as well. Chapter on O'Keeffe, and the one on O'Keeffe and Stieglitz quite fascinating, as is the Weinberg's take on Agee and Evans. I plan on assigning this to my students for a course on 20th century American art."},{"Title":"Ambition and Love in Modern American Art","review":"I absolutely love this book, esp. the chapters on Bourke-White et al, and on Warhol and Basquiat. I agree with previous reviewers that this is a book full of soul by a writer and artist who loves and understands the creative process. This is a great text to teach with my upper-level undergraduates. I highly recommend it even for those only mindly interested in art, as an erudite page-turner that will make you think."},{"Title":"Ambition and Love in Modern American Art","review":"Jonathan Weinberg is one of the world's foremost historians of modern art (in addition to being a splendid painter). His stellar reputation is absolutely deserved, a fact to which this book most certainly attests. It is cogent (easy to understand), while being extremely well-written and researched.

He details the causes of India's long struggle for national sovereignty and independence from the British Empire. He shows how the Empire used divide and rule to crush India's strivings for democracy and self-rule. He shows how colonial rule damaged India's economic and political development.Marx describes the vicious nature of British Imperial rule. The Governor-General of India, Lord Dalhousie, wrote in 1855 that he had \\"has long ceased to doubt that torture in one shape or other is practised by the lower subordinates in every British province.\\" The Report of the Commission for the Investigation of Alleged Cases of Torture at Madras, 1855, acknowledged \`the general existence of torture for revenue purposes'.Marx shows how Empire caused war. He pointed out, \\"the career of endless conquest and perpetual aggression in which the English are involved by the possession of India.\\" The British government started the practice of waging war without a declaration when it attacked China in 1856, the second Opium War.He also shows how the Empire did not shrink from land theft and expropriation of private property. Governor-General Lord Canning proclaimed in 1858, \\"the proprietary right in the soil of the province of Oudh is confiscated to the British Government, which will dispose of that right in such manner as as it may see fitting.\\" Oudh is about the size of Ireland!Marx also analyses how the methods of rule govern the methods of revolt. \\"There is something in human history like retribution, and it is a rule of historical retribution that its instrument be forged not by the offended, but by the offender himself.\\" A British officer admitted, \\"We hold court-martials on horseback, and every nigger we meet with we either string up or shoot.\\" Marx noted, \\"while the cruelties of the English are related as acts of martial vigour, told simply, rapidly, without dwelling on disgusting details, the outrages of the natives, shocking as they are, are still deliberately exaggerated.\\" The British army's sack of Lucknow in 1858 was as barbaric as its earlier sacks of Badajoz in 1812 and of San Sebastian in 1813."},{"Title":"Rascals At Large, Or, The Clue in the Old Nostalgia","review":"An old-time fan reminisces about the reading exploits of his youth in a light-hearted, often humorous manner.

First century texts such as the Shang Han Lun are not books one pulls off a shelf. They were typically prepared on silk or bamboo, and their content is today known via a process called &quot;collation&quot; where archeological artifacts and references in later texts are studied to create a best possible idea of the orginal. The Shang Han Lun Yi Shi, on which this text is based, has been considered the standard by scholars for some time.Secondly, the &quot;translation of a translation&quot; issue is germane only in texts that do not contain the source Chinese. Not only does this text contain the source Chinese, there are appendicies that contain a ground-breaking study of the Shang Han Lun terminology, and alternate orderings of the Chinese text. Importantly, the translators decisions are openly and transparently justified giving readers the opportunity and tools they need to decide questions for themselves. In the case of this translation, each passage in the text is accompanied, not only by the English translation, but by commentary on the terminology and translational decisions.As regards the anonymous writer's contention that the commentaries are not by the author. This is simply false. Feng Ye, Md. Phd., is listed as an author; he is a professor at Chang Gung Medical College where he supervises and instructs graduate Chinese medicial doctors in a teaching hospital. Dr. Wiseman, the primary linguist, also teaches at Chang Gung Medical College and has widely published not only the term set but also the research on which this translation is based.Everyone will make their own decision as to which Shang Han Lun best suits their needs, but that decision should not be informed by &quot;a Reader's&quot; factual errors.Bob FeltPublisherParadigm Publications"},{"Title":"Shang Han Lun: On Cold Damage, Translation & Commentaries","review":"Mitchell, Ye, and Wiseman's translation of the Shang Han Lun is without a doubt among the treasures of my Chinese medicine library. By providing the Chinese medicine community with a line by line translation of this classic work, the translators have enabled a depth of study unparalleled in any other translation of a Chinese medical text. Furthermore, the inclusion of the original Chinese (both in simplified and traditional characters) along with pinyin, linguistic clarification, and an extensive language appendix (worthy of a book unto itself!) studying this text allows the reader to simultaneously learn Chinese medical language while immersing oneself in a seminal and indispensable classic of Chinese medical literature. Aside from its own inherent clinical and academic value - which is undeniably great - this work therefore offers a gateway to a vast treasure house of un-translated Chinese medical literature. This book is an exceptionally valuable gift to the Chinese medicine profession in English speaking countries. It should set the standard for all future translations of classical Chinese medical texts. I hope the Jin Gui Yao Lue follows..."},{"Title":"Shang Han Lun: On Cold Damage, Translation & Commentaries","review":"As anyone can tell from my previous reviews, I don't pull punches or spare criticism when I encounter a TCM or Classical Chinese medical book that fails to deliver. Well, this delivers bigtime and I'm very pleased with it. The organization is didactic, the translations appear reasonable and, thank goodness, the full Hanzi, fully accented PinYin and the translation are close by and easily accessible.It is obvious that meticulous scholarship went into the production of this book and it should prove to be the standard book on this topic for some time to come.As an unexpected bonus, the reader is treated to an absolutely superb chapter towards the end of the book on the topic of a kind of introduction to the nuances of classical Chinese and the typical grammatical constructs and idioms characteristic of medical books of this era. It is one of the finest introductions I've seen on the topic and an unexpected treasure in a book filled with commentary, translations and explanations which make the work of the student a delight instead of an unending search through obscure dictionaries and readers.As a graduate, not too long ago, of a medical college of Traditional Chinese medicine, I can say that this book will have a central spot on my medical bookshelf for some time to come!Highly recommended and my profound thanks to the people involved in its production!"},{"Title":"Shang Han Lun: On Cold Damage, Translation & Commentaries","review":"This is the standard of excellence that translations of TCM texts have to live up to.

And if you study it you will find it immediately clinically useful, esp if you already have some experience.How many USA or for that matter Chinese, Japanese or Korean herbalists actually understand how to use Gui Zhi Tang?This book is the beginning of Chinese herbal medicine, in terms of what remains of classical texts, and as such should be part of the education in all the schools. Of course, sadly, it is not.I dont think the 1 star review on this page really even merits comment; the nicest thing one could say is its misguided; but foolish might be more accurate. Agree with all what the publisher in his review has to say."},{"Title":"Shang Han Lun: On Cold Damage, Translation & Commentaries","review":"This translation of the Shang Han Lun is well done! I have been in a ten month long class taught by Arnaud Versluys and this book has been a great addition to his teachings. It is well laid out and since I am in the process of learning to read and write medical Chinese, I have found the addition in Chinese to be indispensable. The chapters are well structured as to pattern presentation and herbal prescriptions. It is also a valuable book in any practitioner of Chinese Medicine's library! Don't miss out!"},{"Title":"Shang Han Lun: On Cold Damage, Translation & Commentaries","review":"I would like to point out a few things about this book. Yes, I do have a personal beef with a translator who has a book signing. I mean the real star here is the Shang Han Lun, not him.1) Most important point, though no one will say it, this is not a real translation of the classical Shang Han Lun. It is a translation of a translation into modern Chinese. As one esteemed Chinese teacher said, when listing books that needed to be written into english;&quot; We need a new translation of the Shang Han Lun, not the Easy Shang Han Lun.&quot;2) Notice that the comentaries are not by Mitchell, but instead by a Shang Han Lun expert in China. This means that you do not get any kind of cross cultural translation.You are better off getting a much less expensive, old copy of the Shang Han Lun and reading that."},{"Title":"The Body Sculpting Bible Express for Women: 21 Minutes a Day to Physical Perfection","review":"This book works well for me. I have also used his previous book - Body Sculpting Bible for Women plus I have done weight training for many years. I'm not sure how this would be for a beginner as it is pretty fast paced, but if you're used to weight training and exercise in general and are looking to vary your routine, then this should work well for you."},{"Title":"The Body Sculpting Bible Express for Women: 21 Minutes a Day to Physical Perfection","review":"I love this book. I'll be honest, what attracted me most was the fact you only need to do exercises for 21 minutes every day.I enjoy activities like cycling and hill climbing, but exercises I do mostly to tone my body, not for fun.I was looking for exercises that are easy to do, I can do preferably from the home, and don't take up too much time. I tried to combine exercises from various books I had, but as I did not really know if I made the right combinations I was soon discouraged.The great thing about this book is that it has already done all that for me. The exercses are clearly explained and the photos are helpful too. But more, there is a whole exercise plan already made up.You start with 21 mins of exercise every day for a period of 21 days. On the days when you do abs exercises, you only do 8 mins of exercises, the rest of the 21 mins you can fill with the cardio activity of your choice. This is perfect for someone like me who has had little training of abs.After 21 days, you get a more flexible training plan and you don't have to exercise every day although it is recommended. There is a lot of variety in the exercises and if you follow the routine your whole body gets toned. I am thinking of getting another book in this series to throw even more exercises in the mix.I gave this book five stars because the essential part of the book are the exercises and the exercise routines, and I love these very much.However, the book as a whole is not perfect. The section of nutrition is too hard to follow and also rather fussy for someone who is just trying to get fit. This does not matter much to me because I got the book for the exercises and I follow my own nutrition rules (which is basically just trying to eat healthy)Also, I think it is wrong to assume that this book is suitable for absolute beginners.I recommend this book to everyone who has had a bit of exercise before and is looking for an effective way to tone the whole body in little time."},{"Title":"The Body Sculpting Bible Express for Women: 21 Minutes a Day to Physical Perfection","review":"I wonder how much trial and effort is behind this book? From what I read in this well-illustrated, plainly-written guide I think this is not a bodily-improvement manual for the average woman and is more suited to someone who is already a fitness and health fanatic. I'm trying to incorporate a few exercises here into my morning yoga but I don't think I'd embrace the entire program. That's just me, though. I don't think anything presented here will harm anyone but it's also not going to be easy enough that anyone can pick up this book, read a few chapters and get going to where she'd see immediate benefit. I guess what I'm saying is the jury is still out on this since I've only had it six days and it's too severe and intimidating for just anyone to get major use from it. But, again, that's just my opinion and the important thing about any exercise or body enhancement project is to simply GET MOVING. If this helps with that then it's done what it's supposed to do. Best of luck on your road to betterment!"},{"Title":"The Body Sculpting Bible Express for Women: 21 Minutes a Day to Physical Perfection","review":"For my background, I have done weight training off and on for many years. While I agree with the others that this book is written for a women with some weight training experience, a person in reasonable shape who took it slow could also benefit from this book.I used this book in my second trimester of my pregnancy to get back into shape after being sick for 3 months and was not able to exercise much. I got back into shape fast much to the help of using exercises from the book.I love how it combined workouts and had many great pictures to illustrate to exercises.

The chapters cover just about every issue, including history, demographics, activism, tribal political systems, federal and state policies toward Indians, and the images of Native Americans in national media. The emphasis is on Native Americans within the US political system as a whole, and not on politics within tribes or on reservations.Though the factual material is presented in a balanced way, Wilkins has a clear political position that is evident in every chapter of the text. Among other consequences, this means that he does not take a critical stance toward the tribal governments, political movements, or individual Native Americans that he discusses. In the classroom, this would provide a good foundation for discussion, while the non-classroom reader will simply have to read the book critically.While the bias is a \\"feature,\\" not a \\"flaw,\\" the book also has some minor flaws. For examples, uncertain organization mars the chapter on \\"actors in Indian politics.\\" Rather than focusing narrowly on these actors, Wilkins intersperses his treatment of actors and the history of particular policies. Some of this confusion is inevitable, since the role of the BIA as an actor obviously reflects the legislative history of the agency, but Wilkins does not try to keep these issues analytically distinct.Oddly for a book on politics, Wilkins doesn't discuss tribal political systems all that much. For much better treatment of this issue, albeit one limited to the Montana reservations, see Lopach et al., Tribal Government Today.Despite these weaknesses, this really is the best overall book on American Indian politics that I have been able to find. It would be useful both for the general reader interested in the topic and for undergraduate classroom use."},{"Title":"American Indian Politics and the American Political System (Spectrum Series: Race and Ethnicity in National and Global Politics)","review":"Bad service, never even got my book.

So many dogs and cats, not enough homes......Gives a very accurate description of the pet over population problem. Talks about what happens to all these unwanted pets and how people all over the country are feverishly trying to stop the problem and find loving homes for the animals.He is also very good about explaining the problem with some pet owners, they consider the dog or cat a possession instead of a valued member of the family. He also talks about how to go about picking out the right pet for your family situation and how shelters are trying to make sure the people and the pet are a good match.It's about time a book like this came out.

My particular complaints with this novel are the unfounded, mecurial temperaments of it's main characters. One paragraph they're verbally assaulting one another, and the next whispering endearments with no apparent resolution to the previous confrontation.

A more motley, thoroughly amoral group has never existed."},{"Title":"Dear Stranger (Warner, Historical Romance)","review":"This is the first historical romance that I have read by Ms. Cameron. I was a bit skeptical since I LOVE her contemporary books. But this took me by surprise. It is a good suspense story with a wonderful unexpected twist that will leave readers with their mouths open. The love story between Lily and Oliver is equally wonderful. Lily being an &quot;old maid&quot; of 25 knows her mind and trusts this man with her&quot;mysteries&quot; as he will with his.

It covers the high points to avoid major embarassment and has a helpful list of phrases in the back of the book."},{"Title":"Customs & Etiquette of Japan","review":"*Note: I have the 2005 edition of this book, and so my review may not reflect any updated or more detailed information in this newer edition.*I found this book to be very informative and certainly an excellent place to start if one is looking for materials on Japanese etiquette. The writing is clear and concise. Morsbach gives some good advice, including following others' examples, asking when in doubt, and reading more on the subject. This book is very short. As Morsbach himself states in the Foreward, this book is only meant to \\"highlight some of the key aspects of Japanese etiquette\\" (12).There is much, much more to learn about Japanese customs and etiquette, but if you want only some of the 'highlights,' then this is the book for you.It is also important to take (at least my older edition) with a very small grain of salt. I believe most of the information here is valuable, but this shouldn't be the only book on Japanese etiquette in your library. For example, Morsbach advises the reader to scrape their chopsticks (the disposable kind given in restaurants) together to check for/remove splinters. However, I have read multiple sources that advise specifically against this. When you rub your chopsticks together you are non-verbally stating that the quality of chopsticks is very poor, and if they are not, in fact, poor, you may insult the establishment by doing so. Therefore, it is important to note the quality of chopsticks before rubbing them together (to be safe, follow a native's example, or if there isn't one in your party, perhaps refrain altogether).Another example is a small illustration on exchanging business cards. I have read elsewhere that it is polite to hand your card over with both hands (according to the same source it is generally polite to offer items with both hands) but the illustration shows the two men holding out their business cards with one hand each.This is not to say that the illustration is wrong, or that it is ALWAYS wrong to rub your chopsticks together (do your own research to be sure!), but rather that there may be nuances to Japanese etiquette that may not be included or may not be evident in this brief book.Generally, I would recommend this book as a beginner's guide to Japanese etiquette. I also recommend, though, that you include other books on the subject to get a more complete and rounded idea of how one should conduct oneself in Japan. I also recommend reading up on the culture itself to gain a better understanding of the mentality behind the etiquette, as this book, being a highlight, does not expand on this greatly. (I feel it is also important to note there are sections in the back with some useful Japanese vocabulary and facts.)In short, add this to your library, but don't make it your only source."},{"Title":"Training guidelines for new staff in a community integrated living arrangement (Field experience paper)","review":"Even though the author of this collection has almost the same name as my my mother, she's not related to me, at least not that I know of. I'd love if she was, because it's great to have a genius in the family, and she shows signs of being one with these beatifully weighted stories. There's a purity about them that sets them apart from the experimentalism and Ultra-naturalism that seem to dominate the form these days, a characteristically Irish love of language, and a simultaneous feeling for and detatchment from her characters that is really endearing.

He can be tough to pin down.I do know from what I have read so far that it has been a delight for me to read someone putting forth the idea that science and religion do not have to be diametrically opposed; that actually they should be saying the same thing; that mankind does not have to kill the God of the Bible (or the Revealed Word as Professor James A.

He seems to have almost anticipated the debate. He shows the science behind the emergence of man or more importantly the NooSphere.Then highlights how import the role of faith will be in shaping our ultimate fate. The following is a brief excerpt from the book.\\"And now, by the very fact that we have measured the truly cosmic gravity of the sickness that disquiets us, we are put in possession of the remedy that can cure it. 'After the long series of transformations leading to man, has the world stopped? Or, if we are still moving, is it not merely in a circle?'The answer to that uneasiness of the modern world springs up by itself when we formulate the dilemma in which the analysis of our action has imprisoned us.Either nature is closed to our demands for futurity, in which case thought, the fruit of millions of years of effort, is stifled, still-born in a self-abortive and absurd universe. Or else an opening exists -- that of the super-soul above our souls; but in that case the way out, if we are to agree to embark on it, must open out freely onto limitless psychic spaces in a universe to which we can unhesitatingly entrust ourselves.Between these two alternatives of absolute optimism or absolute pessimism, there is no middle way because by its very nature progress is all or nothing. We are confronted accordingly with two directions and only two: one upwards and the other downwards, and there is no possibility of finding a half-way house.On neither side is there any tangible evidence to produce. Only, in support of hope, there are rational invitations to an act of faith.At this cross-roads where we cannot stop and wait because we are pushed forward by life -- and obliged to adopt an attitude if we want to go on doing anything whatsoever -- what are we going freely to decide?To determine man's choice, in his famous wager, Pascal loaded the dice with the lure of boundless gain. Here, when one of the alternatives is weighted with logic and, in a sense, by the promise of a whole world, can we still speak of a simple game of chance? Have we the right to hesitate?The world is too big a concern for that. To bring us into existence it has from the beginning juggled miraculously with too many improbabilities for there to be any risk whatever in committing ourselves further and following it right to the end. If it undertook the task, it is because it can finish it, following the same methods and with the same infallibility with which it began.In last analysis the best guarantee that a thing should happen is that it appears to us as vitally necessary.We have said that life, by its very structure, having once been lifted to its stage of thought, cannot go on at all without requiring to ascend even higher.This is enough for us to be assured of the two points of which our action has immediate need, The first is that there is for us, in the future, under some form or another, at least collective, not only survival but also super-life.The second is that, to imagine, discover and reach this superior form of existence, we have only to think and to walk always further in the direction in which the lines passed by evolution take on their maximum coherence.\\""},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"Teilhard de Chardin was a Jesuit Father, and a highly regarded palaeontologist.

However, classic Darwinian evolution proceeds by \\"chance\\". It is a blind operation, which offers no meaning or hope.Therefore he proposes a purposive process of evolution, which he refers to as \\"cosmogenesis\\". Within such cosmogenesis, the emergence of mind takes place -- a process which he refers to as \\"noogenesis\\". Together with noogenesis, there is an evolving of the collective sphere of mind on the planet, which he refers to as the \\"noosphere\\". This leads utimately to a goal, a final state, which he refers to as the \\"Omega point\\" or \\"peace\\" (one might suggest: shalom). At this point, the noosphere (all conscious beings) will be intensely unified, having achieved a \\"hyper-personal\\" organisation.There is a twist in the tale, however. Teilhard de Chardin then defines \\"the conditions for advance\\". Cosmogenesis proceeds only \\"on condition that we increase our knowledge and our love\\".Let us apply this briefly to contemporary theology. In keeping with his ideas, one may posit a kingdom of God -- rather, a reign of God, since a kingdom is \\"too static\\" (Guder 1998:94) -- a reign which marches forward with \\"impelling force\\" towards shalom (Van Engen 1991:26). As might be anticipated, this would entail the notion of \\"no privatized eschatology\\" (Newbigin 1989:113), and the need for our own participation towards the \\"final outcome\\" (Watson 2001:39). I offer these parallels merely as fleeting suggestions for further study.Teilhard de Chardin has great breadth of thought, and an extraordinary talent for expressing his ideas clearly. However, I found that I ran into a great many obstacles of thought, among them the following:1. He points out that science, by and large, would oppose his views: \\"The majority of \`scientists' would tend to contest the validity of [my views]\\". Yet the book is intended to \\"reconcile Christian theology with this evolutionary philosophy\\". What would be the purpose of such reconciliation, if his views are largely denied by science?2. He continually expresses fundamental doubt or reserve about his own ideas. He states: \\"The views I am attempting to put forward are . . . largely tentative\\". In fact, he posits them \\"in spite of all evidence to the contrary\\". Surely one would desire more of a \\"science\\" one is to stake one's life upon.3. On the one hand, he writes about \\"mankind in its march\\" of emergent evolution. On the other, this evolution \\"can give itself or refuse itself\\". In fact, if our own attitude is wanting, \\"the whole of evolution will come to a halt\\". On what basis, then, should we assume that such evolution is anything more than a contingent or surface phenomenon?4. He clearly does not know what to do with suffering. As though as an afterthought, he relegates this to an Appendix. He writes: \\"Necessarium est ut scandala eveniant. . . . Suffering and failure, tears and blood: so many by-products . . . begotten by the noosphere on its way.\\" At best, he states cryptically that suffering may \\"add precision and depth\\" to theology.CITATION OF REFERENCES:~ Guder, Darrell L.

This book is a prime example of intellectual conceit; unfortunately, like the emperor who wore no clothes, the reader who is taken in by this nonsense only reveals to the scientifically literate how credulous he or she really is. Nobel Prize winning scientist Peter Medawar, cited already by other reviewers, has criticized Teilhard's depiction of evolution as utterly confused and \\"unsupported by scientific evidence.\\" [His full critique may be found in the journal Mind, 1961, (70:99-106) while a selection is available in Connie Barlow's new book, Evolution Extended].I would just like to add one point to the many fine criticisms already made by other reviewers. To me, this book's main shortcoming is gross irresponsibility. The gentle Teilhard would be taken aback by this charge, since his book is about love and cosmic destiny. But I think the problem with The Phenomenon of Man goes well beyond muddled metaphysics and Christocentrism (i.e. assuming that evolution runs according to a Christian, rather than a Buddhist, Mayan, Muslim, Hindu or Sumerian narrative: what, for instance, is inherently more Christian about the evolution of the notochord or the great mass extinctions of the Devonian, Permian and Cretaceous?). The real trouble is that Teilhard loosely borrows a scientific concept here and a scientific fact there as a foundation for an entirely self-serving, subjective argument. And what's wrong with that? Plenty, when you consider how nationalists use and especially abuse \\"scientific history\\" to demonstrate why a piece of land really belongs to them and not the other guy, or how racists use a little survey here and a cranial measurement there to demonstrate why one or another race is inferior.Some say Teilhard's book is too difficult; I say it is too easy. Science is about looking facts in the face whether we like them or not; even more, it is about looking uncertainty in the face whether we like it or not and admitting what we don't know. If Teilhard wanted to fantasize about Christian cosmology, fine; but fantasy is not an argument.I gave this book two stars instead of one because the prose is sometimes affecting, particularly if you read it while sipping freshly brewed coffee by a fireplace.Incidentally, it is not \\"hatred\\" for religion or spirituality that spurs my criticism, as one reviewer so uncharitably suggests. Rather it is my belief that dialogue, which I cherish, cannot be productive if we ground our opinions on nothing firmer than our desire to believe them. The only way we can begin to guard against self-delusion and intellectual self-indulgence is to present claims that can held up to some form of critical scrutiny. Since Teilhard de Chardin does not, I see no reason why non-Christians, especially, and many Christians as well, should not construe his work as a piece of (inspired) fiction.Pure theology may lie beyond the scope of reasoned criticism; but the \\"science\\" Teilhard purports to offer does not."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"The Take Away is Stated Trite or TruePhenomenon of Man details Teilhard de Chardin's view on creation.His provocatively voiced take on life draws the reader out of his or her box to wonder along with Teilhard de Chardin's own phenomenon.His book reports his thinking about existence, man being the crown of creation, and for him life is consciousness.As he proposes, phenomenon (i.e., consciousness) is a state of existence.Mind mind reflexively folds - growing - by a process of layering.Resultantly, human consciousness is the crown of phenomenon, both individually and generally.His self-assured tone flows upon series after series of complex sentences; each compacted with burgeoning information.I admire his visually poetic voice and his scientific confidence.At times my thoughts were carried about by the strength of his verbal-vision.The reach of his language extends beyond understanding, yet it makes sense.Put simply, what is trite might not be true, but something is taken away by reading the book."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"Teilhard opens what is generally regarded as his most significant philosophical work with the statement: \\"if this book is to be properly understood, it must be read not as a work on metaphysics, still less as a sort of theological essay, but purely and simply as scientific treatise.\\"This book is not written in standard scientific style. Teilhard uses more mystical language, which certainly disturbed many scientists. He has got his critics among them, who judged him to have deceived himself otherwise he would argue dishonest.Most of the book is devoted to a poetic description of an evolving Earth, beginning with the formation of the planet, and then moving on to the development of life from its most primitive manifestation to the emergence of man. Some phyla of single-celled organisms eventually developed into metazons ... and so on, and one lineage of all the following creatures finally acquired intelligence and the \\"hominisation\\" of the world at last occurred.Teilhard argues that energy existed in two basic modes, tangential and radial. The former is essentially the energy measure by the instruments of the physicist, while the latter can be regarded as a sort of psychic or spiritual energy. His cosmological system evolves higher and higher order in its biota as time proceeds, and this seemed to him to be forbidden by the Second Law of Thermodynamics which he admits governs the evolution of the usual variety of energy. In fact the Second Law of Thermodynamics is poison to the alleged evolutionary processes. Furthermore the eventual heat death of the universe, predicted by the thermodynamicists, would undermine any hope of having ultimate intelligence permanently immanent in the cosmos.Teilhard certainly described evolution as \\"orthogenetic\\", moving in an unilinear fashion due to some internal or external \\"driving force\\". From this and the apparent fact that in Teilhard\`s picture the development of Man is inevitable, one can conclude that his work is close to any unproved evolutionary mysticism. He said: \\"Without orthogenesis life would only have spread; with it there is an ascent of life that is invincible.\\" This is purely hypothetical of course.What then is the goal of mankind, according to the author. To form the \\"noosphere\\", the cogitative layer of the Earth. Human science and civilization is the \\"planetization\\". The \\"noosphere\\" will finally in distant future coalese into a super sapient being, the Omega Point. This is the ultimate goal of the tree of life."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"Simply astounding. These are about the only words that I think best describe The Phenomenon of Man. Certainly, this has to be one of the most wildly interesting books that I have ever read. Most of us know and at least vaguely understand evolution, and also theists usually respond defensively that there is no conflict between God and evolution. But rare is the person who seeks to intergrate evolution into God's large-scale, dynamic plan refusing even just to argue for some &quot;Design&quot; in the universe. Teilhard argues that with the onset of animals capable of internal reflection, human beings, evolution takes a turn &quot;inward&quot;. The consciousnesss is now what evolves, evolving toward an Omega Point with Teilhard sees as Christ. Certainly in our lives we can see the appeal of this view. Shouldn't our lives be a constant growth, an evolution toward complete oneness with God?Teilhard is a genius and the best modern example of the intellectual firepower that can come from the Catholic Church and the Jesuits in particular. Although he and the Church didn't always get along (most of his stuff was censored in some way) I think this is due to the fact that Teilhard was so far ahead of his time that the hierarchy really didn't know what to do with him. Surely, 50 or even 20 years from now Teilhard de Chardin will be regarded as one of the most prolific Catholic minds in the last few centuries."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1945) was a Jesuit Priest, theologian, philosopher, and paleontologist who expanded on the concept of the noosphere originated by the Russian mineralogist and geochemist, Vladimir I. Vernadsky (1863-1945) who also originated the concept of the biosphere- the \\"life zone\\" where all biological life exists between the crust of the earth to the lower atmosphere or the \\"life envelope\\" surrounding our planet.The \\"noosphere\\" or \\"thinking layer\\", according to Chardin, comes about at that point in time when humans evolve to the realization of a global human consciousness and is totally aware of itself and then headed for the ultimate destination- the \\"Omega Point\\" or \\"Kingdom of God\\". At this point, the earth is enveloped by a collective human consciousness.Chardin uses both science and theology to support this theory and his dissertation on this is fascinating and thought provoking. Unlike most of his religious peers, he was a proponent of directional evolution and that Darwin had hit upon the proof of God's intent, that final destination of the human conscious evolution where the Creator is realized. Darwin, of course, preferred to distance himself from theological assumptions of species evolution, especially so with us humans and his religious wife.Chardin distinguishes humans from all other life-forms because of our abilities to contemplate our existence, hence, the uniqueness of or the \\"phenomenon of man\\". Hopefully, he concludes, that the human family will evolve to be totally conscience, intelligent and loving, cooperative, and rising far above our current chaotic existence. Amen to that lofty, but desirable goal!The evolutionary path of the noosphere is laid out in Chardin's earth evolution and stated as: \\"We have been following the successive stages of the same grand progression from the fluid contours of the early earth. Beneath the pulsations of geo-chemistry, of geo-tectonic and of geo-biology, we have detected one and the same fundamental process, always recognizable-the one which was given material form in the first cells and was continued in the construction of nervous systems. We saw geogenesis promoted to biogenesis, which turned out in the end to be nothing less psychogenesis.\\" (p 181). And leading therefore, to \\"noosgenesis\\" or global consciousness. Finally, and due to the interconnectedness and seemingly intentional direction of life on earth, Chardin gives Earth a soul: Gaia thinking- Earth \\"intentionally\\" supports life.No wonder then that Chardin is referenced and quoted in a mountain of science and religious works. His theories have influenced such great thinkers as: Lewis Thomas(\\"The Lives of a Cell\\"), Buckminster Fuller (\\"The Dymaxion Map\\"), the Gaia Theory- Earth as a conscious, intentional, self-regulating life-support system and expounded upon by Guy Murchie (\\"The Seven Mysteries of Life\\") and later by James Lovelock (Gaia: The Practical Science of Planetary Medicine\\"), Thomas Berry (\\"The Dream of the Earth\\") and many, many more.Chardin traveled the world on his scientific investigations and he was present at the discovery of the Peking Man in China. Some historians have intimated that much of Chardin's travels were at the behest of the Catholic Church for they were not thrilled with his attempts to blend science and religion and the farther away from Rome he was, the better.The church cautioned him not to publish any of his works and faithful to that edict, he left them to a friend in the U.S. to publish posthumously to avoid further conflict and retaliation from the Church- bad memories of the history of the Catholic Church's terrible treatment of scientist and thinkers whose musings drifted from repressive, suffocating church dogma, i.e., Galileo Galilei, et al.No matter where one's leanings are on religion or science, this is a potent dissertation on bringing science and religion together for awe and respect of life and eventual peace on Earth through global consciousness."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"Teilhard has been maligned in scientific circles for many decades and you still hear complaints about his work by people ignorant of or hostile to his message. But make no mistake about it, this book is a breathtakingly accurate and honest description of physical reality. Teilhard uses Bergsonian intuition and Catholic metaphysics to spring us from the trap set by Horgan in The End of Science. Further progress in science will proceed along the trajectories identified by Teilhard. As recent books such as Garden of Ediacara and Nonzero begin to grasp the implications of Teilhard's conclusions, it becomes increasingly clear that Teilhard set the course for both spiritual and scientific renewal. His scientific insights cannot be divorced from their spiritual and religious context. Teilhard should be praised rather than criticized for this because it shows us that the notion of 'pure science' is pure fallacy. Simon Conway Morris articulated this in his review of Nonzero: &quot;to imagine that human destiny is entirely mundane may be one of the most peculiar errors of the moderns.&quot;"},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"The reading of this book is an experience in itself. I approached the Phenomenon of Man with some skepticism, as most people will, since it conforms to neither Darwinian or Creationist dogma. Its putative teleology within a spiritual framework is a dissent from both views. What you notice, though, is the immense intellect behind this work. The process of formal argument anticipates and answers the counter arguments as soon as they are posed. You feel as if you are on tracks led to an inevitable conclusion. The book itself becomes analogous to the process de Chardin is proposing. It is finally the homogeneity of the spirit rather than the heterogenous complexification of the natural world which is the ultimate subject of this book. A merging of consciousness in the image of Christ is the conlusion, hardly conforming to Church doctrine of the sovereignty of the individual or free will, which led to the authors problems with the Roman Curia."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955) was a Jesuit priest and a paleontologist at a time in history when our greatest minds here in the West were making quantum leaps in our understanding of the ultimate nature of reality and our place in it. Divine revelations and mystical insights were at an apex. Teilhard had several mystical experiences during his lifetime. He is considered by some to have been one of the four greatest thinkers in the Western Christian tradition. The others being St. Paul, Augustine, and Thomas Aquinas. His counterpart in the East was Sri Aurobindo. Sychronistically, or perhaps by chance, Aurobindo was given a classical education in England as a youth and then returned to India in 1893. There Aurobindo's thinking evolved from Advaita to neo-Advaita. The primary difference being the evolution in understanding from pure monism to holistic synergetics, a move from the rational to the transrational. Reality is not numerically one, it is a unitive one, whole. Both great men came to the same basic conclusion separately at about the same time. That conclusion being that the unfolding of the Universe is both a physical and a spiritual evolution. Though Teilhard thought of himself in pantheistic terms, I believe he would be better described as a \\"Pan'en'theist\\". Panentheism according to Charles Hartshorne is the belief that God is greater than the sum of God's parts. For the Pantheist Nature is God. For the Panentheist Nature is a part of God. The former is a monotheistic thus solipsistic view, the latter a manifold thus synergetic opinion. In the former God is playing Solitaire, hence the existential dread and nihilistic moroseness of Continental Philosophy. Rationality is a tool of awareness, not the be all to end all of understanding. In the latter God is playing a game of Hearts we all can play. God is more than one but less than two, a transrational whole number. With God all things are possible.Henri Bergson with his book \\"Creative Evolution\\" also had a profound impact on Teilhard. Bergson provided Teilhard a theoretical basis for his feeling of intimacy with nature. Bergson saw a \\"force\\" at work behind the processes of evolution. From this Teilhard would come to an understanding that would reconcile his religion with his science. He chose to see the \\"Book of Genesis\\" from a metaphorical rather than a literal perspective. From Charles Darwin Teilhard would take \\"time\\" and apply it to his understanding of natural processes. Before Darwin's theory of evolution entered the literature Western Science was working under the constraint of a time frame of only a few thousand years from the moment of Creation. After Darwin \\"time\\" became nearly infinite, beyond rational understanding. How long is a million years, let alone a billion years? A lot can happen when time expands exponentially. Given enough time it is reasonable to believe that a monkey might evolve into a man. Especially if that metamorphosis was a part of a master plan, part of an intelligent design. Today Biologists no longer quibble over whether or not there is design in Nature, the argument now is whether such design is \\"real design\\" or \\"apparent design\\". Sounds like an infinite regression to me. A one-way ticket to a House of Mirrors. The nature of Reality is not either/or, rather, it is a dynamic blend of seeming opposites.For Teilhard, the \\"Theory of Evolution\\" became a revelation, \\"The Revelation\\". This did not sit well with many atheistic scientists, most notably Stephen Jay Gould. Let me just say that in my opinion Gould made an ass of himself. In Gould's book \\"Hen's Teeth and a Horse's Toes\\" Gould accused Teilhard of psuedo-science while admitting that he based his opinion on \\"circumstantial\\" evidence. Gould then had the audacity to claim that it was up to others to prove he was wrong about Teilhard. Talk about psuedo-science. This controversy was in regard to Teilhard's role in the \\"Piltdown Man Hoax\\". That Gould made such an allegation more than 20 years after Pierre's death and based it upon circumstantial evidence speaks more to Gould's than Teilhard's character, in my opinion. Obviously, Teilhard could not respond to Gould's allegations, though many of his contemporaries defended his honor and launched attacks of their own questioning the motives behind Gould's attack of Teilhard. Science, like Religion, isn't always pretty. I digress.Bergson's theory that there was a \\"force\\" behind the evolution of life on Earth inspired Teilhard. He saw evolution as guided by a plan, not merely by happenstance, at least as much by orthogenesis as by natural selection. The debate over the driving force behind evolution continues. Teilhard came to see Creation as being drawnout rather than sudden. That the world is still being created. That we are still evolving. He believed in God, and he believed in Evolution. As a young man on a Dig in Egypt he had what he describes as a mystical insight into the underlying unity of the Earth, from rock to Man. For Teilhard, Religion and Science were no longer mutually exclusive. Spending most of his adult years in China Teilhard became familiar with the idea of yin and yang. The ancient Taoist concept that things mutually arise in polar pairs of seeming opposites. In/out, male/female, good/bad, creationism/evolution, science/religion. Day and night are dependent on each other, neither has meaning without the other, and the seed of each is contained within its seeming opposite. It is darkest before the dawn. Teilhard was able to see that Western Science and Religion were in many ways polar opposite/non-opposites. Mutually interdependent poles of the same underlying unity. Science without religion is sterile, religion without science is superstition.Teilhard was rewarded for his synthesis of Materialistic Science with his Faith with accusations of being a psuedo-scientist and a heretic. Some of these attacks continue. It would not be until after his death that his writings would be released for publication. Much of his influence on our current worldview remains anonymous. There is no doubt that his thought had a profound impact on many of his contemporaries, both within the Catholic Church and within the Scientific Community. Vatican II, the movement of the Catholic Church to a more ecumenical spirit towards those of other faiths, was largely the result of Teilhard's thinking. Understanding continues to evolve.Today Teilhard is seen by many as a nature mystic, an ecological and evolutionary visionary, and even as a prophet. There is no doubt that Teilhard's holistic thinking inspired James Lovelock to come up with his \\"Gaia Hypothesis\\", that the Earth is a \\"Super\\" organism. An organic whole greater than the sum of its parts. For Teilhard even rocks had a certain but limited consciousness. Everything had a sacred quality. Teilhard's concept of the \\"Noosphere\\" is being realized today through the spread of the \\"Internet\\". From the \\"Biosphere\\" comes the \\"Noosphere\\", and finally we arrive at the \\"Omega Point\\". The Noosphere is composed of all the interacting minds on Earth. The Omega Point is the culmination of this process of evolutionary integration. \\"The Phenomenon of Man\\", more correctly translated \\"The Human Phenomenon\\", is Teilhard's magnum opus. If you read nothing else by Teilhard read this book."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"The reviews here pretty much mirror the two camps out there regard PTdC - love him or hate him and little in between.I think there is another way to approach the work. Is he a windy and obscure writer much of the time? Yes. Is he wrong about scientific details? Yes. Do either of those problems negate his genuine and largely orginal philosophical insights? In my opinion, no. Does one dismiss Aristotle because he's wrong about the way the human body works? Is Hegel worthless because he's windy and abstruse? Not at all (but it makes the reader's job much harder and casts some real suspicion on the work, I admit).Did anyone really go into reading Teilhard thinking it was a scientific paper? Can his critics find some sympathy (in the midst of what seems to be their relentlessly peevish worldview) for someone forging radical ideas that meld philosophy, theology and science? The ideas, once distilled, are at least interesting, and the basic concepts are not at all invalidated (from my reading at least) by some scientific errors.For some of you out there, please get over your unthinking hatred of any religious or spiritual writing. It's an enormous conceit and a huge intellectual blindspot.And for Mr. Coffee-by-the-Fireplace, he's a Jesuit. It's not his job to speak up for Krishna. Sheesh."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"Stunning, exhilarating, liberating in every way. Has no one recommended this book to the creationists -- informed them that without understanding evolution, we cannot come to a right conception of God?Some passages are as gorgeous as Proust. Some are awkward and stumbling. Teilhard has to grope for a new language in which to formulate his vision; consequently the last quarter of the book becomes too heady, more intuitive than persuasive. It is not free from instances of circular thinking or of authorial bias. But these in no way detract from the power and originality of the vision and the synthesis it achieves.As for Medawar's critique, citely so frequently and with such dismissive satisfaction: what qualifies a man of the microscope to comment on a work of metaphysics? Nothing is easier than to make fun of philosophy and philosophers, but it's a sophomoric sport. This or that paragraph or assertion by Teilhard is easy to pick holes in, and Medawar does so with glee and mean energy, not even neglecting, from his august Nobelist standing, to denigrate Teilhard's scientific credentials. But Teilhard's vision of life's long work since the beginning of space-time Medawar cannot injure, much less supplant with a vision of his own.One way to summarize what's wrong with the world, with the nation, and with ourselves, is to say that not enough people have read this book and been given the faith in life that it demonstrates so powerfullly."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"In the most serious intent to transcend dualism Teilhard de Chardin not only put the bases for a new worldview but also made the most clear distintion between the without of things and the within of things. In this way he opened the doors to start thinking in a new concept of unity in which the qualitative aspect of reality is just as important as the quantitative. Another important Teilhard contribution is the concept of &quot;The Perception of Space-time&quot; not as a linear-mathematical framework but as a new sphere of reality he also called DURATION as Bergson did...In the last century...has been taking place in our minds: the definite access of consciouness to a scale of new dimensions; and in consequence the birth of an entirely new universe."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"42 years ago, I read The Phenomenon of Man, while in the service. It changed the direction of my life, because it animated me to return to my dream of teaching, which I felt was part of helping us all reach de Chardin's dream of mankind evolving towards the unit of point Omega. I bought it again recently, to bask in the ideas, the brilliance of his expression, and to re connect with our mutual dream. I hope to visit his grave this summer. I'm 70 years of age, and I'm still, hopefully, participating in his dream of compassion, unity, and universal love."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"Of all places, I was first directed to Teilhard de Chardin by a reference thereto in a work of Joseph Ratzinger (later known as Pope Benedict XVI). Given my general interest in the biological sciences as well as anthropology, I decided to investigate this matter. I am ever so thankful that I took that step into The Phenomenon of Man. Teilhard's work is a beautiful synthesis of paleontology, philosophy, and even theology, standing as a beacon to the members of all three branches of knowledge. It is a testimony to the greatness of his work that it still influences the Pope to this very day, who used evolutionary language to discuss the resurrection, a concept no doubt influenced by Teilhard's work.The general path of this text is an investigation into the development of consciousness within creation. This is done in light that consciousness must be latent in creation in order for it to exist at all within the context of evolution. It is furthermore acknowledged by the findings of relativity which point to the fact that the various spheres of the physical world are not separate but related, although only slightly at slow speeds. So too must consciousness not be fully unknown within the earlier forms of life, although it may have had much less influence on the activity of that life.The narrative itself is translated well and is readable without a great deal of difficulty. I must say that the author is a bit overly-flowery at times. However, just as I began to become vexed with this floweriness, I would hit passages which were such stunning expositions of his thesis that I would nearly have chills. Teilhard was the first person to ever make almost cry over the final jump to reflection found in the simian branch of the tree of life.His other, just as important, theme is that of complexification. The author puts forth the justifiable analysis of the unitive aspect of creation. The groping of life comes to be only by the unification of atomic units. This remains his theme and ultimately drives his theories for a united humanity, particularly in his views with respect to Christ. While his ideas here are somewhat radical, they are not as unorthodox as they appear to many at a quick glance. Instead, his work is an affirmation that Christ has pushed the evolutionary trend to its Omega point, a point which must in all actuality autonomously exist.The problem of pain is relatively unaddressed in this text and remains a reason for the Church's wariness with the work. I think that he handles it well enough, passing the torch to theologians, acknowledging his own shortfalls in developing this theme.The Phenomenon of Man is a gigantic step in a beautiful understanding of the person, world, and God. Although it is not a complete breeze of a read, it is most definitely well worth the time to read it. I put off reading it for far too long and do not suggest that you do the same. I heartily suggest it to you if you have any interest in human evolution, the birth and deployment of consciousness, or any inkling of theological/philosophical interest."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"Pierre Teilhard De Chardin was a Jesuit scientist, a brilliant paleontologist and evolutionist who attempted throughtout his life to reconcile Catholic belief with scientific knowledge. It was necessary for him to invent a new vocabulary in order to accomplish this. The trouble is that this vocabulary is rooted in mysticism and faux scientific terminology.He valiantly tries to show the long march from unicellular creatures to modern human. This is much more plausible than his introduction of a spiritual &quot;zone&quot; through which this evolution is strained. In other words, evolutionary change with a hidden guiding hand. Parts of it were beautiful and I agree with the author that man is a unique phenomenon on this planet. But how one reconciles a physical mechanism with a spiritual theology is a task too great even for a great man.How is Jesus as God reconciled with ape-man or pre-man? Chardin suggests that religion is a natural outgrowth of being human and he may be right. But it should be noted that the spiritual side of man has evolved along with the physical changes. All we can do is take a &quot;snapshot&quot; of where we are, discover who we were and prepare for who we will become."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"Don't be expected to be blown away by the logic in this book, or the conclusions that are derived thereof. The logic gaps in much of this book are tremendous. A pantheist may find this book to be enlightening but don't expect to be convinced if you aren't already so inclined.It is not hard to understand from this book why de Chardin was censured by the Catholic Church. It is not quite as simple as the fact that he espoused evloution, as a previous review would imply. The Church does not have a problem with evolution. It does, however, have a problem with one of its priests claiming that inanimate matter possesses consciousness.There is no doubting de Chardin's intellect and genius, as well as his mystical tendencies, and it shines through rather well in this book. However, at times it seems he is either too intelligent or too mystical for his own good. In the end I was struck by the fact that large sections of this book seemed to be nothing more than intelligent sounding gibberish."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"People, people! I feel honor-bound to interject a skeptical note into the midst of all the adulatory gushing. There is no doubt Teilhard de Chardin was a deeply religious man as well as a capable scientist. He strove mightily to reconcile these two aspects of his consciousness, and *Phenomenon of Man* is one of the most celebrated results of his efforts. The other reviews will tell you how splendid it is; it falls to me to tell you that it is nothing but incoherent mush and pseudo-scientific babbling.Sir Peter Medawar, Nobel prizewinner in medicine, had this to say about the book:&quot;It is a book widely held to be of the utmost profundity and significance; it created something like a sensation upon its publication in France, and some reviewers hereabouts called it the Book of the Year --- one, the Book of the Century. Yet the greater part of it, I shall show, is nonsense, tricked out with a variety of metaphysical conceits, and its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself.&quot;Medawar's defends this opinion with copious quotes from de Chardin, the arguments of which he analyzes and refutes with withering contempt. Medawar's verdict seems conclusive to me; there may be a book somewhere that successfully unites the scientific and the mystical, but Teilhard's isn't it."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"I bought this book with high expectations, having been delighted with the idea of Teilhard's &quot;noosphere&quot;. However, to my dismay, I've found his unique insights muddled in a jarble of mental gymnastics which oftentimes escapes honest logic. &quot;The Phenomenon Of Man&quot; is less a work of genius and revelation than it is a work of belief determining conclusion. I found myself searching the pages for some vestige of untainted logic, but could find none. Religion and science have one thing in common: neither allows fence-sitting. You either have faith in God, or you do not (religion); you either have faith in logic, or you do not (science) -- no inbetweens. I'm thoroughly unconvinced that Teilhard has disuaded either, as only seems appropriate since God is beyond any rationalization. And what's the use of trying to convince skeptics of anything beyond skepticism? This said, I agree with Teilhard that science neglects &quot;the within of things&quot;, but is this any real wonder, given that science is a study of the workings of nature and nature alone? Perhaps in the end Teilhard will be proven right, that any description of reality science pieces together will never be complete without a spiritual perspective, but until science uncovers incontrivertible evidence of that conclusion, all our conceits pertaining to it are a waste of breath or ink -- and a wearying read."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"Bring your oxometer, and try to keep a straight faceDerek Bickerton, in \\"Language and Species,\\" gives us an example of language creating concepts: a friend declares that, to evaluate a certain speech, he would really need his \\"oxometer.\\" What's that? Oh, \\"it measures the percentage of BS in things.\\" Hmm, could be a useful tool-- but it doesn't exist.If there were such a thing, it would register very nearly 100 percent when presented with this absurd book.Why do I call it absurd? Well, take a look at this statement, which Father Teilhard considered so important that it deserved a whole paragraph to itself:\\"In the last analysis the best guarantee that a thing should happen is that it appears to us as vitally necessary.\\"So -- using our powers of analytical thinking -- we can reduce this sentence to the proposition that we will get whatever we really need. Which is nonsense, as every failed lottery contestant and starving infant can assure you.As those eminent philosophers The Rolling Stones once said, \\"You can't always get what you want, but if you try real hard, you just might find that you get what you need.\\" The Stones seem to disagree with Father Teilhard -- the Stones seem to think that some human effort is necessary in order to get what you need.None of this is scientific thinking, of course. So how did this book ever get a reputation as a scientific book?Well, part of it is \\"jumping on the bandwagon.\\" As Brian Silver brilliantly shows in \\"The Ascent of Science,\\" every major scientific discovery has been pounced on by the ignorant and mistakenly applied to everything under the sun. Newton's Laws of Motion were applied to politics, medicine, and human behavior. David Hume thought he saw \\"inertia\\" in thought! (\\"Every thought will continue thinking in the same direction at a constant speed unless acted on by some force?\\")Similarly, the law of universal gravitation was dragged into politics, biology, and chemistry. And the same fate lurked for Einstein and Darwin, naturally.Charles, meet Father Teilhard! The fundamental process or motion in the universe is evolution, and evolution is \\"a general condition to which all theories, all hypotheses, all systems must bow...\\" Now, there is the biggest bandwagon-jump I have ever seen!All theories must bow to the general law of evolution? Really? How about Newton's Laws of Motion? They haven't evolved a bit during the history of the universe. How about rocks? They haven't evolved and never will.Evolution is a discovery about life and DNA. It is not applicable outside the realm of biology. Get a grip, folks. \\"The universe\\" is not \\"evolving.\\" Life is evolving. Computers are not \\"evolving\\" -- unless you use language loosely. Evolution is a process governing living organisms only.There is much more and much worse in this awful book. As Brian Silver remarked, \\"Here we are in the land of unprovable statements, abuse of language, and everything that has given mysticism a bad name.\\" Just like a TV psychic babbling of \\"focusing cosmic energy,\\" Father Teilhard takes strictly defined terms such as \\"energy,\\" uses them in the loosest metaphorical way, and then pretends that his \\"energy\\" corresponds to the \\"energy\\" found in a scientific text.As Peter Medawar brilliantly remarked, this sort of book finds a huge audience among people who have been educated far beyond their capacity to undertake analytical thought."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"\\"Nevertheless, I was irresisibly reminded of Peter Medawar's comment on Father Teilhard de Chardin's THE PHENOMENON OF MAN, in the course of what is possibly the greatest negative book review of all time: 'its author can be excused of dishonesty only the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself.'\\"From Richard Dawkin'sThe God Delusion."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"The main ethos of this text, that human evolution converges with an archetype of the divine, is an old ideal, first purposed by Nietzsche as the \\"Ubermensch.\\" This is not the only troubling dynamic of this book, however, as the entire basis, a reconciliation between evolutionary science, and the biblical creation, is faulty at best, and impossible in reality.Unfortunately for M. Chardin, his working does not break, crack, or even reach this barrier of failure. With its intermingling of atheist ideology, with irreconcilable creationist theory, it is a fractured effort that must err on the side of theosophy, and not philosophy (and most certainly not science)."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"There are plenty of books this bad, pages of tosh cobbled together to sound impressive, but actually saying nothing.

For instance, the statement \\"there exists a Latin phrase that when spoken will cause the Devil to appear before the speaker\\" is irrefutable. Why? Because the number of possible Latin phrases is literally infinite and they cannot all be tested in a finite amount of time by a finite number of speakers. However many phrases we've uttered, there are always phrases left unsaid and therefore untested. But no one would argue that the statement is true, quite the opposite-- the statement is nonsense.The Phenomenon of Man claims to be a scientific memoir examining Man and his place in the world. It is no such thing. A scientific memoir is something more along the lines of Edward Wilson's book \\"The Ants\\" or Donald Knuth's \\"The Art of Computer Programming\\", viz. it should be an exhaustive study of a topic that thoroughly examines and catalogues features of the object being studied. A memoir is NOT a speculative discourse of untestable claims.Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was both a passionate and practical man. A precocious, spiritual youth he enthusiastically joined the Jesuit order; there is no questioning his Catholic faith. He was also a hands-on field palaeontologist, travelling to remote location to dig up fossils; and there is no questioning his scientific credentials.(*) Reconciling science and Christianity was therefore a deeply personal necessity. The Phenomenon of Man is Teilhard's failed attempt at this.Teilhard accepts the fact of evolution. He bravely asserts that while we can never have any fossil evidence of the material origin of life, the initial organisms must be the result of deterministic physical processes. However, Teilhard does NOT accept the >>Theory&lt;&lt; of Evolution as scientists understand it.He claims that matter contains some sort of psychic inner property (\\"le dedans de la mati&egrave;re\\" or \\"the inside of matter\\"). Matter moves and is dynamic (so far so good) but then he goes too far and claims that the psychic qualities of matter lead it to spontaneously organize itself first into large organic molecules and later into living matter, and finally into the biosphere we know today. Teilhard believes that evolution is teleological, i.e. that \\"evolution\\" is \\"evolution-towards-something\\", that the \\"phenomenon of man\\" is a predictable property of matter.The chronology of evolution Teilhard gives corresponds largely with what you'll find in any Richard Dawkins book but Teilhard explains the chronology by stating, without any evidence, that today's world is the result of the inner-properties of matter which cause it to go from inert to Pre-Life to Life. (Richard Dawkins, and all evolutionary scientists, think the explanation is much simpler: matter doesn't spontaneously organize itself into more complex forms; the complexity of living beings on earth arises because we have a sun that pours energy into an open system, followed by step-by-step adaptation over millions of years. But I digress.) Teilhard goes further: he asserts that this development from matter to Pre-Life to Life will go on all the way to something he calls the Omega Point, a mysterious union of man and God. What can one say to that?The fact is Teilhard's gratuitous statement that matter has an \\"inside\\", and that this inside contains the seed of life's psychic manifestations, forms the foundation of Teilhard's thought. There is no way to prove this is untrue simply because phrases like \\"life's psychic manifestations\\" don't make much sense to scientists. These phrases do not stand for anything that can be felt or measured. They do not stand for science.Vincent Poirier, Montreal(*) The Piltdown Man controversy notwithstanding. I personally believe Teilhard was a victim of the perpetrators of the hoax rather than their accomplice. -- VP"},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"'The Phenomena of Man' is an absolute masterpiece of prescient genius. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was like Friedrich Nietzsche, Shaw and Darwin, great thinkers generations ahead of their time. De Chardin joins the pantheon of intellectual visionaries with this revolutionary book that predicts humankind's eventual conscious evolutionary ascent toward universal consciousness, what he calls the \\"Omega Point\\". This is not a book for the average person, it requires intense study and research to comprehend in full. I must admit his Jesuit Christianity is hard to reconcile with his worldview of post human futurism, but his collective works are truly worthy of studying."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"I read this book in the early 1960's shortly after it's first publication. In the intervening years, I've referred to it often. However, recently I've been unable to locate my original copy, and have become fascinated with how much of what Teilhard envisioned has become reality with the advent of the Internet and satellite communications. I am aware that a new edition is scheduled for release in November, but decided to take advantage of the flexibility of Amazon to obtain a used copy. I am delighted to be able to read this book again when it's relevance has become so great!"},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"Teilhard is difficult to read but worth the effort--IF you're interested enough to make the effort (I am) and IF you can attune yourself to the now-arcane style of writing. IF you are so inclined, the rewards are worth it. You get a glimpse into what has evolved from ancient Buddhism, and probably begin showing up in a Western iteration first with Alfred North Whitehead and eventually into General Systems Theory. Fascinating and relevant if you are a student of spirituality--and who isn't if we're honest?"},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"In this book of the Jesuit priest, a scientist and philosopher, a new cosmo-synthesis is presented, very very ahead of time as has been pointed out, up, at the point that it will never be a best-seller.Teilhard says in the foreword:\\"After all, do we not judge the perfection of an animal, or the supremacy of a thinking being, by the penetration and synthetic power of their gaze? To try to see more and better is not a matter of whim or curiosity or self-indulgence. To see or to perish is the very condition that makes up the universe...\\" Is not precisely this our main problem as mankind since a long time ago?But it is Teilhard who makes us see that things not only have a without but they have too a within, so mankind and science have always seen just a partial view of reality, that is to say, the without of things. This is one of the best contributions made by Teilhard that the american philosopher Ken Wilber has taken for granted to build his work, in SES. Is not this contribution the original, western version of the yin and yang of ancient taoism?Another original contribution is his Law of Consciousness and Complexity, that permits to a certain extent, to measure the state of evolution, as a greater brain is always associated with a greater consciousness, so mankind is the arrow of evolution and he says:\\"...the stuff of the universe, by becoming thinking, has not yet completed its evolutionary cycle, and that we are therefore moving forward toward some new critical point that lies ahead...We are faced with a harmonised collectivity of consciousness equivalent to a sort of super-consciouness. The idea is that the earth not only becoming by myriads of grains of thought, but becoming enclosed in a single thinking envelope so as to form, functionally, no more than a single vast grain of thought on the sideral scale...A new domain of psychical expansion-that is what we lack. And it is staring us in the face if we would only raise our heads to look at it.\\"And when presenting one of his most original concepts he writes:\\"Because it contains and engenders consciousness, space-time is necessarily of a convergent nature. Accordingly its enormous layers, followed in the right direction, must somewhere ahead become involuted to a point which we might call Omega, which fuses and consumes them integrally in itself\\" That is to say, The Supreme Being, the God of Time and Space... as is described in The Urantia Book or the Fifth Epoch Revelation."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"I have not yet finished reading this book, but I certainly feel strongly enough about it already to very highly recommend it. I never have had a problem with a reconciliation of evolution versus creationism. It never felt like a 'versus' to me. I never felt they needed to be mutually exclusive. Who better to make and prove that point than a Jesuit paleontologist? One caveat...read this book with a very high quality dictionary at your elbow and at the ready. Even the dictionary built into your Kindle will not suffice. Words will come up \\"No definition found\\". de Chardin's lexicon and syntax can alternately be arcane, obscure, daunting, and/or mind numbing (perhaps particularly as translated from French). But don't let this stop you or keep you away from this book. It's not new, but it's new to me, and I'm thrilled to have found it."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"I first read \\"The Phenomenon of Man\\" as a 16 year old, and it became a solid part of my thinking ever after, despite the heavy critiques of Sir Peter Medewar and Jacques Monod's \\"Chance or Necessity\\".Teilhard suffers from the progress of science. But his division of the evolution of the Universe into Cosmogenesis, Biogenesis and Noogenesis or Anthropogenesis, have stood the test of time. Teil;hard was writing before the Big Bang theory became accepted, but he would have revelled in its discoveries of \\"Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking\\", as he too talks of \\"phase change\\" like a change of state.As a pioneering thinker, he has had a huge influence. Not only upon people like Buchminster Fuller and James Lovelock, but his \\"Law of Complexity Consciousness\\" has received solid scientific backing now with evolutionary studies of \\"the Encephalisation Quotient\\", and the Noosphere, has become a common part of our language, and animates studies of the Internet, which Teilhard would have loved.Teilhard's Christology, as a non Christian, I find a little more problematic, but his identification of the Omega Point with St Paul's view of the Cosmic Christ, sends echoes into Frank Tipler and John Barrow's speculations of \\"Omega Point\\" in \\"The Physics of Immortality\\", and even in Lee Smolin's \\"Life of the Cosmos\\" and James N. Garner's \\"Biocosm Hypothesis\\".Teilhard de Chardin continues to inspire and animate thinkers like sacred psychologist Jean Houston, physicist Brian Swimm and theologian Thomas Berry. The fact that he was so far ahead of his time, and therefore was required to develop neologisms to convey the full thought of his theinking should not be seen as a weakness. His \\"exterioe\\" and \\"interior\\" of things has been developed by Ken Wilbur into his four quadrants model which has been widely received.If you want to really see the bankrupt inanity of Intelligent Design and so-called \\"scientific creationism\\", there is no better antidote than Teilhard's vision of the ongoing creation of the cosmos as revealed by evolution. Teilhard's paean of poetry, echoes Galileo's statement that \\"Epur e muovo\\" (Nevertheless it moves) with a recognition of the complete centrality of Evolution. I would find it hard to rank a book as more important to 20th century thinking."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"Teilhard was ahead of his time by about fifty years...no, more.

He predicts the development of a &quot;noosphere&quot; existing between the biosphere (the thin, wet, green and flesh layer on the lithosphere) and the atmosphere.When I read this book, 20 years ago, I thought the noosphere was the development of a collective consciousness and a precursor of mental telepathy.

I have been an observer of Pierre's vision of global &quot;confluent synthesis&quot; since, and I might add, have been impressed as to how his concept has developed.Another writer commented that de Chardin's mysterious description of the &quot;global mind&quot; has since materialised into the internet (?). That is the exact same thought I had when I witnessed its emergence. Anywhere on the globe now, people can tap into this &quot;mind&quot; and access whatever data is required to facilitate their &quot;evolution&quot; to greater understanding. Hence, the transference of &quot;evolution&quot; to the inner man. It is having a greater impact on all phases of life, even now 2002. What will this thought process bring mankind in 5 years, 10, 20 and beyond?It is synthesizing all thoughts into one, using the process of elimination. This is done through the &quot;confluent&quot; contributions of the many. People come to places, such as this site, interject their opinions, read others and eventually a dominant concensus arises which abandons all others.

FULLER BEING IS CLOSER UNIONI begin my reading blog with Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's THE PHENOMENON OF MAN. I can do no better. The New York Times called it \\"A profound book . . . A great work by a great man - one of the most spiritually erudite of our time.\\" The book was also voted the \`best spiritual book of the twentieth century' by the Best Spiritual Writing Series Poll.I am not one to go by reviews or polls. For me the test is in the pudding. As soon as I picked up the book last night and read the phrase in the title of this entry, which occurs a few sentences into the Foreword, I knew this was the book I would spend reading and re-reading for the next few months, and keep it in my library to review over the years. It also constellated for me, after many months of mulling over my blog and not quite knowing what it would be on, the vision of this blog. When a book does that, you know it is central to your being. I hope it will become central to yours.What sort of book does that? I will use de Chardin's own words to clarify that, since I cannot say it any better. The title of his Foreword (and I have only read this so far), is SEEING. The books that become central to your being are books that help you SEE.Let me tell you what he means by \`Seeing': He says, \`the whole of life lies in that verb.' \`To see or to perish is the very condition laid upon everything that makes up the universe, by reason of the mysterious gift of existence. And this, in superior measure, is man's condition.'Seeing leads to \`fuller being,' which leads to \`closer union.' \`Union increases only through an increase in consciousness, that is to say, in vision.' So, by \`seeing' he means, \`vision.'What sort of vision? To answer this question I have to backtrack and tell you a little about de Chardin (and I know very little about him, except for what I learned from his brief biography at the beginning of the book. I mean to research him and share more of it as time goes by): he was a Jesuit Priest, a naturalist, paleontologist who co-discovered the fossils of the famous \`Peking Man.' Essentially, a scientist. He says that when scientists \`reach the end of their analyses they cannot tell with any certainty whether the structure they have reached is the essence of the matter they are studying, or the reflection of their own thought.'Man, he continues, \`finds his own image stamped on all he looks at.' This, he says, is \`a form of bondage . . . for the observer is . . . obliged to carry with him everywhere the center of the landscape he is crossing.'The following, and I quote fully from him, is the definition both of Vision and the Union he speaks about.\\"But what happens when chance directs his steps to a point of vantage from which, not only his vision, but things themselves, radiate? In that event the subjective viewpoint coincides with the way things are distributed objectively, and perception reaches its apogee. The landscape lights up and yields its secrets. He sees.\\"A good book, then, is one that facilitates such seeing in which objective and subjective is married. This is only one, though a supreme, of the gifts of reading.More of THE PHENOMENON OF MAN follows in the days to come. My hope is you will buy the book and read it for yourself."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"I am just loving this book. This man is a genius. I am having to read every chapter twice because there's just so much to learn. I highly recommend this book. I've been interested in the subject of the \\"evolution of matter\\" for a while and I've finally come across this source. It is a look at the information within matter in its role as that which integrates and complexifies matter from subatomic particle to atom to molecule to cell to organism and so on. And so Chardin goes on to propose that the development or evolution of matter follows a direction and, this direction is \\"complexification\\", in other words, becoming increasingly more complex. Also deeply ingrained within this perspective is the notion that as smaller units integrate to form more complex ones, the larger units that result are \\"a unit\\" rather than a mere conglomeration of parts. And the reason behind this is that when several units of matter (i.e. subatomic particles) integrate to form a single larger unit (i.e. an atom) the information within each component comes to comprise a single fundamental unit, just as would occur in verbal information where a bunch of letters form a single word the latter of which only makes sense as a single unit. If you're curious about this subject read \\"The Phenomenon of Man\\"."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"_The Phenomenon of Man_ by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin is a profound work of intuitive thought. It is hampered greatly by the very thing it excels in: delineating an intuitively based line of logical reasoning about the importance of evolution. In creating new terms and avoiding specifics, he both succeeds and fails. This creates the polarity of opinion I believe. Only secondarily is there controversy here in Teilhard's bring Christianity and science back in the same room.In the context of movements of scholastic development, there are strong similarities in Teilhard's thought to systems thinking/cybernetics. The idea in this book, and in systems thinking, is to simply reflect on the patterns of the large scale and look for recurrent themes. I have found that reading works by systems thinkers, especially the more abstract ones, is extremely frustrating in that the intuitive ideas easily get lost in ambiguity without grounding in multiple specifics. Where systems thinking has evolved now is complexity science (as focused on at the Sante Fe Institute). Propped up by computer simulations and mathematical formulations and the efforts of proven greats in science, systems thinking has evolved out of its armchair infancy and now has some real work ahead for it.I am inspired now, after my re-reading of \\"Phenomenon\\" to re-read Stuart Kauffman's _At Home in the Universe_. These two books line up nicely as a grand synthesis of the evolution of order from chaos and its mathematical underpinnings (in Kauffman's terms) which Teilhard might describe as the groping (random experimenting) of a complex myriad upward toward greater complexity, and, inevitably, to inward reflection. Anyone needing a deeper scientific grounding of Teilhard need only read Kauffman.To say that every scale of the universe is not a part of an evolutionary story is to be fundamentally blind to the nature of the universe. Biological evolution is simply the more complicated kind. Evolution is as simple as units interacting and producing order via assymetrical events that, in effect, are foundational in how the action that follows is influenced. Order that falls out as persistent in the long run becomes the grounding principles of that layer of activity. Evolution is the story of how asymmetry shapes the universe. So from the large scale structure of the universe's asymmetry to the percentage composition of subatomic particles in our universe we have evidence of story and hence evolution.Teilhard's profound concept of the noosphere simply gives weight to the notion of consciousness as a physically active part of the universe. Even if we can't bottle consciousness, we can see its effects on the physical world. All culture, communication and other man-made environmental influences speak to the physical impact and asymmetrically evolved story of human consciousness. As technology progresses from writing to high-speed information sharing (the Internet) to possible Matrix-like virtual realities (which would effectively augment the size of the Universe as we know it), the noosphere is rising and taking shape and influencing activities on all other physical levels.The bitter pill that Teilhard hopes Christians can swallow is the import of the idea of evolution. When you step back and consider evolution as the story of asymmetric development, then the Bible is clearly all about that. Certain individual's actions create the growing \\"involution\\" of God toward man until His coming and dying on the cross and saving us all from our original fall. God gave us the freedom to tell right from wrong and now we live with those consequences in an unfolding story. The Bible teaches that we will reach the Omega point in our experience through further trials and unite with God in Heaven. God created the evolving universe, creationists just need to step back and take a good (scientific) look at the world and stop burying their heads in literalist interpretations which balk in the face of God's extra-pre-Biblical activity. God may have created sinners but He didn't waste His time creating so many utter fools, so we should, on the whole, as Christians be slow to question the overall views of the scientific community except in a scientific manner."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"Over fifty years has passed since \\"The Phenomenon of Man\\" was initially published, posthumously because at the time of its writing, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was a Jesuit priest who took his vows of obedience to the Catholic Church hierarchy seriously. At that time, his perception of the what can only be called the spiritual evolution of life on our planet coinciding with material evolution was simply too comprehensive, and did not fit in with the narrow-minded views of \\"Creationism\\" as perceived by religion.None-the-less, as a young graduate student in Chemistry and a new Catholic convert at the time of Vatican Council II, I read this book with extreme excitement because it did so much to make sense of what I perceived then and still believe to be the way in which the Divine has infused creation with the reality Teilhard called \\"complexity-consciousness\\". Teilhard believed this Divine presence is guiding our universe towards a culmination of awareness that he designated \\"the Omega Point\\", which others have recognized as what theology calls \\"Christ Consciousness\\".What caused me to revisit this book, and to purchase a new copy since my own from those early days seems to be lost in the clutter of my home, was the awareness brought into sharp focus by recent events: The \\"Thought Envelope\\" or Noosphere surrounding the globe that Teilhard posited has indeed come to fruition with the advent of the Internet, satellite communications and cellular telephone technology. It is now possible to instantaneously communicate with people anywhere on earth, and the potential of this for good AND ill is incredible. I believe with all my heart that what Teilhard defined as a new \\"critical point\\" has arrived, and it is essential that if human evolution is to continue in a positive direction, we accept the challenges he has placed before us in his insightful writing."},{"Title":"The phenomenon of man","review":"Teilhard de Chardin was way ahead of his time. The Phenomenon of Man is fascinating to read, especially because the series of events on Earth since the book was written has provided a lot of support for Teilhard de Chardin's ideas.

Likewise, theologists will find plenty of fodder for argument. But anyone who takes the time to read this book with an open mind will learn something valuable about the connectedness of people everywhere.

I don't have the time nor the space available right now to develop the point, but my statement is that Teilhard de Chardin's writings ('Le Ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne Humain' and other, more explicitly religious writings like 'Le Milieu Divin', 'Le coeur de la Mati&egrave;re' and so on) show the way that a modern, Catholic Church should go: a religious faith that dares to confront itself with modern science, especially with the implications of the fact that our world is fundamentally evolutionary brings with it in the different fields of human knowledge and in the field of religion. Since Teilhard de Chardin, absolutely nobody (despite the fact that actually we are over 6 billion people in this world!) has ever surpassed, nor even equalled his visionary force. Unfortunately, the Church, anno 2005, is very very far from following the lightning example of Teilhard. On the contrary, nowadays, the official Church doesn't seriously reflect on fundamental questions and prefers to take a conservative attitude. That way, without seeming to realize it herself, the Church is making a tremendously severe mistake. Taking on that \\"defensive\\", utterly conservative attitude, is the mean reason why the Church finds itself in a deep crisis; this being the case for some decades now."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"I found this book when a copy was sent to the newspaper where I work. Since they don't do reviews of unsolicited books, I asked if I could have it. (My point: I'd never heard of Stesiak or this book before.)What had first interested me was that it was written by someone my age and from Detroit, as I was. I thought it would be a good counterpart to the partly-autobiographical book I always planned to write about that era but didn't, about being on the fringes of the college protest movement and unsure of what I believed.I was not disappointed! Stesiak has written a very poignant story. As a female, I hadn't read any other graphic war novels. This one made me begin (barely begin, I know) to understand what it was like to be in Vietnam - in training and camp, under attack, in the hospital. \\"Terror, drama, comedy and romance,\\" as the jacket succinctly said.I am impressed with this book and that he actually did write it, as he said he would, after all that time."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"I am the Gold Star Mom of Sp/4 Keith Allen Campbell, combat medic, 173rd Airborne Brigade. The vivid battle scenes in this book helped me to understand what my son's work was in Vietnam and what his life was like during his time there. Most importantly it helped me to understand how and why he died in such a heroic way. This book is a must read for all persons over the age of 16 (too graphic for those under) to help them understand the price and horror of war. God bless all our young people who face our enemies today, and the author for telling it like it is!"},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"The author captures the full realm of Vietnam combat from the misery of the Monsoon season, the terror of the night ambush patrol,to dealing with the jungle elements, all in the finest detail, even including the unforgettable stench of burning off the latrines\` containers back in base camp.In writing this book, G.K. Stesiak has honored all the 18, 19 and 20 year-old \\"grunts\\", the soldiers who, as in all wars, bear the brunt of the misery, while displaying courage, resilience and complete devotion to one another."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"Having read hundreds of war related books over the years, I found Raptor's Prey to be so powerful of a personal account of war that it had to be predicated upon fact, albeit it is technically a wrting of fiction.Such personal accounts of the horrors of war have come to us throughout history: World War I brought us All Quiet On The Western Front -- World War II produced The Cross Of Iron, and now G. K. Stesiak has written the next classical war novel, Raptor's Prey.Raptor's Prey will strike a cord in our collective psyche. All of us will be able to relate to this novel story in one form or another. The writing is a cry for humanity which can only be told by an infantry grunt who's job was to become a combat medic in the jungles of Vietnam.In a surprise ending the reader will learn -- in war the line between raptor and prey gets pretty thin. A must read for those who want to understand the agony and the sacrifice of the combat soldier."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"I lived through the Vietnam War. I lived it day-to-day just like this author. His story is my story. I was a medic in the 173rd Airborne Brigade, 1966-67.News commentator Walter Cronkite, forty-some years ago, used to close each broadcast with the words, \\"And that's the way it is...\\" In this book, Gerry Stesiak's words say, \\"And that's the way it was,\\" with on-target accuracy.He conveys the comaraderie and passion that comes from trusting your life and soul to another man.The medics fought \\"another war\\"--one filled with frustration at our lack of ability as young men with insufficient supplies, and the demoralizing knowledge that even though we wanted more than anything to send everyone home alive, we were indeed not God. We were but one man, often with scores of wounded in our care. We had our self-reliance, guts and our Airborne Infantry brothers to get us and our wounded through to the next hour and hopefully the next day.\\"Raptor's Prey\\" tells it all, explores it all and brought moments of my time in Vietnam back to me in vivid detail. This book will give any reader an accurate telling of the way it was."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"Writing about Raptor's Prey intimidates me because I have so much to say about it, and I fear I'll appear more like a gushing fan than an objective journalist. But the fact is, Raptor's Prey stopped me in my tracks. Like other reviewers on this Web page, I could not put it down.The book is fiction, but it is based on a platoon of specialists in Vietnam; specifically it is a memoir of the 173rd Airborne. It is a book about friendly fire killing your pals, bombs sucking the air out of your lungs, leeches sucking at your crotch in constant rain, being outwitted by a supposedly inferior enemy, and the steady throbbing-like-a-toothache feeling that we should not be here, that we lost this war before we arrived. It was written by one of the least likely of soldiers to make it home alive: a combat medic.My father was a combat medic in the 173rd. He doesn't talk about Vietnam. How bad was his experience? Consider this: He appears in the book but refuses to read it. Had G.K. Stesiak not written Raptor's Prey, I (and the world) would likely never know what it was like for my dad and the rest of the 173rd. Stesiak details the experience from boot camp and jump school straight through a wartime tour of duty in the jungle. I am grateful to have learned something profound about my dad - about who he is and why.In the prologue, Stesiak explains that 2.1 million people went to Vietnam during the war. A quarter-million were grunts. Of those, 2,000 were Airborne medics. 2,000 out of 2.1 million. Later in the book, Stesiak writes, \\"The enemy knows that under fire the only person who ever moves is the medic.\\" Realizing my dad's long odds messed with my head. In the final pages, Stesiak gives a clue about my dad's silence: \\"We all carry the guilt of surviving, and, because of that, no one boasts.\\"Raptor's Prey is a hellish psychodrama, a true story swathed in a compelling fictional scenario, a priceless history, a window for those who want to know what it was really like in-country for those whose survival was against the odds. I am thankful this historic account exists."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"An extremely well written book, it made me feel guilty at times, as though I was peeking in on someone's diary from a very traumatic time in his life. Very gritty and personal and no holds barred, it is a refreshing read from a lot of the fancy glossed-over stories out there. It was a 'mistake' to pick it up, perhaps, because it resulted in several nights of non stop reading into the early hours of the morning - 'I'll stop at the next chapter and go to sleep, really I will! or maybe one more chapter after.'"},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"G. K. Stesiak's work, Raptor's Prey, is unique in that it gives a true to life picture of what it was like to be a grunt during the Vietnam War. The book flows well and holds your interest from cover to cover. As a fellow veteran, many of the senario's in the story brought back lost memories of similar experiences I had during my own tour of duty. This was not a bad thing.It is a warm feeling to know that Mr. Stesiak has lived up to his promise to share the story of his experience with his fellow soldiers. He even goes the extra measure to support the Vietnam Memorial in his home state.I am proud to have the opportunity to share in Mr. Stesiak's story and wish him well. Hopefully the future will see his novel become a feature motion picture."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"Gerald has written what we all felt in one way or another.

Anyone that wants to know what the life of a line medic was like needs to read this book. I recomend it to everyone"},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"I can relate to Gerry Stesiak's book and having served with the 4th Infantry Divison it is refreshing to learn of experiences not only in combat but also the times spent prior to Vietnam. Memories of friends, family and youth all of which can vanish and change very quickly. The story of a tormenting journey from boyhood to manhood and the lack of understanding of all the uncontrollable events exprienced along this journey. Reading it serves as a reminder what Duty, Honor, and Comradeship is about and what it was to face terror upfront and be victorious. Gerry as a combat medic went to the fringes of hell, he puts you there, in combat with real sights and sounds of what it was like. Above all it gives the reader a chance to understand what a Combat/Medic job was and the unpalleled respect given to \\"DOC\\" from fellow brothers'.This book brings back memories and events long repressed in mind but has made me once again fell VERY PROUD of all my brothers and sisters who had served in Vietnam and especially those who have not returned. Nothing gun-ho, exaturated truth or sugar coating, just the hard relization of how life can change. Excellant job Gerry, it's good to be home!"},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"What a story about Harry Spencer. I have read a few books on the Viet Nam era, but none as quite personalized as this one. Being a Viet Nam vet and attached to the unit Harry Spencer was with I can relate in a much lighter note what he went through. From my talks with other combat medics this book tell's it like it is and was. A bold story of love and hate at a time when one was more over powering then the other. A must read for all generations that share the same opinion and thoughts about Viet Nam, WHY!!"},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"I have read Gerry Stesiak's book twice. It does bring back memories I had forgotten. I was with Gerry at Fort Campbell, KY., on the ship USS General John J. Pope that left Oakland, Ca. on 06 June 1966 (D-Day Anniversity WWII) and landed in Viet Nam on 20 June 1966 (The Anniversity of the start of the Korean War). I thought then that this was going to be one hell of a year and it was.I believe the book should be in every high school in this Country to teach the young people about this conflict.I have lent my copy out to many friends and have had nothing but raves for it. Especially sons and daughters of the men we served with. This book is really I believe for them more than for us.I remember well in Viet Nam when I would see Gerry writing in his diary and would kid him about writing a book. Just get the names straight I would tell him.He has fulfilled a promise to the Medical Platoon which I was a part of. As a matter of fact I am Tom Brown in the book. I am the one that actually did get his strips. That part is very true and I do remember it well.The book brought tears to my eyes many times when I read it and reread it. For me it brought back emotions that I had buried very deep."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"Raptor's Prey is one of the best Vietnam combat memoirs currently available. I have been teaching a course on the Vietnam War for thirty years and have always included a combat memoir as required reading. This year I assigned Raptor's Prey and the student reviews were universally favorable. Looking at the war through the eyes of a medic, Stesiak tells a thrilling and entirely authentic story that helps one understand not only the Vietnam War but warfare in general."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"With Raptor's Prey, G.K. Stesiak gave the world one of the best accounts of a Vietnam combat veteran's experience to date.This extraordinary novel brought back many of the familiar feelings, sights, sounds and even smells I experienced in Vietnam as a combat veteran.I thoroughly enjoyed this book.If you want to know what a young paratrooper really experienced in Vietnam, this is your book !I hope Mr. Stesiak continues to write."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"I've known Gerry for nearly 20 years through our mutual association of the veterans organization, Vietnam Veterans of America. I was aware that Gerry was going to write his book but I never held my breath waiting for him to get it together and do it. Well, do it he did.Raptor's Prey is one of those few books that you don't want to put down when you start reading it. As they say, it's partly truth and partly fiction, but it blends so well it keeps you guessing. The characters development make you feel as if you once knew a fellow veteran that acted like they do. Some good memories here, some not so pleasant.If you want to learn about the combat medic, this is the book for you. I even recommend it to my non-military friends."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"This was a great book. From the time I picked it up, I could not put it down. It was very refreshing to read true facts about what went on in Nam. There was no sugar coating or political intervention. I know for some in country vets, this will be hard to read, especially the chapter about the land mines. At times you will laugh, get mad and even cry but believe me, it is well worth the reading. My husband, both of my brothers and my fiance were all in Nam and I was stationed stateside. I truly feel this is a MUST READ. I even experienced some of the Bull that went on in the Army. I am VERY PROUD of all our Vietnam Vets and what they went through and especially those who gave their lives and our POW/MIA's You did a great job Gerry and I hope others read your book."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"The story is truly captivating, mind-boggling, and incredibly educational. For my generation, (I'm 23) it serves as an inside look on a war we didn't study much in school. Vietnam has always been a mystery to me - reading Raptor's Prey has informed me and inspired me to learn more about the war and why our country intervened. I think the book will serve an important purpose for the author's generation too. So many of his peers scorned the war and our government, and concern and respect for the men who fought in it fell by the wayside. Anyone who reads this book will walk away with a much better appreciation for people who serve our military, particularly those who served on the front lines, as you did. This story affected me profoundly"},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"I DON'T EVER REMEMBER PICKINIG UP A BOOK AND READING IT FRONT TO BACK LIKE I DID THIS ONE.

THIS BOOK PULLS YOU RIGHT INTO THE ACTION AS IF YOU WERE THERE YOURSELF. I LOST MANY HOURS OF SLEEP AT NIGHT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT IT DOWN. IT TELLS SOMETHING THAT NO ONE ELSE WANTS TO SAY. NOW, ALL I WANT TO DO IN MY SPARE TIME IS TO LOOK DEAPER INTO THE VIETNAM ERA TO SEE WHAT ELSE WE'RE NOT HEARING ABOUT.

This is the first book that I have read that brought me down to ground level and allowed me to see the war through the eyes of those fighting it. Whether the war was right or wrong is irrelevent; these men answered their country's call, draft or not, and fought in what is quite arguably one of the worst conflicts America has ever gotten herself involved in. In this book you see the daily struggles of survival and the horrors and realities of war through a soldiers eyes. I cannot thank Mr. Stesiak enough for his service to our country. I especially feel blessed that he has shared his personal experiences in this book. I trust that it will have the same impact on you that it has had on me!"},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"Raptor's Prey is a must for anyone who is the least bit interested in Vietnam and what they (medic's and grunts) actually went through.

I came away understanding why these men call one another 'brother'."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"Jerry Stesiak's book had the ability to take me back more than 35 years in time and 10,000 miles in distance. As I read and re-read what had been the reality of my tour in Viet Nam, I became once again a young paratrooper serving with the 173d Airborne Brigade (SEP) in always difficult and often times very dangerous and desperate circumstances. Stesiak's ability to write in the simple and unadorned style of the combat soldier did much to give Raptor's Prey the authenticity missing in so many other books written about war. And by keeping a promise to honor his comrades by writing of their shared experince and sacrifice, Stesiak maintains the bond forged by all soldiers, in all wars, who serve in combat. If you would like to know about the war in Viet Nam from a &quot;boots-on-the-ground&quot; perspective, read Raptor's Prey and live how it was &quot;in the Nam&quot; during the tumultuous era of the 1960's."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"Recently finished Stesiak's book, Raptor's Prey -- OUTSTANDING. Hard to believe one could find oneself in such a predicament and come through it all as the lead character, Harry Spencer did, or did he? A phenomenal conclusion to this story!During the reading I found I could not put this book down, but when I did, I looked forward to getting back to reading it, which is a hallmark of any good novel.Stesiak must be congratulated for giving the world a birds eye view of combat in the steamy jungles of Vietnam. Further, to actually fulfill a promise he made to his fellow grunts to write about their encounters is extrodinary in itself -- more so with the passage of some 36 years. I have taught my child to, \\"say what you mean and mean what you say\\" -- Stesiak obviously personifies that ideal."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"This was a very profound telling of what the War of vietnam was like for the people who were in country and what they went through, there are some very humerous parts that everyone who has served in the military can share in some of those experiences. Having served on Destroyers and Aircraft carriers and Major Relay Communication ships doing tours during vietnam, nothing like the heartaches that the grunts endured. This book is very compelling and should be read by everyone as it will help appreciate the need for people to realize the problems caused by war. This was a superb book, dedicated to the authors fellow comrades and is a complement to the author. well done"},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"This book is vastly over-rated.

I cannot imagine the courage it takes living these events and then to write about it in such enthralling detail. I was gasping in disbelief at the horror one human can impose on another and even to themselves, crying for the heriosm and suffering, and enjoying the humor with which he told us problems he encountered. Thank you Mr. Stesiak for telling us the true story of a fighting American in Vietnam in a fashion we all appreciate."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"Raptor's Prey is very graphic and most of all REAL, it tells the story,of what an man must go through to become a U.S.Paratrooper , and what a grunt did to survive Viet Nam. It places one, in the boots of the men who fought and died in the jungles of Viet Nam. It tells their story, so the people of today and those who lived during this period, of our history, can actually feel what it was like to be a Medic in combat, in Viet Nam."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"Out of the hundred or so books I have read on the Vietnam conflict I have to say, in all honesty, Raptor's Prey is by far one of the best, if not the best written book I have ever read. I only wish it was longer as I read it in three days -- couldn't put it down. Stesiak captured my attention. I am also pleased to see he kept his promise to his fellow paratroopers to write this book. I have taken the liberty to call several friends to tell them they MUST read this book, and that they will never regret doing so."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"This gripping book gave me insight of another time, a different country than I know today, and a war I never thoroughly understood. Because I am 27 years of age, and the fact that my parents dodged the draft and moved to Canada, up until reading this book I never was able to fully appreciate the Vietnam era quagmire. What a testament Raptor's Prey is for many of our fighting men. This naive reader was given an 'at war' experience as never before.Raptor's Prey has it all -- From romance to combat. At various times throughout the book I was tense with fear, while at other times I laughed out loud. This book is a reflection of life's experience, and an insight of coping with extreme situations.The author's writing style won't allow you to put the book down. Not one word is wasted. Each scene described is life like. I recommend this book to everyone interested in the straight scoop on the Vietnam War. The author provides us with a no holds bar point of view. I must tell you -- this novel will stay on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Raptor's Prey: Vietnam 1966-1967","review":"I got hooked on reading war related books at an early age and can honestly say that I haven't come across a better novel than Raptor's Prey.

I like, a lot of Nam Vets have a hard time with words trying to explain what really happen over there, Raptor's Prey brings it to life.

I was young and didn't know anyone in the military or anyone who was directly involved. I couldn't understand any of it - got mixed messages as to why our men were even over there. I would ask - why do so many people have so much anger directed at the men who were just trying to do their duty to our country? I didn't understand the government or the political end of the war either until I met my husband - he was in the Army during that time and served a two year tour of duty in Vietnam as an MP - got lucky and didn't have to be on the front lines. He explained what he could of it to me - which gave me a better understanding - but even he didn't have 'the whole story'.'RAPTOR'S PREY' tells it all - the way it should be told. To be honest, I never thought I would like a book like this - blood & guts stuff - I hate that! War - yuck!!! I could never relate to any of this because I wasn't there - you can't know unless you were there. Mr. Stesiak puts you there - I could almost see what he saw, feel what he felt and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Its not just about war - Harry Spencer's story is told from the time he was a boy to the time he became a man - about life, love, hardship -- events you can't control, but that put you in places you sometimes don't want to be - places that change the course of your life forever. It gave the word 'life' a whole new meaning and anyone who reads this book will appreciate and understand more about the men and women who serve in the military then and now.

My favorite stories were the title story, which was so wonderful that it made me cry at the end, and &quot;The Undeclared Major,&quot; a tale about a student from a small town who doesn't want to tell everyone what his major is because he's afraid people won't approve.These stories are fun to read and good for the soul. I recommend them to anyone (even to those not from Minnesota)."},{"Title":"A Gravestone Made of Wheat","review":"If you loved Red Earth, White Earth, A Gravestone Made of Wheat will fill you in the same way...leave you quietly dreaming.

I didn't expect too much similarity since one is a short story and the other is a full length movie. However, everything that I felt made the movie unique and of substance as film was absent in a literary sense from this collection of stories. I'm not really criticizing the collection of short stories and if you're reading it based on your experience with the author you may be pleased. But if you are purchasing these stories based on a favorable impression from the movie then you may find them dissimilar and be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Gravestone Made of Wheat","review":"Every year, our large, eclectic area, encompassing a vast and diverse consolidated school district and community, chooses one book for everyone to read and then come together to chat about.

I became aware of this book from an NPR interview and searched it out. I have enjoyed it myself and have recommended it and given it as gifts."},{"Title":"The PRACTICAL HEART.","review":"In this loving, startling book, Allan Gurganus has outdone himself. I don't know of anybody writing who takes more emotional risks and who seems to know more about how very much people offer each other and the universe. There are writers who can do big crises, and there are others who specialize in the world of the everyday; but nobody can do both this well. There's a suspense you feel. I loved &quot;Oldest Living Confederate Widow&quot; and &quot;White People&quot; and also &quot;Plays Well&quot;. Don't know why the novella form seems to work best for his talents. But each one of the works is different in tone and outlook. Each seems to have been written by another kind of writer. But, when you finish &quot;Saint Monster&quot;, the last of the short novels, the generosity of vision, the dark humor and lighly accepted tragedy, both breaks your heart and leaves you somehow happy. Can't explain it. Both. Woody Allen claims: Tragedy plus Time equals Comedy.In Gurganus's work, there's a willingness to let the story tell itself, to stay out of the characters' way. Not to be &quot;Clever&quot; or &quot;show off&quot;, but to always brilliantly have the right word, the telling scene, the tone needed. I believe that Gurganus cares more about his people than anybody writing. He sees them, faults and all, until you feel ready to adopt him as your sponsor, or your god. This quiet funny book should win all the prizes. The day after I finished it, I looked around for something else good to read. Something somewhat like it. Then I just started The PRactical Heart again. You'll see what I mean. I think he has broken through to a different and a higher level of meaning and heart. The work is so lovingly shaped. It makes most everything else feel pulpy, like junk. This one will be read forever."},{"Title":"The PRACTICAL HEART.","review":"I have read all of Mr. Gurganus' catalog. \\"The Practical Heart\\" being his last. I liked the book but had problems with the first novella, the book's namesake \\"The Practical Heart\\" I found it choppy with to many flashforwards and flashbacks somehow the story gets lost in all of them. \\"Preservation News\\" was wonderful about a dying gay man who saves old houses, as was \\"He's One To\\" about a gay man who is outed when he is traped in a public restroom hitting on the cheif of Police's son. \\"Saint Monster\\" stands as the best of the four novellas in depth. It is about the son of man who delivers Bibles to motels and his mother who has a motel mentality making love to the town vet while father and son are away. His search after his father dies to find out more about him and eventually how to come to terms with his mother. I found the writing in \\"Saint Monster\\" similar to one of John Irving's twisted plots and I mean that in a good way. I like John Irving."},{"Title":"The PRACTICAL HEART.","review":"\\"The Practical Heart\\" has some fine writing, but also some awkward constructions and digressions that repeatedly chop up the flow of the stories.The title story has a postmodern shift that distracted me and broke my emotional involvement with the main character. You're reading about a nephew writing about his aunt, then you learn the nephew was fictionalizing her life. The rest of the story is his true picture of her and their relationship, which is far less engaging.In the second story, \\"Preservation News,\\" the writing becomes even more precious and self-indulgent. Gurganus beats the reader over the head with forced whimsy.For me the final straw came during the first conversation between a young historical preservationist and a widowed eastern North Carolina matron. Encouraging her to help with his work, he says, \\"You need to get your excellent, sinewy ass in gear, girl.\\"I'm from eastern North Carolina, I've met hundreds of matrons, and I have several gay friends, one of whom does historical preservation. I can assure you that Gurganus' line would never be spoken in the situation he presents. It was so absolutely phony that, coming after the book's other annoyances, I lost all interest in continuing."},{"Title":"The PRACTICAL HEART.","review":"Allan is what they call an &quot;old soul&quot;---someone whose compassion and wisdom seem beyond what we are capable of seeing and understanding, and make us wish to become finer and nobler induviduals.

However, it has problems.Chapters 1-3 introduce us to Kyoko, the new female penguin trainer.Chapter 4 features Musashi going on a movie date with one of Minako's friends.Chapters 5-7 sees the return of Kyoko, as she seeks to utterly embarass Minako at a Christmas swimsuit celebration, and Gin must try to stop, even if hindered by Mike in a \\"Satan\\" suit.Chapter 8 sees Gin trying to help out a down-on-his-luck street musician.There is a \\"bonus\\" story featuring bit players previously seen in the series, but as its not actually a bonus, it actually takes away space that should have gone to Gin, which is nowhere to be found in the story.Between the bad bonus story, and how they misused Kyoko, I must dock this book by a star. Still, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Saint Augustine","review":"St. Augustine's effect on the Christian religion can not be understated. This timeless work should be read by all religious and spiritual persons regardless of their path of preference if only to just understand where so many of Christianity concepts and dogma originate."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Saint Augustine","review":"&quot;The Confessions&quot; is undoubtedly one of the great books of western civilization, and the paradigm of the autobiography genre. But Henry Chadwick's modern translation available through Oxford University Press is a more vibrant and exacting translation. Pusey's translation is too Victorian, which casts too much of the Patristic writer in a Victorian mode of being. Augustine was a preeminent rhetorician, which comes out more brilliantly in Chadwick's translation. Moreover, the philosophical arguments advanced by Augustine are more clearly stated in the Chadwick translation. The hardcover or paperback version from Oxford isn't any more expensive, but significantly better translated."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Saint Augustine","review":"Obviously, the Confessions of St. Augustine themselves need no review.

It's one thing to read the book, its another experience to listen to it!"},{"Title":"The Confessions of Saint Augustine","review":"Note: Your \\"helpful\\" votes are appreciated. Thanks.This book is one that should be on every educated person's bookshelf. For a book written by a Christian in the fourth century, I was surprised at some of the details. For example, Augustine accepts autopsies as a matter of medical necessity. More well-known is his opposition to astrology.Augustine also had surprisingly enlightened views about dress and appearance. Any race or ethnicity can enter the City of God (an argument made in \\"The City of God\\").Augustine says that as a teenager, he and his friends stole some pears and threw them away. Have things really changed? Teenagers up to mischief!In the \\"City of God,\\" Augustine also marveled at the human mind.\\"In general, the completeness of scientific knowledge is beyond all words and becomes all the more astonishing when one pursues any single aspect of this immense corpus of information. Last, but not least, is the brilliance of talent displayed by both pagan philosophers and Christian heretics in the defense of error and falsehood. In saying this, of course, I am thinking only of the nature of the human mind as a glory of this mortal life, not of faith and the way of truth that leads to eternal life.\\"Here are some more great lines. A philosopher was abroad a ship captained by a bad man, and after a violent storm, the fearless captain jeered the philosopher for his terror. Said the philosopher, quoting from a similar incident that occurred to the pagan Aristippus, \`A rogue need not worry about losing his worthless life, but Aristippus has a duty to care for a life like his.\\"Finally, St. Augustine spoke to the modern world and to the \\"Creationists.\\"\\"It very often happens there is some question as to the earth or sky, or other elements of this world...respecting which, one who is not a Christian has knowledge...and it is very disgraceful and mischievous and of all things to be carefully avoided, that a Christian speaking of such matters as being according to the Christian Scriptures, should be heard by an unbeliever talking such nonsense that the unbeliever perceiving him to be as wide from the mark as east from west, can hardly restrain himself from laughing.\\""},{"Title":"The Confessions of Saint Augustine","review":"The audio book was very well done. The reader is Simon Vance, whose reading sounds like what you would expect of an English speaking Augustine. He sounds very humble, yet intellectual. The translation is OK, but I would like to explore other more modern translations.The book itself is divided into two major parts. The first part is Augustine's autobiography, up until the time of his conversion to Christianity and his mother's death.\`Confessions' is a very descriptive title for this work. He literally confesses everything, even things many of us would find too trifling to even remember. He is a man that had a delicate conscience. We learn of how he was raised in Christianity, converted to Manichaeism, lost faith in that and studied philosophy, and finally became a convert to Christianity after having some spiritual experiences and resolving some philosophical issues with it in his mind. The style is not way different from modern autobiographies (other than the constant acknowledgement of his faults). From a doctrinal point of view, he was very Catholic in his view that Baptism was a requirement for remission of sins and therefore salvation.The second part is his musings on Christians doctrines, mainly related to the creation and the majesty of God. Here, Augustine gives us an idea of God's relationship to man and the world. He firmly believes that God created everything out of nothing (creation ex nihilo); though he wasn't as extreme as I had though from reading other people's views of Augustine's beliefs. He did admit that the Bible says that God created things out of existing material, but made it clear that God created the existing material out of nothing. This is kind of a two-step creation process.He also dabbles in determinism, but once again was not as extreme as I thought. It is not the extreme of Calvin, but you can see where Calvin was influenced by him.All in all, this is a great book to read if you want to understand Augustine and early Christianity (and the later Christianity that was influenced by him). The audio book was a good way to get through the book."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Saint Augustine","review":"This book is an excellent book that I refer to the Christian and/or the spiritual philosopher. Though Augustine engages many questions we take for granted in today's culture (as we think we know these things of God or our self without ever having analyzed them honestly and humbly), he approaches them like a spiritually \\"corrected\\" Socrates. Some might think I have a mental disorder, as I buy this book whenever I see it for cheap at a used book store. It's one of those books that I feel- if I believed in reincarnation- I would've myself written in a past life. Augustine is so honest and repentant of things I believe anyone can relate to, and I therefore purchase these books with others in mind, in hopes someone else can be touched by his honest inquiries of the faith and his spiritual status with God. The book is itself a complete 5-star book, deserving universal admiration and respect among the writing of humans who ponder God via scriptural influence.Concerning this specific audio, however, I have never been able to finish listening to it. I recommend it as a five-star product to anyone from the UK, as you would not be hindered by a distracting English accent, naturally), or anyone elsewhere who find English accents profoundly reverent or intelligent. But to an American, especially any American who already gets uneasy with English accents representing ALL foreign dialects in Hollywood movies, I would recommend reading it quietly to yourself or finding an American narrator who may exist but I have not personally searched out (and likely never will as I never buy audio twice. Especially since librivox and other sites have free audio anymore).So, the 3-star rating I gave is exclusively due to my hardship with the English accent. I am nearly a racist against my fellow caucasians, brothers even (as I am english in descent), as I hate how they are credited with intellect for no other reason than their foreign accent. (Here in America, it seems we esteem all who are \\"different\\" as better than American).I confess, I simply cannot look past it. Call me small minded if you will, but I have explained myself clearly. Take it or leave it."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Saint Augustine","review":"Written in a way making understanding difficult. This could have been translated in a more interesting and reader friendly manner. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Saint Augustine","review":"I have never read the Confessions of St. Agustine. In fact, I found it very difficult to follow both in English and in Spanish the two times I did actually try to read the book.Since Agustin can easily be considered one of the greatest thinkers in all of Christianity and foundational for Western civilization, I think it to be important to have some understanding of this man.This CD version of the book made this man come alive to me. It wasn't just hearing how God dealt with an individual bringing them from darkness to the light of the Gospel that impressed me, but that did impress me greatly. The details of everyday life from that time period I also found to be fascinating.So, if you have wanted to read Agustin's spiritual autobiography, but have had trouble understanding it, I highly recommend this audio version. It is beautifully read."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Saint Augustine","review":"Augustine relates the tale of his life as an unbeliever and his conversion. It is a remarkable picture of a mother's faithful prayers for her son and the power and mercy of God, by which he eventually became an important figure in the early church.St. Monica, Augustine's mother, stood out as a remarkable woman of God. Her husband did not wish their son to be baptized, so she respected custom and obeyed his wishes. She prayed many years for the redemption of her son, and without her patience and faithfulness we may have been deprived of her son's beautiful, inspiring books.The translation offered by the MacMillan Publishing Company is comparatively easy for the modern reader to understand, and much less likely to induce sleep than many other available translations. I first picked it up as a child, having found it on my father's shelves, and found it understandable even then.Whether or not you are of Christian beliefs, this is a beautiful, deeply spiritual book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Saint Augustine","review":"St. Augustine is obsessed with sin (and Jesus). No wonder as he is the proponent of the concept of original sin. He goes through some lengths not only to prove God's existence, which religious people are constantly prone to do as one who were to have to constantly refute the fact that he is indeed Napoleon Bonapate- Augustine also performs philosophical acrobats to avoid toppling this house of cards called belief. What a feat indeed.Somehow, God lies outside of everything, even the rules which we know everything.The \\"Saint\\" verbally flogs himself at every turn; even to acts done as a child when he stole fruit for stealing sake or to when he took up with a woman in Milan?There seems to me a misfiring (as Richard Dawkins calls it) in our brains that needs authority, a craving for a personification of gravity and other laws into one surrogate father.He talks of God as if he literally KNEW the man, being, spirit, deity, etc. When the only evidence he has of this \\"knowing\\" is what was written in a book. If one knew of God based on his own experience, that is if one were to have identical experiences of a god who had NOT read this book and was unable to reap the fodder of scripture to the malleable faults of human imagination, then and only then would I give the 'word\\" some credence of truth. But this is not the case. Religion is simply a collaboration of sticky, albeit harmful, ideas.He also expressed his disdain for astrology, ack!"},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"It is obvious to me that mankind has a built-in desire to expand - in any and every way. Today, virtual worlds of various scope and quality are common (mostly, as games) and interconnected via the internet. I am coming to believe that the impetus for these creations must lie deep within us - it seems instinctive and critical to us in some way. The dream of the Buddha? Or, some aspect of evolution?Before the existence of the current virtual worlds came to be so common, William Gibson imagined and coined the term \\"cyberspace\\". Gibson and other writers like Bruce Sterling and Neal Stephenson wrote stories of \\"cyberspace\\" and its relation to the human spirit and evolution. I think, however, it was probably necessary for computer technology to advance to a certain level before imagining these stories was possible. Or, was there synergy? Did the desire, inspired by cyberpunk authors, to create these worlds further drive the development of computer technology once it had achieved a level that inspired the authors? Ah, now I have a headache.Well, before the computer technology was such as would inspire the concept of \\"cyberspace\\", there was a similar concept out of which the concept of \\"cyberspace\\" also likely grew. That concept involved a higher plane of reality that could be experienced by achieving \\"enlightenment\\" or having and out-of-body experience, sometimes with the assistance of drugs and/or sensory-deprivation tanks. This is the time and place that (I think) probably inspired the book \\"White Light\\" by Rudy Rucker. If you consider it a while, you can also see how these concepts extend in many ways into human history. These all obviously have a relationship to our current concepts regarding virtual worlds and a potential next evolutionary step for mankind - the synthesis of man and a machine of his own creation that will allow him to exist both in this world and worlds of his own creation. Ah, the headache is worse, now.In \\"White Light\\", Rudy Rucker tells the story of an out-of-body experience. Felix Rayman, the main character, is a math professor who is frustrated in many aspects of his life. His job is unfulfilling and his relationship with his wife, the mother of his toddler child, is not good. Somehow, he wills himself out of his body and into a strange realm that he struggles to understand. It is very reminiscent of the land of Oz or the Wonderland experienced by Alice with a lot of abstract mathematics added. The story is filled with discussions of abstract mathematics - infinity, infinities of infinities, the point/place/whatever where infinity and absolute zero come together. This makes the story intellectually and philosophically stimulating. I especially enjoyed the irreverent humor involving well-known figures - mathematicians, philosophers, cartoon characters, and even deities and demons. I enjoyed this work of Rudy Rucker for the same reasons I have enjoyed some of his other works. He takes me places that I have never been - in literary style, imagination, and contemplation of the nature of reality and man's current and future role in it.If you would like to experience an absolutely lunatic and irreverent comic story that is wonderfully entertaining, intellectually stimulating, and likely a direct ancestor of the cyberpunk genre, Rudy Rucker's \\"White Light\\" is it."},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"I reviewed Rudy Rucker's finest nonfiction work, _Infinity and the Mind_, a while back, and it's about time I reviewed this one too. I think this is probably his finest fiction.Nor is that an accident, as it was written at about the same time as _Infinity and the Mind_ and deals with the same primary theme: the soul's quest for God, the Absolutely Infinite. And Rucker's is my kind of mysticism.For this novel is about a mathematician who went to college to dodge the draft and winds up working in set theory in an attempt to (as Lord Buckley would have put it) dig infinity. At one time, Rucker himself was a mathematician who was supposed to be working on Georg Cantor's Continuum Problem while stuck teaching at a college in upstate New York; the novel's protagonist, Felix Rayman, is closely modeled on Rucker in this and other respects. (Some of the other characters are modeled on real and fictional people as well: for example, \\"Franx,\\" the giant cockroach, is modeled on Franz Kafka -- author of \\"Metamorphosis,\\" in which Gregor Samsa finds himself turned into a giant cockroach -- and \\"Donald Duck\\" is modeled on Donald Duck.) In fact, the original subtitle of the novel was \\"What Is Cantor's Continuum Problem?\\" -- which is, incidentally, to determine what order of infinity the points in space make up.This is thus the first novel in Rucker's series of \\"transreal\\" novels -- \\"transrealism\\" being defined as somewhat metaphorical storytelling based pretty closely on the author's own experiences. In the present case, we're talking about mystical experiences, some drug-induced, some not. At any rate, Felix Rayman does indeed get to dig infinity -- and so does the reader, although those with _no_ mathematical background may dig infinity a little better if they read _Infinity and the Mind_ either before or after this one.Rucker writes in his introduction to the Princeton edition of _Infinity and the Mind_ that he must have settled his questions about God, because he stopped thinking about them. Here, in a short afterword, he confirms that he still accepts the premises on which _White Light_ is based, and adds that he has also adopted a new belief: that far from being merely an impersonal metaphysical abstraction, God can and will help human beings overcome our spiritual difficulties if we just ask. He also gives us a bit more information about the influences that shaped the novel.Also included in this new edition is a somewhat informative but mostly irritating foreword by John Shirley, who helpfully expounds the novel's relationship to the ideals of the '60s but vastly overstates its relationship to cyberpunk. (Rucker's _Software_ and its sequels may be cyberpunk, but this one isn't.)But the main feature is still the story itself, which I happen to think is mind-blowingly cool. Check it out."},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"Gregory Benford once stated that he was skeptical on the literary effectiveness of math stories because &quot;mathematical languages have such a wonderful aura of precision and controllability, which is why scientists are intuitively drawn to them; but they lack a quality I can only describe as human expressiveness.&quot; To those who concur with Benford I point out Rucker's White Light as a counterexample. White Light is hilarious, intriguing and even poignant at times. The hero Felix Rayman is actually likeable and he keeps the story grounded in the sphere of human emotions even at its most fantastical moments. What does Felix as Donald Duck think about after he has had his heart ripped out by an Aztec priest? - That he never told Hewey, Dewey and Louie that he loved them! However, I must add that this book might be confusing to someone who has had minimal exposure to math beyond calculus. The enjoyment of the book is heightened if you've read Cantor's proof that the cardinality of the real numbers is greater than the cardinality of the natural numbers, know something about the Banach-Tarski paradox and the Axiom of Choice, and have a general knowledge of the great mathematicians of the late 19th century. If you like Stanislaw Lem, are interested in higher mathematics and are tired of those space operas I would highly recommend White Light."},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"A modern 'Alice in Wonderland' for grown-ups, this easily-digestible novel (it's very short) tells the possibly-imaginary tale of a man who falls out of his body one day and takes off in pursuit of the infinite, and beyond. It doesn't really have much of a point, and the author was clearly making it all up as he went along (the abstract nature of 'Cimon' renders conventional plotting superfluous), but provided you don't take it at all seriously it's a light-hearted romp through a surreal, infinite world.This particular edition was published in associated with Wired magazine - despite the awful essay that introduces it, it has nothing to do with cyberpunk at all (there are *no* in-line skates, and at no point does our hero plant explosives in somebody's head), and is all the better for it."},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"I read &quot;White Light&quot; when it first came out in 1980. I liked it so much I lent it to a friend, and of course never saw it again. Rudy Rucker has a masterpiece here, as far as I am concerned. He deals with infinity in a very interesting fashion, and makes it entertaining to us average types. Rudy Rucker deals with the soul; and the concepts of heaven and hell are approached in a very strange fashion. White Light refers to the melding of the soul with God, The Absolute, or Infinite, and in a sense, with the loss of one's ego and sense of self. While being irreverent, Rucker, a professor of mathematics at San Jose State, has very seriously written about the concept of mathematical infinity and with the absolute brain busting theory of infinity plus one. This is a novel, and you travel to the afterlife with Felix Rayman and, almost like Odysseus, embark on a journey of discovery. You will experience what it would be like to be in a place where you can change body shape, defy gravity, meet weird creatures, and deal with the infinite and eternal. But all is not groovy. You and your guide, Felix Rayman, encounter many frustrations and even sinister spirits now incorporated into bodies and who inhabit a strange place reminiscent of an R. Crumb landscape.

I was overjoyed when I found it, I will never forget the description of what \\"White\\" is."},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"I read somewhere, once, that Rudy Rucker was the original and actual father of cyberpunk, and that White Light was his seminal work. I'm not sure I really buy that, but I can say this - Rudy Rucker is certainly one of the most unique authors of his generation, and White Light is a unique work among unique works. Sort of Alice in Wonderland meets The Phantom Tollbooth, it is the story of a free-spirited mathematics professor who stumbles upon an extra-dimensional, parallel universe - where he embarks upon a journey to attain the ultimate truth; the White Light.White Light is many things at once - so many things, in fact, that it hovers on the fulcrum between challenging and disturbing, between brilliantly complex and maddeningly random. At the end, I'm not certain whether I've read a work of coherent genius, so much as I am impressed by Rucker's ability to introduce so many surreal concepts, and maintain even the slightest impression of control over the story.Definitely not a linear work, White Light is more like a vast dreamscape, or intense acid trip, where Rucker casts up a cacophony of bizarre characters, dead geniuses, and new age mysticism oddly blended with abstract mathematical theory. And while it is not a dense literary work, it is also not an easy read - it takes work to get through it. In the end, I found the effort worthwhile - but Rucker is definitely not for everyone. If you're up for a surreal intellectual challenge, though, I'd recommend it strongly."},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"with reference to another review, this was my first rucker book and it made me want to read more. finally, a book about a mathematician and a proper look at the ramifications of mathematics. i think rucker must be one of the greatest authors out there today, the reading was fluid and enjoyable. i'm not much for the little sexual excursions, but it didnt seem too out of place or trashy. overall, one of the better books i've read, and i would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"I read this book in 1981 while an Electronics student. Since then I've been looking for a copy everytime I went into a bookshop. It seems fitting I found it online. As with others this book seemed to wake me up. Explaining transfinite number theory with various surreal characters and a plot which resembles the most controlled acid trip ever pushed the limits. A sort of maths road movie with altered states, Einstein, God and urban decay. Perfect for the end of a millenium."},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"On one level, it's a mathematical fable, like Flatland--it finally taught me what it means that some kinds of infinity are bigger than others, a concept I have puzzled at since I was a child. But it's also a more or less autobiographical account of mystical (for want of a better word) experiences that Rucker actually had--not exactly as set down here, of course, but as close as he could explain them. And at the same time it's a psychologically realistic account of a young professor's professional and marital problems. And it's a fun, surreal sci-fi goof. And it's a modern version of Dante's trilogy. Maybe it's an infinite number of books about infinity!"},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"I am a 13 year old fan of all mathamatics and anything that has to do with computers, so I picked up this sucker after reading the 'ware series.

After Rudy took me to the world of Cim&ouml;n, I feel I must go to San Jose and be taught by the new king of scifi.

You see, I had enjoyed 'Infinity and the Mind' a lot (this book isn't fiction) and also 'White Light'. And the reviewers have educated me - so 'Freeware' is cyberpunk. Well, if it is typical it's not to my taste (I will write a review of 'Freeware' when I have finished it.). It's so disappointing because Mr Rucker does have a capacity to express mathematical ideas so well - he should do more of it. 'White Light' I recommend unreservedly for its mathematical underpinning and its humour."},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"you must be kidding! this book is GREAT. complicated, sure. there were parts where i got a tad lost, but what's scifi without some hardcore math? lame! it's totally end of 70s early 80s too, that is, the scenes that take place in places other than on Mount On or in Dreamland. kickin'! this edition is cool too, hope it comes back soon!"},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"I had a.. Friend who took LSD once and he, err told me about it, and if I ever want to be reminded of his experience I just need to read White Light. That does it for me. It has the best descriptions of out of body states, dream / nightmare worlds of infinity. Trying to get somewhere, but never quite getting there. It's trip for sure.I find all of Rudy Rucker's books easy to read, somehow they are on my wavelength. However for the casual reader this book might not be the best place to start if your new to this author. Try Spaceland or The Hacker and the Ants first."},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"I've been looking for a copy of this in the used book bins for a couple of years now. I finally got sick of looking at it in my \\"to read\\" database in my PDA. It was pretty entertaining, I have to admit. Much more so if the reader understands Cantor's work. Apparently it was a result of his musings on Cantor's work during a short teaching tenure in a podunk univeristy. Part of it is pretty close to what he must have experienced there (despair, a failing relationship with his wife, drugs and really, really stupid students -all familiar situations to the young academic). Most of it is concerned with a sort of Edward Abbot-esque, or more accurately a Lewis Carroll-ish, journey to the lands of aleph-null and etcetera. I admit to being annoyed by the appearance of, well, Jesus Christ and Satan. I suppose others might be as annoyed by the appearance of David Hilbert and Georg Cantor. It should be compared with Lewis Carroll's mathematical recreations and Edward Abbot's \\"Flatland,\\" but, really, I think this is my favorite mathematical fiction book.One of these days I need to get around to reading some more of his fiction. I've actually met the man in person (and unfortunately, I think I freaked him out with my vehemence in pointing out that 'nanotech' is extremely silly), and he seems like a clever fellow. The book is certainly virtually unique in style and substance."},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"An insane headrush through the realms of higher mathmatics, the afterlife, the university system, and marital dissppointment!

My advice is don't bother."},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"In the strange worlds of quantum physics and the mathematics of infinity, things happen which defy common sense. Rucker was stuck in a small women's college teaching mathematics during the composition of this book, and his feelings of being out-of-place are mixed with the illogical mathematics he was studying, resulting in a book with a disturbingly chaotic flow.Dreamlike, surreal, psychedelic or just plain haphazard (depending on your frame of mind), this book lurches from storytelling to math to philosophy to self-analysis to physics to gutter humor to Kerouac to.... talking cockroaches, infinite hotels and a marriage on the rocks.Not a pleasant read -- one is never allowed to &quot;suspend disbelief&quot; -- and the plot twists in the book just happen, like quantum events, with no logic or internal rhythm or storytelling momentum."},{"Title":"White Light, Third Edition","review":"Well, someone gave me this book for Christmas and I wish they hadn't. I just couldn't get into this book. It doesn't seem to belong to the cyberpunk genre like other readers here indicate. I felt like I was unaware of some inside joke as I plowed through this. It doesn't merit a single star."},{"Title":"Confessions of an English opium-eater","review":"Thomas De Quincey wrote this account of his life and his struggle with drug addiction to both educate on the evils of opium and also to share the dream trances that he experienced while in the throes of addiction. This version by Penguin presents De Quincey's original version from 1821 and then his revision notes from 1856. There is also a short section of comments that De Quincey made concerning his Confessions from 1821-1855. The introduction by Alethea Hayter is one of the best I've seen in a Penguin book, and it really helps in understanding Thomas De Quincey and his writing style.The Confessions, in a nutshell, begin by recounting De Quincey's early life and the events that led him to begin taking opium. The rest of the tale deals with his problems with opium and his dreams that came from taking the drug. The original version isn't that long of a read, but his revision notes add considerable length, and for the most part weren't as interesting as the 1821 original.De Quincey's prose is absolutely amazing. He is one of the most gifted writers I've had the pleasure to read (up to this date). Many times I felt as though I was lifted up by his words and carried directly into his world. I've yet to have as profound an experience with any other author. De Quincey can also be difficult. His grasp of the English language will leave many modern readers scratching their heads. Footnotes and notes by the editor help, but a dictionary will find heavy use during the reading of this book. So those with short attention spans, be forewarned. You won't survive this book. Also, De Quincey received a classical education. He makes heavy use of Greek names, places and other classical references. He even uses Greek words in the text (although notes provide translations). I can read Greek and have studied classical history, so I got most of his references and in jokes. This is one of the things that impressed me about De Quincey. He mentioned early on that he could speak classical Greek fluently. Anyone who has studied Greek realizes how difficult this is to do. Even Romans had trouble speaking Greek fluently, so much so that it is mentioned in various historical works when an emperor could do so. The fact that De Quincey can do this is a sign of his deep intellectual abilities. I can only imagine how prolific he might have been if he had not been saddled with an opiate addiction.An amazing book and one I highly recommend to those who are prepared to read and understand it. For those looking for a justification for drug use, look elsewhere!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an English opium-eater","review":"Thomas De Quincey was a contemporary of Wordsworth and more importantly in terms of comparison, Coleridge. He writes that Coleridge and he met several times and in one instance they perused some Parnesi prints together. Whether on not they were both high at the time, De Quincey doesn't reveal. However, given the tenor of the tangent upon which De Quincey expounds, it is certain that at least he was using, and given Coleridge's history, he probably was a well. Why do I cite this incident? Because it is one of the few points in the narrative that is memorable. As someone interested in literary figures, the image of two 19th century literary hop-heads grooving-out whilst staring at Parnesi prints (you should look up Parnesi on the web - a definite precursor to M.C. Escher)is just plain marvelous.Unfortunately, that, and a few paragraphs depicting some truly macabre nightmares are the only noteworthy incidents in this book. Too often, De Quicey's labarynthine riffs doen't really lead anywhere. His writing style in some ways can be compared to another of his more illustrious contemporaries, Thomas Carlyle's. Both go in for elongated Latinate constructions, with modifier upon modifier and dependent and independent clauses ad infinitum. Carlyle, however, can pull it off. His great wit and energy of mind holds the center of the thought together, even as the rest of his sentence veers off into Baroque space. De Quincey is not an adept enough magician to perform this trick.De Quincey's subject is himself. His mode of writing in this instance is primarily that of a diarist. This leads to comparisons with some other English diarists of note. Two that come immediately to mind are Defoe (A Journal of the Plague Year) and Pepys (the most famous of all). De Quincey doesn't hold up well in comparision. Defoe's journal is interesting because his subject matter is compelling, he's a great journalist (conveying to our mind's eye the events he depicts), and he gets to the point. Pepys is wonderful because he provides us a full panorama of life in London in the latter half of the 17th century. De Quincey is so absorbed in his solipsistic self-examination, that we as readers aren't even allowed to come up for air, much less see anything around us. That would even be permissable if the narrator were like Proust's Swann, who is at least likeable and self-effacing. Not so De Quincey. He interupts his own narrative on countless occasions to tell us what a splendid scholar he is and (to borrow a phrase from Ophelia) &quot;what a great mind is here o'erthrown.&quot; He peppers the text with words like &quot;heautontimoroumenos&quot; to indicate that he is learned in Greek. Throughout the narrative, he is in way to big a hurry to impress these points upon the reader, instead of allowing the reader to judge for him/herself.If you want to know what it's like to be a junkie, read Burroughs. If you want to read some painfully constructed English prose, give this one a go.BK"},{"Title":"Confessions of an English opium-eater","review":"Heritage/LEC had a lot of fun in developing an intelligent, dignified, and yet evocative design for de Quincey's classic.A bilious, swirling variation of marbled paper appears on the book and the slipcover (is opium green?)

This is a drug memoir of sorts, but it is washed in a romantic aestheticism that distinguishes it from the familiar gritty and sordid morality plays of more recent times. De Quincy sometimes comes off as an erudite version of the charcher played by Ewan McGregor in Trainspotting. Entertaining stuff, if a little dry in places."},{"Title":"Confessions of an English opium-eater","review":"When I first heard of this book, I thought that it was a work of fiction. Given my basic knowledge of the Victorian era, I didn't think anyone, much less a writer, would stand up and talk about addiction. Alas, I was wrong, but do not regret reading this in the least.Although this book is short, about 70 pages for this edition, it is not as quick a read as you would think. His vocabulary can be quite extensive and to fully understand him, you have to have his background in Greek (the language and mythology) to understand his allusions. His writing seems to approximate a conversation with a very intelligent, but distracted, person. Many of these sentences (especially in the beginning) are quite long and filled with commas and colons. It is like the intelligent person trying to tell you something important, but as he speaks, he is not sure that he is being clear, so he adds little phrases to try to illustrate his point more effectively as he leans forward earnestly in hopes of adequately trying to prove his point.Within this piece, he talks of his background and why he started taking opium. He debunks many commentaries on opium use and explains why. DeQuincey also mentions other famous people who took opium (or laudanum). Lastly, he tells of some of his dreams which were &quot;enhanced&quot; by his opium taking. After reading these descriptions, I find myself looking at the work of Coleridge in a new light, and even the fictional character Sherlock Holmes.I would recommend this piece to any wanting a better understanding of DeQuincey and his time."},{"Title":"Confessions of an English opium-eater","review":"If you can tolerate older forms of English without becoming confused and yawning, then this would be a good book to read."},{"Title":"Confessions of an English opium-eater","review":"Heritage/LEC had a lot of fun in developing an intelligent, dignified, and yet evocative design for de Quincey's classic.A bilious, swirling variation of marbled paper appears on the book and the slipcover (is opium green?)

Worse yet, it suffers form the greatest of literary afflictions....want of interesting writing.Confessions has the appeal of listening to the incoherent, unorganized ramblings of a thoroughly bland speechgiver. He gives fits of lucidity to his story, in the form of making a point, only to derail it into some meaningless anecdote or philosophical pondering that leaves you wondering what his original point was to begin with.The sum of his story is he began taking opium to alleviate the pain from a stomach malady and through increased use and increasing dosage became an addict. Little insight is given that would be relevant to understanding modern day drug abuse. However, much of the physical effects of opium abuse related by the author are common to the hell of chemical abuse suffered by today's addict.I cannot remember the last time I fell asleep reading a novel but I did so 4 times while reading Confessions from sheer boredom.

As brief as an article for a newspaper must be, the &quot;Confessions&quot;in fact reveal very little insight into the characters and their truths, and very little confessions of personal intimacies.

It comes from the Statue of Liberty: \\"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to be free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore, Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden Door!\\" Roger Daniels' well researched and carefully nuance view of immigration to America since 1882 is a refreshingly even-handed assessment of America's immigration policies.For those that wish to shut and lock the \\"golden door\\" it would be well to remember this wonderful sentiment from George Washington: \\"The bosom of America is open to receive not only the opulent and respectable stranger, but the oppressed and persecuted of all nations and religions, whom we shall welcome to participate in all of our rights and privileges, if by decency and propriety of conduct they appear to merit the enjoyment.\\"The immigration issue is a divisive one in which more often than not we are faced with editorials stipulating that immigrant labor reduces the standard of living and opportunities of employment for all workers. But is this true? Are we not a nation of immigrants? If you want a better understanding of our policies and what this means to America please read this book."},{"Title":"Guarding the Golden Door : American Immigration Policy and Immigrants since 1882","review":"I just finished reading \\"Guarding the Golden Door: American Immigration Policy and Immigrants since 1882\\" by Roger Daniels. It focus's most of it's attention on the expanding network of contradictory, unenforceable, political and often blatantly racist immigration laws passed in the United States since the first Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882.It is the best book on the history of US immigration policy that I have read to date. By looking at the history of immigration chronologically by period and then at the effects on groups within each period it makes it possible for the reader to grasp the flow of policy and events. Two areas that aren't well treated in the book are the effects of the various policies on those excluded and other than statistically how immigrant groups melded into the mainstream. The book therefore reads more as a textbook than as a compelling story. But it presents the data well and puts it in one place. The footnotes and the bibliography are both very complete and useful.Daniels does have a few very interesting graphs. One on page 233 shows the changing attitude of Americans toward immigration over time. According to the Gallup Poll data negative attitudes toward immigration peaked in 1995 and attitudes have been improving since then. Of course the politicians and the bureaucrats have not yet adjusted their actions to this change of attitude."},{"Title":"Guarding the Golden Door : American Immigration Policy and Immigrants since 1882","review":"Full of statistics and facts about immigration law and the changes since 1790.

Great history book to say the least!"},{"Title":"The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration","review":"Black Political Scientist Carol Swain has produced a very important work which not only examines the growth of the new white nationalist movement in America, but also its sources. Swain notes that in the last ten years or so, a new, non-violent type of white nationalism has been growing in America, one that seeks to win people over through logic and argumentation. These groups vary from moderate to radical, but underlying them all is the same message: America is being undermined by minorities and immigrants. Perhaps the most important of these groups is \\"American Renaissance\\" led by Jared Taylor. Taylor is highly educated as are most his followers. They are against multiculturalism and seek to change the demographic balance in the country.But Swain's examination of the various groups and their messages is only the begining. She then examines the three main issues that are fueling the rise of these groups appeal to mainstream white Americans: Immigration, Crime, and Affirmative-Action. Swain argues that current immigration policy is not sensitive to local needs and a discussion on reform is needed. Unfortunately, no such discussion exists at this moment. Similiarly, high black crime rates are a taboo subject which no mainstream politician will discuss, leaving the issue to be framed by the white nationalists who argue that blacks are criminal by nature. Again, the lack of an open discussion is the greatest problem in confronting this issue. Swain offers no solution on how to lower black crime, however. But the fact that she acknowledges black crime rates are indeed higher is a brave break from the past. The third major issue feeding the movement is affirmative action, seen by many whites as discrimination. More than any other issue, it contributes to the appeal of white nationalism. Swain makes a strong case for the elimination of race-based policies, in favor of class-based policies instead. Swain also delivers a scathing indictment of the black leadership, which she believes does not serve its communities interests. Since Swain herself is black, perhaps her words will have some resonance within the black community to reasses their leaders.In sum, it seems that censorship is our greatest enemy. When we cannot talk about issues honestly and openly, those with radical agendas will take over since there is no other side to balance it out. At first glance, one might think of this book as a typical liberal attack on the radical right, simply denouncing them without offering solutions. Swain does no such thing. She is a conservative, one who understands that difference between the mainstream and radical right, and who offers us solutions on how to improve race relations for the future. Our efforts can no longer focus on minorities, but on all Americans, if we are to reach our ideal of a color-blind society."},{"Title":"The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration","review":"If you are looking for a truthfully unbiased book about the growing nationalism in our country, this is not the book for you. From the opening page the author tries to label the movement and its growth as the rehashed baby boy of the socially unacceptable white supremacy movements of America's recent past. Even though she does admit to the reasons that more and more Americans of European descent are being driven to an ethno- cultural nationalistic way of thinking, she still paints the underlying motivation as pursuit of white supremacy and white dominance mixed with our inherent insecurities and need for control. She informs us that the beliefs all stem from white supremacist plots to trick and coerce common Americans to their way of thinking. Isn't it funny how all sorts of people across the nation are getting similar ideas when they have never even touched base with each other? Quite possibly could it be that some people have grudgingly begun to accept the facts for what they are? The author makes an attempt to win credibility by conceding certain points about racial differences in crime rates, hate crimes, etc, but still refuses to shoulder the responsibilty for her people's actions and lacking social behavior, and she shows a marked inability to understand why other people and other races would care to distance themselves from these things.This book falls back on the old philosophy \\"if we can label it as racist, then maybe we can curtail it before it even gets started\\". All I can say is that I am very disappointed in this book. From the reviews I read I expected a completely unbiased book slammed full of interesting facts and truths that we are all so in need of seeing in print. Am I a racist if I wish for my children to grow up in a safe environment? Am I racist if I wish my children to live in the best possible world, free from prejudice and hate? Am I racist if I want my children to grow up with a strong sense of pride in themselves and their people and history? Am I racist if I wish my children to have morals and values and a strong sense of culture and heritage in a place that is their home where they are treated fairly like all citizens? If that is what a racist is, then I must surely be one and I am sure the author would agree. Plain and simple, if you want a book full of the old \\"anti-racist\\" double standard racism, unique perspective, liberal finger pointing, labelling failure to accept the truth for what it is and mask it with the taboo labels of our past, then this book is great for you, but as for me, I could have gotten the same information from a few weeks of watching my television set......."},{"Title":"The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration","review":"A good study on White Racialism in the United States and the affects of a &quot;multi-racial&quot; society on whites.All too often non-whites flaunt their racial pride, and they have organizations to turn to. But where do whites turn? All too often the only place they can turn to are radical organizations, because the only non-racist organization for whites out there that i know of is the EAIF.org (European/American issues Forum). If anything we need more non-racist websites for whites that don't accuse whites of bigotry the second they enter the site. Not the best book in the world, but worth a glance."},{"Title":"The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration","review":"As an Englishman (a Geordie to be precise) and admirer of America, this book is a welcome discussion of the problem of race in the States, a problem which runs far deeper than in Britain. The simple fact is that the epithet \\"racist\\" has become a profoundly effective weapon in propagating the slave morality which Nietzsche so despised. No one suggests that America is \\"white\\" because that particular demographic happened to be the most powerful, therefore the most deserving - a self-evident trait. No, instead the missionaries of the underclasses rant and rave about the \\"fact\\" that whites \\"cheated\\" to become dominant - as if they were possessed of some demonic power. The fact is, I abhor people who have disgust for other races than their own, but i abhor equally the acceptable face of anti-Nordicism. The fact is that whites dominated the earth because of simultaneous developments in their culture around the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries - notably the evolution of capitalism. Whomever suggests that whites overcame undeservedly is clearly jealous of this master morality (cf. the Greeks, the Romans, the French and British Empires, etc) which was also a feature of non-white peoples like the Arabs and the Chinese; and yet they have no reason to be - historical dialecticism is not the goal of humanity, contrary to the assertions of the Hegelian-Marxists."},{"Title":"The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration","review":"The author is a tax-supported \\"scholarship student\\" (by her admission), who dutifully says what such people are paid to say. She actually advocates censorship of the Internet, (when it doesn't conform to her views or the views of the think-tanks with which she's affiliated), something that made me so angry I contacted her. The book, quite frankly, made me sorry for my family's positive sense of \\"civil rights.\\" To have given this woman \\"a voice,\\" only to have her use it to condemn and silence populations unlike herself, and to censor the Internet.

Native Irish are projected to be a minority in their own country no later than 2050. Racial strife and violence has already rocked England, due to out of control multiculturalism.This disturbing trend has appeared here in America as well, with Whites consistently being outbred by foreigners, not to mention the lax border control policies our government has (or has not) implemented.The funny thing is that a lot of Whites seem completely unconcerned about the future of their children and grandchildren.Europe is undoubtedly a White person's birthright, and should be for Whites only, just as Asia and Africa is for Asians and blacks. Here in America, where this demographic suicide is also occuring, we will become a third world country within the next 50 years. Balkanization will happen and racial violence (South Africa for example) will be much more common.Executions of Whites and interracial rapes will become more common as we plunge into minority status- they say 50% of the population by 2050, and what next? How low can we go?Would Whites be alarmed when the census comes out with a 5% projection? Where does the annihilation of our people end?The author of this book would no doubt be shocked by the disappearance of a beautiful butterfly, sea lions or the St. Bernard dog but could not care in the least to see White children continue to exist and thrive in a safe first world country.-A female White Nationalist"},{"Title":"The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration","review":"Carol Swain's book is a wonderfully thorough and in depth look at current race relations in America. Although some of the content is disturbing, she argues that we should not be silent on the issue of race, but rather discuss what is often uncomfortable. The most persuasive part of the book is her section on policy suggestions as she brings unique and new ideas to light. Even if you think that these issues do not effect you, it is a must read as silence and lack of information fuels the white nationalists' discourse and overall pursuasiveness."},{"Title":"The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration","review":"The New White Nationalism In America: It's Challenge To Integration by Carol M. Swain (Professor of Political Science and Professor of Law, Vanderbilt University) is a clarion call of warning, regarding the building solidarity of a non-violent, \\"white nationalist\\" movement in contemporary America. Rather than rely on force and terrorism, this movement seeks to advance its agenda through persuasion of its target white audience, embraces separation, undercuts the civil rights era vision of an integrated America of true equality -- that what is separate cannot be evil.

An appeal to pity for suffering white kids, an appeal for special consideration under the law to remedy the suffering of Christian normals at the hands of a liberal elite.What could be more chilling than that?"},{"Title":"Trice-Greatest Hermes; Studies in Hellenistic Theosophy and Gnosis","review":"You've got to like the sometimes tedious, journal-style approach of early explorers, or at least be willing to put up with it, to appreciate this book. However, it holds some remarkable writing, insight and yes adventure. Baker was a contemporary of Richard Burton, John Henning Speke, Henry Morton Stanley and David Livingstone, all famous for their searches for the source of the Nile River in Africa. If you know anything about this time in history and about Africa itself, then you know that Africa was almost always fatal. Few who went into the interior returned, and those who did usually paid with their health. Not a pretty picture. Into this scene walks Samuel Baker, a wealthy, larger than life British aristocrat with a passion for exploration and excitement.Baker was a man who tackled rather than simply lived life. A fine linguist, writer, artist and sportsman who hunted with a knife because it was too easy to kill with a gun, he was also extremely practical with a &quot;let's get on with it&quot; attitude towards his travels. Nothing but determined, he presses forward when others would have said, &quot;enough.&quot; Are you surprised that he succeeds where others have failed? I wasn't.What I like about Baker's writing is that he knows how to tell a story. He is as interested in the people as he is in the facts of what happened. It also helps that Baker himself edited this book, picking and choosing the entries from his longer journal. If Baker is pompous and full of his own superiority at times, he can be forgiven. All in all this is a good read. It helps, however to have read his first book &quot;The Albert N'yanza Great Basic of the Nile&quot; first."},{"Title":"Trice-Greatest Hermes; Studies in Hellenistic Theosophy and Gnosis","review":"I like to read about exploring and hunting in Africa, authors like Ruark, Capstick, & Hemingway. The reason I hunted down this book is because Hemingway said it was the best book he ever read about Africa. I figured he would know.I enjoyed this book immensely. Baker describes his explorations, hunting expeditions, and encounters with the natives in experiences that now can only be dreamed about. He talks about his extensive hunting trips with the Hamram Arabs, who hunted elephants with swords from horseback. He tells about traveling hundreds of miles on the backs of camels, and about rescuing one pack camel that had fallen off the side of a cliff by wrapping ropes around it and lowering it to the bottom of the canyon. Even much of the day to day camp life is very interesting, as the party had to provide for all of their needs for themselves.It is worth noting, that apparently modern readers must be somewhat put off by a supposed tone of superiority. One reviewer indicates this way, and in the version I have, the publisher actually attempts a vague apology on the back of the book. I didn't notice anything in Sir Samuel Baker's tone, but if someone can read this book and not conclude from the narrative that Baker actually is superior to the vast majority of mortals, they must have a better imagination than I do.One of the most interesting aspects of Baker's explorations is that he had his wife, Lady Florence, with him the entire time. One of my favorite stories is about a night when he was awakened by a gentle tug on his sleeve, which was always his wife's signal that something was wrong. Without rolling over he reached under his cot and got his rifle first, and then his wife indicated that a hyena had just stuck it's head in the door of the tent. He waited a few minutes, and when the hyena took another look, he dispatched it there in the tent in the middle of the night.If you like to read about Africa, or about exploration, hunting, or high adventure, I think you will enjoy this book very much."},{"Title":"Trice-Greatest Hermes; Studies in Hellenistic Theosophy and Gnosis","review":"This book makes fascinating reading for anyone interested in 19th century Africa. Above all, it gives a clear insight into how Africa and, in particular, the Nile was viewed by European adventurers and hunters at the time. Samuel Baker was a very able writer and his fluid style and keen eye for scientific detail make this book a pleasure to read. Perhaps the only negative aspect of the book is that it goes into too much detail on Baker's hunting expeditions and the modern reader may find some of these episodes quite savage and cruel. Apart from that, it is a book which is well worth reading and which gives the reader a much better understanding of how life really was in these remote areas in the late 19th century."},{"Title":"Trice-Greatest Hermes; Studies in Hellenistic Theosophy and Gnosis","review":"There was a time when men of honor travelled the world in search of new and exciting adventures. Strength of character, intestinal fortitude and raw courage abound in this wonderful recount of actual events. It is hard to imagine in our \\"modern world\\" how difficult and dangerous the adventures retold in this amazing book must have been to actually achieve. This is not Hollywood or a video game. These events actually transpired as written by a man of unquestionable strength.Although his writing style can be a bit dry at times the reader is transported to a world which no longer exists. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Africa, hunting, exploration, etc. There are few men of any generation whose accomplishments can be compared with those of Samuel White Baker.For those who enjoy this book I highly recommend, Man-Eaters of India, by Jim Corbett. Another fine example of courage and honor under the most difficult of circumstances."},{"Title":"Anti-Judaism in Feminist Religious Writings (American Academy of Religion Cultural Criticism)","review":"If you are looking for a condemnation of feminist readings of the Hebrew bible, this book ain't for you. Make no mistake, the author is an ardent feminist. Where this book is a masterwork of criticism is in how it shows how anti-Jewish theology, sometimes centuries old, has innervated modern feminist analysis of the bible. The book starts with an introduction that makes the book worthwhile for any student of German or Jewish history, where the author describes her discovery of the atrocities committed by an older relative, and how the family sought to deny it. This watershed moment triggers her re-evaluation of her studies, and her discover of the insipid anti-Semitism that fills the work of many biblical scholars who work in the feminist arena. Goddess theology, views of Israelite religion, Christian feminism, these and more pass through von Kellenbach's filters. This book is the record of her search for a better feminist view of the Hebrew bible and a more accurate view of the Ancient Near East that incubated it. She does not seek to deny feminist readings, rather, she brings to light the flaws of scholarship that anti-Judaism has brought to such readings. The book is a work of literary scholarship, and is not in the &quot;for dummies&quot; format, so it is less than perfectly accessible. Some knowledge of the field of secular biblical scholarship and feminist thought is needed to understand some of the more complex points. Overall, the book addresses a serious issue in biblical scholarship, and it bridges many areas of study. If you are looking for either exultation or condemnation of Feminist views on bible, you have the wrong book. If you want to take the next step in your study of modern biblical scholarship, or you seek to build a better feminism, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"COMPLEX VARIABLES WITH APPLICATIONS","review":"I learned complex variable theory on my own from this book and it was a very fun process.

The discussions are very readable and the problems do a good job of re-enforcing the discussion at hand. The book covers a wide range of topics and spends ample time on each individual subject - so you really get your money's worth. I have made multiple self-study attempts at complex variables using a wide variety of books both old and new and can say that this is the best I've seen. As a bonus Dr. Wunsch takes you on various short historical and mathematical side trips (both in the body of the text and in the problems) which makes the book come alive.

This is one of the most elegant books on the subject of complex variables. The author uses very clear language to explain complicated topics such as contour integration and conformal mapping. It contains both elementary and advanced topics. This book has several interesting properties: First, It is virtually void of errors. Second, there are a lot of examples worked out in detail. Most of these examples are from physics or engineering.

The exceptions are some concepts such as the conditions to be satisfied for a function to be differentiable which can come off as a little too under-explained.The exercises are great and numerous, although the author has the, to me, annoying habit of deferring some lesser proofs to being exercises, limiting the books usefulness as a reference which I stress is still quite good. Fortunately Wunsch has made an excellent solutions manual which mitigates this issue and which can be found on the internet from several sources, a great selling point in it's favour when it comes to working with the book.The book also contains a wide range of applications though I cannot vouch for their usefulness or relevance as I only worked with the purely mathematical subjects."},{"Title":"COMPLEX VARIABLES WITH APPLICATIONS","review":"I had the extreme good fortune of having the author as a professor in the 70's and was excited to find this book available. Without a doubt, the best teacher I have ever had, his classroom style comes through vividly in this book. I've read other books on this subject, but none have ever inspired me the way this one has. Real world examples add to the importance and make the math come alive. Examples give very helpful hints at solving the problems and add immensely to the learning experience. I was also very pleased to see a screen shot of Richard Feynman's notebook page where he proclaims e^i(pi)+1=0 as the most remarkable formula in math...indeed! Other historical notes bring the savants of the past to life.

Maybe if Jim Thompson (i.e., Killer Inside Me, The Grifters, After Dark, My Sweet, etc.) was writing an \\"... book,\\" but then he'd be hard pressed to improve upon Babs Lakey's efforts. Babs tells the story of two abused characters in a rapid fire first person perspective which shifts between the characters and gives the reader an almost God's eye view of the unfolding story. The details are dealt out piece by piece so that the reader is given the big picture of the two main protagonists and how their lives molded who they are. The contrast in the psychopathy of the two characters reminds me of a discussion on Batman and the Joker's personalities that appeared at the time of the first Michael Keaton movie. Batman's just as nuts as the Joker, but he comes at it from another perspective. The same is true with Els, who has survived a similar family unit as Peter both of their childhoods molding their adult lives.\\"Spirit of the Straightedge\\" deals mainly with nurture causes and foregoes looking into any of the natural enablers of its characters' personalities. This book isn't for the squeamish and is very graphic in its depictions of life. It's never gratuitous, but it's neither for the sensitive reader nor possibly for those who have survived similar childhoods. It's a fascinating read nonetheless. This is book one in a series of psychological suspense novels coming from Babs Lakey ... hopefully she doesn't make us wait long and hopefully she takes her unwavering and dissecting eye beyond what evils men do and includes more of the fairer sex too.

The book shows how hard life was in the early 1900's and how people had to work so hard for their lives. It has a very sad ending, but a very realistic one.

Any author who can make the characters and their relationships so real to the reader like Ms. Rawlings is truly talented. I haven't read a book that made me cry so hard for a long time.

I'm not surprised that this is the winner of the Purlizer Prize... I'm crazy about this book. I cried so much when I came to an end... half because I was sorry that Flag had died, and half because Jody's beautiful childhood has ended. And so touching it is! It kind of tells you how much love a young boy gave to a yearling. He understood it and loved it.

I liked this book because it was neat to see the relationship between the boy and Flag (his fawn). It showed how far Jody would go to keep his pet from out of trouble. Also, it seemed that the more problems Flag created, the stronger the bond came among them. Another reason why I liked this book is because it was fun to read about life during that time period. It was interesting to read of all they had to do, especially when it came to walking long distance. If they forgot to tell someone something, they'd have to walk all the way back just to say what they needed to say. Furthermore, when they lived by \\"neighbors\\", they still lived fairly far away from each other. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read a great book."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I'm 11 years old and I just finished reading the Yearling, with tears in my eyes.

So, on a \\"different\\" scale of 1-5 stars, I would give it 7."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"Although I read &quot;The Yearling&quot; nearly thirty years ago, it still remains my all-time book. First, Ms. Rawling's characters are strong; i.e., even in their individual frailty, they each stand apart from one another. Second, the characters contrast one another. Jody has love and compassion; his mother has become withdrawn and cold. Fodder Wing is weak in physical strength and poor in health, but has a God-given gift through his ability to communicate with wildlife. His older brothers, on the otherhand, are the epitome' of brawn, strength, and good health; but how they love their frail, little brother! The fawn, Flag, was so memorable that I named my present Labrador Retriever after him. But although Flag's ending was tragic to say the least, it was necessary in the completion of Jody's character. I cannot say that &quot;The Yearling&quot; is a book for everyone, but it is truly a literary classic; at least in my opinion. If I could ever emulate an author, it would be Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, because a book that transmits to the reader a strong depth of characters, as well as evoking deep emotions, is always one that keeps my attention.Myra L.

The number one most refreshing thing about Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' \\"The Yearling\\" is that Southerners are made into real people. Admittedly, the Baxter family of her novel is quite ignorant by our modern standards, but as a portrayal of a 1930's backwoods dirt-poor Florida family, her characterization and descriptions are something to immediately get lost in.The Yearling tells the story of Jody Baxter, his father Penny, his \\"Ma\\" Ory and their encounters with the wild Florida scrub around them as well as the wild neighbors they share the land with. Each chapter is formulated to be a perfect short glimpse into a different month, a different season, and a different struggle for the Baxters. Long before Jody finds the Yearling for which the book is named, we develop a bond with the characters of the book as we follow their daily activities and wonder at their simple pleasures.The language and style that Rawlings uses is also spot on. The phrases that the Baxters and their rowdy neighbors, the Forresters, give us provide comic relief as well as a sincerity and honesty to the work.The story is poignant and memorable as we grow up with Jody and his fawn, and learn the tough decisions that one must make as we transition into adult-hood. This book has earned the title of a beloved classic, and its appearance on school reading lists cannot be seen often enough. This is a must read for every Southerner and especially for adolescents who are making the hard journey towards maturity that Jody shares with us."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"Travel back in time to the late 19th century and bushwhack your way into the thick woods and scrubland of northern Florida. Here you'll find young Jody Baxtor living with his parents in a small, isolated house. Jody is the last of seven children, but none of his six siblings survived infancy. Jody's father is a tough yet generous man, but the heartache and tragedy Jody's mother has undergone have created a barrier that prevents her from growing close to her one living son. Life in these Florida woods is difficult, and Jody is lonely. He longs for a pet of his own, but feeding just the three people in their home is challenge enough without the added burden of an animal.A series of unusual events involving a dangerous bear hunt and a serious rattlesnake bite eventually lead Jody and his father to an orphaned fawn, which Jody eagerly adopts and dubs \\"Flagg\\". An unbreakable and happy bond develops. While Jody hangs on any tender moment he can capture with his parents, he depends on Flagg to help to fill the aching void in his young heart. Flagg becomes a bright spot Jody can't live without.As he grows up, Jody learns to cope with the sadness of strained relationships, the constant fight against starvation, the reality of death, and the numerous dangers that, given his location and the era, are par for the course. Catostrophic floods, fights with unrefined neighbors, and exposure to snakes, alligators, and other predators are just a few of the obstacles Jody will face and learn to overcome throughout his childhood. His is the life of a farmer, hunter, and survivor, and it is far from easy.As Jody reaches adolescence, he is forced to recognize that his one stable and happy treasure, Flagg, may not be his forever. Turns out growing up and letting go is far more difficult than he could have imagined. Will Jody find the resolve to part with the one true companion he has come to cherish so deeply?The Yearling is eye-opening for the average American child, who has no real concept of the kind hardship Jody experienced. It's a window into another lifestyle in which survival was the first priority, forcing love and emotions to take a back seat. It's also an educational look at what it was like to grow up in this part of Florida, isolated from most civilization and exposed to various dangers. And of course, the unique bond between a boy and his pet deer is a classic story sure to warm your heart. This is a long read, and feels slow in spots, but it's worth the time if you're willing to plow through.Recommended read-aloud age: 10 and upRecommended read-alone age: 14 and upTo read more of my book reviews, visit larsenreviews.org."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"Well, this book was very good. It has an unusual ending and I did it for my ELA class. It describes the relationship between a boy and his pet, but it also describes a boy's passage into childhood.

Otherwise he could never get through a book of strange dialect and replete description such as this. Those of you who found the plot weak, and the story slow moving may not yet be mature enough to be able to appreciate the genius of Rawlings as she deftly develops the characters over this easy going romp through the Florida scrub of the early 20th century. The descriptions are like being able to listen, through your mind's eye, to Rawlings' recollection of this wild and fantastic land in which these simple people clawed out their existence.

This book is about a young boy named Jody who wants a pet of his own in the worst way. One day while Jody is hunting with his father Penney for a bear named Slewfoot in the backwoods of Florida, his father gets bitten by a rattlesnake on his arm. Penney quickly kills a grazing doe and uses her liver to remove the poison from his wound. The boy discovers that the doe had a fawn and convinces his father to allow him to keep the yearling. Jody is forced to decide the fate of his charished pet fawn after it has grown because it continues to eat the poor family's crops. Jodyruns away from home for a short time after his mother kills his fawn &quot;Flag&quot; [after his white tail] because Jody believes that his mother intended to shoot it. The book has a main theme of facing difficult times and pulling through them. Jody faces the death of a neighbor friend named Fodder-wing, the death of his beloved pet, the near-death of his father and also, his own near- death experience after he runs away from home. Some men rescue him and Jody returns home and appoligizes to his mother and father. Jody agrees to stay on the farm and help his father instead of going to sea.

Even though there is no yearling, it is still exciting tracking a bear that is killing their livestock. The boy Jody, wants a pet like his friend Forrester, who has all kinds. He is given the responsibility of taking care of a baby dear. As the dear grows older, it causes trouble, and Jody must decide between his parents wishes, and his beloved yearling, Flag. Its similar to Where the Red Fern Grows, a sad story about a lonely boy in the mountains. Except the ending, is not only sad, but a little disapointing and makes you wonder 'what next?' The yearling is definitly not a main character. You'll be pulled toward the end all through the book, which makes the end a dissapointment."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"The Yearling had too much sybolism; I don't reccomend it for the literal reader, like me.

Altough I liked the mother, she wasn't sympathetic at all and I don't blame her at all."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"This book was so boring that it took me a long time to finishit because I disliked it so much.

Thesewere the only positive compliments I had for this book. StevenYum, 6th grade, ASIJ."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"Definately a very descriptive and touching old yeller kind of book. It's about this hillbilly boy who lives with his redneck parents and neighbors in florida. 41 percent (yes i have calculated) passes before the story acctually gets to the point and he finds the fawn whos mother his dad killed to use the liver for a snakebite. This was possibly the most boring book i have ever read. Luckily i was blessed with patience and it was required. If you can talk like hicks and can't really understand normal english here's a book in your own language. Unless your life consists hunting for bears and deer and planting crops you will never really connect with the story. Average kids dont live in the middle of a marsh eating their bear jerky. The characters are confusing since at first i though his dad was a girl (his name is penny)and details about both of them are often confusing. This book is also repetative mostly talking about hunting and him playing with his fawn. I'm not a disrespectful person and i think that the author has talent that not many can reproduce. Also this story did tell of family values and a boy's journey growing up. But i really dont recomend this book unless you have time to go though and understand the whole thing.C.S. age 12"},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I loved the book!

It's hard to see how most people who aren't hunters would really enjoy this book. Even if hunting was a near constant activity, reading about it, at least for me, started to wear thin about half way through the book.

The Yearling is a very visual through the detailed description of its characters, setting, and dialouge. The reader is able to picture the story very clearly in their minds because of the way that the author has written this. The characters are brought to life by this and by the way that the author has written the dialect in a southern style. The yearling takes place in the backwoods of Florida with a young boy named Jody, his family, and his tamed fawn, Flag. Jody and his family suffer through many hardships in their life. They are a poor family trying to raise a farm and suffer through the turmoils of being poor. Through these hardships Jody fell in love with his friendship with Flag. This book is one for people who love animals, love to read about youth growing up, or simply enjoy readin of any kind.

I had to read this for school.Let's just say that this book is not the best and not the worst."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"The Yearling is one of the most emotionally provocative classics I have ever had the fortune to come across. Being a 12 year old myself, I empathize greatly with our young hero, Jody Baxter, who resides in a dense florida scrub, leading an agrarian lifestyle with his father and mother. Coming of age in the savage, untamed heart of late ninteenth century Florida is not an easy task, and Jody will need to mature swiftly if he wants to survive in the wild enviorment that is his own. Luckily, many things aid him, mostly indirectly, such as his pet fawn, that he cares for with such a passion, that in the end, a very difficult and demanding choice is required of him.Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings writes this splendid tale with an honest and unwavering hand, thankfully not romanticizing the protaganist, as can be seen with novels of a lesser quality. Our heroe's flaws and redeeming qualities are portrayed in a realistic fashion, as Rawlings shifts between comedy and tragedy with the deft skill of a very gifted writer. This delightful story is bereft of all unconvincing melodrama that often plagues such novels, and tells this innocent boys experiences with vivid imagery. No matter how impassive the reader might be, Rawlings eventually delves into our minds, hearts, and memories."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"If you could have anything in the world, what would it be? For years, Jody Baxter knew the one thing that he desperately wanted- and it was as simple as a pet. When he is ten, he finally finds his fawn. Now, Jody has a wonderful life living with his family, and his tame fawn on their farm in Baxter's Island, Florida. He spends his time hunting or fishing with his father, visiting his grandmother, or playing with his fawn, Flagand his friend Fodder-Wing. What could possibly go wrong?This book, The Yearling, by Marjorie Rawlings is an excellent read, for the more advanced reader. Rawlings is very good at creating an exciting story and excellent at accurate description. If you enjoy a longer, but still interesting, more detailed story, this book is definitely for you.When Jody Baxter finds the young fawn abandoned in the woods his life changes dramatically. He goes from a bored, and slightly lazy and depressed boy to a whole different person. He loves to play with the fawn more than anything, and will do anything for it. Because of his devotion to it, he does any work he is asked to do, as well as he can, because he wants his parents to let him keep it. But the fawn seems to Jody's parents to be more trouble than it's worth. It is destroying their crops and food supplies. How will Jody's family survive the winter with no food?I thought that this whole book is interesting even though it is so long. Because of the length, I think it would be hard to actually keep up the reader's interest, but Rawlings does a very good job at it. Her description of the forest scenery is also, at times, shockingly good. Truthfully, this isn't the best book I have ever read, but is definitely among the top three. It has all of the features of a good book: the plot isinteresting and original, the length and language are decent, and the ending is truly moving and thought provoking. If anyone is looking for a good read, no matter what type of books they normally select, I would highly suggest this one."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"After moving to Florida, I had to sample this classic.

She also was blessed with the most brilliant of editors, Max Perkins, who was an editor for 20th century literary giants like Fitzgerald and Hemingway.It was Perkins who kept Rawlings on track with her novel, reminding her that the novel should not be just written 'for a boy' but also 'about a boy'. He was the one who pointed out to her that her writing genius lay in stringing together episodes rather than hatching out intricate plots. In addition, it was Perkins who reminded Rawlings that the setting was full of tough times and tough people & she should avoid the theatricality and romanticism that sometimes crept into early drafts of the novel and really strive to emphasize, even increase the naturalism.Finally, Perkins remained dissatisfied with Rawlings' early title: The Fawn. He suggested that she find a more symbolic title. When she came up with titles like The Flutter-Mill or Juniper Island, he held her to her task, saying that there was not enough human suggestion. When she sent him a list including the eventual title, Perkins was satisfied that this was the right one.Shortly after that, Rawlings decided what she'd written was inferior & threw it out. Perkins prodded her to get going again. This book IS a classic, Rawlings WAS talented, unbelievably so, but neither would be as true if it were not for the dedicated brilliance of Max Perkins.

I kept coming back to read the last page over and over. It seemed slow, almost in real time, but while reading this I got to slow down myself and see how people can make it with nothing unnecessary.

The boy, Jody, starving for warmth and affection himself finds them in his adoption of a young deer, a \\"yearling\\". The love he develops for his pet and the relationship they share touches your heart and reminds you that life is so much more than what we know - it is what we feel.Taking you to the wilds of Florida in the days when battling the elements and creatures of nature was a day-by-day occurrence, this story is full of adventure and raw emotion. To most today this life seems brutal and unforgiving, but a reader allowing himself to time travel backward can watch from the clearing as a special relationship develops between and boy and a deer.Love, responsibility, regret, fun, sorrow, all are valuable elements in the story and I cannot think of a reader who would find this tale boring. It is a classic tale and one that needs to be on the bookshelf of every young person - after they have read it!"},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"\\"The Yearling\\" was one of the books of my youth and I still recall the sheer magic of the story through the eyes and imagination of a child. It is a totally different experience that that of the adult, in reading the same book, years later. Yet it is meant for both.The story is threaded throughout with humor even as it describes the dire poverty and struggle against the elements of a scrub family eking out a living among the wild creatures in a Florida swamp setting. Penny Baxter, the son of a backwoods preacher, his wife and young son, Jody, are simple and plain folk, but of solid character and tough fabric. The nearest neighbors are another family of a totally different variety, both in appearance and \\"raising\\" - the rough and tumble Forresters, a family of bearded, untamed backwoodsmen, headed up by a frail old couple whose existence revolves around a strange nucleus - a younger child and brother, \\"Fodderwing\\" - misshapen and crippled mentally at birth but whose soul is bright and unaware of physical limitations. Jody Baxter and Fodderwing are, in the innocence of youth, close friends who, when they are able to play together, share a deep love of the wild creatures of the woods that surround their \\"clearings\\". The chapter that deals with the interaction of the two lonely little boys with their animals is truly beautiful - childhood moments at their finest. Yet the author does not dwell long in the telling of those moments - it, like the real passing of time, is fleeting, gossamer.There are several separate, wonderful story threads: the \\"dog deal\\"; the might of The Storm - a hurricane - in which the reader actually feels the wild wind whipping the palmettos as the rain sheets down in torrents; the hunt for food afterward amid the death and destruction that takes the Forresters and the Baxters into the aftermath of the storm and it's devastations; the agony of feeling up close the cold breath of Death barely sparing the life of Penny, the sturdy little father so totally elemental to the survival of all; but primarily, it is the tale of the deep devotion of the little boy, Jody, for his fawn, Flag - the young deer who becomes the only other young creature in Jody's life that can be his companion on a regular basis, and for whom he tries to shield from the ever encroaching reality that the pet is a deer, and that deer and people are at odds in the fierce and unforgiving \\"circle of life\\" in such an environment.This book is a Classic - it's mystery and morale will never be forgotten once read, and in the final paragraphs, another elusive, fleeting truth flares brightly - then vanishes forever into the mists of the swamp."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"This book touches your heart in a special way, that makes you want to cry, I would reccommend this book to people that like wilderness books and nature stories.

The foresters are the neighbors of the main charachter.The forester's are treated like slightly noble bafoons, and the noble white town folks in the book treat them in a way the that is supposodly the way descent white folk are supposed to treat coloreds-in a condescending, patient manner, because coloreds can't help the way they are. the author grew up in the deep south and she takes her stereotypes with her into her book. if it wasn't for this i would have easily given the book five stars. everything else about the book is perfect"},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"This book would be moderately interesting if you liked repetiveness with just a little variation. I have to read this book for school and like the rest of the seventh graders think that it is a huge waste of time. The same thing happens every day-they get up go hunting and come home. Also this book uses language that many people find hard to understand. True it is appropriate to the story and I would not mind it if the book was at all interesting. I love writing and have read a good many books on the topic. They all say not to be overly descriptive as the author is here. We all know what a sunset looks like now will you please move on!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I found this book to be very slow going. The first half of the book is pointless. It sports an universal theme but the reader must be very patient to find out what that theme is. I had to read it for school and I am thinking that it is definitely a book for adults. Most kids just don't have the patience."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I had to read this book for school. The story that is there is good, but way too discriptive. It would have made a good short story, not a loooooong novel. The whole first page is about a cloud of smoke. This book is incredibly overrated. Anyone who wants to read this book, don't. Read Where the Red Fern Grows instead. It has the same theme/moral/whatever, is much more exciting, and dosen't drag you kicking and screaming through page after page of describing pansies and trees."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I am only 12 years old but, hey, if I thought this book was boring, you should listen to me. Unless you enjoy listening to other people's boring lives, this book is not for you. Jody, a young kid living with his Ma and Pa, is lazy and hates doing his chores because he gets easily distracted. Eventually, Penny, his father gets bitten by a snake and kills a mother doe to use the liver to suck out the venom. Jody learns that the fawn is still alive and oddly wants it as a pet. He names it Flag and gets even more distracted from his work with Flag around. This goes on until Flag ruins the corns crops and dies. If you really were attached to this fawn, of course you would be sad, but Jody just easily blows it off, like it is nothing. Parts of this book were good, but many few. Jody could have been a stronger character and Penny was probably the smartest out of all of them. Of course, not very many people in Florida at that time were not very educated, (especially with that crazy accent). Ok, that is about it."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I read this book for my English class; and I'm sorry to say that I was not the only one who was disappointed with it. In fact, I'm sure that few of my classmates would give this novel such a warm review as I am giving. But had I not been instructed to read it, I am afraid that I would not have wasted my time with it.There was little to no excitement throughout the duration of the book--there were hunts, there were fights--but none of which truly excited my attention. The most rewarding chapter was perhaps the last chapter, but it was too long a journey to reach it.Although some of my classmates would vouch that the dialogue in \\"The Yearling\\" was outright disgusting and that Marjorie's descriptions were unecessarily lengthy, these things were not what bothered me. I was simply bored with the plotline. Sure, it was a lukewarm coming-of-age tale, and Marjorie captured the immaturity of Jody very well, but, as aforementioned, it was not exciting. And I found that Penny especially, was very flat and without fault. My English teacher was quick to insist that he was a hero because of this, but I thought that this only made him unrealistic. Who do you know who is so faultless, so good and selfless? I would certainly like to meet such a person.I could have appreciated this story more, perhaps, if it had been shorter. There was so much prelude to the main plot (concerning Flag) that I would have happily put the book down and never have picked it up again if I was not required to read it cover-to-cover. \\"The Yearling\\" is by no means a page-turner, and I never truly pitied or sympathized with the characters.So why am I giving this book two stars and not one? It is because of the last sentence in the book. It was the only thing that was worth reading twice. The last sentence really struck a chord with me, and I could probably recite it from memory now, except I wouldn't want to spoil it for you (that is, if you go against my opinion and actually purchase/borrow \\"The Yearling\\").All-in-all, I would not recommend this book to anyone. I think I am being generous in calling it mediocre."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I am one of the unlucky ones who HAD to read this book for school. This book can not be considered a &quot;timeless classic&quot;. The REAL story only starts a few pages before half-way through the book (check for yourself). It also describes nature too deep in detail. Also, most of the book is very irrelevant to the whole story. This book needs to be avoided at all costs.

I remember first noticing it on my list of Pulitzer winners and being a bit surprised. However, not only did it win the Pulitzer - it deserved it.The general story is that of a boy named Jody living in the Florida backwoods. He works the land with his father and goes on adventuresome hunting trips, but has no people his own age to spend time with. After years of begging for a pet, his mother finally agrees to let him take a young doe in. Then your heart gets broken about a thousand times.The writing could easily have been cheesy or overly dramatic, but it wasn't. It was crisp, exact and made excellent use of dialectical dialouge, which I'm not usually a fan of. I was really captured by this book and immensely enjoyed reading it.That said, the whole thing with the yearling was a little weird, seriously. Like, the thing lived in his house? With him? It was a deer!! Deer don't live in houses!"},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I had wanted to read The Yearling for many years. Decades ago, when my children were young, I tried to read it with them, but they were daunted by the backwoods Florida dialect. We just couldn't get off the ground with it. Finally now, in retirement, I've found time to read it just for me. Like other reviewers, I enjoyed absorbing the carefully and wisely crafted story, appreciating its harsh truths and the thorough development of its characters. The ending moved me deeply. Such hard, but valuable, lessons life doles out!Please note that readers of this story, especially young people, will have to deal with its, fortunately very infrequent, use of the \\"N\\" word. I guess the best way to do that is to realize that this is one more facet of 1930s culture that the book reflects. Adult discussion of this may be helpful."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"Jody faces the harsh realities of life and grows from a boy into a man in this Pulitzer prize-winning book for middle school readers. Jody and his folks live a hard life on a Florida farm in the late 1800's. He gets very little schooling, but instead is expected to help out with the chores: hoeing, hauling in wood for the fire, and tending the cow, the pig, and the chickens. Everyone in the family must pitch in to make sure there's food on the table every day.When Jody desperately wants to take in an orphaned fawn as a pet, his father agrees, even though the fawn will need to drink some of their precious milk. Jody rescues the fawn and loves it as he's never loved anything.As time goes on, the boy has to take on a greater share of the work. Even though he's busy, Jody delights in watching the fawn grow, and the two of them play together as the best of friends. However, the family's troubles mount when Jody's father is seriously injured. Then Jody faces, not just hard work, but the most difficult decision of his life.The author's knowledge of farming, hunting, and the habits of animals is amazingly detailed. You'd think she herself lived that hardscrabble life of half a century earlier (The Yearling was published in 1938).Rawlings has woven together a powerful story and a rich and detailed world into a profound vision of the joy and pain of life. She's an amazing writer: the final sentence, which captures the theme of the novel, is a poetic image that pierced my heart.This was written in a time when the pace of storytelling was slower than today's novels. This and the detailed descriptions could be off-putting to some young readers, but lovers of literature, whatever their age, will revel in her prose and be moved by the compelling story."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"A wonderful coming of age story with complex characters and universal themes. I loved it all - the end was tough to read (I was sniffling in the doctor's office!) A must read for all who appreciate historical novels and literary classics. Very well-written - it transcends time and place!"},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"The Yearling continues to inspire our family. For three generations, fathers in our family have read this story beside the warmth of the family hearth, yet amid the vivid swirling of life experienced thereby. A boy long ago really isn't any different from me. He learns about life and reality amid idyllic beauty of character development, landscape and feelings. My children, as I at my fathers knee, longed for the special time that &quot;dad&quot; would share this family treasure, together.My children already are arguing about who gets to inherit the copy my dad gave me when I was twelve."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"Jody is a young boy living in Florida on Baxter Island with Ma and Pa Baxter. The nearest neighbors are the Forresters on Forrester Island, that family consists of Ma and Pa Forrester and Lem , who is always picking fightsBuck-wheel, and Jody's best friend- Fodderwing. Each family has to hunt and raise livestock to survive. The trouble is the bears and wolves kill their livestock, so it is a fight for survival. One day Jody is out with his father, and his father (Pa Baxter) gets bitten by a rattler snake. To survive he shoots a doe to put it's liver on the bite. Jody notices a fawn under the tree behind the place where the doe lie dead. Pa is soon cured, Jody tells his family about the fawn. Jody had always wanted a pet and this was his only chance to have an excuse so he asks his ma and pa if he can keep it. He is allowed to keep it if he can find it again. When he finds it he goes to Fodderwing to have him name it, but when he gets there Fodderwing is dead. The fawn was named Flag, in Fodderwing's honer. In time Flag and Jody develop an unforgettable and trusting friendship. But what is this talk of Flag eating the crops and is he as bad as the wild animals? Why do they say Jody needs to shoot him, and will he? The author writes as if she were Jody and has had the exact same situation. This is very exciting and wonderful book. &quot;Jody wandered west with Flag beside him. He carried Penny's shot gun over his shoulder. His heart beat and stopped and beat again. He said under his breath, 'I'll not do it. I'll just not.' He stopped in the road. He said out loud, 'They can't make me do it.' Flag looked at him with big eyes, then bent his head to a wisp of grass by the roadside. Jody walked on again slowly, 'I'll not. I'll just not. They kin beat me. They can kill me. I'll not' &quot; (Rawlings, 104) The Yearling is an outstanding story that touched me deeply. I would recommend this book to anyone 14+ and especially anyone that has a deep relationship with a pet and had to deal with death. Nicole"},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"This book is great for the whole family. Although the book has some touching moments it is a must! Rawlings did an excellent job on describing the plot as well as the charactors. Jody Baxter is a very young and immature boy when the book opens. He has no friends, yet wants some. He is troubled by many deaths and usully has nothing to do. One day when Jody and Penny, Jodys dad, are hunting Penny is bit by a snake. Penny has to kill a deer for it's antitoxin. Jody feel really bad to let the yearling deer alone to die.Jody brings it home and cares for it. After a while the deer is causing too much of a problem for the family to handle. I personly recomend you read this book!!!"},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"Rawlings' poingnant portrayal of settlement life in the Florida backwoods of the late 19th century is a true children's classic (Kid and Animal theme) but for adults as well. Young Jody Baxter-- only child of a gentle father and an embittered mother--longs to have a pet to love, something which belongs exclusively to him. But the family is dirt poor on their &quot;island&quot; in the swampy pine forest; there is no money for frills or food for pets. In fact, all human and animal folk have their appointed tasks and purpose--the battle is just staying alive.When Jody's Pa kills a doe to provide antitocsin from a snake bite, Jody feels that the family owes something to the vulnerable, orphaned fawn. Despite Ma's dire predictions and negative outlook, Pa grants him permission to raise the fawn, later named Flag. During the year the family struggles against weather and varmints--of the two-and four-legged varieties. But Flag's playful antics gradually become more serious risks to their food supply and fragile economic system. Things reach a crisis point when Flag destroys their second corn crop; someone is going to starve and Ma grimly reminds Pa that it is Not going to be her family!This novel builds in emotional tension to the inevitable crisis scene and Jody's turmoil, as he comes of age in a bitter confrontation of reality. Rawlings includes vivid scenes of the Florida flora and fauna before they were bulldozed or hunted out of existence. Privately Jody often wonders about the mysterious legend of the ghostly Conquistador--with only the swaying Spanish moss left as a reminder of his passing. Despite the difficulty navigating the homespun dialect, this book is an excellent read for the plot alone. Yet the discerning reader will appreciate this intensely personal drama of the human heart, torn between life and loyalties."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"Want to experience the Florida under the layers of concrete and Mickey Mouse ears? Read this book. The era is just after the Civil War when Florida had no lights or electric guitars. The story is poignant and real and though not for young children, young adults and teenagers will, for the most part enjoy it. A mature reader will learn about the flora and fauna of the area without realizing it and will certainly enjoy Ms. Rawlings gift. The characters are diverse and rich and I especially enjoyed the Forresters. If you are in a great hurry, or if you want to be artifically stimulated by high speed chases or chariots taveling at warp speed, then don't pick it up. But if you have never been to Florida, and you want to see the sun sparkling on a blue green spring surrounded by giant oaks with moss swaying on an April breeze, then read THE YEARLING and just close your eyes."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"The book The Yearling is a very interesting book.

Some parts are OK, but there is too much description of the plants and animals, and of so miniscule relevancy to the storyline."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I was quite surprised that this book really isn't written for children. It is an adult book. I found it interesting, with incredible information on how the pioneers of Florida lived. I almost didn't finish the book, however, because there was so much killing (of animals). By the end of the story when the deer has to be killed, it doesn't seem to matter anymore"},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"My Review of the YearlingDo you enjoy reading books that involve suspense, thrilling hunting chases, conflict, and love? Then The Yearling is the right book for you. The Yearling's main characters are Jody, Ma (Ory), and Pa (Penny) Baxter. The Baxter family farms for a living and they barely get by with the meager rations they obtain from their crops and hunting.Because life in South Central Florida is tough, Ma Baxter is very concerned about not having enough to survive. It has made her be insensitive and she is strict with Jody and does not have a good relationship with him. On the other hand Penny Baxter is more laid back and relaxed and Jody gets along wit him just fine.The Forresters are the Baxter's neighbors. They have an easier life than the Baxters because they are wealthier and don't have to work as hard as the Baxters to survive. Jody is a friend with one of the Forresters' sons. His name is Fodder-wing and he is a cripple. Although Fodder-wing cannot do all the things other boys his age can do, he has a way with animals. Jody is also fond of animals and visits Fodder-wing and his many pets as often as he can.Jody wishes he could have something to call his own like Fodder-wing's animals, but Ma will not allow it. When Penny shoots a doe and its fawn is left all alone, Jody cannot help to feel sorry for it. So he begs Penny to let him keep it. Penny agrees and Jody goes into the woods to find it. Finally Jody has something to call his own.I think The Yearling is an interesting book. The author tells the account so well because she actually lived in South Central Florida for a while. She is very good writer. She uses descriptive words to make the book come alive. Although the book is very well written it is hard to understand and is annoying to read when the characters talk. They have a strong accent and use horrible grammar. Still the book is very well written.My favorite part of the book is when Jody and Penny go hunting. It is very interesting to read and makes you want to keep reading to find out what happens next. It feels like you're right next to the Baxter's hunting dogs chasing a bear or a deer through the woods.In this book there is conflict between families, sickness, death, and fighting to name some of the not so happy parts of the book. But on the brighter side there is Jody and his fawn that he loves so much. During the book Jody watches as his fawn becomes a yearling and Penny watches as Jody becomes a man.By: Nick Nendel465 words"},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I grew up on books that told stories of rural children who found kinship with nature and the animals within it. However, for some reason, I never read The Yearling until I was in my 20s. I am sorry that I waited so long. This book enveloped me to the point where I almost became part of the story. Maybe that is because I grew up rural, and found my happiness and contentment among nature, like Jody and his father do. Jody's father is a very admirable character. He struggled through terrible adversity while growing up, yet is a very caring and soft-spoken father to his only child. He wants to give Jody an enjoyable childhood because he never had one. That is the basic premise of this book. A young boy making the bumpy transition between childhood and adulthood. He wants both, but in the end, must choose. Even before reading the book, you know that the boy will have a pet deer, but that doesn't enter the story until at least halfway through the book. And I feel that is only a small part of the main plot. There is much more to reflect upon than just the boy-deer friendship. One final note: Another fun part of this book is locating on a map all of the landmarks in Central Florida mentioned in the story. That makes the story seem even more real. The Florida in this book is much different than the Florida of today though."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I believe that &quot;The Yearling&quot; is an excellent book. It is about a young boy named Jody Baxter who really wants a pet but his parents cannot allow him.

Its an excellent book for the whole family! READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"This book became monotonous to an extent that all the characters such as Jody and Pa Baxter were doing is hoeing the corn and hunting. All it did was a chain that was event:description, event:description, etc. We are talking long discriptions too, it takes the author like a chapter to describe how to plow a field. Maybe I am exaggerating a little but that is how it seemed at times. It was also a slow start, but it did progress as the story continued. Overall it was an ok read and contained wonderful dialect and the overall story line, characters and plot was well developed. It also portrayed a vivid setting for the story to take place in."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I really hated this book.

In 'The Yearling', after the boy befriends a deer, he slaughters it for some convoluted moral reason to save his father. This book is like all those lame LA TV dramas that focus on and almost glorify dysfunctional families and tweaked social problems- it is like that because it insists on focusing on a plot which starts out 'normal' and decent, then ends up morally twisted and tweaked. Worse, it takes place on a backwater farm and is just plain long and boring. I could care less about this little boy petting his deer in the golden meadow of banal town, USA, only to succumb to some lame and twisted idea that by slaughtering his new found animal friend his poor sick papa will live. ..."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"...I had never really encountered a \\"bad\\" book...until I read The Yearling. I found The Yearling to be extremely slow paced and it bored me to my wits end. The book seemed to be written for a seven year old, always taking time out of the story to interupt and explain things that didn't need to be explained, if you were following the story. (which was sometimes difficult due to the fact that I would frequently catch myself falling asleep while reading it) For example in the beginning of the book the author took seven pages to explain that the little boy,Jody,was building a flutter-mill. Now They explain along the way what a flutter-mill is, but then after they use the 7 pages to describe him building one, they also felt it was nessecary to stop and tell us yet again, what it is, just in case that we missed it the first few times.

Otherwise it can be very dull and boring. There is very little excitemement. The deer(yearling) does not come into the book until like page 250. I had to read this for school.Let's just say that this book is not the best and not the worst."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"It is not hard to see why this modern masterpiece was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1938. It was made into a classic movie starring Gregory Peck as Penny Baxter and was illustrated by the legendary N.C Wyeth. They would not have exhausted their immense talents on a mediocre book (as some of the reviews have expressed- were they reading the same book as me?).The story is beautifully crafted and it flows effortlessly. The homespun language is quaint and is perfect for the book (which is set in the late 1800s). The author knew the intricacies of nature in Florida and described it with exactness and beauty. There are many sections of the book that are filled with warm humor and lightheartedness. The deep closeness between the father and son is touching as well as the love between the husband and wife.Life was a tough stuggle then and it is brought out with great skill. Rawlings was a master of timing and decriptions.(For those high school students who were forced to read the book- read it again in ten years. I felt the same way about \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\". In high school I hated it. Later in life- I loved it. Maturity adds a lot to any book).There is one aspect of the book that is a little hard to believe- grown men getting up in the middle of the night to play their music on guitars and so forth- stark naked- in front a of a young neighbor- but that is only thing in the entire novel.N.C. Wyeth's illustrations are perfect for the story. His use of strong directional lighting is fabulous. I would recommend the Scribner Classic (hardcover)with his illustrations in it.Rawlings lived in the heart of the Florida woods in the winter time and was a keen observer of nature and men. I think I learned more about hunting from this book than from any other source.Because this book lacks sex, extreme violence, aliens or risque humor- perhaps it seems dull to some- but it is for those very reasons that I was enthralled with it. Imagine a book filled with brilliant writing, a complex plot which is weaved by a consummate artist and many secondary adventures all which fortify the plot and without one tinge of cussing!This book deserves ten stars not five."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I remember checking The Yearling out of the library when I was 10 or 11. I read the first few pages and was so intimidated by the length of the novel that I returned it to the library two weeks later...unread. My loss. I just finished reading this book and it is a beautiful, poignant, rich story that I will hold in my heart forever. I appreciated Rawlings' detailed descriptions and her extensive character development. I felt like I was really there in the Florida scrub experiencing everything that Jody experienced. Jody's love for Flag is so lovely, touching, beautiful...and familiar. Have you ever had a pet whom you loved more than anyone else in the world and would do anything for? There is no other love like it...it is true devotion. The scene where Jody meets Flag is so enthralling that I wanted to read it over and over. I felt like I knew each character and I became so attached to Jody and Flag and their devoted friendship that I wept in more places than one.Although I think this is an excellent book for children and adults, I'm not sure that there are many teenagers who will appreciate it. It is a harsh story in places, but it is not so much the harshness that I'm talking about. This book is about a time when people were more at one with nature and life was simple and slow-moving. There are no explosions, no sex, no swearing and no gratuitous violence. I loved the novel for those reasons. To many young people, this may spell \\"boring\\". Although I would have loved this story at any time in my life, had I read it when I was a teenager, I would have never had the patience for the rich detail. Now, I savor it. I loved the story for its slow-moving, simplicity and detail and because it was a total break from the warp speed and superficiality of today.This is actually the best book I've ever read, and definitely the most touching. I can't wait to have children old enough to read it together with them. This is an unforgettable coming-of-age story...I think you have to have come of age yourself to really appreciate the landscape that Jody traverses with his cherished friend and where it brings him. I'm so glad I took the time to read this wonderful book and really savor it. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read; the characters are vivid, the story is engrossing, the depiction of life in a remote rural area is authentic. But even though the relationship between a young boy and his pet deer plays a primary role this book does not strike me as being a &quot;children's&quot; book. It is lengthy and contains adult themes more suitable for a book meant for more mature readers. Death, extreme hardship, starvation, attempted murder...this a kiddy story? I dismissed reading this book years ago because I thought, oh well, the story of a boy and his deer, ho hum, not interested. Well, this book has MUCH more depth than that. The review by younger readers who proclaim this book &quot;boring&quot; are not old enough to appreciate it. I would recommend this book to anyone mature enough to understands it's appeal and deeper meaning."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"This classic novel was written by an author who wrote it at her home a few miles south of Gainesville (in Cross Creek, Florida) and it won the 1939 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. It is about life in rural central Florida in the second half of the 19th century, being centered around a boy (Jody Baxter), his family, and his pet fawn (Flag). Throughout the novel, the reader sees a boy growing up and having to face some tough decisions. We also learn much about the natural history, environment, folk remedies and beliefs, and culture of rural Florida. We also learn how precarious one's existence is out in the wild. Jody's father, Penny Baxter, has to kill a doe in order to use a folk remedy for a snake bite, not knowing that there is a little fawn nearby. Jody keeps the fawn to raise and to have as a friend. But, as the fawn grows older, problems arise. The author based her main characters loosely (very loosely) on a rural family she knew living in central Florida. Contrary to most reports, this family did not live in Cross Creek. They had a small place deep in the woods in the center of what is now the Ocala National Forest. I decided to see if I could find that site in the late 1980s. It turned out not be difficult at all. Armed with a map of the National Forest, I went on a hike (on some beautiful trails) and found the place. Nothing remains of the house. However, the family burial plot is still there, as are the graves of most of the members of the family. Unfortunately, it is sad to report that a number of the headstones have been stolen. Some of the stones referred to Civil War veterans. As you probably know, such stones draw very good prices on the \\"black market.\\" The Forest Service had signs posted to warn people against stealing items but, being deep in the woods, they were taken anyway. I'm certain that the people who took the stones have no idea of their literary significance. Perhaps one day the Forest Service or some historical organization will replace the stones, but with all the cutbacks in funding, it'll probably be a long time before that happens."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I originally wasn't planning to write another review for amazon.com, but the movie of \\"The Yearling\\" was on TV last night. Remembering how it touched me, especially the sorrowful end, I decided to take a look at the reviews posted here.Most were brilliant, right to the point, and then I saw \\"kid's review\\" and a few others that found the book boring.Sorry, children, that in an age of Paris Hilton and Lindsey Lohan, not to mention strumpets like Britney and Jessica Simpson you don't have the chance to come of age. Or to appreciate a classic, moving read. Yes, we're an image and media-driven society, and the negative effect of it all falls on these kids who not only hate a classic, but can't even write why they hate it in a meaningful review.This the price we are paying when our kids can't feel struggle, pity, or hurt.\\"The Yearling\\" was a very realistic tale of the life of a poor American family struggling to make ends meet in late 19th Century Florida, and of a boy who like many today, doesn't understand that there is bitter besides the sweet in life - especially when it comes to the loss of a beloved pet. I can only wish that some of the sorry weirdos who have recently murdered schoolchildren or another weirdo denizen of Florida had read this book, or the Twain and Jack London classics when they were children. They might have learned something good and moral beyond the twisted thoughts that they came of age with.This book, along with the aforementioned Twain and London classics, \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\", and Bill Bennett's \\"Book of Virtues\\" should belong on the bookshelf of any and all American mid-and upper-elementary school age children.I teach 6th grade and I would not hesitate in recommending this book or any of the classics that I grew up reading to my students."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"This is a classic that is more special for the portrayal of the subsistence life of the Baxters in the wildlands of Florida in the late nineteenth century, than it is for the tear-jerking climax.The Baxters consist of pre-teen Jody, his small but sturdy father, Penny, and his ample curmudgeon of a mother, mostly referred to as Ma Baxter. Jody is high on life, as his existence is filled with the wonders of nature and the love of his family. But he feels lonely, too, and when he gets the opportunity to own an orphaned fawn, it seems that his life is suddenly complete. But the long months that follow are full of excitement and drama, underlined by the constant battle against starvation that the Baxters must wage to survive.It is very exciting and satisfying to read about the life the Baxters lead, where food means life, and a good relationship with one's neighbors can spell the difference between feast and famine. The only neighbors the Baxters have in this case is the Forresters, a large family of large men that alternates between being a source of comfort and of danger. Other than the Forresters, the only human contact comes when a day is spent traveling to town.The relationships between the characters in this book, presented very realistically and within the context of a whole range of moral issues, are the meat of this story. The readers join Jody in wavering between loving and hating the people around him. This is far closer than most books ever get to real life.This is also a compelling coming-of-age story, in which Jody moves from boyhood to manhood. After being faced with rattlesnake attacks, devastating floods, death and hunger, he has gained the experience necessary to stomach the world as it is. This loss of childhood is strongly felt, especially when it is seen through the eyes of Penny, who has done nothing but attempt to shelter his son from the harsher side of life.The story of the yearling fawn itself is less heartbreaking because the book is so realistic. There is no one moment when a child becomes an adult, and we are led to understand that Jody has been shaped by a range of experiences, of which the yearling is only one part.The stories of outdoor living will be captivating to any nature lovers, and the tough pioneer lifestyle that makes use of everything at hand is likewise interesting. Under constant threat from bear, panther, alligator and wolf, there is an unrelenting pressure on the Baxter family, and we see which human characteristics are necessary to survive life in the wild.The writing is terrific, particularly in the areas of dialogue and describing natural settings. The plot is meandering, oftentimes throwing a curve ball when you least expect it. This, too, recreates a believable semblance of life.If you want a book with heart and a satisfying ending that has something to say about the lives we live, pick up The Yearling. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"Every time someone refers to Children's literature as a genre less worthwhile than general fiction or Children's authors as second-class writers, I bring up this book. The Yearling was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.The Yearling is a coming of age book set in the hard-scrabble scrub of Florida around the turn of the century. It is filled with the embarrassment and delight felt by a 12-year-old boy named Jody Baxter. One minute, Jody whirls faster and faster, arms held straight from his shoulders like a water-turkey's wings, until he becomes dizzy and drops to the ground, and then the next, he longs to follow his father, mix with men, and learn their ways.The Florida in this story is as much frontier as was the Wild West. This is a Florida unimagined by all those children who visit Orlando. This is a Florida inhabited by panthers that have cubs with blue spots, by bears that walk upright down the road like men, and by whooping cranes that dance cotillions in the marshes. This is a Florida where one's nearest neighbor lives four miles away, and a family has to work constantly to have enough food to survive another winter.Jody and each of his parents face these hardships differently. The story begins on a day when Jody is just a boy, addled with April and dizzy with Spring. He is the youngest and only surviving Baxter child. Jody thrived when one frail baby after another had sickened and died, almost as fast as they came. Jody's mother seems to have given &quot;all she had of love and care and interest to those others.&quot; Jody's father is &quot;a bulwark for the boy against the mother's sharpness.&quot;&quot;Leave him kick up his heels and run away,&quot; the father thinks. &quot;Leave him build his flutter-mills. The day'll come, he'll not even care to.&quot;Jody forgets his work and makes mistakes but his father covers for him. The boy's only problem seems to be loneliness, but even that is eased when his parents allow him to keep an orphaned fawn. The fawn and the boy grow up, becoming yearlings together. By the end of one year, Jody has sat up all night at his best friend's wake, been beaten for helping another friend against three bullies, become enemies with his neighbors over their burning an old woman's home, and tried to run away only to realize there is nowhere else he wants to be. He learns love and disappointment, as well as the fallibility of his father. Jody learns that life is &quot;powerful fine, but 'tain't easy.&quot; And knowing all this, Jody enters manhood, leaving childhood. However,&quot;A mark was on him from [that first April] day's delight, so that all his life, when April was a thin green and the flavor of rain was on his tongue, an old wound would throb and a nostalgia would fill him for something he could not quite remember.&quot;Note on reading level classification:While this book is listed as a Young Adult Reading Level book, I read the book when I was in the fifth grade and would recommend it to children of that age level or above. While a certain amount of maturity and emotional sophistication is required in order for the reader to fully understand and appreciate the issues raised in the book, my eleven-year-old daughter had no trouble doing so, and in fact, she was deeply moved by the story. Our family read the book aloud to one another during a week's vacation in a log cabin the mountains. It was a wonderful and rare experience to share this book in that remote location with no telephone nor TV to distract us.Reviewed by Linda MurphyChildren's Editor of the Writers Hood"},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I read this book as a young person while still in school. Now, while picking some books for a 10 year old nephew who is becoming an avid reader, I read it again. It is a beautiful book but it made me cry at 74 as well as when I first read it at about 14. I now live close to the Rawlings home in Cross Creek and have a keener apreciation of the setting but the writing itself is what makes the book. Of course the story represents another era and a poor southern family but the characterizations are well drawn and universal. Fodderwing and his family are people that every young person should meet.Just as the opening words, to my mind, of \\"Mr. Roberts\\" transcend good writing and are superb, so the final few sentences of \\"The Yearling\\" speak to me in universal terms about youth and \\"where has it all gone?\\""},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"This book has such great memories for me.

Yes, it's language is of an un-educated family from the 1930's, but that one of the things that makes this book so rich. We keep our history in books such as this, and we remember coming of age ourselves.

This year old fawn will not only become his best friend, but it will help him learn to become a man. During the course of this heart-warming novel, Jody has witnessed both human tragedy and the violent course of nature. This is a wonderful book that shows the relation of man to nature and the curves that nature can throw at the human race."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I just finished reading this novel to my nine year old daughter and am amazed it was in the children's section at my local library. It is a book for adults. I am a voracious reader and would certainly put it among my top 100 novels. I was able to explain the significance of what was happening to my daughter as we went along and although this stretched out the time it took us for it's completion, it worked out as a very rewarding experience for us both. I do not think this book should be forced on children to read, it's over most of there heads and could turn them off to reading the classics when they mature. Moby Dick has destroyed many the want to read from forced exposure (I myself loved it, but did not pick it up until my thirties)"},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"This has been a favorite of mine, since being &quot;required&quot; to read it in grade school. The version I read then, had some of the more violent scenes edited out, such as the fist fight.As an adult I re-read the full version, and was just as enthralled as ever. I have since passed this story to my four sons. Each of them agree it is one of the best books they have ever read.My sons are avid readers, and have read C. S. Lewis, Steven King and many other famous and popular authors. For them to be impressed so deeply by this story is a testament to the quality and depth of this truly classic book."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I have lived in North Florida nearly all my life, but it takes a book like The Yearling to make me come to my senses concerning how our state has changed due to development and its contributions. Rawlings's book is highly adventurous despite its realistic nature. And, of course, the final chapters will touch any person who truly has a soul. However. I feel that the strongest emphasis the book should make today is how it focuses on man's relationship to the land. As a teacher, I will use this book to show students how the land was once used and respected. I think that The Yearling is a book that every student in Florida should read and know; I also think that those wishing to see Florida should read this book so that their visit is not daunted by the Mickey Mouse atmosphere that covers much of Florida these days. The Yearling, in my opinion, is one of the most beautiful books ever written."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I thought this was an excellent book.

The main theme of the novel is the maturing of Jody from childhood to boyhood through his fawn &quot;Flag&quot;. This historical fiction also captures the hand-to-mouth existence of frontier families of this time period. One day Jody's father Penny is bitten by a rattlesnake. To draw out the venom, Penny shoots a doe and uses the liver as a poultice. Jody realizes that the doe had a concealed fawn and later adopts the orphaned deer. Soon the fawn has grown to a yearling and is impossible to keep out of the Baxter's crops. What will happen to the mischievous yearling Flag? I liked this novel because its setting involves nature and the outdoors. Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings used excellent figurative language. Similes such as, &quot;He felt as foolish as a bird dog caught chasing field mice,&quot; and hyperboles such as, &quot;A 'coon'll bite one more time after he's dead,&quot; made the story more vivid. It was easy to empathize with the characters since I am a twelve-year-old boy who loves animals and the outdoors. This book is a four star work. The only reason it does not muster five stars is because the beginning chapters move so slowly. A prodigious work, it is worth finishing."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"The symbolism runs deep in this excellent novel. The yearling is not the deer. Indeed not, the yearling is Jody, the boy who becomes a man-- hence the events of the book transpire over the course of one year. And what a year!! Jody begins a certain year of his life as a boy-- lying beside a brook, playing with a straw paddle wheel. He is innocent, tender, naive. He and the fawn become pals, but by the end of the story, the fawn becomes a buck, and Jody becomes a man. Jody kills a part of himself in the end, but the memories of what he had been in the days of his tenderness stay with him. This is the first book that brought tears to my eyes. I cried like a baby when I read it in 7th or 8th grade as a class assignment-- which was a big deal since I was then and am now a rather unemotional male. I learned about the symbolism in college where I minored in English. Along with Castle of Wisdom by an obscure author named Rhett Ellis, The Yearling is one of the two greatest American coming-of-age stories ever written."},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"Reading Genre: The Yearling ( Historical Fiction ) My Opinion of this \\"timeless classic\\" is not very good. It did not catch my interest as well as some books and was very hard to read and understand. The plot set a good morale example, but, being a fifty year old book, it was not very exciting as standing up to my measures. If I was on a committee to vote in this book as one of the greatest novels to understand ever written, I am afraid that I would have to turn it down. Yet, some people feel differently and that is why we have opinions. I also would have to say, in a more positive respect, that the book did set a very good , almost realistic, example of life in the wilderness and the hardships one might face. That, I am afraid, is my opinion of \\"The Yearling\\". The author, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, is the author of several other novels, as well as a memoir, Cross Creek, which inspired the acclaimed motion picture of the same name. Coincidentally she lived for twenty-five years in Cross Creek, Florida, which is the setting of The Yearling. She was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1939 for this novel. She lived from 1896-1953 and was a true figure in Historical Fiction. A short synopsis of the book would probably go something like this. In the backwoods of Florida there lives a poor family with a young child named Jody. One day while Jody is hunting with his father Penny for a bear named \\" OLE' Slewfoot \\" Penny is bitten on the arm by a rattlesnake. Penny quickly kills a grazing doe and uses the liver to remove the poison from his wound. Jody discovers that the doe had a fawn and quickly convinces his father to let him keep the yearling. Jody is forced t decide on the fate of his beloved fawn, whom he has named \\"Flag\\", after it grows and continues to eat the poor families hard earned crops. Jody's mother accidentally shoots the fawn and Jody runs away believing that his mother intended to. The books main theme is of facing difficult times and pulling through them. Jody faces the death of a neighbor friend named Fodder-Wing, the death of his beloved pet, the near-death of his father, and also, his own near death experience when he runs away from home. All in all the book morally right. A look at the characters of the story would reveal: Jody himself has love and compassion for all living things; his mother has become withdrawn and cold after the deaths of her children. Fodder-Wing is very weak in physical health and in poor health, but has a God-given gift to communicate with wildlife. Fodder-Wing's older brothers on the other hand, are the epitome' of brawn, strength, and good health; but how they love their little brother! The fawn \\"Flag\\" Was extremely memorable. But although \\"Flag's\\" ending was very tragic, to say the least, it was nesscessary to the completion to Jody's character. Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings writing is very hard to understand, considering it was written long before my generation. She writes in a very expressive style and includes, what I assume, all of her thoughts and feelings into the book. As well as going into strong details on a lot of things I feel like was unnecessary to the book. I was not very suprised when I found out that this book was not written for children, but for adults. Her writing could be described as VERY descriptive and almost script like. She had a very good knack for writing, just not to my taste. Her writing seems almost unnatural to me. I would almost certainly not recommend this to anyone under the age of sixteen. -Justin Newman"},{"Title":"The yearling,","review":"I give this one 5 stars. It's one of the best books of its kind that I have ever read. I missed reading it when I was young and now I am glad that I did. Reading it at 50+ years of age, I think I appreciate it more than I would of at 12 or 13 and if you notice these reviews, that's the age of most of those giving the book 1 star. That's somewhat understandable though as this book is often required reading in school, and books you're assigned and tested on never go down as well as the ones you pick up on your own.As I understand it, Rawlins did not specifically write this book targeted at what's now called the young adult market. I don't believe that market had really come into its own back in the 1930s. I think she intended it for adult readers and maybe that's the reason for the length, which can intimidate some younger readers (heck, I almost wondered if I wanted to deal with it when I first picked it up). But her description of life in the Florida back country in the years immediately following the American Civil War is so meticulously put together that a person may not really appreciate it until they have read a lot of books. She obviously did a great deal of research on the flora and fauna of the region, and from what I gather even went on an actual bear hunt to gather information for her book. The dialog is a foreign to us today, and even some of the words may not be familiar (e.g. how many kids today know what a 'shoat' is?). But you get used to it the further you get into the book, and I found some of the dialog between Penny and Ory (his wife) almost comical in places.By the way, I did read one letter somewhere in this group from a 12 year old who had given the book 1 star after complaining that his teacher read this book out loud to the class over several weeks time. For shame, if I had to listen to this book read aloud every day by a teacher I'd probably rate it 1 star too.For now though, The Yearling is definitely on my 'reread before I die' list and has been placed on the shelf alongside my collection of Hemingways in my Florida room."},{"Title":"One Two ThreeInfinity","review":"This book set me on the road to becoming an engineer - ME, 1958.

Desde esa perspectiva podemos darnos cuenta que la trama describe claramente lo que hoy en d&iacute;a se conoce como realidad virtual. Este aspecto ya resulta fascinante, pero eso no es todo. Bioy Casares se propuso escribir una novela que conservara el ritmo y llamara el inter&eacute;s del lector. En este punto es comparable con muchos buenos libros policiales de la &eacute;poca. Para lograr este resultado sostuvo una serie de entrevistas con Jorge Luis Borges, quien lo asesor&oacute; en diversos aspectos del desarrollo (adem&aacute;s escribi&oacute; el prologo que acompa&ntilde;&oacute; al libro en numerosas ediciones). Por otro lado el libro tambi&eacute;n trata de una fuga y de la soledad que debe soportar un hombre, quien siendo libre se encuentra a&uacute;n m&aacute;s atrapado que dentro de una carcel. Esta paradoja hace de este libro uno de los mejores ejemplo de una novela de ficci&oacute;n que se hayan producido en Argentina. El desenlace es tan inesperado como original y la prosa empleada es tan maravillosa que el libro se desarrolla como una pel&iacute;cula dentro de la mente del lector.

Si no ha leido el libro corre el riesgo de perderse el gusto de descubrir la trama por si mismo.La Invencion de Morel es una novela muy audaz e interesante que explora entre varios temas los limites de la realidad y el aislamiento de un hombre con la sociedad. El lector con basico conocimiento de filosofia tambien encontrara semejanzas con el Mito de la Cueva de Platon. El modernismo de esta novela no le deja un solo significado claro; habra distintas interpretaciones basadas en las subjetividades de cada uno. Hay bastante madera en el libro para justificar varios puntos de vista distintos.El narrador no tiene nombre (lo cual interpreto que es casi un \\"nadie\\" para si mismo) y por las primeras muchas paginas se interpreta como un esquizofrenico. Luego vemos que su percepcion de la realidad era la correcta y el movil de su vida es apalear una vieja y terrible soledad con una mujer que no esta, y nunca estara. Pero la trama se extiende muy larga y cansa el tono chillon del narrador; no hay momentos de humor ni de esperanza, solo un monotono de quejas y desesperacion. Esto lo que el autor quiso para el narrador, pero esto no hace agradable la carga para el lector de 91 paginas de quejas, quejas y quejas. Es dificil empatizar con el narrador.El final: desgarrador. El narrador encuentra la forma de vivir al ritmo de las repetitivas secuencias de Faustine, y al memorizar las pausas y los pasos de sus dias el narrador consigue una semblanza teatral de normalidad, pero es todo, y lo mas tragico es que con eso esta conforme. Su pedido a un futuro cientifico en la ultima linea rompe el alma.Termine la novela hoy y quizas en unos dias tenga mejor opinion de ella, ahora solo me animo a darle 3 1/2 (Amazon no deja usar fracciones y prefiero darle cuatro que tres). La Invencion de Morel tiene afan de sonar mas profunda y sabia de lo que es y no me sorprende el leer que Don Adolfo solo tenia 26 primaveras cuando la escribio, se nota esto. Tambien se extiende mas alla de lo que debe; realmente pudo haber sido mas corta sin sacrificar nada. Jorge Luis Borges (mi autor favorito) le da demasiado credito; no es para nada una novela \\"perfecta\\". Obviamente las alabanzas hiperbolicas para libros escritos por amigos son cosa vieja.Muy recomendable para el lector paciente y con cierto grado de sofisticacion en libros.

The result was an eye-opening recitation from a learned man who participated in the affairs of the world. The book did not surface in the west until 1829.The 1986 version under review here was a new translation by H.A.R. Gibb, Lecturer in Arabic at the School of Oriental Studies, University of London, reprinted by Oriental Books Reprint Corporation at Delhi, India.Gibb treats Ibn Battuta \\"as a traveler, not as a writer of geography\\" and wrote it so that \\"this extract may be of service in introducing to a wider circle of English readers one of the most remarkable travelers of his own or any age.\\"In this work he does the job. The prose is easy to read and comprehend. Gibb's translation does not interfere with Ibn Battuta's narrative style. You believe that it is Ibn Battuta whom you are hearing as you read. The notations throughout the book, as endnotes, are scholarly, although the maps, all by the author, are a little hard to read. There is also an index of names and places, but there is no general index.The stimulus for Battuta's travels stemmed from the \\"duty laid upon every Muslim of visiting Mecca at least once in his lifetime, so long as it lies within his power to do so.&quot;\\"He was in fact the only medieval traveler who is known to have visited the lands of every Muhammadan ruler of his time,\\" in addition to travels in non-Islamic Turkey, Ceylon, and China. His account of the Maldives \\"is the earliest descriptive account we possess of the islands and their inhabitants.\\"His pilgrimage in Ceylon to the top of the high mountain known as Adam's Peak is a place unique in the world. Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist alike revere this as the location of the imprint in black rock of the foot of Adam, or a Hindu god, or Buddha, according to their respective beliefs. The reported footprint is over eight feet long.His account of a cowrie exchange in Malli (Mali) alongside the salt exchange there \\"showed the existence of extensive trade between West Africa and East Africa, as cowrie shells are found only in East Africa.\\" It should also be noted that Gibb gives a brief but helpful account here \\"of the early negro (sic) empires\\" in West Africa in an extensive endnote.\\"The extent of his wanderings is estimated at not less than 75,000 miles without allowing for deviations, a figure which is not likely to have been surpassed before the age of steam.\\"We are lucky to have this translation. It reveals a perspective that could have been lost, were it not for Battuta's keen eye, the royal Moroccan and his scribe, and Gibbs.A.D.Saunders August 8, 2000 ++++++++"},{"Title":"The five clocks (International journal of American linguistics)","review":"This book is an example of how to write a text explaining English usage.

Trent, sometimes a name used for Lance Kilkenny is one of the most interesting heroes created by L'amour, perhaps the ultimate warrior-like person who could ever be created by one of the greatest authors ever lived and contributed. There is one thing that Bantam Book and L'amour's offsprings didn't do yet. They should line up the whole works of L'amour and mark the 1, 2, 3 numbers for the readers to follow. Like Sackett saga, they should tell the reader to start reading from &quot;To The Far Blue Mountain&quot;, then, &quot;Jubal Sackett&quot;, then which one should be read first about Tell Sackett, Orrion, or Tyrel Sackett. Readers picking up and finising a book and found out that should come later after the other ones is so annoying and frustrated. If there is a character who would appear again and again as a certain series, the publisher and the heir of L'amour should mark them clearly. Like I've read Tell finally lost his wife, Angee, and then the next one I've picked up was Angee was still alive, because this is the one I should have read first, but without knowing it is such an annoying mixup."},{"Title":"The Rider of the Ruby Hills","review":"L'amour is always dependable for a good read with realistic people.

This one was an audiobook I listened to this time. The reader was good, better than average for a Louie L'Amour reader and he had a flavor of the old west in his speech, I liked that. And the story started promising but faded toward the end with little more to like about the main characters than first described.Story goes like this, lone rider rides into town from off the plains, see's the woman he's goin' ta marry, determines the land he's goin' ta own, runs into the city-slicker and the other men he's gonna hav' ta kill and goes about takin' care of business. A formula I like really, but in other Louie L'amour books it's been done so much better.Of recent stories I've read or heard I'd suggest Crazy Man, The Lonely Men, or Mojave Crossing for a better read.

When she arrives at court for his sister's wedding Mike believes she is his kismet soulmate. Now to persuade the obstinate Yank that she is his queen and the upcoming double wedding ceremony should be expanded to a triple.Holly Jacobs' \\"Royal Invasion\\" has been a fun lighthearted trilogy starring delightful protagonists. The final tale ONCE UPON A KING is a wonderful regal romance mindful of Roman Holiday as the audience will ponder whether Prince Mike can convince his beloved commoner that she is his queen or will she return to the Keystone State and her bookstore. Holly Jacobs provides a fine conclusion to a whimsical regal miniseries.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Once Upon A King (Silhouette Romance)","review":"Courtesy of Love Romances ReviewsHolly Jacobs has written yet another sweet romance that readers will love.Cara Phillips has a wedding to plan... a double wedding. However, this one has to be kept secret, as it is to be a private wedding. Her two best friends have found their Prince Charmings. Parker Dillon, princess of Eliason is returning home to be wed. Shey Carlson is coming also, to marry her very own Prince Tanner, Parker's former betrothed. Now only Cara remains to find love... or does she?Three months ago on a magical night back home in Erie, PA, Cara met a stranger with whom she had an immediate connection. One night of passion has resulted in a pregnancy. Believing her lover had abandoned her after a one-night stand, she is resigned to being a single mother... until she steps off the plane in Eliason and sees him.Prince Michael Dillonetti, Parker's brother, had gone to the US to bring his sister home. While there, he met a woman and it was love at first sight. He never knew her name but has been searching for her ever since. He's stunned to find his mystery woman is one of Parker's best friends. He's even more shocked to learn she's carrying his child. He vows not to let her get away again, but can he convince her he loves her and that the only answer for him is \\"happy ever after?\\"As with any book by Holly Jacobs, readers will find engaging characters that are so real one would expect to see them in town. Cara is a kind woman who is very soft spoken and would do anything for her friends. In fact, she'll help out anyone she feels is in need. Her every thought is for everyone but herself and she always willingly takes a back seat to others. When she meets Michael, AKA Mike King, she finally finds something she would go after no matter what, until the morning he disappears on her, and she believes she was nothing but a fling for him, that is. Discovering she is pregnant with his child, the unborn baby becomes the most important thing in her life.Michael fell for Cara the moment he first saw her and all he wants is her, not even knowing her name. The night they were together meant the world to him and he was crushed the next morning when he came back and she was long gone. He knows she's the only one for him and just needs to find her again. When he discovers her identity, and her secret about being pregnant, he realizes he has to convince her to stay. The effort he puts in to proving he loves her is evident to everyone but her. How these two bridge the gap between their different lives is enough to warm anyone's heart.Readers will delight in seeing that even though this story doesn't take place in Erie, many of our beloved friends from Perry Square put in an appearance. There are even some who star in their own sideline story in this book. Of course, no Perry Square book would be complete without Pearly Gates and her stories. Have no fear, she is here and so are her zany tales. She is probably one of this reviewer's favorite secondary characters of any books she has read, by any author.Sit back, relax, and get lost in this charming tale, for it is certainly a winner.Kelley A.

In the half-hour it took to read it, I learned nothing. I know this book is old so maybe it was ground-breaking for its time, but there is nothing in here that current teachers shouldn't already know. Also, the ideas described in this book are all based on a textbook-driven, lecture-centered environment. Yes, the author tells you to have students complete each step before the teacher so that there is more student work time to break up the lecture, but it still describes a traditional classroom.Give bellwork. State the objective. Ask open-ended questions. Ask why. Have other students elaborate. Have all students work on the same problem while you circulate. Have students correct their own work. Teach students how to take notes and do notebook checks. That's it. Now you don't have to buy the book.If you are stuck in a rut of a long homework correction time followed by a lecture, followed by independent practice, this book may help you, but there are many more teaching books for the same price or less that go into great detail about how to make your classes more student-centered and meaningful.This book is Teaching 101.

Moore) who coined the phrase &quot;latent inhibition.&quot; This book contains a readable and exhaustive survey of the field, a good starting point or summary. Of course much work has been done since '89 (c.f. Jeffrey Gray for an interesting direction it has gone), but recent work seems more to have grown out of this, not grown to replace it. The Conditioned Attention Theory, which Lubow presents, is still a major contender for explaining the mechanism that produces latent inhibition. It not only has implications for latent inhibition, but for the study of attention in general."},{"Title":"Poetic meter and poetic form (Random House studies in language and literature, SLL3)","review":"Fussell's foreword says that his book is for aspiring readers, not aspiring writers. But if you are an aspiring poet, I think Fussell has something to offer that is absent in most \\"handbooks\\".One of the most important things Fussell addresses is how the form of a poem affects the meaning and impression of the total poem. For example, he notes how many poetic forms are inevitably coloured by their initial or most famous use. He says regarding Tennyson's In Memoriam stanza-form, that it \\"is now so closely associated with the sturdy, serviceable elegaic atmosphere of In Memoriam itself that...its uses now seem limited to occasions which either resemble or mock the original\\" (Ch 8 The English Stanzas).Another chapter that poets will find helpful is Metrical Variations, in which Fussell examines how poets substitute variant feet to create particular effects. Or if your interest is in free verse, he devotes a chapter to examining the characteristics of successful free verse, including how line breaks create effects.This is not a substitute for a general handbook of poetry, and assumes a minimal knowledge of poetic technique, meter, &c.; But if you are serious about reading or writing poetry, I don't think you can afford to miss this book."},{"Title":"Poetic meter and poetic form (Random House studies in language and literature, SLL3)","review":"When I was 21 and in my first year of graduate school, Paul Fussell's &quot;Poetic Meter and Poetic Form&quot; was one of the first text books assigned to me. When I bought the book and saw how slim it was, I snickered, &quot;Grad school's gonna be a walk in the park!&quot;Yeah, RIGHT!This densely packed tome is not for the uninitiated and definitely not absorbed in just one reading. On and off, over the last 20 years, I have come back to this book to refresh my memory and, usually, to astonish myself. The book's real strength, besides Professor Fussell's obvious command of his subject, and his ability to convey that command, is in the sprinkling of dozens of anecdotes by and about poets about other poets and poetry. Even at this late date in my life, I can't pretend to understand the entire book but what I do understand I admire and respect. &quot;Poetic Meter and Poetic Form&quot; is not recommended to anyone studying poetry; it is urgently required."},{"Title":"Poetic meter and poetic form (Random House studies in language and literature, SLL3)","review":"This book is a classic of prosodic exposition. (And understand, when I call a book a classic, I am not just lapsing into a cliche; it really IS a classic.) Fussell shows us the relations between form and content, between rhyme and rhythm on the one hand and the function of these formal devices to illuminate meaning on the other. The book also devotes a chapter to empirical observations on the properties of free verse, and it includes a concise bibliography of other works on prosody. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Poetic meter and poetic form (Random House studies in language and literature, SLL3)","review":"This is a lucid, engaging short book on the elements of poetry listed in the title: meter and form. Fussell does not provide the kind of encyclopedic information found in many poetry &quot;handbooks&quot;; what he does offer is a basic approach to scansion and analysis, and models for using these techniques in reading and writing about poems. This is a classic text, written with a great love of formal poetry, and referred to often by students and writers of poetry. The only thing that keeps my rating under 10 is that it is fairly out of date, and there are more recent texts that cover contemporary poets and verse forms with more rigor than Fussell. But for a readable treatment of the accentual-syllabic tradition and the first century or so of free verse, this book is a gem."},{"Title":"Poetic meter and poetic form (Random House studies in language and literature, SLL3)","review":"I came across this book for my Poetic Analysis class in college.

Fussell in opinionated and unafraid to display his own taste, but I find that a good thing (uncommon in academic writing in my experience). My favorite idea of Fussell's is that for a stanza break to be merited, something must happen in the white space _between_ the stanzas: there must be a shift of register or mood.I can't wait to read his most famous book, The Great War and Modern Memory, on the literary impact of World War I."},{"Title":"Poetic meter and poetic form (Random House studies in language and literature, SLL3)","review":"This is really a fantastic book for those of us who are interested in the art form and all that entails. Namely this book focuses on how meter and forms are used to create and compliment the feelings of the poems in question. The first chapter on scansion is a bit of a boot camp (and godsend?) for those who have not been satisfied by mere wikipedia research. I must say I had a really difficult time, as both a writer and a reader, in discerning and implementing exactly the art of metrical analysis. Most of the chapters are well structured and interesting, but tend to focus on non-contemporary poetry, or even recent poetry, or poetry after 1900.That being said, Paul Fussel is somewhat of a poetic prude, as exemplified in his exclusion of a discussion on free verse (a huge literary movement that erupted in the 20th century, as I'm sure you know)until this edition; even so, the chapter on free-verse is skimpy and pretty much useless. Unfortunately, I would say it's not worth the paper it's printed on. However, this book has a lot of great ideas on poetry, and if you take it with some skepticism, it should be a wonderful companion to any lover of poetry (but check your library first)."},{"Title":"Poetic meter and poetic form (Random House studies in language and literature, SLL3)","review":"The only thing that may stop you from buying this book is the price. It's a lot for a slim paperback, and there are other options available that will tell you about formal poetic forms and meter.But if you have read any of Fussell's cultural criticism (\\"Class,\\" for example), you know that he writes with verve and wit. And if you are familiar with his excellent treatment of WWI poetry, \\"The Great War and Modern Memory,\\" you know he knows his poetry. So here, you get his informed, scholarly overview with some sharply barbed opinions along the way.This is no picnic. It is graduate school stuff. It is practicing poet stuff. But if you are serious about poetic form--in trying to understand what you read or what you want to write--you owe it to yourself to have this text at your fingertips. He shows you how a poem works for him--syllable by syllable--so that you can better appreciate the choices a poet makes (especially if you are that poet).Fussell pulls many examples from the 18th century (Pope, for example). I commend him for it. But for those who believe that poetry began with the Romantics, you may not have much appetite for Pope's \\"Essay on Man,\\" for example. Your loss. Even so, anyone who reads or writes formal poetry will want to understand its practice across the centuries. And this book gives you that understanding in a few, packed pages."},{"Title":"Poetic meter and poetic form (Random House studies in language and literature, SLL3)","review":"A handful of books I've read have imparted lessons that stuck with me for life. This is one of them. As others have said, this is a book to be studied rather than read.But the writing is so elegant that you'll enjoy the study. After you've worked your way through this book, the way you read and write will be changed forever--for prose as well as poetry--because the best prose occasionally employs the poetic techniques that Fussell explains so well.You'll read a phrase that seems particularly apt, you'll wonder why it works so well, and then it will occur to you: Why, that phrase is iambic until the last two syllables, which includes a trochaic substitution. And the trochee at the end conveys exactly the twist that the writer wanted to convey.And when you're lucky, on a good day, you'll look at a sentence you just wrote, and you'll see the same forces at work."},{"Title":"Poetic meter and poetic form (Random House studies in language and literature, SLL3)","review":"Fussell's work is fantastic...the only problems are his high handed attitude towards free verse and a general snarkiness throughout the text. But overall, a good resource."},{"Title":"Poetic meter and poetic form (Random House studies in language and literature, SLL3)","review":"Expensive isn't it! But it's the most excellent book on writing poetry and poetic form I've read. Fussell has a masterful understanding of the material and handles it with great style and insight."},{"Title":"Poetic meter and poetic form (Random House studies in language and literature, SLL3)","review":"A good introduction to the mechanics, usefulness, and limitations of scansion and rhyme forms. His examples are well-chosen and illuminating.My main beef with Fussell is that I think he puts too much stress on the limitations of convention -- on how much past use of a form shackles future use. But then, I'm a young poet with a couple bones to pick, so apply salt as needed."},{"Title":"Poetic meter and poetic form (Random House studies in language and literature, SLL3)","review":"Fussell describes how forms of poetry define and focus the poem. He does this really well.If I knew a really effective superlative, I'd use it here. Nothing comes to mind. Shouldn't have drunk so much.This is the best book on poetry."},{"Title":"The JFK Assassination : Dissecting The Corpus With Occam And Cassius","review":"The only reason this book rates 'one star' is because the option of 'zero stars' is not available.This book has to be one of the all-time worst books written about the assassination, right up there with the likes of 'Case Closed' and 'Final Disclosure.'Like 'Case Closed,' Hartwright's book is full of lies, deception, and misinformation.In addition, it is poorly written and contains multiple grammatical errors.The book also engages in bashing of liberals, homosexuals, Jews, Israel, and President Lyndon Johnson, just to name a few.Hartwright contends that Oswald supposedly acquired a high-tech 'exploding' bullet and intentionally loaded it as his third cartridge out of four. Any experienced assassination researcher would realize how ridiculous that theory is.Don't waste your hard-earned money on this volume of trash..."},{"Title":"The Birder's Handbook: A Field Guide to the Natural History of North American Birds","review":"This book isn't as immediately appealing as some of its competition, and its organizational scheme, and heavy use of symbols, can put you off. Use it for a week, though. I agree with another review in being mildly frustrated with its excessive use of symbols, often when a tiny printed word would have done the same work. But it's indispensible, and I'd recommend it to everyone.A number of unique choices set this one apart. At first I was somewhat irritated by the placing of broader essays on the right page next to the species descriptions on the left. Then, with long use, it became clear to me just how well that worked. It's the perfect browsing format - just right for when you go to learn more about the thing you just saw. Also, the essays are written above the individual species level, so you can start out reading about Cowbirds and end up understanding the issue of nest parasitism, and the human impact on birds that practice it, far more completely than you would if you'd read Kenn Kaufmann's individual species description. It works.There are some formatting issues here that do puzzle me. I don't really see the virtue in ordering the birds to correspond with the order in the NGS guide. There are other guides, to begin with, and now that we're about to get a new NGS guide, even the page numbers are going to be wrong. In any case, I can't see how you'd easily flip from one book to the other unless you were reading them sequentially. Who does that?But those are quibbles. This is a terrific book, quite useful as a complement to your field guide and very nice to just read through. It could use a face lift, but it's got a heart of gold."},{"Title":"The Birder's Handbook: A Field Guide to the Natural History of North American Birds","review":"When I'm not on the trading floor, I spend my free time watching birds. I would say that it wasn't until I picked up this essential birder's guide that I became an experienced and knowledgeable birder. This book increased my ability to identify birds, thus making bird watching infinitely more enjoyable. Since purchasing the Birder's Handbook, my weekend hobby has blossomed into an intense love for birds. I highly reccommend this to anyone with any level of interest in birding."},{"Title":"The Birder's Handbook: A Field Guide to the Natural History of North American Birds","review":"This is the book every birder needs to supplement her or his field guides. Intelligently organized and brilliantly indexed and cross-referenced it tells you concisely and in plain english what the field guides don't have room to tell you. It is also packed full of fascinating facts; for example, an oystercatcher opens bivalve shells in only one of two ways and it learns how to do this from its parents.The left-hand pages each detail feeding, mating, nesting, habitat, conservation concerns, &amp; much more, for a single species. As well as being described in text, basic information appears in icons at the top of the page, so you tell at a glance such things as preferred habitat, feeding patterns, breeding behavior, egg and nest appearance.The right-hand pages contain essays which apply to more than one species (for example, bill shapes or learned feeding behaviors) or which are not species-related (for example, biographical sketches on the great ornithologists). I would buy this book just for these essays alone.The species descriptions are in the usual AOU order and are cross-referenced to the major field guides.This book is a joy to use and an absolute bargain."},{"Title":"The Birder's Handbook: A Field Guide to the Natural History of North American Birds","review":"I have found this book to be a valuable source of background information on North American birds. I take it off my shelf and use it with considerable frequency. I find, however, the extensive use of symbols to be an occasional source of frustration. Until one becomes well acquainted with the meaning of the various symbols (this coincides, roughly, with the time that the book's spine starts cracking), there will be considerable time spent flipping back to the front of the book to find the meaning of the symbols used.Probably the most valuable aspect of the book is the extensive bibiography found in the back of the book. Not only do Ehrlich, Dobkin, and Wheye give you the basic information, they point you to more detailed sources of information.Since this book is now several years old, we can hope that a new edition--with an updated bibliography and less reliance on symbols--will soon be in the works."},{"Title":"The Birder's Handbook: A Field Guide to the Natural History of North American Birds","review":"Definately not for the casual reader...This book is really two books. One is a book on details of specific birds, the other a collection of essays on a wide ranging set of subjects. Both are very interesting and usable, but the book is structured such that the bird details are always on the left page, the essay on the right. Sometimes the essays are a fit with the bird details, sometimes not. Sometimes the essay continues on for several pages...Purchase of this books should really be combined with either the old three volume Audubon Master Guide, or older editions of Peterson (west and east), or a couple of other older field guides. You may have to hunt used books for a match. As indicated in the reviews below, the detail pages are loaded with cryptic little symbols that reference specific plates and pages in these other older guides.There is quite a lot of detail here, it is not a thin book, so don't plan on carrying it in the field much past the interior of your car. The size raises another issue. Updating this thing is not going to be an easy task. I suspect this 1988 edition is going to be what you get for a looong time."},{"Title":"The Birder's Handbook: A Field Guide to the Natural History of North American Birds","review":"This is a good book but you have to get used to the format and organization. To be honest I generally use one of my other books for id and basic info then I go to this book for more details. The details are fantastic though. I'd be very sad if I didn't have this in my collection because I learn a lot each time I use it. The format/use of symbols is just a bit awkward. Shouldn't deter you though - its great to have on hand"},{"Title":"The Birder's Handbook: A Field Guide to the Natural History of North American Birds","review":"Great reference book, though NOT portable. Because this book came out in 1988, it needs updating: bird name changes have occured and there is more information from research to add to the wealth of information it already contains. Birder's Handbook uses various editions of field guides as reference points, that is, it points to particular pages of those field guides for a bird illustration or photo as well as range maps. And because those field guides have been updated in the intervening years, the page numbers are not true.I look forward to another edition of this book!"},{"Title":"The Birder's Handbook: A Field Guide to the Natural History of North American Birds","review":"When you are ready to move beyond simple identification of birds, your curiosity piqued by the avians on your feeder or flying over your canoe, this book is the answer. It is a big fat paperback, far too cumbersome for field use, but wonderful in its detail. Why do geese fly in a vee? How does a seagull's wing work? What materials do birds use to line their nests? Owls ears, hatching asynchronicity, communal roosting, head scratching, and promiscuity are a few among the hundreds of topics discussed in this work. There are brief biographies of early ornithologists, discussions of bird names and detailed advice on how a layperson can meaningfully contribute to the study of winged creatures (from the comfort of your feeder-viewing easy chair, if you like). This one's for the serious birder."},{"Title":"The Birder's Handbook: A Field Guide to the Natural History of North American Birds","review":"First of all I think the book is poorly titled. \\"A field Guide...\\" might confuse someone thinking this is a book to id birds in the field. It is not. There is good descriptions of birds, nests, etc. but what I really like about this book are the essays.They are chock full of really fascinating natural history, biology, behaviors, ornithology biography, general interest in birds. Great light reading for a naturalist. I own a house full of natural history books and really appreciate this one for what it is."},{"Title":"The Birder's Handbook: A Field Guide to the Natural History of North American Birds","review":"I was given this book as a gift, but I probably would not have bought it for myself.Although it does have a lot of good information, it is difficult to read, and there are very few bird illustrations, so you need to have other references as well. It is really more of a bird encyclopedia than a field guide, and the author uses a lot of abbreviations and graphical symbols, requiring frequent look-ups in the front of the book to see what is meant by them.Marshall Faintich, author of \\"A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Wintergreen\\""},{"Title":"The Birder's Handbook: A Field Guide to the Natural History of North American Birds","review":"Ok, this is NOT a field guide as the name would suggest. It is a reference book of bird biology. It includes information such as habitat preferences, nesting substrate, clutch size, diet, courtship rituals, which sex sits on the nest, etc. There are also short essays intersperced throughout the guide about various topics of ornithological interest. Not for the passive birder. Useful for researchers and serious birders."},{"Title":"The Birder's Handbook: A Field Guide to the Natural History of North American Birds","review":"Enhances all the other bird identifications books we currently own.

Besides containing interesting and useful information on North American species which it rarely contained in other guides, it also contains great \\"essays\\" with fascinating bird-related subjects, research and people. Left-hand pages contain the species information, right-hand pages contain the essays. While it is not intended for field use due to its weight, if traveling by car or kayak, I bring it along on any multi-day trips just for pleasure reading when the opportunity presents. It is that good! I highly recommend it to all my friends."},{"Title":"The Birder's Handbook: A Field Guide to the Natural History of North American Birds","review":"This book is very unique in the birding book world on several counts.~ First off, as has been stated in other reviews, this is not a conventional guidebook. It has no pictures or drawings and is clearly designed to be used with other guidebooks, in fact references to page numbers in the major \\"picture\\" guidebooks are given for each bird. I would go so far as to say that is has no place \\"in the field\\" but rather should be consulted when back home.~ Second, I really feel that this book is truly for advanced birders - or trivia freaks like me (more on that later).~ Thirdly, the layout takes a bit of getting used to but once you \\"get it\\", it is ingenious. On the left side of each page layout (even numbered pages) are all the write-ups about all U.S./Canadian birds. The writeups include lots of info not always included in a guidebook including nest shape, food, incubation period and mating system (mongamous vs polyandrous vs polygynous etc) using a simple legend system. It also includes a prose of each bird including unique facts often not found in other guides. The right hand side (odd numbers) is where it gets really unique. The right side may or may not have anything to do with the birds facing it. These pages consist of essays that range from Courtship Feeding to Sleeping Sentries to Bird Biologist - Joel Asaph Allen! Roughly half of the book (actually more) is made up of these essays and informative blurbs. The neat thing is that, if they apply to any particular bird, they are referenced within that bird's description. So, for example, under Wood Duck one will find references to Site Tenacity, Plume Trade and Parasitized Ducks along with the essay's page number. These same essays may be referenced from many other birds and thus are not necesarily near any specific bird.For advanced birders or trivia nuts (like me) it is a fabulous resource. For me, it is kind of like those times when you get lost on the internet and follow link to link to link and wonder how you got to where you are! Only these links contain factoids and useful info re: birds! I guess somehow, that sounds more meaningful and fulfilling than surfing the net for hours.My only hesitation might be that the book may be a bit dated. It was published in 1988 which to some may make it ancient. For birding, other than the taxonomic orders that are constantly changing, I believe the info is all still very timely and accurate.Another interesting thing about the book is that one of the authors is Paul Erlich who was reknowned back in the 60's for his population studies and publications (\\"The Population Bomb\\"). Not sure what part he played in the writing and layout but it is certainly a fascinating connection beween birds as an indicator species for the health of the planet and his having a hand in the book.Hope this helps some folks out!Steve"},{"Title":"The Birder's Handbook: A Field Guide to the Natural History of North American Birds","review":"Although a few years old now this book is full of great information.

Fenichel not only summarizes and clearly explains theory, but also provides case-histories. He also decribes the most basic concepts of psychoanalysis such that anyintelligent layman/woman could use this book as a starting point, though the book does reach a very sophiscated level after the introduction and early chapters. Very significant is Fenichel's presentation of how mere neuroses can advance to psychoses, and that solely mentalistic causes can force such an advance; this etiology ruptures the current fashion ofemphasizing brain-biochemical causes, or, holding biochemicals to be the ONLY cause of mental illness; Fenichel's work here shows why the biochemical/physicalist-theory is at best half-true (despite the best marketing tactics of American pharmaceutical companies, and the outright bombast of the psychiatric community).Fenichel is truly Freud's heir, and anyone interested in what psychoanalyisis is should read this book, as well as Feni's Collected Papers. Pompous and asinine critics of psychoanalysis,from femininists to diluters like Lacan, to petty, small-minded\\"philosophers,\\" like Adolph Grundbaum, could have no rejoinder to this work, and they rarely if ever refer to it: its scope is so vast, and its ordering of theory and fact so powerful, its sources so numerous that critics would prefer to ignore it.This is the most important work outside Freud's own that anyone could read."},{"Title":"The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis","review":"Without a peer for an encyclopediac reference of psychoanalytic theory as it existed at the close of World War Two, Fenichels' Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis is an absolute necessity for any student of, researcher in or practitioner of psychoanalysis or analytic therapy. Unlike other reference works in the subject, which present analytic thinkers as competing &quot;systems,&quot; Fenichel sets psychoanalytic theory up as a broad framework, with each theorist adding a novel perspective or elucidating finer points in the broad theory."},{"Title":"The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis","review":"An essential in psychoanalytic literature, this summary of the first 50 years in psychoanalytic research gives a thourough description and explanation of the freudian psychoanalytic school. With his scientific, and detailed writing Fenichel gives a detailed and clear understanding of psychoanalytic approach to mental phenomena, presenting the strong link between psychoanalytic thinking and human biology, helping put psychoanalysis back in medicine, where it has actually always belonged, being until now the only thourough \\"anatomy\\" and \\"physiology\\" of the mental functions of the human body."},{"Title":"The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis","review":"I am using this text for my masters in psychoanalytic psychotherapy and it is really a wonderful piece of art.

She introduced the tiny character named K'tonton in the September 1930 issue of Outlook magazine.The Adventures of K'tonton: The Little Jewish Tom Thumb was first published in 1935; it includes 16 stories and was reprinted at least 10 times. Each tale includes important Jewish ideas or traditions, and a dash of Jewish humor--and its own complex plot. A few tales from this volume--Ktonton's Sukkot Adventure and Ktonton's Yom Kippur Kitten--were reprinted later as individual books with new color illustrations.Isaac Samuel ben Baruch Reuben--whose first name meant laughter--was called K'tonton, which in case you wondered, is Hebrew for very very little. He was a late-born miracle for whom his mother had prayed so hard one Sukkot that she promised to love even a child \\"no bigger than a thumb.\\" Sure enough, before a year had passed, she gave birth to a son. And sure enough, he was no bigger than her thumb. She blanketed him in the flax she had used to wrap an etrog--the Israeli citrus fruit used to celebrate Sukkot--and cradled him in a hand-carved etrog box.It was also on the harvest festival of Sukkot that K'tonton made his first trip to the synagogue. As his father put his etrog carefully into its box to take to shul, K'tonton eagerly asked to join him. \\"Next year,\\" answered his father, \\"when you're a little bigger.\\" Like all over-eager boys, K'tonton did something he shouldn't, and climbed inside the etrog box to hide.Once in shul, he couldn't see, so he climbed onto the lulav--the palm branch that is pointed east, west, south and north, to the heavens and to earth as part of the celebration. As K'tonton's father rose with the congregation to chant Hodu l'Adonai ki tov--Praise the Lord for God is good--there was K'tonton singing from atop the lulav, in a high treble that rose above all the other voices.I can't tell all the myriad details, but here's a taste of K'tonton's adventures: He planned a palace for the Sabbath Queen, saved the birds on Shabbat Shirah, planted trees in Israel and sent them a Shanah Tovah (a Happy New Year). In one hilarious tale, a spinning Chanukah dreidel carried K'tonton off the table, down the stairs, out the door, into the street and into a gutter, where he found a small bit of Chanukah money known in Yiddish as gelt.K'tonton also turned up in a Purim cookie, a Hamentash, covered with poppy seeds. On the day before Passover, he helped (with a mouse) find and discard the last crumbs in the house to help celebrate the redemption of the Hebrew slaves. He had a picnic on Lag Ba'Omer, rode an arrow and a bird. The book also features stories for Shevuot, Rosh Hashonah, Yom Kippur (when K'tonton tried to feed a hungry cat), Shemini Atzeret, Simchat Torah and a finale for Sukkot.Each one of these 16 special stories of a tiny boy will light children's eyes.--Alyssa A.

Having said that, the author does go beyond the precursory information one finds online to further explain the ins and outs.

I'm not a big fan of the whole New York escapade, (Even though it does give you a better insight on Eiri) and I was rather glad when it ended in this volume. I was also happy to see the return of Ryuichi, who had been absent in the last few volumes, as I find him to be one of the most entertaining characters in the series.A few things it did not like: Rage simply gets on my nerves. Most people would not continue stalking an obviously gay guy, but nevertheless Reiji persists, getting rather irritating after a while. Also, too much of Tohma being evil. He's really being painted as the bad guy of the story, but judging from what we know about him he really shouldn't be this much of a bad guy.In short, though volume 10 was certainly entertaining, I'm hoping that the last two volumes will be even better."},{"Title":"Gravitation, Vol. 10","review":"I have loved this series, but the last 2 volumes haven't been lived up to the promise of the preceding ones. Volume 10, in particular, was disjointed and repetitive. Frankly, I think the series would have been much better if it had been compressed into 8 or 9 volumes. The multitude of side stories and plot twists are making me lose interest. Too many of the characters look alike, which makes the action and dialogue difficult to follow.I'm sure I'll finish reading the entire series, but I don't think I'll look on it as favorably as I once used to."},{"Title":"Gravitation, Vol. 10","review":"Most of the pages were in tact- one was completely ripped out, though.

I couldn't ask for a more eclectic assortment of soap-making ideas and techniques. I'd never tried this but with this book I found it easy.

It's a remarkable social history, it's ethnography, biting social commentary, educational historiography, psychology, an essential resource for curriculum development. The book catches up with and defines that moving target: What is literacy? Certainly anybody who has anything to do with education, school boards, curriculum developing, funding for our schools, should read this book. Politicians, journalists, teachers, especially. The research is painstaking. Conclusions are vital and well-grounded. It reveals how the very institutions that are supposedly designed to foster literacy may actually be contributing to its uneven distribution by continuing historic patterns of discrimination, and how private interests continue to threaten to hijack our schools. And it reminds us, that's not the way it's supposed to be in our democracy."},{"Title":"Literacy in American Lives","review":"A great book if you need to learn about literacy in America.

I started from knowing VB.net pretty well (for business apps), but not knowing the first thing about DirectX or Game Programming. That said, the editing of the code samples in this book is atrocious. The code samples in the book almost never match those on the CD and you have to figure out &quot;what they mean&quot; most of the time, debugging stuff yourself. Another dumb thing is that whoever wrote the code doesn't know how to use arrays, and always Dims a 4 element array as MyArray(4) instead of (3). Lastly, they don't tell you to enable &quot;key preview&quot; on your forms, so if you didn't know to do that from reading it in another .Net book, the keyboard handler functions would never work for you. Bottom line is that this book can help you learn elementary game programming in VB.net, as long as you know the language reasonably well (decent VB6 would be enough), and you won't get too frustrated trying to reconcile the code in the book and on the CD.

However, this book is so terrible that I felt compelled to send out a warning to all those considering this book.The whole time I was reading it, the only thing I could think of was all of the naive programmers out there who might just be learning and not realize all of the bad practices this book is advising. Not to mention a complete misunderstanding of how Object Oriented Programming is to be used. According to Mr. Lobao, EVERYTHING derives from a game engine - a sprite, a tile, a font, etc...I can't believe a book like this ever made it to press. I also find it laughable that the foreward is written by a Microsoft MVP whose focus is in ADO.NET, and the technical reviewer specializes in data warehousing and internet solutions.

Mostly I could forgive these because the authors have a nice, clear style, and seem to understand fundamental game development principles that I am still learning, like collision detection. But when I was able to greatly enhance the performance of the example in chapter 3 because I already understood culling even though the authors don't, I became annoyed. And I just gave up when the example from chapter 4 ran at an unplayable speed: I just couldn't navigate the river in this game, the performance was so bad, and that was without moving enemies or the ability to shoot.

If you want to write the next Doom, this book will not teach you how to do that. In fact, considering that this book has &quot;DirectX&quot; in the title, it covers very little 3D programming. However, this book DOES teach the basics of game development and almost all aspects that go along with that, from simple graphics to controlling sound, and controllers such as force feedback joysticks.

I sat down in Barnes & Noble this weekend and read the first 60 pages and skimmed briefly through the rest. I would hate to try and recommend this book to anyone. A beginner may learn a few things, but it's riddled with errors and some terrible programming techniques, that I would hate to see a beginner pick those techniques up as \\"the way to do it.\\"I think authors should take more care in the editing procedure. Even a casual re-reading by the author would have, I should think, exposed many problems, which could have been fixed before going to press.A couple errors:- Saying you'll take errors if you try and use a certain technique with indexed pixel formats, like JPEG. Excuse me? JPEG is not, never has been, and never will be an indexed pixel format image. Sorry!- Saying \\"In .NET all the arrays must be defined without boundaries, which are later assigned in the code.So we must always use Redim before assigning values to an array.\\" What?! Are you nuts??The biggest chuckle I got was when, in the first chapter, he is careful to code his own \\"Rectangle\\" storage so that he can save an addition (+) operation. But, if you look at the code for drawing the blocks, he is as inefficient as you can get: creating and destroying entire device contexts for EACH BLOCK. Yeah, for each (X,Y) block, he calls \\"ArrGameField(X, Y).Show(WinHandle)\\", which in turn does \\"Graphics.FromHwnd(WinHandle)\\". Crazy!!"},{"Title":".NET Game Programming with DirectX 9.0","review":"eI am not sure if I am the only one who researched before I bought, but I found this book to be precisely what I expected, to a degree, but more on that in a moment. Some of the other comments are unfair to say the least. A sprite can inherit from a monkey if I want it to. This does not make it any more or less OO and those who say it does I feel lack the abstract vision...no point in bashing, the book does what it is designed to do and code-nazis will never be happy with anything that doesn't fit their narrow perception of 'the right way.'I would say this book is really good for those who have written a lot of code, are at least somewhat comfortable with .net and know how to debug. That is because you will do a lot of debugging. I have no idea what went on, but the editing is horrendous, to be very kind. They will suddenly rename objects a page after they declared them, they will completely forget to inform you that you have to include a method and you only realize it when it is referenced later, they (and this is completeley unexcusable) have syntax errors that don't even make it past the copiler. The actual code in the text as a sample is completley useless unless you view it as psuedocode.That being said, I found this book to be fairly uselful when I accepted the psuedocode notion above. If you know how to get around the text issues, this book does a pretty good job at intorducing many concepts of game programming. The DirectX info is good and let's be honest, how many other books are out there covering game coding in VB? I can churn out three complete, working apps (even taking into account all the textual errors) in the time it takes to muck through a C++ direct3D lib. It has been a fantastic 'jump start' on my game programming and you get to experiment and tweak where in other cases you spend the entire week just chunking out the code. It is just to bad the text is riddled with issues, because there are so many talented programmers who learned completely through working with VB, it is sad this title will not enable those same self-visionary-types to do the same with games."},{"Title":".NET Game Programming with DirectX 9.0","review":"All I can say is that I picked this book up hoping it could guide me through some simple game programming. I ended up more confused by How to use the book than I ever would by the code. As someone who likes to step through working samples, it seems virtually impossible to do so using this book. I have had it for over a month and am still trying to decipher the first chapter!Here's an idea of what I am talking about. You begin by programming a tetris clone. You start by coding the little objects (puzzle pieces) that will fall from the top, you get to a certain point and the author says to run the program to look at the object - only one problem - there is no &quot;playing field&quot; for the object to be displayed! You have to flip ahead several pages to find out how to program the playing field. The playing field probably should have come well BEFORE you'd ever program the object that is going to be placed onto it. At the very least it should come before you are asked to run the program. Once you find the playing field code in the book, there is a missing reference to another class that hasn't even been written yet, so your search begins again. etc, etc.I have so many examples of this type of frustration. Just when you finish your &quot;code hunt&quot; for a missing function, there is another one that rears it's ugly head.I am giving it 2 stars because they explain some gaming concepts I wasn't familiar with like Collision detection and Proximity Algorithms.

How disappointed I was to find that the book was a complete mess. I feel for other budding game programmers like me who have struggled looking for the Draw( ) command referred to on pages 36 and 37. I kept searching through the previous pages, sure that I had missed something somewhere.Turns out there is no Draw( ) command, never was. The correct command is Show( ). If I'm not mistaken the problem does not exist on the CD source code (available with the book), but for those who are typing it in from the book line by line (like me), you can stop looking now.The mistake has been caught by APress and that plus other errata can be found here:http://www.apress.com/book/errataDisplay.html?bID=111&sID;=1039I realize now that lots of books have errata pages online, so I guess this is normal in the industry, but it seems obvious to me that nobody at APress actually sat down and tried to USE this book as a layman. I know this because if they had done so prior to going to print, they would have found and fixed this problem!What is also funny is that Mr. Labao and Ms. Hatton also have apparently not used the book they wrote, either.

I've tried copying some of it straight from the book into VB.NET, with, shall we say, questionable success.

It is getting me started on Direct3D okay, which is why I bought the book. There are some serious problems, however.The book (thank god) comes with a CD with working source code. This code will often not agree with the book. The book contains syntax errors. The author forgets to inform you of many variables and functions that need to be defined. He flips back and forth between VB6-style and VB.Net program flow mechanisms and commands, using Err.Raise, On Error Goto, MsgBox, and FunctionName = ReturnValue in one function, then Structured exception handling, MessageBox.Show, and Return ReturnValue in the next function. In the function I am looking at right now, a for/next loop is needed, but the for and next lines are simply omitted from the source in the book! The code doesn't appear even make sense until you open the source from the CD to see what is missing. He uses incorrect DirectX function, class and enumeration names (on the page open in front of me, he declares a texture object as a \\"Direct3DTexture8\\" rather than the correct \\"Texture\\"... I am beginning to wonder if all this code is not ported from VB6 and DirectX 8).I copied one of the games (River Pla.Net) to my hard drive, and compiled and played it. It (intentially) runs at about 6 FPS, with the entire playing field scrolling one row of tiles per frame. It works, but it looks... bad. In five minutes I looked around, modified 15 lines of code, tops, and I had the game running with smooth scrolling and waaaay smoother controls. Why would the author not take the extra five minutes to make his game look 100% better?I have to admit, though, that I am now capable of creating a Direct3D, tile-based game, which was my goal, which is why I would give the book 3 stars rather than one.

There are references to a mysterious Chapter 6 throughout the book, but Chapter 6 does not exist.

Stationed in Galilee, Longinus comes into contact with John the Baptist first, then Jesus and His followers. It it the delicate detail, humor, and believability that carry the novel. When Ruafocus becomes ill and reminds Longinus that the centurion owes him a life, Longinus dresses in his parade uniform and formally requests Jesus' mercy; granted it, he stops Him from going to Ruafocus with the great words: &quot;Speak but the word, and my servant will be healed.&quot;It's a beautiful portrait of a man of 50 or so whose world dissolves and reforms in the presence of Christ. Much of it is Bible-based. A very good read."},{"Title":"The Centurion: A Novel of the Ministry and Passion of Christ","review":"Longinus is the traditional name of the Roman centurion at the Crucifixion.

In my case it was the eighth edition, published in 1982 and republished in 1986. CAPT Noel's versions of the \\"Watch Officer's Guide\\" and the \\"Bluejacket's Guide\\" were also instrumental to me in my Navy career, as they surely have been to generations of sailors.Now that I have retired from naval service and have done a few things since, I have had the chance to re-evaluate this book and would like to mention some things about it that I have found to be of value.This remains one of the best books about the art and science of naval leadership I have ever read. This includes literary works by Melville, Conrad, and others, as well as film and Television episodes such as \\"The Caine Mutiny\\" (which we also watched) and a variety of Star Trek \\"The Next Generation\\" episodes, which deal in naval leadership themes with a surprising degree of detail and nuance.The lessons of naval leadership that CAPT Noel imparts in this book are timeless and increasingly relevant. The three core elements of leadership he mentions on page 4 of the book remain fundamental: personal example, effective management, and moral responsibility. In stressing the importance of the human element of leadership, CAPT Noel would probably be considered old fashioned in today's technology infatuated military. A word to contemporary military strategists now embracing anthropology and other \\"soft\\" techniques about CAPT Noel's definition of \\"moral responsibility:\\"\\"The difference between Hitler and Churchill was not only their methods but in their motives. Irresponsible leadership threatens, bluffs, deceives, and oppresses; morally responsible leadership guides firmly and honestly, with every possible regard for human dignity\\" (p. 5).The U.S. Navy (and the other service branches), as well as business and industry, would do well to adopt the honorable and learned counsel he imparts here."},{"Title":"Compact Houses: Architecture for the Environment","review":"very little variety in housing styles, they are all modern boxes. i agree with someone who wrote that this is a coffee table book. i.e. not useful for much except flipping through the pictures when you're bored."},{"Title":"Compact Houses: Architecture for the Environment","review":"This is a great how-to book.

They are for anyone who hopes to cure the McMansion virus.Trump would hate this book."},{"Title":"Compact Houses: Architecture for the Environment","review":"This is basically just a coffee table book - plenty of nice pictures but light on substance.

The \\"blueprints\\" are hardly viewable, let alone descriptive. Most of the structures resemble eachother and are spare, without furnishings or signs of life. I would recommend the book, \\"PREFAB\\" by Allison Arieff for bigger pictures, broader concepts and more in depth explanations. I suppose they were making a point by making the size of the book compact, but the few times I was impressed with a structure I would scour the three or so pages devoted to it and then it was over, leaving me wanting much more. Try classics like, \\"Pierre Koenig\\", by James Steele or \\"Julius Shulman: Architecture and Its Photography\\" by Peter Gossel. Ta Ta"},{"Title":"Compact Houses: Architecture for the Environment","review":"I review a lot of architecture books, and this one more than most makes me want to go out and build a new house. The subject of the book is small houses. It consists of pictures and the story of some fifty houses, all of which are less than 1,300 square feet. Many of them are much less than 1,300 feet, indeed down into the 300-400 square foot size.I live in a small house -- 900 square feet or so -- that's about a hundred years old. But compared to the layout, the beauty the simplicity of design, mine's a dump. I'm getting the urge to go visit a realtor friend. One thing about these houses is that many of them are on what would be considered hard to build on lots. And such lots tend to be cheap. There's a new architect in town that's fresh out of school and may have more originality than the older guys. Maybe if I give her this book, with a few houses marked. Hmmmmm!One thing I didn't like, most of the bed rooms are on the second floor. I was in a house once that had a fire. The amount of smoke generated in just a minute or two was incredible. I don't want a bed room upstairs, if necessary I want to be able to close the door to keep the smoke out and get out through a wondow or emergency door.Other than that, this is a great idea book. The pictures are beautiful. There's not as much detail as I would like, but adding detail would have to mean either fewer houses or bigger book, so I guess it's a nice balance."},{"Title":"Compact Houses: Architecture for the Environment","review":"I enjoyed the wide variety of projects presented. I'm a visual person, so thought there could have been more photos per home to orientate oneself with the accompanying floor plans.Overall, I return to this book (amongst others of its genre in my collection) because of the celebration of small project design.This is not for those who dislike modern, minimilistic elevations."},{"Title":"Compact Houses: Architecture for the Environment","review":"This book is one of my favorites of its kind. Photographs are beautiful and do a good job of capturing the concepts of the houses. The houses featured are innovative but for the most part practical. Obviously these are just more or less over views but they made me want to know more."},{"Title":"Compact Houses: Architecture for the Environment","review":"As a member of the Small House Society I love this book. The houses are small and to the point without all the clutter some small houses tend to have. And as the title says its Compact Houses: Architecture for the Environment. And in an era of McMansions its so refreshing to see small homes that use small lots to make the best use of the land and provide for the most open and airy feeling home. Or for those who like myself love the idea of a 500-800 square foot home in an open field that is environmentally sound but also simple and minimalist this is a great book."},{"Title":"Compact Houses: Architecture for the Environment","review":"Monotonous. Even though the houses in this book are from around the world - Europe, east Asia, Australia, South America, and a sprinkling from North America - every single one is in the minimalist style, mostly boxes and a few oddly shaped things, all with little aesthetic appeal. I learned nothing about the architectural traditions of different parts of the world.The text doesn't convey much, the floor plans are hard to read and often do not show every floor so it's hard to get an overall feeling of the design, but the book has beautiful photographs and a large amount of material, 420 pages worth. So, if you like to look at pictures of minimalist houses then get this book, otherwise avoid it."},{"Title":"Compact Houses: Architecture for the Environment","review":"As a prior reviewer stated: \\"This is basically just a coffee table book - plenty of nice pictures but light on substance. If you want detailed (even semi detailed) information on compact design, space saving ideas and the like than look elsewhere.\\"That is why I think it is a good book. There isn't a bunch of detailed information to get bogged down in. It gives you ideas and notions. If some house really sends you, you can follow up and contact the architects."},{"Title":"Compact Houses: Architecture for the Environment","review":"There are many, many books about small houses. Buy any one of those instead of this one. I can recommend \\"New Small Spaces\\" (edited by F Mola) because I happened to pick up both of these the same day; the latter book although similar in layout and minimalist design, is much more informative and livable.As other reviewers have mentioned, the floor plans and elevations are miniscule, poorly drawn, and not labelled. In several instances they are flat out wrong, not representative of the house being discussed. (Okay the WeeHouse variation pictured in both books does not have a bathroom.)Most of the photos are exterior shots with a lot of duplicate views. Many interiors were photographed without furniture. There is no discussion of space-saving features--not that I was looking for an in-depth treatise but a few mentions would have been appropriate for a house of less than 1200 sq ft. The houses selected are not just minimalist, they are Pritzker-level minimalist.There is a lot of focus on light, I'll grant you that.In short, this is a hasty compilation for a coffee table book. Otherwise, how do you explain the Australian houseboat with two full-size beds in the cabins but not a single other place to sit down aside from the captain's swivel chair."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Investing: How to Be a Savvy Investor","review":"Have you, the individual investor, read books by Larry Swedroe, Burton Maklkiel, and John Bogle? Do you think you now know a great deal about investing? If so, STOP. DO NOT PASS GO. BUY THIS BOOK.Once discovered this text will become an investment classic. For the average investor it will challenge your thinking, present some very valuable insights that otherwise might be ignored, and reinforce some sound principles of investing.Following an introductory examination of the long-term performance among various asset classes and the risks to investors posed by inflation, Bruce Temkin then delves into the impact of taxes upon real investment rates of return. He then aids the investor in understanding market volatility and various types of risks. Additional insights follow in his frank discussion of personal risk factors, investment time horizons, the role of (and limits of) diversification, and the role emotions can play in making investment decisions. Charts and graphs throughout the 258 pages help explain and reinforce the concepts presented.Throughout this book Bruce Temkin challenges us to carefully consider the steady diet we have been fed of misleading historical charts, the illusion of &quot;average&quot; rates of return, and longevity statistics. Mr. Temkin effectively explains why both &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;aggressive&quot; investment portfolios can be far riskier than many investors think, and why investment portfolios should be (and must be) rebalanced periodically.The author scatters various insights throughout the easy to follow text - precious nuggets to absorb, contemplate, and apply to your individual situation. For example, he summarizes the benefits and limitations of financial software programs, including those employing Monte Carlo simulations. Also, he effectively conveys to the reader in several places the central theme that there are no guarantees in investing.Think you know it all, or most of it? This book is clearly for you. To quote the author, &quot;When it comes to investing, feeling invincible can be dangerous. It can lead investors to overlook the principles that significantly contributed to their success in the first place.&quot;This is perhaps not the first book the beginning individual investor should read. But this is the one book on investing that should not be overlooked by investors and their advisors. This book will challenge your thinking, whatever level of experience you may possess. This is one book that deserves to be read carefully not only a first time, but every several months again, lest the individual investor think he or she has explored all there is to consider in investment and financial planning decision-making.Candid and insightful, this text is a must read for those seriously interested in investing and financial planning."},{"Title":"The Terrible Truth About Investing: How to Be a Savvy Investor","review":"This book is out of print and Mr. Temkin has only himself to blame. He could have chosen any number of titles for his book, such as \\"How To Be a Complete Idiot and Still Get Very Rich Very Quick.\\" Instead, he chose a title that implies that investing might not be the all that easy. What is worse, he published his book in 1999, when the stock markets were not quite at the end of a prolonged period of much higher than average returns and much lower average volatility.This is not a book about how to buy stocks and bonds. It will not tell you what mutual fund to buy. What is does contain is a very good explication of what is actually known about investing strategy, based on the historical data as first assembled and analyzed by Ibbotson and Sinquefield in the early 1970s. The information on offer here is especially valuable at a time when more and more of us are responsible for saving enough for our retirement needs. Among other useful things, this books explains: why you may need more money for retirement than you think; why you may not be as diversified as you think; why your investments may be riskier than you think (or, perhaps, thought, up until the last three years); how diversification can reduce but not eliminate risk; why investment mixes with higher volatility can reduce your total returns; why you have an investment strategy even if you don't think you do; why the handy investment software programs you find on the Internet may be misleading you about your retirement savings needs; why life cycle investing advice is often oversimplified; and, perhaps most importantly, why your psychological reactions to swings in the markets may cause you to make bad decisions.Perhaps, in the light of the experience of the last three years, we have reached what another investment writer called \\"the educable moment\\" and we are ready to absorb some of the terrible truths about investing that Mr. Temkin teaches. Some clever publisher ought to get Mr. Temkin to do another edition of this book and promote it as being by the-investment-guru-who-was-smart-enough-to-know-the-stock-market-would-go-down-again-some-day. Maybe they could call it \\"The Completely Easy Way to Get Rich in a Hurry in Spite of the Fact That You're an Utter Fool\\" or something like that."},{"Title":"The Great Whitewater Fiasco","review":"It's too bad this book is out of print. You should try to order it used or see if your library has it. Gross writes with a very no nonsense style. He didn't try to win a writing prize with this book like James Stewart did with his Whitewater book. And, of course, Gross isn't a hard core Clinton apologist/worshipper like Gene Lyons and Joe Conason. This book explains the relationship between the Clintons and the McDougals, goes through the task of explaining the transactions, and by the end of the book leading the reader to conclude that Whitewater, contrary to Clinton supporters, was a scandal that should have dethroned their king."},{"Title":"The Great Whitewater Fiasco","review":"Well written and a must read for the Clinton scholar. Makes even more sense today with the Clintons making millions of dollars speaking and writing. In their Arkansas days they used every legal and nonlegal loophole to make money hand over foot and win every election except one. That loss convinced President Clinton that money buys elections, and this book explains their investments and federal guaranteed loans. The author gives solutions to the money problem in politics but of course none of them have been implemented so nothing has changed since Whitewater. Money buys votes."},{"Title":"The animals of Farmer Jones (A big golden book)","review":"Used Book arrived intact, but smelled like cigarette smoke.

I read this book many years ago and have forgotten some of the details, but this theme -- more popularly explored in &quot;Jaws&quot; and recently in &quot;Isaac's Storm&quot; -- has stayed in my mind. Most readers will never be threatened by a volcanic eruption, but this book is a somewhat grim reminder that our own leaders may be lying about impending natural disasters. Remember Pelee!"},{"Title":"The Day The World Ended","review":"Thomas and Witts tell the story of a week in May, 1902,when the Carrabean city of St. Pierre was obliterated by a volcanic eruption. When I first saw this book, I wondered how anyone could pen over 150 pages on a volcano that wiped a city out in seconds, leaving only two survivors. I thought there would not be much to write about. Boy was I wrong! It turns out that in the week prior to the eruption, St. Pierre was hit by landslides, a tsunami, and even a deadly snake infestation! Several hundred were killed before the great event itself. The final eruption is simply the climatic horror and can almost be seen as a blessing, putting people out of their misery. This book is probably hard to find now, but it is worth getting, and will interest just about everyone from the scientist to the casual reader."},{"Title":"The Day The World Ended","review":"In reading this book I kept coming back to the question of how men can put their political careers and reputations ahead of the safety of women and children? When fools rule in an unstable society, they implement foolish self interest laws and decrees that sooner or later brings about the death of those they rule. History shows us this time and again.This book is written in a way that highlights the selfish deeds of not one such fool, but a host of fools who for personal reasons and gain would not listen to sound logic and instead left themselves and those they were sworn to protect, vulnerable to the wraith of nature. Few are innocent in this story of destruction.The story itself almost reads like the chronicles of Moses returning from the mount and finding his people living in sin and worshiping false idols. It was the foolish leadership, in the absence of Moses, who took over and led the people astray. To me, Mt. Pelee in this story, simply represents the natural law of the land acting as its creator meant for it to act. It's always up to men to heed the warnings of natural law and react accordingly.So where was the spiritual leadership of the Church in the days leading up to the eruption of Mount Pelee? It appears that they'd already made a deal with the political machinery in the city of St. Pierre and would not interfere in its decrees, regardless of the evidence of approaching danger. Again, fools following fools.This book is a well documented reading about a natural disaster that took advantage of the foolishness of men and wiped out 30,000 human lives. It would be interesting to see the ethnic breakdown of those who lost their lives. The city was made up of a diverse group of peoples; French, Mulatto, Negro and many foreigners attracted to its \\"Paris of the Caribbean\\" moniker.To the reviewer who claims to have done extensive research on this disaster and questions the authenticity of information in this book, I ask you to please share your resources and findings. I find it hard to believe that anyone who reads the well researched evidence presented here in this book can attempt to discredit it with a few opinionated lines and self-crowned scholarship. Does the reviewer not see the harm in his words without sound facts? This book teaches a serious lesson to mankind. If the lesson is not learned it's likely that there will be another Mt. Pelee to teach another town controlled by fools."},{"Title":"The Day The World Ended","review":"So many people killed by a Nuee Ardente (Glowing Cloud), released during the catatrophic eruption of Montagne Pelee, in 1902.Political skulduggery, chicanery, and a total unwillingness to confront a deadly situation, especially by the Governor Louis Mouttet."},{"Title":"The Day The World Ended","review":"For fast-paced excitement, you cannot beat The Day the World Ended, which is a day-by-day account of the 1902 volcano, starting on the 2nd of May 1902 and ending on the 8th, that weaves into this time several strong human interest stories. It was written in 1969, 67 years after the eruption, when the authors could still find a few people close to those times to interview. I get the feeling it was based very much on interviews, which gives it an immediacy not as apparent in the other two books: The Last Days of St. Pierre by Ernest Zebrowski and La Catastrophe by Alwyn Scarth. If you can only read one book, make it this one. it reads like a novel.The cost of this approach is that we cannot be sure all the stories the authors heard were accurate, so we will never know if some of the stories told here, like the placing of troops to stop people leaving the town are true. But for a feeling of impending doom, this book creates the atmosphere perfectly."},{"Title":"The Day The World Ended","review":"I would rate this book but it dose not even rate one star. I have read many accounts of eruption of the 1902 eruption of Pelee and this book dose not fit with the facts. There are maybee two or thee sentences in the book that are accurate but for the most part the book is pure fiction."},{"Title":"The Day The World Ended","review":"The subject matter--the 1902 volcanic decimation of the most important city on the Caribbean island of Martinique--is compelling. Indeed, I have been so fascinated by it that I have read everything I can find on the subject. The trouble with this particular accounting is that it emphasizes political selfishness and plotting, long thought to have unnecessarily entrapped the 30,000-odd victims in the doomed city. That view of the disaster--ascribing cruel indifference to persons no longer alive to explain their actions--was itself politically generated after the event, and has been subsequently thoroughly discredited. Indeed, the Island's governor is now perceived as having been a deeply concerned and brave man who tried to do what was best for his island and himself perished in the process. This book was simply written before the political and social circumstances of the event were well understood. Because the authors chose to emphasize the social aspect of the tragedy--and relied in so doing upon a long-standing, purposefully generated misrepresentation based in inaccuracy and innuendo--the volume is simply grossly misleading. Read any one of the fine books written in the past fifteen years or so. You'll come away with a much truer sense of what actually happened in and to St. Pierre, and an understanding of how a lack of scientific knowledge--despite the best efforts of the island's best and brightest--brought about a compelling and fascinating disaster at the start of the last century."},{"Title":"Augustus and the Greek world","review":"Perhaps more than any other Roman emperor, Caesar Augustus exemplified lines 1145-1154 in Book VI of Virgil's &quot;Aeneid&quot;:Others will cast more tenderly in bronzeTheir breathing figures, I can well believe,And bring more lifelike portraits out of marble;Argue more eloquently, use the pointerTo trace the paths of heaven accuratelyAnd accurately foretell the rising stars.Roman, remember by your strength to ruleEarth's peoples - for your arts are to be these:To pacify, to impose the rule of law,To spare the conquered, battle down the proud.-(Robert Fitzgerald, translator)Scholars have largely believed that the &quot;others&quot; whom Anchises is referring to are the Greeks. The Greeks were simply far more artistically and scientifically inclined than were the Romans. Moreover, the educated among the Romans realized this; it is for that reason that the wealthy Roman citizens hired Greeks to be tutors to both themselves &amp; their children.It is surely not by chance that it was Octavion who commissioned Virgil to write his epic poem. I am compelled to believe that it was Augustus himself whom Virgil was thinking of when he was writing these lines - and not merely because the trek to the underworld was to foretell the future (including the reign of Augustus). Rather, it is because of the immense respect that Octavion had for the Greeks - that, I think, was the impetus which inspired these lines.In this book, G.W. Bowersock does a superb job of expounding on this fact. We learn of how Caesar Augustus longed for a cultural fusion between the Greeks and the Romans, much like what Alexander of Macedon was searching for between the Macedonians and the Persians a few centuries earlier. Octavion wished to have the Romans learn the Greek language &amp; dress in Greek clothing and he desired to have the Greeks learn latin and dress in Roman attire. The goal was to have both cultures be interchangeable with each other while still preserving their own cultural heritage and identity. To have the best of both worlds shared amongst the two peoples was the objective. This is a noble purpose in any day &amp; time.Augustus responded to various Greek anti-Rome revolts with a temperance and restraint which is remarkable and in those times almost unheard of. He loved classical Greek plays and admonished his fellow Romans to disinter the didactic qualities the works of art held for the Roman people.G.W. Bowersock covers all of these motifs and more in this book. It is a must book for all classical historians and for those who admire the great Caesar Augustus so much as a hundreth as much as I."},{"Title":"Caesar and Cleopatra","review":"I can't resist any chance I can get to peek into the mind of a genius, and Shaw was a true genius. This story was delightful and brilliant.This was great. Instead of a love affair, we get a high-stakes game of chess with Cleopatra making calculated moves to secure the throne of Egypt, but her opponent, Caesar, excels at the game as well. Shrewd takes on Wise in this excellent battle of wits, giving us a refreshingly original story that portrays Cleopatra as a crafty politician seeking power rather than a romantic siren interested in an affair of the heart.This story was smart and funny. I loved it and wanted more when it was over. I'll have to buy another one of his books. I just love his style."},{"Title":"Caesar and Cleopatra","review":"This is a wonderful, and much more likely, interpretation of Cleopatra's romantic involvement with Caesar. Most writers are tempted to turn it into a great love affair, but Shaw reveals a clever and ambitious Cleopatra whose reasons for sinking her claws into Caesar are entirely political. As much as I'm a sucker for a good romance, I found this tale of sly and loveless manipulation to be much more intriguing.This story takes place when Caesar has occupied Egypt. Cleopatra wants to steal the throne out from under her brother and realizes that Caesar has the power to give it to her. The lengths she goes to in order to gain Caesar's favor or even stand in his presence are zany. She even goes so far as to roll herself up in a carpet that's to be delivered to him.Shaw is my favorite of the Victorian playwrights. His works were revolutionary in many ways. Use of humor was rare and exceptional for playwrights during that era, but Shaw was not afraid to make audiences laugh. He also tackled serious moral, political, and social issues in his plays at a time when sappy dramas were all the rage. He was truly bold and innovative and greatly contributed to dramatic art. He had an amazing gift, the ability to make people think while simultaneously making them laugh.Reading Shaw's works are a genuine treat. All of his plays are fabulous. His characters are memorable, and his humor is brilliant.This is a wonderful book, charming, significant, and insightful. I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Caesar and Cleopatra","review":"Caesar and Cleopatra by George Bernard Shaw. Published by MobileReference (mobi).This is a fine edition of the delightful Shaw play. Shaw's Caesar is a man of self-doubt and good humor, a vivid counterpoint to the haughty, aristocratic Caesar of Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Caesar and Cleopatra","review":"This is no love story. The wise and manipulative sixteen year old Cleopatra, one of two claimants to the throne of Egypt, tries to outmaneuver Caesar, the over fifty year old Roman general who had grasped control of her country, who is also wise, and who understands Cleopatra's subtlety, her desire to wrest political control over Egypt from her ten year old brother/husband Ptolemy.How could Shaw portray people who lived in a different culture close to two thousand years ago? Shaw tells us that despite the passing of so many centuries, people do not really change. Thus he can portray the people in his comedy and their reactions as if they were living today. Thus, also, in reverse, he is able to show the folly of the English people of his own age in his portrayal of the ancients. At the outset of the play, for example, the Egyptians speak of themselves as if they are the descendants of the gods. Is this any different than humanity today, who also act as if they are the greatest beings of creation and that they can do to the world as they see fit.Cleopatra is depicted as a kittenish, childish, immature, frightened, young girl who is also afraid of her servants and who wants to hide from the Romans. Caesar is shown as a seasoned warrior, afraid of nothing, yet with a sense of humor, a womanizer who is fascinated and charmed by the kittenish Cleopatra."},{"Title":"Caesar and Cleopatra","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will be a while before I do. The title caught my eye!"},{"Title":"Caesar and Cleopatra","review":"This edition does not include Shaw's original prologue opting instead to only present his alternate version. I found this oversight to be very disappointing as it doesn't allow for a complete understanding of how Shaw wanted the play to be presented."},{"Title":"Caesar and Cleopatra","review":"It was a wonderful pageturner. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the relationship between Julius Caesar and Cleopatra. This is an exciting book for someone who enjoys reading historical fiction."},{"Title":"Caesar and Cleopatra","review":"This work is an excellent and pragmatic look at Caesar's and Cleopatra's relationship, character, and motives. Caesar is portrayed as a wise and benevolent ruler who understands the value of clemency. Cleopatra, on the other hand, engages in a different form of politics. She is less forgiving and wise in the art of manipulation. Putting these two together brings their character traits to the forefront.Another thing we are able to take away from all of this is that people never change. Civilization and technical advances do not make people any better or smarter than their early ancestors. Regardless of how far we think we have come, we will always say and do and chase after the same things as those who came before us.George Bernard Shaw created numerous masterpieces over the span of his writing career. He has the distinction of being the only person to ever be awarded both an Oscar and the Nobel Prize for Literature. He was a very humble and conscientious man, a political activist and a vegetarian. His conscientiousness shows in his work by his inability to write meaningless fluff at a time when fluff dominated the stage. His trademark is his classic use of ample humor in dramas with serious subject matter. It takes a special kind of genius to be able to pull that off as flawlessly as he did."},{"Title":"Old English Sheepdogs 2005 Wall Calendar","review":"(If you DO have your own OES, as I do, you will enjoy this even more.)

It truly is a page turner to the end, and it is very apparent how much research and attention to detail went into it's pages.I was only 2 years old when my grandfather, Duncan, passed away but I can imagine that he would have recommended this book to everyone close to him.- Luke Smith"},{"Title":"The Upward Reach","review":"An excellent inspirational and motivational tool, recommended to anyone that wants to feel extraordinarily better when circunstances put us down."},{"Title":"Universal Dictionary of Violin and Bow Makers.","review":"This is a huge book dedicated to the history of violin and bow makers. It's a great book that no serious string instrumentalist or dealer should be without. The amount of history contained in the book is incredible. My only complaint is that the price listings are too old so they are incaccurate. Other than that, this is an incredible book."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],L={key:0},N={key:1};function W(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",N,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",L,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const P=d(M,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-6da0fbac"]]),B=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/16.md","filePath":"people/16.md"}'),E={name:"people/16.md"},j=Object.assign(E,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{B as __pageData,j as default};
